      "As Iran faces increasing tensions with the West and turmoil at home, a new exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is displaying Western artwork including pieces not seen by the public in at least a decade",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- As Iran faces increasing tensions with the West and turmoil at home, a new exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is displaying Western artwork including pieces not seen by the public in at least a decade.",
      "The unveiling of the exhibition \u201cEye to Eye\u201d has drawn numerous women, their hair uncovered, to the underground galleries of the museum in Tehran's Laleh Park. Their presence, while unacknowledged by authorities, shows the way life has changed inside Iran just in the last few years even as the country's theocracy presses forward with enriching uranium to near-weapons grade levels and launching attacks on Israel during the ongoing Mideast wars.",
      "\u201cThe first feeling that came to me, and I told my parents, was that I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m seeing these works, which have always been kept far from our eyes,\u201d said Aida Zarrin, a young woman at the museum.",
      "\u201cIf such events are held here and we can see artworks like the rest of the world, it\u2019s enough. They are really precious.\u201d",
      "The government of Iran\u2019s Western-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, the former Empress Farah Pahlavi, built the museum and acquired the vast collection in the late 1970s, when oil boomed and Western economies stagnated. Upon opening, it showed sensational works by Pablo Picasso, Mark Rothko, Claude Monet, Jackson Pollock and other heavyweights, enhancing Iran\u2019s cultural standing on the world stage.",
      "But just two years later, in 1979, Shiite clerics ousted the shah and packed away the art in the museum\u2019s vault. Some paintings \u2014 cubist, surrealist, impressionist and even pop art \u2014 sat untouched for decades to avoid offending Islamic values and the appearance of catering to Western sensibilities. Nearly everything is believed still to be there, though an Andy Warhol print of the empress was slashed during the revolution.",
      "Today, the collection is likely worth billions of dollars. Even with Iran now cash-strapped under Western sanctions, officials with the museum have been able to advocate for keeping the collection, though there have been occasional trades in the past for items from Persian history. Those sanctions may increase under the next administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "As Iranian politics have thawed, re-frozen and thawed again, the collection resurfaces along with those changes.",
      "Among the over 120 works being shown are ones from Picasso, Andy Warhol and Francis Bacon, along with celebrated Iranian artists. One of the Warhols, \u201cJacqueline Kennedy II,\u201d is a silkscreen double image of the former U.S. first lady in mourning after the 1963 assassination of her husband, President John Kennedy. Another Warhol portrait of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger also garnered attention from the cellphone photo snappers.",
      "\u201cA lot of these works are important works in the history of art, and that\u2019s why this show distinguishes itself from others,\u201d said Jamal Arabzadeh, the exhibition's curator. \u201dA lot of people with less exposure to art have discovered the museum for the first time. ... We are seeing a part of the community that are discovering art and the museum and see the potential of this place, and this is something to be proud of.\u201d",
      "The presence of Western art comes as Iran's government has long fought against items like Barbie dolls and depictions of cartoon characters from \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d Such Western influences have been deemed un-Islamic in the past and have been seen as part of a \u201csoft\u201d cultural war against the Islamic Republic.",
      "With a ticket costing the equivalent of 14 U.S. cents, the exhibition offers a rare government-sanctioned event not involving the country's politics or Shiite religion.",
      "Among the visitors were many women defying the country's mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law. Crackdowns over the hijab have slowed down after Iran's presidential election in July that elected reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, though individual cases of arrest continue to draw anger.",
      "And for many, the cost of tickets to travel abroad given Iran's collapsing rial currency keep foreign museums out of reach.",
      "\u201cThis is very attractive for art enthusiasts because not everyone can go and see museums abroad. It\u2019s extremely exciting to see the works here,\u201d said a woman who only gave her last name, Dolatshahi. \u201cI had no idea I could see works by van Gogh and Picasso here.\u201d",

      "The Philadelphia-based band Snacktime will provide the show's music.",
      "The show's title is a homage to \u201cThey Call it Pro Football,\u201d which was NFL Films\u2019 first full-length film in 1967. NFL Films originated in Philadelphia and founders Ed and Steve Sabol are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

      "Kelce is in the first year of a multi-year agreement with ESPN. He appears on the network's \u201cMonday Night Countdown\u201d show as well as providing halftime and postgame analysis. He played 13 years for the Philadelphia Eagles before retiring at the end of last season and was the most sought-after former player by networks. He participated in last year\u2019s NFL Broadcasting and Media Workshop, which used to be known as the \u201cBroadcast Bootcamp.\u201d",
      "Kelce has made news lately, though, for other reasons.",
      "He was involved in a confrontation with a fan in State College, Pennsylvania, before the Penn State-Ohio State game on Nov. 2, when a fan heckled Kelce and appeared to shout an anti-gay slur about his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, for dating pop star Taylor Swift. Video showed Kelce grabbing the fan\u2019s phone and throwing it to the ground.",
      "Kelce apologized about the incident on ESPN on Nov. 4.",
      "On Thursday night an autograph seeker verbally confronted Kelce outside the El Capitan Entertainment Center in Hollywood, where \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d is taped.",
      "Video obtained by TMZ shows Kelce explaining that he doesn\u2019t sign autographs for people that follow where he is going. After being shouted at for over two minutes, Kelce eventually got out of the car and signed autographs, including shaking the hand of a man who was berating Kelce with obscenities.",

But if we need to bring that energy up, then we can. For us, it was about instilling confidence going into the next week.\u201d",
      "Biles might be famous for her athletic prowess, but she was able to relate to the music contestants \u2014 from one competitor to another.",
      "\u201cThese are the learning steps: Learn, process, go back in and work,\u201d she said. \u201cThey all have the vocal talent. It\u2019s about harnessing that, knowing when to bring it out and which songs to sing and which genre you fit in. And what you want your legacy to be. This is truly a special show as well as the judging. They don\u2019t get to see the physical appearance first. It\u2019s all off of ears, listening and putting their craft together as well.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "When the photographer Ernest Cole died in 1990 at the age of 49 from pancreatic cancer at a Manhattan hospital, his death was little noted",
      "NEW YORK -- When the photographer Ernest Cole died in 1990 at the age of 49 from pancreatic cancer at a Manhattan hospital, his death was little noted.",
      "Cole, one of the most important chroniclers of apartheid-era South Africa, was by then mostly forgotten and penniless. Banned by his native country after the publication of his pioneering photography book \u201cHouse of Bondage,\u201d Cole had emigrated in 1966 to the United States. But his life in exile gradually disintegrated into intermittent homelessness. A six-paragraph obituary in The New York Times ran alongside a list of death notices.",
      "But Cole receives a vibrant and stirring resurrection in Raoul Peck\u2019s new film \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found,\u201d narrated in Cole\u2019s own words and voiced by LaKeith Stanfield. The film, which opens in theaters Friday, is laced throughout with Cole\u2019s photographs, many of them not before seen publicly.",
      "As he did in his Oscar-nominated James Baldwin documentary \u201cI Am Not Your Negro,\u201d the Haitian-born Peck shares screenwriting credit with his subject. \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found\u201d is drawn from Cole\u2019s own writings. In words and images, Peck brings the tragic story of Cole to vivid life, reopening the lens through which Cole so perceptively saw injustice and humanity.",
      "\u201cFilm is a political tool for me,\u201d Peck said in a recent interview over lunch in Manhattan. \u201cMy job is to go to the widest audience possible and try to give them something to help them understand where they are, what they are doing, what role they are playing. It\u2019s about my fight today. I don\u2019t care about the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found\u201d is a movie layered with meaning that goes beyond Cole\u2019s work. It asks questions not just about the societies Cole documented but of how he was treated as an artist, drawing uncomfortable parallels between apartheid and post-Jim Crow America. In the U.S., Cole was given a Ford Foundation grant to capture Black life in rural and urban areas, but he struggled to find a foothold professionally. Some editors said his images lacked \u201cedge.\u201d",
      "In 2017, more than 60,000 of Cole\u2019s 35mm film negatives were discovered in a bank vault in Stockholm, Sweden. Much of that material, including thousands of photographs Cole took in the U.S., was believed lost. Answers for how they had gotten there, and why they hadn't been known about earlier were hard to come by. \u201cLost and Found\u201d portrays the struggle of Cole's estate to acquire the collection. Only on the eve of the film's Cannes Film Festival premiere in May did the bank finally announce the handover of most materials to the estate.",
      "What those photographs reveal is an artist who made much more than indelible images of apartheid life. Cole\u2019s early photographs, published in 1967, offered one of the most illustrative and damning portraits of apartheid to Western eyes, including a widely reproduced photograph of a middle-aged woman sitting on a park bench that read \u201cEuropean\u2019s only.\u201d But he was an equally astute and sensitive observer of the segregations, and multicultural joys, of American life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of survival,\u201d Stanfield narrates as Cole. \u201cSteal every moment.\u201d",
      "For Peck, the themes of \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found\u201d are deeply personal. The 71-year-old filmmaker, a former minister of culture in Haiti, has spent much of his artistic life also away from his native country, in Berlin, Paris and New York. He dedicates the movie \u201cto those who died in exile.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I say that, that\u2019s most of my friends,\u201d he says. \u201cI recognize all the steps. When you take a contact sheet, I see myself.\u201d",
      "For some four decades, Peck has made some of the most urgent films, in both fiction (including 2000\u2019s \u201cLumumba,\u201d about the exiled Congo leader) and non-fiction (including last year\u2019s \u201cSilver Dollar Road\u201d ). But he has rarely not employed both narrative and documentary elements in films that take their own shape \u2014 movies less interested in genre distinctions than they are pursuing unexamined truths.",
      "That\u2019s made Peck an increasingly exceptional figure in a documentary world that\u2019s become more and more dominated by glossier, less probing films for streaming platforms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse. There\u2019s less money so young people are desperate and accept stuff that my generation would never accept,\u201d Peck says. \u201cThe whole industry has changed. I knew another world, and I recognize it\u2019s not that anymore.\u201d",
      "Peck is currently editing a documentary on George Orwell. Like \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found,\u201d it will be told totally in Orwell\u2019s words. A few days after the U.S. election, Peck was working to update a moment in the film that touches on President-elect Donald Trump. Peck has been astonished at how prescient Orwell was on so many current issues \u2014 misinformation, AI, social media, the refugee crisis.",
      "\u201cHe was a really incredible critic of history and how history is even told,\u201d says Peck. \u201cBefore plunging into it, I did not realize how sharp he was about what\u2019s going on today.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me,\u201d he adds, \u201ca film has value if it\u2019s talking to us today.\u201d"

      "And ever since, moviegoers, marketers and meme makers have been trying to recreate that moment, searching the movie release schedule for odd mashups and sending candidates off into the social media void. Most attempts have fizzled (sorry, \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d ).",
      "This weekend is perhaps the closest approximation yet as the Broadway musical adaptation \u201cWicked\u201d opens Friday against the chest-thumping sword-and-sandals epic \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Two big studio releases (Universal and Paramount), with one-name titles, opposite tones and aesthetics and big blockbuster energy \u2014 it was already halfway there before the name game began: \u201cWickiator,\u201d \u201cWadiator,\u201d \u201cGladwick\u201d and even the eyebrow raising \u201cGladicked\u201d have all been suggested.",
      "\u201c'Glicked' rolls off the tongue a little bit more,\u201d actor Fred Hechinger said at the New York screening of \u201cGladiator II\u201d this week. \u201cI think we should all band around \u2018Glicked.\u2019 It gets too confusing if you have four or five different names for it.\u201d",
      "As with \u201cBarbenheimer,\" as reductive as it might seem, \u201cGlicked\u201d also has the male/female divide that make the fan art extra silly. One is pink and bright and awash in sparkles, tulle, Broadway bangers and brand tie-ins; The other is all sweat and sand, blood and bulging muscles.",
      "Both films topped Fandango\u2019s most anticipated holiday movie survey, where 65% of respondents said that they were interested in the \u201cGlicked\u201d double feature. Theaters big and small are also pulling out the stops with movie-themed tie-ins. B&B Theaters will have Roman guards tearing tickets at some locations and Maximus popcorn tubs. Marcus Theaters is doing Oz photo ops and friendship bracelet-making. Alamo Drafthouse is leaning into the singalong aspect (beware, though, not all theaters are embracing this) and the punny drinks like \u201cDefying Gravi-Tea.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than it being in competition, I think they\u2019re in conversation,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal said. \u201cThis industry needs a shot in the arm. Those films gave it last year. We hope to do it this year.\u201d",
      "And the hope is that audiences will flock to theaters to be part of this moment as well. It's a sorely needed influx of could-be blockbusters into a marketplace that's still at an 11% deficit from last year and down 27.2% from 2019, according to data from Comscore.",
      "\u201cCompetition is good for the marketplace. It\u2019s good for consumers,\u201d said Michael O'Leary, the president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \u201cHaving two great movies coming out at the same time is simply a multiplier effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cGlicked\u201d is currently tracking for a combined North American debut in the $165 million range, with \u201cWicked\u201d forecast to earn around $100 million (up from the $80 million estimates a few weeks ago) and \u201cGladiator II\u201d pegged for the $65 million range.",
      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d shattered its projections last July. Going into that weekend, \u201cBarbie\u201d had been pegged for $90 million and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d around $40 million. Ultimately, they brought in a combined $244 million in that first outing, and nearly $2.4 billion by the end of their runs.",
      "It\u2019s possible \u201cGlicked\u201d will exceed expectations, too. And it has the advantage of another behemoth coming close behind: \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which opens just five days later on the Wednesday before the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cGlickedana\u201d triple feature anyone?",
      "\u201cThese are 10 important days,\u201d O'Leary said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to show the moviegoing audience that there\u2019s a lot of compelling stuff out there for them to see.\u201d",
      "There are infinite caveats to the imperfect comparison to \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d as well. \u201cWicked\u201d is a \u201cPart One.\u201d Musicals carry their own baggage with moviegoers, even those based on wildly successful productions (ahem, \u201cCats\u201d). \u201cGladiator II\u201d got a head start and opened internationally last weekend. In fact, in the U.K. it played alongside \u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d where that double was pegged \u201cGladdington.\u201d \u201cGladiator\u201d reviews, while positive, are a little more divided than the others. And neither directors Ridley Scott nor Jon M. Chu has the built-in box office cache that Christopher Nolan\u2019s name alone carries at the moment.",
      "The new films also cost more than \u201cBarbie\u201d ($145 million) and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d ($100 million). According to reports, \u201cGladiator II\u201d had a $250 million price tag; \u201cWicked\u201d reportedly cost $150 million to produce (and that does not include the cost of the second film, due next year).",
      "The narrative, though, has shifted away from \u201cwho will win the weekend.\u201d Earlier this year, Chu told The Associated Press that he loves that this is a moment where \u201cwe can root for all movies all the time.\u201d",
      "Close behind are a bevy of Christmas releases with double feature potential, but those feel a little more niche. There\u2019s the remake of \u201cNosferatu,\u201d the Nicole Kidman kink pic \u201cBabygirl\u201d and the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The internet can\u2019t even seem to decide on its angle for that batch of contenders, and none exactly screams blockbuster. Sometimes the joy is just in the game, however. Some are sticking with the one-name mashup (\u201cBabyratu\u201d); others are suggesting that the fact that two of the movies feature real-life exes (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp) is enough reason for a double feature. And getting people talking is half the battle.",
      "When in doubt, or lacking a catchy name, there\u2019s always the default: \u201cThis is my Barbenheimer.\u201d",

      "The Illinois Supreme Court has overturned actor Jussie Smollett\u2019s conviction on charges that he staged a racist and homophobic attack against himself in 2019 and lied to Chicago police",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Illinois Supreme Court on Thursday overturned actor Jussie Smollett\u2019s conviction on charges of staging a racist and homophobic attack against himself in 2019 and lying to Chicago police, saying he should not have been charged a second time after reaching a deal with prosecutors.",
      "The ruling, which did not address Smollett's continued claims of innocence, was the latest twist in a yearslong saga. Smollett, who is Black and gay, made headlines around the world after he told police in January 2019 that two men assaulted him in his downtown Chicago neighborhood, spouting slurs, tossing a noose around his neck, and yelling that he was in \u201cMAGA country,\u201d an apparent reference to Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d presidential campaign slogan. The report prompted a massive search for suspects by Chicago police before investigators announced that they believed the attack was a hoax.",
      "The state's highest court found that a special prosecutor should not have been allowed to intervene after Smollett reached a deal with the Cook County state\u2019s attorney in which charges against him were dropped in exchange for him forfeiting his $10,000 bond and performing community service. The deal prompted outrage in part because it did not include any condition that Smollett apologize or admit he staged the attack.",
      "\u201cWe are aware that this case has generated significant public interest and that many people were dissatisfied with the resolution of the original case and believed it to be unjust,\u201d Justice Elizabeth Rochford wrote in the court\u2019s 5-0 opinion. \u201cNevertheless, what would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the state was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied.\u201d",
      "Smollett was on the television drama \u201cEmpire,\u201d which filmed in Chicago, and prosecutors alleged he staged the attack because he was unhappy with the studio\u2019s response to hate mail he received. Testimony at trial indicated he paid $3,500 to two men whom he knew from \u201cEmpire\u201d to carry it out. Smollett testified that \u201cthere was no hoax\u201d and that he was the victim of a hate crime.",
      "Smollett declined to comment Thursday through a publicist. His attorney, Nenye Uche, said Smollett was happy and relieved but also disappointed to have been \u201cdragged through an unfair process.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though this is over now and Jussie just absolutely wants to move his life forward, people should start asking questions. How did this happen? Why should this even happen? What can we do to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again?\u201d Uche said at a news conference in Chicago.",
      "The special prosecutor, former U.S. Attorney Dan Webb, said he disagreed with the court\u2019s ruling while noting that it \u201chas nothing to do with Mr. Smollett\u2019s innocence.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Illinois Supreme Court did not find any error with the overwhelming evidence presented at trial that Mr. Smollett orchestrated a fake hate crime and reported it to the Chicago Police Department as a real hate crime, or the jury\u2019s unanimous verdict that Mr. Smollett was guilty of five counts of felony disorderly conduct,\u201d Webb said.",
      "After Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx's office dropped the initial 16 counts of disorderly conduct, the backlash was swift, with then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel calling it \u201ca whitewash of justice.\u201d Webb was appointed special prosecutor and a grand jury restored charges, leading to Smollett's 2021 conviction on five counts of disorderly conduct.",
      "Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in jail \u2014 six of which he served before he was freed pending appeal \u2014 and was ordered to pay about $130,000 in restitution. Chicago officials are pursuing reimbursement for that amount in police overtime through a civil case.",
      "Foxx told The Associated Press that she was not surprised that the high court found her handling of the case \u201cproper \u2014 if unpopular, proper.\u201d She criticized Webb's ensuing \u201clegal machinations,\u201d which she said ignored the tenet of prosecutorial discretion and landed the issue in the \u201csame position we were in in March 2019.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat they were doing in going to the court to re-prosecute someone because you didn\u2019t like the outcome would have set a horrendous precedent, in which anyone could come in and undermine the work of a prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d said Foxx, who did not seek a third term this year.",
      "Eileen O\u2019Neill Burke, the incoming Cook County state's attorney, declined to comment.",
      "Smollett, a child actor who appeared in 1992 movie \u201cThe Mighty Ducks,\u201d has credited his role as a singer on the hip-hop drama \u201cEmpire\u201d for turbocharging his career. This year, he starred in the movie \u201cThe Lost Holliday\u201d with Vivica A. Fox.",

      "Two television networks with \u201cNBC\u201d in their names \u2014 MSNBC and CNBC \u2014 will no longer have any corporate connection to NBC News once a spinoff formally takes effect in about a year",
      "Comcast's corporate reorganization means that there will soon be two television networks with \u201cNBC\u201d in their name \u2014 CNBC and MSNBC \u2014 that will no longer have any corporate connection to NBC News.",
      "How that affects viewers of those networks, along with the people who work there, still needs to shake out. Their new corporate leader, Mark Lazarus, visited the set of MSNBC's \u201cMorning Joe\u201d as the plan was being announced on Wednesday and spoke to network staff members during a morning conference call to address concerns.",
      "Comcast is spinning off most of its cable networks, also including USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and the Golf Channel, into a separate company. That recognizes how streaming is considered the future and the cable networks are a drag on the bottom line.",
      "In the space of a lifetime, the networks went from upstarts aside a legacy operation like NBC to profitable superstars to castoffs.",
      "Lazarus, chairman of the NBC Universal Media Group, is becoming CEO of the newly-formed company of cable networks, temporarily dubbed \u201cSpinCo.\u201d Cesar Conde, who as NBC Universal News Group chairman had oversight of CNBC and MSNBC, will lose those networks from his portfolio, yet remain in charge of NBC News, NBC News Now streaming, Telemundo and the news operations of the NBC-owned local stations.",
      "The presence of Lazarus and Anand Kini, who will be chief operating officer and chief financial officer of SpinCo, is a good sign for the new company, said Jessica Reif Ehrlich, research analyst for the Bank of America. \u201cYou can't dismiss it as getting rid of the crappy assets, because these are talented executives,\u201d she said.",
      "At MSNBC, questions about the future range from the simple \u2014 will it even keep its name? \u2014 to the complex.",
      "MSNBC's staff and studios are based in the same Rockefeller Center offices as NBC News, and it was unclear on Wednesday whether they will remain or move elsewhere, Lazarus told MSNBC employees.",
      "MSNBC's relationship with NBC News has caused some awkwardness, particularly as the network has become known for its stable of liberal commentators while still attached to a news division that stresses impartiality. For much of MSNBC's broadcast day, NBC News journalists like Katy Tur, Jose Diaz-Balart, Chris Jansing and a host of reporters appear on the network.",
      "It's unclear whether arrangements could be made for that cross-pollination to continue \u2014 where will Steve Kornacki land, for example? \u2014 or if MSNBC will bear the expense of building out its own newsgathering operation or lean more heavily into commentary.",
      "It's a nervous time at MSNBC for other reasons. The network has seen a dramatic drop in viewership since Donald Trump's election victory, although it is common that news networks that appeal primarily to one side of a political divide lose viewers when their candidates are defeated. History shows most viewers return, and MSNBC executives anticipate that.",
      "Less clear is whether a second Trump administration will make life difficult. Trump ally Steve Bannon, on his radio show last week, sent out a specific warning to the network's anchors and producers. \u201cYou better be worried,\u201d he said. \u201cYou better lawyer up.\u201d",
      "CNBC launched in 1989, while MSNBC started in 1996. They have seemed inextricably bound with the broadcast network since, and the sharing of legal, promotional, technical and other support is something else that needs to be worked out.",
      "With its financial concentration, CNBC has been more independent of NBC News than its cable brethren. With offices in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., its operation is even physically separate. However, NBC News often taps CNBC reporters for their business expertise on broadcast and its streaming service.",
      "\u201cI completely empathize with people who think this would be a bittersweet thing,\u201d Lazarus said, according to MSNBC. \u201cI think it's exciting because very few times in life you get to have the opportunity to be part of what I'll call a \u2018well-funded startup.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite the old-school nature of a company of cable properties, Comcast executives are bullish on its prospects, noting that many of them produce profits individually. And there's the potential for buying other networks undervalued by big media companies.",
      "Andrew Ross Sorkin, host of CNBC's \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d said on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Wednesday that the two cable news networks produce \u201dextraordinary profits\" for Comcast that are not being reinvested in cable properties.",
      "\"If you could take that money that's coming off of these channels and invest in the businesses as an independent entity, what will that ultimately look like\"?\" Sorkin asked. \u201cCould you use that money to go make other acquisitions? Could you make investments in the business itself? That's the big question.\u201d",
      "One piece of advice from Bank of America's Ehrlich: Keep the names. \u201cThose are pretty big brand names,\u201d she said. \u201cI would not advise them to change.\u201d",

      "A previously unknown musical work written by composer Frederic Chopin appears to have been found in a library in New York City",
      "NEW YORK -- The brooding waltz was carefully composed on a sheet of music roughly the size of an index card. The brief, moody number also bore an intriguing name, written at the top in cursive: \u201cChopin.\u201d",
      "A previously unknown work of music penned by the European master Frederic Chopin appears to have been found at the Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan.",
      "The untitled and unsigned piece is on display this month at the opulently appointed institution, which had once been the private library of financier J. P. Morgan.",
      "Robinson McClellan, the museum curator who uncovered the manuscript, said it's the first new work associated with the Romantic era composer to be discovered in nearly a century.",
      "But McClellan concedes that it may never be known whether it is an original Chopin work or merely one written in his hand.",
      "The piece, set in the key of A minor, stands out for its \u201cvery stormy, brooding opening section\u201d before transitioning to a melancholy melody more characteristic of Chopin, McClellan explained.",
      "\u201cThis is his style. This is his essence,\u201d he said during a recent visit to the museum. \u201cIt really feels like him.\u201d",
      "McClellan said he came across the work in May as he was going through a collection from the late Arthur Satz, a former president of the New York School of Interior Design. Satz had acquired it from A. Sherrill Whiton Jr., an avid autograph collector who had been director of the school.",
      "McClellan then worked with experts to verify its authenticity.",
      "The paper was found to be consistent with what Chopin favored for manuscripts, and the ink matched a kind typical in the early 19th century when Chopin lived, according to the museum. But a handwriting analysis determined the name \u201cChopin\u201d written at the top of the sheet was penned by someone else.",
      "Born in Poland, Chopin was considered a musical genius from an early age. He lived in Warsaw and Vienna before settling in Paris, where he died in 1849 at the age of 39, likely of tuberculosis.",
      "He\u2019s buried among a pantheon of artists at the city\u2019s famed P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, but his heart, pickled in a jar of alcohol, is housed in a church in Warsaw, in keeping with his deathbed wish for the organ to return to his homeland.",
      "Artur Szklener, director of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute in Warsaw, the Polish capital city where the composer grew up, agreed that the document is consistent with the kinds of ink and paper Chopin used during his early years in Paris.",
      "Musically, the piece evokes the \u201cbrilliant style\u201d that made Chopin a luminary in his time, but it also has features unusual for his compositions, Szklener said.",
      "\u201cFirst of all, it is not a complete work, but rather a certain musical gesture, a theme laced with rather simple piano tricks alluding to a virtuoso style,\" Szklener explained in a lengthy statement released after the document was revealed last month.",
      "He and other experts conjecture the piece could have been a work in progress. It may have also been a copy of another's work, or even co-written with someone else, perhaps a student for a musical exercise.",
      "Jeffrey Kallberg, a University of Pennsylvania music professor and Chopin expert who helped authenticate the document, called the piece a \u201clittle gem\u201d that Chopin likely intended as a gift for a friend or wealthy acquaintance.",
      "\u201cMany of the pieces that he gave as gifts were short \u2013 kind of like \u2018appetizers\u2019 to a full-blown work,\u201d Kallberg said in an email. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know for sure whether he intended the piece to see the light of day because he often wrote out the same waltz more than once as a gift.\u201d",
      "David Ludwig, dean of music at The Juilliard School, a performing arts conservatory in Manhattan, agreed the piece has many of the hallmarks of the composer\u2019s style.",
      "\u201cIt has the Chopin character of something very lyrical and it has a little bit of darkness as well,\u201d said Ludwig, who was not involved in authenticating the document.",
      "But Ludwig noted that, if it's authentic, the tightly composed score would be one of Chopin\u2019s shortest known pieces. The waltz clocks in at under a minute long when played on piano, as many of Chopin\u2019s works were intended.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the authenticity of it, in a way it doesn\u2019t matter because it sparks our imaginations,\u201d Ludwig said. \u201cA discovery like this highlights the fact that classical music is very much a living art form.\u201d",
      "The Chopin reveal comes after the Leipzig Municipal Libraries in Germany announced in September that it had uncovered a previously unknown piece likely composed by a young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in its collections.",

      "Percival Everett\u2019s \u201cJames\u201d has won the National Book Award for fiction",
      "NEW YORK -- Percival Everett's \u201cJames,\u201d a daring reworking of \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\u201d has won the National Book Award for fiction. Jason De Le\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cSoldiers and Kings: Survival and Hope in the World of Human Smuggling\u201d won for nonfiction, where finalists included Salman Rushdie's memoir about his brutal stabbing in 2022, \u201cKnife.\u201d",
      "The prize for young people's literature was given Wednesday night to Shifa Saltagi Safadi\u2019s coming of age story \u201cKareem Between,\u201d and the poetry award went to Lena Khalaf Tuffaha\u2019s \u201cSomething About Living.\u201d In the translation category, the winner was Y\u00e1ng Shu\u0101ng-z\u01d0\u2019s \u201cTaiwan Travelogue,\u201d translated from the Mandarin Chinese by Lin King.",
      "Judging panels, made up of writers, critics, booksellers and others in the literary community, made their selections from hundreds of submissions, with publishers nominating more than 1,900 books in all. Each of the winners in the five competitive categories received $10,000.",
      "Everett\u2019s win continues his remarkable rise in the past few years. Little known to general readers for decades, the 67-year-old has been a Booker Prize and Pulitzer Prize finalist for such novels as \u201cTrees\u201d and \u201cDr. No\u201d and has seen the novel \u201cErasure\u201d adapted into the Oscar-nominated \u201cAmerican Fiction.\u201d",
      "In taking on Mark Twain\u2019s classic about the wayward Southern boy Huck and the enslaved Jim, Everett tells the story from the latter's perspective and emphasizes how differently Jim behaves and even speaks when whites are not around. The novel was a Booker finalist and last month won the Kirkus Prize for fiction.",
      "\u201cJames\u201d has been nicely received,\u201d Everett noted during his acceptance speech.",
      "\u201cDemon Copperhead\u201d novelist Barbara Kingsolver and Black Classic Press publisher W. Paul Coates received lifetime achievement medals from the National Book Foundation, which presents the awards.",
      "Speakers praised diversity, disruption and autonomy, whether Taiwanese independence or the rights of immigrants in the U.S. Two winners, Safadi and Tuffaha, condemned the year-old Gaza war and U.S. military support for Israel. Neither mentioned Israel by name, but both called the conflict \u201cgenocide\u201d and were met with cheers \u2014 and more subdued responses \u2014 after calling for support of the Palestinians.",
      "Tuffaha, who is Palestinian American, dedicated her award in part to \u201cto all the deeply beautiful Palestinians that this world has lost and all those miraculous ones who endured, waiting for us, waiting for us to wake up.\u201d",
      "Last year publisher Zibby Owens withdrew support for the awards after hearing that finalists were planning to condemn the Gaza war. This year the World Jewish Congress was among those criticizing Coates\u2019 award, citing in part his reissue of the essay \u201cThe Jewish Onslaught,\u201d which has been called anti-Semitic.",
      "National Book Foundation Executive Director Ruth Dickey said in a recent statement that Coates was being honored for a body of work rather than any individual book, and added that while the foundation condemns anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry, it also believes in free expression.",
      "\u201cAnyone examining the work of any publisher, over the course of almost five decades, will find individual works or opinions with which they disagree or find offensive,\u201d she added.",
      "The National Book Awards have long taken place in mid-November, shortly after the elections, and they're an early snapshot of the book world's reaction: Hopeful after Barack Obama's victory in 2008, when publisher and honorary winner Barney Rosset anticipated \u201ca new and uplifting agenda\u201d; grim but determined in 2016, after Donald Trump's first victory, with fiction winner Colson Whitehead urging the audience to \u201cbe kind to everybody, make art, and fight the power.\u201d",
      "This year, as hundreds gathered for the dinner ceremony at Cipriani Wall Street in downtown Manhattan for the awards' 75th anniversary, the mood was one of sobriety, resolve and willed good cheer.",
      "Host Kate McKinnon joked that she was recruited because the National Book Foundation wanted \u201csomething fun and light and to distract from the fact that the world is a bonfire.\u201d Musical guest Jon Batiste led the audience in a round of \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In\u201d and sang a few lines from \u201cHallelujah,\u201d the Leonard Cohen standard which McKinnon somberly performed at the start of the first \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d after the 2016 election.",
      "Kingsolver acknowledged feeling \u201csmacked down, at the moment,\u201d but added that she has known despair before. She likened truth and love to forces of nature, like gravity and the sun, always there whether you see them or not. The writer's job is to imagine \u201ca better ending than the one we've been given,\" she said.",
      "At a Tuesday night reading by awards finalists, some spoke of community and support. Everett began his turn by confiding that he really \u201cneeded this kind of inspiration after the last couple of weeks. We kind of need each other right now.\u201d After warning that \u201chope is not a strategy,\u201d he paused and said, \u201cNever had a situation felt so absurd, surreal and ridiculous.\u201d",
      "It took a moment to realize he wasn't discussing current events, but rather reading from \u201cJames.\u201d"

      "Casting for her characters is planned.",
      "Milhouse first appeared in a Butterfinger commercial in 1989 and was named for the former U.S. president Richard Milhous Nixon. Groening said he adopted it \"because that was the most unfortunate name a kid could have.\u201d",
      "The nearsighted character was often the butt of most jokes and bullied mercilessly by Nelson. In one episode, Bart got Milhouse placed on the America\u2019s Most Wanted list, but in another he traded Bart's soul to the guy at the comic book store."

      "A piece of conceptual art consisting of a banana duct-taped to a wall has sold for $6.2 million at an auction in New York",
      "NEW YORK -- A piece of conceptual art consisting of a simple banana, duct-taped to a wall, sold for $6.2 million at an auction in New York on Wednesday, with the winning bid coming from a prominent cryptocurrency entrepreneur.",
      "\u201cComedian,\u201d by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was a phenomenon when it debuted in 2019 at Art Basel Miami Beach, as festivalgoers tried to make out whether the single yellow piece of fruit affixed to a white wall with silver duct tape was a joke or cheeky commentary on questionable standards among art collectors. At one point, another artist took the banana off the wall and ate it.",
      "The piece attracted so much attention that it had to be withdrawn from view. But three editions sold for between $120,000 and $150,000, according to the gallery handling sales at the time.",
      "Five years later, Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency platform TRON, has now paid more than 40 times that higher price point at the Sotheby\u2019s auction. Or, more accurately, Sun purchased a certificate of authenticity that gives him the authority to duct-tape a banana to a wall and call it \u201cComedian.\u201d",
      "The piece attracted heavy attention at the busy auction at Sotheby's, with attendees in the crowded room holding up phones to take photos as two handlers wearing white gloves stood at both sides of the banana.",
      "Bidding started at $800,000 and within minutes shot up to $2 million, then $3 million, then $4 million, and higher, as the auctioneer, Oliver Barker, joked \u201cDon't let it slip away.\u201d",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t miss this opportunity,\" Barker said. \u201cThese are words I've never thought I'd say: Five million dollars for a banana.\u201d",
      "The final hammer price announced in the room was $5.2 million, which didn't include the about $1 million in auction house fees, paid by the buyer.",
      "In a statement, Sun said the piece \u201crepresents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community.\u201d But he said the latest version of \u201cComedian\" won't last long.",
      "\u201cAdditionally, in the coming days, I will personally eat the banana as part of this unique artistic experience, honoring its place in both art history and popular culture,\u201d Sun said.",
      "Sotheby\u2019s calls Cattelan \u201camong Contemporary Art\u2019s most brilliant provocateurs.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe has persistently disrupted the art world\u2019s status quo in meaningful, irreverent, and often controversial ways,\u201d the auction house said in a description of \u201cComedian.\u201d",
      "The sale came a day after a painting by the Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte sold for $121.2 million, a record for the artist, at a separate auction.",
      "\u201cThe Empire of Light,\u201d an eerie nighttime streetscape below a pale blue daytime sky, sold Tuesday as part of Christie\u2019s sale of the collection of interior designer Mica Ertegun, who died last year at age 97.",
      "The sale lifts Magritte into the ranks of artists whose works have gone for more than $100 million at auction. Magritte is the 16th member of the club, which also includes Leonardo da Vinci, Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol, according to the market analyst firm Artprice.",
      "\u201cThe Empire of Light,\u201d executed in 1954, was one of 17 versions of the same scene that Magritte painted in oil. Marc Porter, chairman of Christie\u2019s Americas, called the sale \u201ca historic moment in our saleroom.\u201d",
      "The $121.2 million price included the auction house\u2019s fees. The buyer was a telephone bidder whose identity was not disclosed."

      "This charming and winning movie charts the decade-long true story of how the world\u2019s first IVF baby was born in England in 1978 \u2014 a 5-pound, 12-ounce girl who paved the way for millions more. It's an upbeat, very English affair, mixing sober discussion of endometriosis with chocolate biscuits.",
      "The couple embracing that day were pioneering scientist Robert Edwards and Jean Purdy, a young nurse and embryologist. Together with surgeon Patrick Steptoe, the trio succeeded with in vitro fertilization, a method of treating infertility. Edwards would go on to win the Nobel Prize.",
      "\u201cJoy\u201d has been birthed at a time when science is under threat in America \u2014 even IVF \u2014 so it's downright inspiring to see plucky, smart scientists working hard to change the world. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing, it matters,\u201d says Steptoe, played with quiet economy by Bill Nighy.",
      "\u201cJoy\u201d is the personal stories of the three scientists \u2014 mostly through the eyes of Purdy, a polite lab-coated warrior. \u201cIf I hear a commotion, I\u2019m not very good at staying out of it,\u201d she says. Perfectly played by Thomasin McKenzie, Purdy is both vulnerable and strong, learning through the process to be a better human. James Norton plays Edwards with charm, self-doubt and calm spirit.",
      "Jack Thorne's script nicely explains the massive pressure the trio faced. IVF may have become common and uncontroversial over the last decades, but back in the late '70s it was experimental and shunned. The Anglican church called it a sin, the newspapers labeled it Frankenstein-ish and other scientists warned of freak babies. \u201cYou\u2019re aware they\u2019ll throw the book at us,\u201d Nighy's Steptoe tells the team. \u201cWe will unite them all against us.\u201d",
      "Purdy, a single woman as the swinging \u201860s lead to the \u201970s, is exiled by her own pious mother \u2014 \u201cYou can\u2019t play God with this,\u201d the elder woman tells her daughter \u2014 and disinvited by her church. No matter. \u201cThis fight is ours. We don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Purdy says. The film also celebrates the brave would-be mothers who volunteered their bodies to be poked and prodded at the edge of science.",

    "story": [
      "Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of the cable television networks that were once at the entertainment giant's heart as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms.",
      "Those one-time stars for Comcast's NBCUniversal cable television networks include USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel, as well as CNBC and MSNBC. Movie ticketing platform Fandango and the Rotten Tomatoes movie rating site will also become part of the new company.",
      "Streaming service Peacock will remain with Comcast, as will Bravo, which provides significant content for the Peacock streaming service, and other assets like the NBCUniversal's studios and theme parks.",
      "Comcast telegraphed the shift last month, before confirming Wednesday that it will spin off assets that generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months ending Sept. 30. That\u2019s about 5.5% of Comcast\u2019s total revenue during that period, according to the company.",
      "How exactly this split will impact customers is not yet clear. Experts maintain it\u2019s too early to tell, given that Comcast aims to complete the transition over the next year.",
      "Some analysts speculate that the spun-off networks may have more freedom to bring their content elsewhere. That could mean you'll have more options to find and curate what you want to watch and where \u2014 or headaches from juggling several different subscriptions in an already-fractured media landscape.",
      "Wednesday's announcement arrives as more and more people \u201ccut the cord\u201d on cable, with millions canceling service subscriptions every year \u2014 and instead signing up for streaming platforms.",
      "Paul Verna, principal analyst and vice president of content for market research company eMarketer, said Comcast\u2019s decision to divest itself from most of its cable TV channels is a reflection of that trend.",
      "\u201cThe writing is on the wall that the cable TV business is a dwindling business,\u201d Verna said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Comcast did what it did today.\u201d",
      "Mike Proulx, a vice president and research director of Forrester, added that the spin-off marks \u201csimply a reconciliation of assets that detract from the company\u2019s inevitable all streaming future.\u201d",
      "Comcast expects the new company, which it referred to as \u201cSpinCo\u201d Wednesday, to have the financial flexibility to be \u201ca potential partner and acquirer of other complementary media businesses.\u201d And Mark Lazarus, the current chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group who will serve as the new entity\u2019s CEO, said Wednesday that the standalone company \u201cwill be better positioned to serve our audiences and drive shareholder returns.\u201d",
      "Like other cable companies, Comcast in recent years has shifted its business emphasis away from traditional cable toward streaming and other sources of revenue, such as its movie studio, theme parks and home wireless and internet services.",
      "Despite a slightly confusing, glitchy start, Peacock has been one of the company's biggest success stories, with recent boosts gained in part by the streaming platform's popularity during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. In its most recent quarter, Comcast reported that paid Peacock subscribers jumped by 3 million, or 29%, to 36 million subscribers. Peacock\u2019s revenue soared 82% to $1.5 billion in the period.",
      "Dropping \u201cmoney-losing assets\u201d to instead focus on these kinds of lucrative business is clearly beneficial to Comcast, Verna said \u2014 but the future of a new company housing primarily cable networks is less promising. He said he finds it hard \u201cto envision that this company will stay independent for a long time,\" predicting future consolidation of the networks or acquisitions through private equity.",
      "Howard Gutman, private equity strategy and coverage lead for MorganFranklin Consulting, also expects consolidation to be in the cards. He noted the spin-off might entice bigger streaming services that are in search of more content, for example, to buy up these kinds of assets.",
      "That could mean watchers of the Golf Channel, for example, finding its content on what were once rival platforms. But the spun-off assets might also find more power to focus on priorities specific to them under a smaller company umbrella, Gutman added. That would potentially open the door for networks like CNBC to further monetize its own content or expand its brand.",
      "\u201cI think it will open up opportunities,\u201d he said, adding that customers will also have more options to curate subscriptions based on what interests them the most.",
      "Verna is less optimistic. He pointed to a history of changes in the media landscape that has repeatedly been tough for consumers.",
      "People already have a hard time figuring out where to watch or stream something they're looking for, Verna said, and deals to license or spread that out further could worsen that. And paying for more and more services adds up, particularly as platforms have hiked prices over time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too early to know what impact (the Comcast spin-offs) will have .... But I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath (on there being) a net benefit to consumers,\u201d Verna said. \u201cConsumers are the ones who are supposed to be driving these trends, and to some extent they are. But they also tend to get the short end of the stick every time.\u201d",
      "The spin-off is targeted for completion in about a year, the entertainment giant said Wednesday, pending financing and approval from its board and government regulators.",
      "Beyond Lazarus' appointment to CEO of the new company, Anand Kini, the current chief financial officer of NBCUniversal, will take on the same title with the new company as well as the chief operating officer role.",
      "Shares of Comcast, based in Philadelphia, ended up 1.6% Wednesday.",
      "Comcast reported revenue of more than $32 billion and profit of $1.12 per share in its most recent quarter, boosted by the summer box-office success of \"Despicable Me 4,\" which grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",

      "\u201cMy girls suck on their thumbs because of how hungry they are, and I pat their backs until they sleep,\u201d she said.",
      "After being displaced five times, the Eids reside in central Gaza, where aid groups have relatively more access than in the north, which has been largely isolated and heavily destroyed since Israel began waging a renewed offensive against the militant group Hamas in early October. But nearly everyone in Gaza is going hungry these days. In the north experts say a full-blown famine may be underway.",
      "On Thursday, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, accusing them of using \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d \u2014 charges Israel adamantly denies.",
      "In Deir al-Balah, the Eids are among hundreds of thousands sheltering in squalid tent camps. The local bakeries shut down for five days this week. The price of a bag of bread climbed above $13 by Wednesday, as bread and flour vanished from shelves before more supplies arrived.",
      "The United Nations humanitarian office warned of a \u201cstark increase\u201d in the number of households experiencing severe hunger in central and southern Gaza. It appeared to be linked to the robbery at gunpoint of nearly 100 aid trucks last weekend in southern Gaza, close to Israeli military positions. Israel blamed Hamas but appears to have taken no action to stop the looting, while Hamas said it was the work of local bandits.",
      "Aid groups say the looting is one of many obstacles to getting food and other vital aid to the territory's 2.3 million Palestinians. They also have to contend with Israeli movement restrictions, ongoing fighting, and heavy damage wreaked by the Israeli bombardment of roads and critical infrastructure.",
      "For months, Yasmin and her family have gone to bed hungry.",

Meat and chicken all but vanished from the markets months ago, but there are still some local vegetables. Such sums are astronomical in an impoverished territory where few people earn regular incomes.",
      "Crowds of hundreds wait hours to get food from charities, which are also struggling.",
      "Hani Almadhoun, co-founder of the Gaza Soup Kitchen, said his teams can offer only small bowls of rice or pasta once a day. He said they \u201ccan go to the market on one day and buy something for $5, and then go back in the afternoon to find it doubled or tripled in price.\u201d",
      "Its kitchen in the central town of Zuweida operated on a daily budget of around $500 for much of the war. When the amount of aid entering Gaza plummeted in October, its costs climbed to around $1,300 a day. It can feed about half of the 1,000 families who line up each day.",
      "Israel says it places no limits on the amount of aid entering Gaza and has announced a number of measures it says are aimed at increasing the flow in recent weeks, including the opening of a new crossing. It blames U.N. agencies for not retrieving it, pointing to hundreds of truckloads languishing on the Gaza side of the border.",
      "But the military's own figures show that the amount of aid entering Gaza plunged to around 1,800 trucks in October, down from over 4,200 the previous month. At the current rate of entry, around 2,400 trucks would come into Gaza in November. Around 500 trucks entered each day before the war.",
      "The U.N. says less than half the truckloads are actually distributed because of ongoing fighting, Israeli denial of movement requests, and the breakdown of law and order. Hamas-run police have vanished from many areas after being targeted by Israeli airstrikes.",
      "The war started Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are dead, and Hamas militants have repeatedly regrouped after Israeli operations, carrying out hit-and-run attacks from tunnels and bombed-out buildings.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many of the dead were fighters.",
      "The United States warned Israel in October that it might be forced to curtail some of its crucial military support if Israel did not rapidly ramp up the amount of aid entering Gaza. But after the 30-day ultimatum expired, the Biden administration declined to take any action, saying there had been some progress.",
      "Israel meanwhile passed legislation severing ties with UNRWA. Israel accuses the agency of allowing itself to be infiltrated by Hamas \u2014 allegations denied by the U.N.",
      "Israeli news outlets have reported that officials are considering plans for the military to take over aid distribution or contract it out to private security companies. Asked about such plans Wednesday, government spokesman David Mercer said \u201cIsrael is looking at many creative solutions to ensure a better future for Gaza.\u201d",
      "Yoav Gallant, the former defense minister who was seen as a voice of moderation in the far-right government before being fired this month, warned on X that handing over aid distribution to a private firm was a \u201ceuphemism for the beginning of military rule.\u201d",
      "As that debate plays out in Jerusalem, less than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away from central Gaza, most Palestinians in the territory are focused on staying alive in a war with no end in sight.",
      "\u201cI find it difficult to talk about the suffering we are experiencing. I am ashamed to talk about it,\u201d said Yasmin\u2019s husband, Hani. \u201cWhat can I tell you? I\u2019m a person who has 21 family members and is unable to provide them with a bag of flour.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 07:06:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Drug reform advocates hailed Oregon as a progressive leader when it became the first in the nation to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the compound found in psychedelic mushrooms",
    "story": [
      "Drug reform advocates hailed Oregon as a progressive leader when it became the first in the nation to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the compound found in psychedelic mushrooms",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Drug reform advocates hailed Oregon as a progressive leader when it became the first in the nation to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the compound found in psychedelic mushrooms.",
      "But four years later, voters in a growing list of its cities have banned the substance.",
      "Four cities, spanning Portland suburbs and rural and coastal towns, added new voter-approved prohibitions for the federally illegal compound in the Nov. 5 election. A dozen other communities that approved two-year moratoriums in 2022, when a majority of Oregon counties and over 100 cities voted to temporarily or permanently ban psilocybin, voted in this election to make the restrictions permanent.",
      "In the wake of the fentanyl crisis, the rejection of drug liberalization measures in Oregon and states across the country this election has some experts questioning whether voters are rethinking their appetite for such policies.",
      "In Massachusetts, for example, voters rejected a measure that would have allowed residents over 21 to grow and use plant-based psychedelic drugs in certain circumstances. All three states that had measures to legalize recreational marijuana voted against it.",
      "Oregon voters, in particular, appear to have soured on drug reform. A law passed by voters four years ago that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of hard drugs, including heroin and methamphetamine, was rolled back by the state legislature earlier this year after heated debate over whether it played a role in a spike in public drug use and deaths.",
      "\u201cPerhaps the fact that the drug policy reform pendulum appears to be swinging back towards prohibition is part of a broader trend toward a preference for \u2018law and order\u2019 among American voters,\" said Josh Hardman, founder of Psychedelics Alpha, a consulting firm and newsletter on psychedelic research, business and policy. \u201cOregon, specifically, has been touted as an example of liberal drug policies gone wrong.\"",
      "Despite the local bans, psilocybin remains accessible in over 30 licensed centers spanning the state\u2019s most populous cities, like Portland, and a handful of small towns. Some rural counties also have voted to stay in the program.",
      "However, access to therapeutic psilocybin is further complicated by high costs: One session can be up to $2,000 out of pocket. That is largely because center owners and facilitators have to pass on licensure expenses to consumers in order to stay afloat.",
      "MJ Wilt, who just opened a licensed center in the Portland suburb of Gresham, spent tens of thousands of dollars of her own savings to get licensed and establish her center. It has been hard, she said, because her own experience with psilocybin changed her life for the better and she wants to bring that experience to others.",
      "\u201cThe cost for the program has been astronomical and is not accessible to people across the socioeconomic spectrum,\u201d Wilt said. \u201cIt's certainly not the cash cow that people think or thought it was going to be.\u201d",
      "In 2020, roughly 56% of Oregon voters approved Measure 109, which allowed for the manufacture and controlled, therapeutic use of psilocybin at licensed facilities for those over 21. But the measure allowed counties and cities to vote to opt out, resulting in a patchwork of regulations across the state.",
      "Adding to the complexity, some cities have voted to allow psilocybin despite being in counties that banned it, as cities control the land incorporated within their borders while counties control unincorporated land.",
      "The regulatory patchwork resembles that of cannabis law. In half of the 24 states that have legalized recreational cannabis, including Oregon, localities may opt out of most types of cannabis businesses, according to Kate Bryan, a policy specialist on criminal and civil justice at the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Colorado in 2022 became the only other state to legalize psilocybin for therapeutic use. It will begin accepting license applications for \u201chealing centers\u201d at the end of December, a spokesperson for the state's natural medicine division said in an email. The law allows localities to adopt certain regulations regarding how the centers operate, but it does not allow them to ban such centers entirely.",
      "Multiple cities across the country also have voted to decriminalize psilocybin, meaning a person cannot be arrested or prosecuted for possessing limited amounts of plant-based hallucinogens.",
      "Psilocybin, found in several species of mushrooms, can cause hours of vivid hallucinations. Indigenous people have used it in healing rituals, and scientists are exploring whether it can help treat depression, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. Researchers and military veterans are among those who have advocated for the study of the substance for therapeutic use.",
      "Kat Thompson, the founder and CEO of Fractal Soul, a licensed psilocybin center in the Portland suburb of Beaverton, said her center has served 400 people in its first year and that the \u201cvast majority\u201d have had positive outcomes. Many come seeking help for depression, anxiety, trauma and addiction after years of trying talk therapy and medication, she said, while others come to process grief or explore their spirituality.",
      "But she said a lack of public awareness about the state's psilocybin program has led many to confuse it with Measure 110, the separate ballot measure also passed in 2020 that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs. The botched implementation of the law \u2014 also a first of its kind in the nation \u2014 and rising overdose deaths amid the fentanyl crisis fueled pushback that prompted state lawmakers to backtrack on it earlier this year.",
      "\u201cWe actually got lots of calls from people who had booked sessions with us who heard about the roll back of 110 and thought that that meant that we were closing,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve had to explain and educate the public that Measure 110 was really just about decriminalization for personal use. It has nothing to do with the professional therapeutic model.\u201d",
      "Some people also confuse the model of the psilocybin center with cannabis dispensaries. At dispensaries, people buy cannabis and leave to consume it elsewhere. People who want to use psilocybin, meanwhile, must consume it at a licensed service center under the supervision of a licensed facilitator who administers it to them and remains with them for the duration of the trip, Thompson said.",
      "\u201cThis is essentially a mental health clinic where someone is here all day with us,\u201d she said. \"By and large, it is extremely safe.\u201d",
      "Of the over 16,000 doses that have been administered since the first licensed center opened in June 2023, staff at such centers have called 911 or taken a patient to a hospital five times, an Oregon Health Authority spokesperson confirmed in an email. There are roughly 350 licensed facilitators and a dozen psilocybin manufacturers in the state, according to the agency's most recent figures.",
      "Joe Buck, the mayor of Lake Oswego, a Portland suburb that just passed a psilocybin ban, said he wasn't surprised by the outcome, even though a majority of the city's residents supported Measure 109 in 2020.",
      "\u201cOregon really has not done a great job managing its drug policy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I can understand how some people may be wary of the promises that are now being made around psilocybin.\u201d",
      "But further research on psilocybin, he said, could change voters' perspective in the future.",
      "\u201cIt really is up to state leaders, leaders in the federal government, to work these drugs through a good system that builds community trust.\""

      "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- With their push to end smoking in Atlantic City's casinos going nowhere fast in either the courts or the state Legislature, casino workers and supporters of smoke-free gambling halls demonstrated Thursday outside a hotel where New Jersey's governor was due to speak.",
      "The workers have been pushing for four years to end an exemption in New Jersey's clean air law that allows smoking inside the nine casinos. They say they or their co-workers are becoming ill with cancer, heart disease and other conditions related to exposure to second-hand smoke.",
      "Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has said he will sign a bill to end casino smoking once it reaches his desk. But he has invested little political capital in pushing for it to happen.",
      "His office referred a reporter to a statement he made in a call-in show in September on News 12 New Jersey in which the governor questioned why workers are blaming him for the impasse.",
      "\u201cI have an enormous amount of sympathy with them; they\u2019re somehow blaming this on me,\u201d Murphy said on the show. \u201cI just want to repeat what I have been saying for about five years: If a bill comes to my desk that bans smoking in casinos in Atlantic City, I will sign it. Period. I am not equivocating, and I have not equivocated about that. The way to solve this is through legislation.\"",
      "A bill to end casino smoking has been stalled in the state Legislature for years without the state's Democratic leadership allowing it to progress to full votes in the Senate and Assembly.",
      "And a lawsuit brought by the worker s in April is working its way slowly through the legal system; a judge refused to grant an order in August that would have ended smoking in the gambling halls.",
      "The stalemate added to the frustration of casino workers who say they want the same workplace protections that virtually every other worker in New Jersey receives.",
      "\u201cIt's horrible when you have three, four, five people blowing smoke in your face,\u201d said Sandy Smolen, a dealer at the Borgata casino for the past five years and a 40-year veteran of the industry. \u201cYou can't get away from it. You go home with a cough you didn't have that morning.\u201d",
      "Elaine Rose, a frequent casino patron, voiced similar sentiments.",
      "\u201cAs a player, I've walked into a casino, played a couple hours, and walked out with a bad case of bronchitis,\u201d she said.",
      "Whether to ban smoking is one of the most controversial issues not only in Atlantic City casinos, but in other states where workers have expressed concern about secondhand smoke. They are waging similar campaigns in Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Kansas and Virginia.",
      "The Atlantic City casino industry opposes a ban, fearing the loss of significant revenue and jobs if smokers stop coming to Atlantic City and take their business elsewhere.",
      "But opponents say casinos in several parts of the country have successfully gone smoke-free without losing business.",
      "A competing bill that would keep the current 25% limit of the casino floor on which smoking can occur, but impose other limits is also bottled up in the Legislature.",
      "That measure would allow smoking in unenclosed areas of the casino floor that contain slot machines and are designated as smoking areas that are more than 15 feet (4.6 meters) away from table games staffed by live dealers. It also would allow the casinos to offer smoking in enclosed, separately ventilated smoking rooms with the proviso that no worker can be assigned to work in such a room against their will.",
      "Ricky Foster, a supervisor-dealer at the Borgata for 21 years, said the frustration among workers is palpable.",
      "\u201cWe're tired of doing Go Fund Me accounts for people's cancer and heart conditions, and they never smoked a day in their life,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Two Australian teenagers and a British woman have died from suspected methanol poisoning after drinking tainted alcohol in Laos",
      "BANGKOK -- Two Australian teenagers and a British woman died from suspected methanol poisoning after drinking tainted alcohol in Laos. An American man and two Danes also died, though their exact causes of death have not been released. A New Zealander also has been sickened. The U.S. State Department issued a warning to travelers to be \u201calert to the potential risk of methanol poisoning.\u201d But what is methanol, and how do you avoid it?",
      "There are three main types of alcohol: ethanol, methanol and isopropyl. Ethanol is what is found in consumer spirits and is the only one intended for consumption. Isopropanol is the main ingredient in rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizers. Methanol, commonly called wood alcohol because it is the byproduct of wood distillation, is frequently used as fuel and in products such as antifreeze and solvents.",
      "According to the Methanol Institute, the global trade association for the industry, drinking just 25 to 90 ml (0.7 to 3.0 ounces) of methanol can be fatal without proper medical treatment, but can be successfully treated if caught early.",
      "Methanol poisoning can cause headaches, dizziness and decreased consciousness including coma, seizure, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision and multiple other symptoms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The CDC recommends seeking medical attention immediately if methanol poisoning is suspected.",
      "\u201cIndividuals vary in their response to methanol,\u201d said toxicologist Alastair Hay from Britain\u2019s University of Leeds. \u201cSome will be able to tolerate more than others because we all have variability in the capacity of our enzymes to detox. But small quantities ... might be fatal for individuals; others may survive slightly more.\u201d",
      "Methanol is sometimes added deliberately by unscrupulous bars to mixed drinks to give them more \u201ckick\u201d and to save money on using higher-priced ethanol-based spirits such as vodka or rum. This practice is not specific to Laos or Southeast Asia, but occurs wherever taxes on legitimate alcohol or the cost of legitimate alcohol is perceived as being too high, according to the Methanol Institute.",
      "Methanol is also a normal product of the distillation process that produces ethanol, and in home-brew distilleries without strict controls \u2014 often found in poorer countries \u2014 it can end up in the mix.",
      "The answer is easy: don't drink it.",
      "But it's colorless, odorless and tasteless, so that can be something of a challenge.",
      "In guidance issued after the Laos poisonings, Britain\u2019s Foreign Office recommends only purchasing alcoholic beverages from licensed liquor stores, buying drinks only from licensed bars and hotels, always checking if bottle seals are intact, and checking labels for poor print quality or incorrect spellings.",
      "The Methanol Institute notes that beverages such as canned beer, cider, wine, pre-mix, and duty-free products tend to be safer and less easy to adulterate.",
      "It also urges people to be wary of homemade brews, and free drinks or drinks priced far below normal.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:06:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Fights are cropping up nationwide over fluoride in drinking water",
    "story": [
      "Fights are cropping up nationwide over fluoride in drinking water",
      "NEW YORK -- For about 50 years, adding cavity-preventing fluoride to drinking water was a popular public health measure in Yorktown, a leafy town north of New York City.",
      "But in September, the town\u2019s supervisor used his emergency powers to stop the practice.",
      "The reason? A recent federal judge\u2019s decision that ordered U.S. regulators to consider the risk that fluoride in water could cause lower IQ in kids.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous to look at and just say \u2018Ah, screw it. We\u2019ll keep going on,\u2019\u201d said the town supervisor, Ed Lachterman.",
      "Yorktown isn\u2019t alone. The decision to add fluoride to drinking water rests with state and local officials, and fights are cropping up nationwide.",
      "Communities in Florida, Texas, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and elsewhere have debated the idea in recent months \u2014 the total number is in the dozens, with several deciding to stop adding it to drinking water, according to Fluoride Action Network, an advocacy organization against water fluoridation. In Arkansas, legislators this week filed a bill to repeal the state\u2019s fluoridation program.",
      "The debates have been ignited or fueled by three developments:",
      "\u2014In August, a federal agency reported \u201cwith moderate confidence\u201d that there is a link between high levels of fluoride exposure \u2014 more than twice the recommended limit \u2014 and lower IQ in kids.",
      "\u2014In September, the federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to the intellectual development of children.",
      "\u2014This month, just days before the election, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. declared that Donald Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day as president. Trump later picked Kennedy to run the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "In Durango, Colorado, there was an unsuccessful attempt to stop fluoridating the water during Trump\u2019s first term in office. A new push came this year, as Trump saw a surge of political support.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of the ebb and flow of politics on the national level that ultimately affects us down here,\u201d said city spokesman Tom Sluis.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and the addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main source for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data.",
      "There is a recommended fluoridation level, but many communities exceed that, sometimes because fluoride occurs naturally at higher levels in certain water sources.",
      "Opposition is nothing new, though for decades it was considered a fringe opinion. Adherents included conspiracy theorists who claimed fluoridation was a plot to make people submissive to government power.",
      "Health officials could point to studies that showed that cavities were less common in communities with fluoridated water, and that dental health worsened in communities without it.",
      "But fluoride isn't just in water. Through the years it became common in toothpaste, mouthwash and other products. And data began to emerge that there could be too much of a good thing: In 2011, officials reported that 2 out of 5 U.S. adolescents had at least mild tooth streaking or spottiness because of too much fluoride.",
      "In 2015, the CDC recommended that communities revisit how much they were putting in the water. Beginning in 1962, the government recommended a range of 0.7 milligrams per liter for warmer climates where people drink more water to 1.2 milligrams in cooler areas. The new standard became 0.7 everywhere.",
      "Over time, more studies pointed to a different problem: a link between higher levels of fluoride and brain development. The August report by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program \u2014 summarizing studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico \u2014 concluded that drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter was associated with lower IQs in kids.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question that fluoride prevents cavities,\u201d said Dr. Tom Frieden, who was director of the CDC when the agency changed the recommended fluoride levels. \u201cThere\u2019s also no question we\u2019re getting more fluoride than we were 50 years ago, through toothpaste and other things.\u201d",
      "Frieden said \u201ca legitimate question\u201d has been raised about whether fluoride affects brain development, and studies making that link \u201cneed to be looked at carefully.\u201d",
      "Many people in health care strongly embrace water fluoridation. The American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics reaffirmed their endorsement of current CDC recommendations in the wake of the federal report and the judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "Colorado\u2019s health department, which weighed in during a Nov. 5 Durango city council meeting, said in a statement that it \u201cseeks to align its public health recommendations with the latest scientific research. The facts of this court ruling are not sufficient\u201d to revise current fluoridation levels.",
      "Durango officials are waiting to see what the EPA does in reaction to the recent court decision, said Sluis, the city spokesman.",
      "\u201cWe follow the science,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be in the best interest of the city to stop fluoridation based on one judge\u2019s interpretation.\u201d",
      "In Yorktown, Lachterman concluded the judge\u2019s decision was enough to halt fluoridation. He recalled a community discussion several years ago in which most people in the room clearly favored fluoridation, but recently it seems public comment has reversed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a total 180,\u201d he said.",
      "But not all public pressure these days is against the idea.",
      "In September, Buffalo, New York, announced it would resume water fluoridation after not having it for nearly a decade. News reports had described an increase in tooth decay and families sued, seeking damages for dental costs.",
      "The Buffalo Sewer Authority\u2019s general manager, Oluwole McFoy declined to discuss the decision with The Associated Press, citing the litigation.",
      "For its part, the EPA \u201cis in the process of reviewing the district court\u2019s decision,\u201d spokesman Jeff Landis said this week.",
      "In Monroe, Wisconsin, fluoridation \u201chas become a very hot issue,\u201d said its mayor, Donna Douglas.",
      "The small city, near Madison, started fluoridating its drinking water in the early 1960s. But in the late summer, some residents began calling and emailing Douglas, saying she needed to do something about what they saw as a public health danger. The first call \u201cwas more like a threat,\u201d she recalled.",
      "Douglas said she did not take a position on whether to stop, but decided to raise it to the city council for discussion. The discussions were unusually emotional.",
      "Few people tend to speak during public comment sessions at council meetings, said Douglas. But more than two dozen people spoke at a city council meeting last month, most of them in favor of fluoridation. At a subsequent meeting, about a dozen more people \u2014 all opposed to fluoridation \u2014 came out to speak.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had any debates at all\u201d like this, Douglas said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it would be such a heated discussion.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Georgia official disbanded the state's maternal mortality committee that investigates deaths of pregnant women",
      "Georgia's top health official dismissed all members of a state committee that investigates pregnancy-related maternal deaths after a committee member presumably released information about two such deaths.",
      "In a letter first reported by ProPublica and dated Nov. 8, state public health commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey said whoever shared the information violated state law and a confidential agreement signed by committee members. An agency investigation wasn't able to identify who disclosed the details.",
      "ProPublica reported in September that internal reports showed the Georgia Maternal Mortality Review Committee determined the deaths of two women were preventable, but found that doctors were hesitant to perform a procedure that could have saved their lives because of the state's strict abortion policies.",
      "The cases drew national attention and became a central theme in Vice President Kamala Harris ' presidential campaign. Harris has been outspoken on abortion rights ever since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision more than two years ago that overturned Roe v. Wade.",
      "The Georgia committee works to identify what caused women to die during pregnancy or soon after childbirth, seeking to prevent other deaths or health crises.",
      "The decision to disband the committee seems \u201cvery abrupt,\u201d said Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, one of the groups that sued Georgia over the state's abortion ban beyond six weeks of pregnancy. A judge initially struck down the ban, but Georgia's Supreme Court halted the ruling in October, restoring the law.",
      "\"To have any time where we don\u2019t have this committee in place difficult to fathom, realizing that we may lose access to really important data and information that could help us make better decisions and organize better around what we need for the state,\" Simpson said.",
      "Toomey wrote that reconstituting the committee \u201cwill not result in a delay\u201d of the committee's responsibilities.",
      "The Georgia Department of Public Health will open applications for new members in the \u201ccoming weeks,\u201d Toomey said in the letter, but will work to make sure there is more oversight and confidentiality in its review of cases.",
      "\"This is a scare tactic meant to stop full investigations into the circumstances of pregnant women\u2019s deaths across the state,\" Alicia Stallworth, Director of Georgia Campaigns at Reproductive Freedom for All, said in a statement. \"Now more than ever, it\u2019s important to mobilize against anti-abortion extremists like Governor Kemp, who are responsible for these deadly bans.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp doesn't appoint or release members of the committee because it's overseen by the Department of Public Health, Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas said. Kemp signed into law in 2019 a ban on abortions once the fetal heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as six weeks.",
      "A spokesperson for the health department declined to provide additional comment and said the letter \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d"

    "summary": "A push by New York City jail officials to block people detained at Rikers Island from receiving physical mail was based on faulty fentanyl test strips that overstated the influx of contraband sent through the mail",
    "story": [
      "A push by New York City jail officials to block people detained at Rikers Island from receiving physical mail was based on faulty fentanyl test strips that overstated the influx of contraband sent through the mail",
      "NEW YORK -- In 2022, New York City\u2019s jails commissioner, Louis Molina, issued a dire warning to local lawmakers: fentanyl was pouring into Rikers Island through the mail, he said, spurring an overdose crisis among the jail's detainees and putting guards at risk.",
      "As evidence of the insidious threat, Molina passed around a child\u2019s drawing of a reindeer, one of hundreds of seized items he said had been \u201cliterally soaked in the drug and mailed to people in custody.\u201d",
      "But that claim was based on faulty drug-testing kits with a stunning 85% false positive rate, according to a report released Wednesday by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation. The report found the city vastly overstated the prevalence of fentanyl sent by mail to detainees.",
      "When investigators retested 71 pieces of mail initially flagged by field tests as containing fentanyl, only 10 actually showed traces of the drug. The drawing of a reindeer highlighted by Molina was fentanyl-free.",
      "Field tests indicating an influx of fentanyl-laced mail to Rikers Island fueled a yearslong campaign by Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration to bar people in city custody from receiving physical mail.",
      "As a replacement, city officials proposed redirecting mail to an offsite vendor, who would then upload it digitally for the incarcerated person to read on a tablet \u2014 a practice used in other correctional systems, including New York's state prisons. So far, the proposal has been blocked by a jail oversight board.",
      "Jocelyn Strauber, the commissioner of the Department of Investigation, said the city should reassess its ongoing effort to bar detainees from receiving mail, given the report\u2019s findings.",
      "\u201cThe field tests don\u2019t support a concern that a high rate of fentanyl-laced objects are coming in from the mail,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cTo the extent policy determinations are based on flawed data, they ought to be reconsidered.\u201d",
      "Detainee advocates have long contended that drugs primarily enter the jail system via employees, who can easily smuggle them inside and sell them to gang leaders. In recent years, dozens of correction officers have been charged in multiple investigations of smuggling rings on Rikers Island.",
      "In its report, the Department of Investigation said corrections officials had failed to implement many of the department's previous recommendations aimed at screening staff for contraband.",
      "In an email statement, a Department of Correction spokesperson said the agency would review the report and continue refining its testing processes. \u201cField tests are a tool used to quickly assess potential threats, and while not perfect, they play an important role in our safety protocols,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Such field tests have gained popularity in recent years alongside a spike in opioid overdose deaths nationwide, allowing law enforcement officials to bypass the lengthy lab process to determine if a substance contains narcotics.",
      "But experts have long raised questions about the strips' effectiveness. Under federal regulations, manufacturers are required to include language on their packaging indicating that results are preliminary until confirmed by a lab \u2014 something that rarely happens in correctional settings.",
      "Last November, New York\u2019s state prison system was found to have wrongly punished more than 2,000 detainees due to false positives from drug tests manufactured by Sirchie Finger Print Laboratories.",
      "For years, the test strips used on Rikers Island, the city-run jail system, were also provided by Sirchie. But after complaints about the reliability of the tests, the Department of Correction switched to kits made by DetectaChem last April.",
      "The review by the Department of Investigation found DetectaChem\u2019s test strips had a false positive rate of 79%, while Sirchie\u2019s were wrong 91% of the time.",
      "Inquiries to Sirchie were not returned.",
      "Travis Kisner, the chief operating officer of DetectaChem, said the company was still reviewing the report, but added: \u201cWe stand behind our product.\""

      "Here's a look at a television doctor who became a politician and is now designated to lead an agency that touches nearly all Americans in some way.",
      "Trained as a heart surgeon, Oz rose to prominence on Oprah Winfrey's leading daytime television show before spinning off his own series, \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\" in 2009.",

      "He attended a private high school in Delaware and Harvard University as a college undergraduate, also playing football there, and served in the Turkish army to maintain his dual citizenship.",
      "Oz dispensed nutritional and lifestyle advice on his show, portraying himself as a trusted doctor capable of explaining health matters in an engaging and approachable way. But his show also blurred the line between medical advice and advertising, failing to make clear to his audience just how closely he worked with the companies he pitched.",
      "He repeatedly promoted products of questionable medical value and was named in lawsuits that alleged he made misleading claims on the show. Several of the companies he has promoted are structured as multilevel marketing businesses whose practices have repeatedly drawn the attention of federal regulators.",
      "Oz had a net worth between $100 million and $315 million, according to a federal financial disclosure he filed in 2022, which gives dollar values in ranges but does not provide specific figures.",
      "Oz ran for U.S. Senate as a Republican in 2022, one of the highest-profile races of that year's midterms. Though he was a longtime resident of New Jersey and worked in New York City, Oz ran in Pennsylvania, citing ties to the state through his wife's parents.",
      "His campaign leaned heavily into his celebrity. Its logo looked just like his TV show logo. His themes \u2014 \u201ca dose of reality\u201d or \u201cthe doctor is in\u201d \u2014 spun off his TV doctor reputation.",
      "He ran in a crowded Republican primary and won Trump's eagerly sought endorsement.",
      "\u201cWomen, in particular, are drawn to Dr. Oz for his advice and counsel. I have seen this many times over the years. They know him, believe in him, and trust him,\u201d Trump said when he endorsed Oz.",
      "Following a court battle that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Oz narrowly won the primary over McCormick by 951 votes but lost to Democrat John Fetterman in the general election.",
      "Oz told The Associated Press in a 2022 interview that he first met Trump in 2004 or 2005 when he asked Trump to use his golf course for an event for Oz\u2019s children\u2019s charity. Trump agreed. After that, they saw each other intermittently at social events before Oz interviewed Trump about his health during the 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "In a 2016 appearance on \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d Trump said his wife, Melania Trump, was \u201ca big fan\u201d of the show.",
      "Trump appointed Oz to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition during his first term.",

      "Women's health advocates in Africa are worried that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will again invoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that cuts off U.S. government funding for groups that offer abortion-related services",
      "EPWORTH, Zimbabwe -- Carrying her infant daughter, 19-year-old Sithulisiwe Moyo waited two hours to get birth-control pills from a tent pitched in a poor settlement on the outskirts of Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "The outreach clinic in Epworth provides Moyo with her best shot at achieving her dream of returning to school. \u201cI am too young to be a baby-making machine,\" she said. \"At least this clinic helps me avoid another pregnancy.\u201d",
      "But the free service funded by the U.S. government, the world\u2019s largest health donor, might soon be unavailable.",
      "As he did in his first term, U.S President-elect Donald Trump is likely in January to invoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that bars U.S. foreign aid from being used to perform abortions or provide abortion information. The policy cuts off American government funding for services that women around the world rely on to avoid pregnancy or to space out their children, as well as for heath care unrelated to abortion.",
      "The gag rule has a 40-year history of being applied by Republican presidents and rescinded by Democratic presidents. Every GOP president since the mid-1980s has invoked the rule, which is known as the Mexico City Policy for the city where it was first announced.",
      "As one of his first acts as president in 2017, Trump expanded the rule to the extent that foreign NGOs were cut off from about $600 million in U.S. family planning funds and more than $11 billion in U.S. global health aid between 2017 and 2018 alone, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.",
      "The money \u2014 much of it intended for Africa \u2014 covered efforts such as preventing malaria and tuberculosis, providing water and sanitation, and distributing health information and contraception, which might also have repercussions for HIV prevention.",
      "Women\u2019s health advocates are \u201cuneasy\u201d following Trump\u2019s victory, said Pester Siraha, director of Population Services Zimbabwe, an affiliate of MSI Reproductive Choices, an NGO that supports abortion rights in 36 countries.",
      "The policy stipulates that foreign NGOs that receive U.S government funding must agree to stop abortion-related activities, including discussing it as a family planning option \u2014 even when they are using non-U.S. government funds for such activities. During Trump's first term, MSI did not agree to those conditions, effectively making it ineligible for U.S government funding.",
      "Siraha said that a blueprint offered to Trump by the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation in its plan known as Project 2025 indicates that the new administration could enact \u201ca more comprehensive global gag rule.\u201d",
      "Even NGOs in countries that outlaw abortion, such as Zimbabwe, are affected. Population Services Zimbabwe, for instance, closed its outreach clinics during Trump\u2019s first term after losing funding due to its association with MSI Reproductive Choices. Such outreach clinics are often the only health care option for rural people with limited access to hospitals due to poverty or distance.",
      "\u201cIt leaves women with no place to turn for help, even for information,\u201d said Whitney Chinogwenya, global marketing manager at MSI Reproductive Choices.",
      "Some NGOs in other African countries such as Uganda, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa rolled back services, including clinics, contraception, training and support for government and community health workers, as well as programs for young people, sex workers and LGBTIQ+ communities.",
      "Other services shut down entirely. The risk of unplanned pregnancies, unsafe abortions and related deaths increased in many of the affected countries, according to the U.S.-based Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.",
      "Chinogwenya, the MSI Reproductive Choices marketing manager, said her organization\u2019s donor income dropped by $120 million during Trump\u2019s first term. The money would have provided 8 million women globally with family planning help, preventing 6 million unintended pregnancies, 1.8 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 pregnancy-related deaths, she said.",
      "The gag-rule policy \u201cleads to more unintended, unwanted, unsupportable pregnancies and therefore an increase in abortion,\u201d said Catriona Macleod, a professor of psychology at South Africa\u2019s Rhodes University.",
      "\u201cThis legislation does not protect life \u2026 it\u2019s been called America\u2019s deadly export,\u201d said Macleod, who heads the university\u2019s studies in sexuality and reproduction.",

      "Transgender Day of Remembrance is marked every Nov. 20 and began in 1999 to honor Rita Hester, a trans woman who was killed in Massachusetts.",
      "The day marks the end of Transgender Awareness Week, which is used to raise public knowledge about transgender people and the issues they face.",
      "The Williams Institute at UCLA Law estimates that 1.6 million people in the U.S. ages 13 and older identify as transgender. And it says transgender people are over four times more likely than cisgender people to be victims of violence, including rape and assault.",
      "Candlelight vigils, memorials and other events are held to mark the day. The Human Rights Campaign also released its annual report on deaths of transgender people in conjunction with the day.",
      "International Transgender Day of Visibility, which is designed to bring attention to transgender people, is commemorated in March.",
      "At least 36 transgender people have died from violence in the 12 months since the last Day of Remembrance, the Human Rights Campaign said in its annual report. Since 2013, the organization has recorded the deaths from violence of 372 victims who were transgender and gender-expansive \u2014 which refers to someone with a more flexible range of gender identity or expression than typically associated with the binary gender system.",
      "The number of victims is likely higher because many deaths often aren't reported or are misreported, or misgendering of the victims leads to delays in their identification.",
      "The Human Rights Campaign said there was a slight increase from the previous year, when it identified at least 33 transgender victims of violence.",
      "A large number of the victims tracked over the past year were young or people of color, with Black transgender women making up half of the 36 identified. The youngest victim identified was 14-year-old Pauly Likens of Pennsylvania.",
      "Two-thirds of the fatalities involved a firearm, the organization said. Nearly a third of the victims with a known killer were killed by an intimate partner, a friend or a family member.",
      "This year\u2019s remembrance follows an election where advocates say victories by President-elect Donald Trump and other Republican candidates who focused on issues like transgender athletes dealt a setback to trans people\u2019s rights.",
      "It also follows a wave of measures enacted in Republican states this year restricting the rights of transgender people, especially youth.",
      "Half the states have banned gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments next month in a lawsuit challenging Tennessee's ban.",

      "Most polio cases this year were reported in the restive southwestern Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces bordering Afghanistan, where 23 confirmed cases have surfaced, according to data from the World Health Organization. That\u2019s up from six cases in 2023.",
      "Hamid Jafari, the WHO director for the Eastern Mediterranean, said last week the forced repatriation of Afghans from Pakistan was a major setback to polio eradication and has led to a \u201cmassive and unpredictable movement\u201d of people within the two countries and across borders.",

    "story": [
      "A judge has struck down Wyoming\u2019s overall ban on abortion and its first-in-the nation explicit prohibition on the use of medication to end pregnancy",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- A state judge on Monday struck down Wyoming's overall ban on abortion and its first-in-the-nation explicit prohibition on the use of medication to end pregnancy in line with voters in yet more states voicing support for abortion rights.",
      "Since 2022, Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens has ruled consistently three times to block the laws while they were disputed in court.",
      "The decision marks another victory for abortion rights advocates after voters in seven states passed measures in support of access.",
      "One Wyoming law that Owens said violated women's rights under the state constitution bans abortion except to protect to a pregnant woman's life or in cases involving rape and incest. The other made Wyoming the only state to explicitly ban abortion pills, though other states have instituted de facto bans on the medication by broadly prohibiting abortion.",
      "The laws were challenged by four women, including two obstetricians, and two nonprofit organizations. One of the groups, Wellspring Health Access, opened as the state\u2019s first full-service abortion clinic in years in April 2023 following an arson attack in 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is a wonderful day for the citizens of Wyoming \u2014 and women everywhere who should have control over their own bodies,\" Wellspring Health Access President Julie Burkhart said in a statement.",
      "The recent elections saw voters in Missouri clear the way to undo one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans in a series of victories for abortion rights advocates. Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota, meanwhile, defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment in support of abortion rights, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "The abortion landscape underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion and cleared the way for bans to take effect in most Republican-controlled states.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Nearly every ban has been challenged with a lawsuit. Courts have blocked enforcement of some restrictions, including bans throughout pregnancy in Utah and Wyoming. Judges struck down bans in Georgia and North Dakota in September 2024. Georgia\u2019s Supreme Court ruled the next month that the ban there can be enforced while it considers the case.",
      "In the Wyoming case, the women and nonprofits who challenged the laws argued that the bans stood to harm their health, well-being and livelihoods, claims disputed by attorneys for the state. They also argued the bans violated a 2012 state constitutional amendment saying competent Wyoming residents have a right to make their own health care decisions.",
      "As she had done with previous rulings, Owens found merit in both arguments. The abortion bans \u201cwill undermine the integrity of the medical profession by hamstringing the ability of physicians to provide evidence-based medicine to their patients,\u201d Owens ruled.",
      "The abortion laws impede the fundamental right of women to make health care decisions for an entire class of people \u2014 those who are pregnant \u2014 in violation of the constitutional amendment, Owens ruled.",
      "Wyoming voters approved the amendment amid fears of government overreach following approval of the federal Affordable Care Act and its initial requirements for people to have health insurance.",
      "Attorneys for the state argued that health care, under the amendment, didn\u2019t include abortion. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon, whose administration has defended the laws passed in 2022 and 2023, did not immediately return an email message Monday seeking comment.",
      "Both sides wanted Owens to rule on the lawsuit challenging the abortion bans rather than allow it to go to trial in the spring. A three-day bench trial before Owens was previously set, but won\u2019t be necessary with this ruling."

      "Millions of Americans are looking for 2025 coverage now during annual enrollment windows for Medicare Advantage plans and individual insurance. Plus, many employers are telling their workers about their coverage plans for next year too.",
      "Insurers selling Medicare Advantage plans are dangling coverage with $0 premiums, and individual insurance marketplaces created through the Affordable Care Act offer tax credits to help with the premium or cost of coverage.",
      "Here are other factors to consider beyond price.",
      "This is the annual amount a patient pays for many covered services before the insurer starts paying a portion of the bill. Plans with low premiums can come with deductibles well over $1,000 for individuals and a few thousand dollars for families.",
      "Shoppers should look at the size of the individual deductible and understand where it applies. Regular visits to a specialist can lead to some hefty patient bills.",
      "Deductibles are different from copayments or copays. Those are flat amounts that a patient pays for a covered service or doctor visit. Copays typically do not count toward paying off a deductible.",
      "Insurers form networks of covered doctors and health systems. Some plans may provide no coverage for care sought outside those networks.",
      "The federal government\u2019s website for finding insurance plans makes it easy to filter for covered doctors and hospitals when looking for plans, said Emily Bremer, president of a St. Louis-based independent insurance agency, The Bremer Group.",
      "Bremer says shoppers should think about more than whether their doctors are in the network. They also should also consider which hospital system they would want to visit if a big emergency happens.",
      "Insurance plans come with formularies, or lists of covered drugs, that vary by plan. Those lists often group drugs in tiers with different costs for the patient.",
      "Shoppers should check to see how a plan will cover the regular prescriptions they already take.",
      "Don\u2019t immediately rule out the plan if the bill would be too high. Help may be available. Drugmakers often have coupons or discount programs that can cover patient costs as long as the drug has coverage, Bremer said. Websites like GoodRx also may be an option for getting a price break.",
      "\u201cIf you take a lot of stuff and see a lot of doctors \u2026 it can be really hard to find one perfect plan that\u2019s going to cover everything,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you have to make choices.\u201d",
      "This is the portion of a bill the patient is responsible for after meeting the deductible. It\u2019s a percentage that can vary. Usually plans with lower premiums leave patients with bigger coinsurance.",
      "Coinsurance payments can hurt, so it\u2019s important to know the percentage and the risk you face.",
      "For instance, a childbirth by cesarean section may generate a $25,000 bill. A patient responsible for a $1,000 deductible and then 20% of the remaining bill through coinsurance could pay $5,800 of that total.",
      "\u201cMost people will focus on the deductible and forget about the coinsurance, and they should not,\u201d Bremer said. \u201c(It) can really sneak up on you when you have a large claim.\u201d",
      "People with low incomes may qualify for help with some of these out-of-pocket expenses through cost-sharing reductions found in the ACA marketplaces.",
      "Health insurers will start handling all costs for covered, in-network care once you reach a plan\u2019s out-of-pocket maximum for patient spending. That can vary by plan.",
      "For coverage sold on the ACA marketplace, that annual maximum cannot be more than $9,200 for individuals and $18,400 for families next year.",
      "Those who reach this level of spending may only see temporary relief. Patient spending totals that count toward that out-of-pocket maximum generally reset at the start of every calendar year or if you switch plans during the year.",

      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Kansas has promised to provide more hospital beds for mentally ill criminal defendants to settle a federal lawsuit filed over defendants waiting months for evaluations of whether they were fit for a trial.",
      "The agreement between state officials and representatives of five defendants requires the state to \u201cuse its best efforts\u201d to open a new psychiatric hospital by January 2027 in Wichita, the state's largest city. Officials also must seek funding from the Kansas Legislature to reopen a previously closed 30-bed unit at its psychiatric hospital in Larned in western Kansas, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.",
      "The agreement was announced this week by the two groups pursuing the lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and the National Police Accountability Project, based in the Seattle area. The groups sued in 2022 on behalf of attorneys for four defendants and the mother of a fifth. The accused were identified only by their initials.",
      "The state operates two psychiatric hospitals, but only the one in Larned has a unit for evaluating whether mentally ill criminal defendants can understand their cases and participate in their own defense. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Larned State Hospital has had fewer than 80 beds for defendants awaiting evaluation.",
      "The state Department for Aging and Disability Services, which runs the Larned facility, acknowledged before the lawsuit was filed that defendants were waiting an average of about 11 months to be evaluated. The lawsuit said defendants remained in county jails that weren't providing adequate treatment, making the inmates' conditions worse and violating their rights. The lawsuit also said the state was violating the federal Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against people with mental health problems.",
      "\u201cThis settlement is more than a legal agreement; it\u2019s a lifeline for those who have been lost in the system, a promise that their dignity and humanity will no longer be ignored,\u201d said Lauren Bonds, the police accountability group's executive director.",
      "One of the five defendants covered by the lawsuit had been held in a county jail for 13 months facing criminal threat charges when the lawsuit was filed. That's longer than the maximum prison sentence for a conviction on that charge.",
      "\u201cRemaining in the jail environment is devastating and deeply harmful even for those whose mental health is not in question, and condemning Kansans to languish across the state in their county jails was contradictory to our values of justice,\" said Monica Bennett, the ACLU of Kansas' legal director.",
      "State officials argued that they already had been addressing the long waits. The state began having Larned State Hospital officials operate a mobile evaluation unit in 2019; and in 2022, the Legislature passed a law to allow other qualified hospitals and organizations to examine criminal defendants.",
      "The state and Wichita's home county hope to start construction early next year on a secure, $101.5 million psychiatric hospital with 104 beds, half of them set aside for the state. Federal COVID-19 relief dollars provided part of the funding.",
      "KDADS spokesperson Cara Sloan-Ramos said the department and Gov. Laura Kelly are committed to reducing wait times.",
      "Republican state Rep. Stephen Owens, chair of the House committee handling criminal justice issues, was pleased that the state could settle the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly been aware of this issue and have been working on solutions,\" Owens said Tuesday."

      "The secessionist campaign in southeastern Nigeria dates back to the 1960s when the short-lived Republic of Biafra fought and lost a civil war from 1967 to 1970 to become independent from the West African country. An estimated 1 million people died in the conflict, many from starvation.",
      "Nigerian authorities have accused Ekpa of using social media to instigate violence by his followers in Nigeria, many of them young people.",
      "Police in Finland said the investigation involves international cooperation.",
      "Nigerian authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "For many years Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, with at least 210 million people, has been wracked by violence related to the activities of armed extremist groups. Most recently, social protests were held over a worsening cost-of-living crisis and alleged bad governance."

      "HONG KONG -- Former publisher Jimmy Lai denied that he asked a colleague to draft a list of potential sanction targets in his second day of testimony Thursday at his landmark national security trial in Hong Kong.",
      "The 77-year-old founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily pro-democracy newspaper is being tried on charges of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications. He was arrested in 2020 in a political crackdown following massive anti-government protests in 2019. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.",
      "The testimony highlighted WhatsApp conversations between Lai and Apple Daily\u2019s ex-associate publisher Chan Pui-man. She was one of six former Apple Daily executives who pleaded guilty to conspiring with Lai to call for sanctions or a blockade or to engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.",
      "Lai's lawyer Steven Kwan showed the messages in court after Chan earlier in the trial said that Lai had suggested the newspaper prepare a sanction list after then-President Donald Trump signed a directive seeking to punish those the U.S. government determines have helped to curtail Hong Kong\u2019s civil liberties.",
      "Lai said Thursday he did not write that message and had just copied and pasted the text he received from a person he suspected was connected with the White House. He said he did not read the full text thoroughly before forwarding it. He said the text \"sounds so foreign to me.\"",
      "Kwan said Lai sent the same message to several pro-democracy politicians, including Lee Wing-tat. Asked whether he intended to ask Lee to work up such a list, Lai answered \u201cthat would be ridiculous.\u201d",
      "After the security law was enacted in June 2020, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Hong Kong officials, accusing them of cooperating with Beijing\u2019s effort to undermine autonomy and crack down on freedom in the city.",
      "Authorities have used the law to prosecute Lai and other leading activists. Under the threat of the law, dozens of civil society groups disbanded and some other activists were forced into self-exile. Apple Daily closed in 2021 following the arrests of some of its senior managers.",
      "Critics say the drastic political changes reflect the freedoms promised to be kept intact in the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997 were shrinking. But Beijing and Hong Kong governments said the law restored the city's stability following the 2019 protests.",
      "The court also heard Lai had reminded his staff working on international news not to go against Trump in 2020 when they were hoping Trump would do something to stop the national security law. Lai said he did not interfere with the way those journalists worked until the law loomed.",
      "On Wednesday, asked how he thought Trump could help, Lai said \u201ca call to China, a call to Xi Jinping, whatever,\u201d referring to the Chinese president. He said his newspaper would not be able to survive under the law but he never communicated with Trump.",
      "The trial will continue on Friday."

The announcement came as health officials in the Gaza Strip said the death toll from the 13-month-old war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 44,000.",
      "The warrant marked the first time that a sitting leader of a major Western ally has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by a global court of justice.

      "At the the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, Najat Rochdi urged all countries and parties with influence \u201cto prevent Syria being further swept into a broader conflagration.\u201d",
      "In the current escalating climate, Rochdi said, \u201cOnce again, Israeli airstrikes on Syria have increased significantly, both in frequency and scope.\u201d",
      "He pointed to Wednesday\u2019s strike near Palmyra that killed dozens, which was \u201clikely the deadliest Israeli strike in Syria to date.\u201d Israel says its targets are linked to militants from Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah or Palestinian Islamic Jihad, but Rochdi said there have been civilian casualties.",
      "He said Israeli strikes on residential areas in the capital Damascus as well as on bridges, roads and border crossings have further hindered civilians fleeing the war in Lebanon and disrupted essential imports and exports. Edem Wosornu, the U.N. humanitarian office\u2019s operations director, said that since late September 540,000 people have arrived in Syria from Lebanon, an estimated two-thirds of them Syrians.",
      "In parallel, Rochdi said, the United States struck what it said were Iran-backed militias in response to armed drone attacks on its bases in northeast Syria.",
      "He said northeast Syria has also seen \u201cits most serious escalation during 2024\u201d from Turkish airstrike against what Ankara said were Kurdish militant targets which resulted in civilian casualties. They followed an Oct. 23 terrorist attack in Ankara.",
      "In rebel-controlled northwest Syria, Rochdi said there has been \u201ca worrying uptick in pro-government drone and artillery attacks\u201d alongside attacks involving the main insurgent group in the region, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.",

He demanded the immediate improvement of security and conditions throughout Gaza to allow the safe and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid \u201cthrough lawful means.\u201d",
      "Israel says it puts no limit on the supplies permitted into Gaza, and it blames the U.N. distribution system. But Israel\u2019s official figures show the amount of aid it has let in has plunged since the beginning of October. The U.N has blamed Israeli military restrictions, along with widespread lawlessness that has led to theft of aid shipments.",
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House fundamentally rejects the International Criminal Court\u2019s decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday.",

      "However, a 30-day Biden administration deadline came and went earlier this month for Israel to meet specific U.S. targets to improve its treatment of Palestinian civilians in Gaza trapped in the war.

      "Eli Feldstein, a former media adviser to Netanyahu, was charged Thursday with leaking classified information with the intent of harming state security and obstruction of justice.",
      "The leaked documents are said to have formed the basis of a widely discredited article in the London-based Jewish Chronicle \u2014 which was later withdrawn \u2014 suggesting Hamas planned to spirit hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, and an article in Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper that said Hamas was drawing out the hostage talks as a form of psychological warfare on Israel.",
      "Critics say the leaks were aimed at giving Netanyahu political cover as the case-fire talks ground to a halt. Some have accused Netanyahu of resisting a deal in to preserve his governing coalition, which includes hard-line members who have threatened to bring down the government if he makes concessions to Hamas.",
      "The leaks came at a time of public uproar over the deaths of six hostages who were killed by their Hamas captors as Israeli soldiers were closing in.",
      "The indictment said the leaks were meant \u201cto create media influence on the public discourse in Israel in regards to the handling of the hostage situation, after the news of the murder of six hostages.\u201d",

      "According to Israeli media reports, Erlich was not on active duty when he was shot, but was wearing a military uniform and had a weapon. The army said he was a reservist with the rank of major and identified him as a \u201cfallen soldier\u201d when it announced his death.",
      "Erlich was a well-known West Bank settler and researcher of Jewish history. Media reports said Erlich was permitted to enter Lebanon to explore a local archaeological site.",

      "The European Union's foreign policy chief has underlined that the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas officials are a legal and not political matter, and that they are binding on all 27 EU member countries and other signatories to the ICC to implement.",
      "\u201cThe tragedy in Gaza has to stop,\" Josep Borrell told reporters during a visit to Jordan. \u201cIt is not a political decision. It is the decision of an international court of justice, and the decision of the court has to be respected, and implemented.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis decision is a binding decision on all state parties of the court, which include all members of the European Union,\" he added.",

      "\u201cToday, combating impunity is our priority. We ratified the ICC Statute in 2000 and have consistently supported the court\u2019s actions. Our response will align with these principles,\u201d Christophe Lemoine told reporters at a press conference.",
      "Lemoine added that the warrants were \u201ca complex legal issue ... It\u2019s a situation that requires a lot of legal precautions.\u201d",
      "In Italy, the foreign and justice ministries didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails seeking comment about whether Italy, an ICC member which hosted the Rome conference that gave birth to the court, would honor the arrest warrant.",

      "In a post on X, he said the international court \u201chas chosen the side of terror and evil over democracy and freedom, and turned the very system of justice into a human shield for Hamas\u2019 crimes against humanity.\"",
      "Israel Katz, Israel\u2019s new defense minister, said the decision was \u201ca moral disgrace, entirely tainted by antisemitism, and drags the international judicial system to an unprecedented low.\u201d He said it \u201cserves Iran, the head of the snake, and its proxies.\u201d",
      "Benny Gantz, a retired general and political rival to Netanyahu, also condemned the decision, saying it showed \u201cmoral blindness\u201d and was a \u201cshameful stain of historic proportion that will never be forgotten.\u201d",
      "Hamas has welcomed the decision by the International Criminal Court to issue warrants against Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant, calling it an \u201cimportant and historic precedent\u201d after what it said was decades of injustice at the hands of a \u201cfascist occupation.\u201d",
      "The statement did not refer to the warrants issued for the militant group\u2019s own leaders.",
      "Hamas called on all nations to \u201ccooperate with the court in bringing the Zionist war criminals, Netanyahu and Gallant, to justice, and to work immediately to stop the crimes of genocide against innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip.\u201d",

      "Associated Press footage showed a crowd of hundreds pushing and shouting outside a bakery in the central city of Deir al-Balah on Thursday. The day before the reopening, the price of a bag of 15 loaves of pita bread had climbed above $13.",

      "The amount of aid entering Gaza plunged in October as Israel launched a major offensive in the isolated north, where experts say famine may be underway.",
      "Hunger is widespread across the territory, even in central Gaza where aid groups have more access. Humanitarian organizations say Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order make it difficult to deliver assistance.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive, launched after Hamas\u2019 October 2023 attack, has displaced around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million people. Hundreds of thousands are crammed into tent camps with little in the way of public services and are reliant on international food aid.",

      "THE HAGUE \u2014 The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas officials, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the war in Gaza and the October 2023 attacks that triggered Israel\u2019s offensive in the Palestinian territory.",
      "The decision turns Netanyahu and the others into internationally wanted suspects and is likely to further isolate them and complicate efforts to negotiate a cease-fire to end the 13-month conflict.",
      "But its practical implications could be limited since Israel and its major ally, the United States, are not members of the court and several of the Hamas officials have been subsequently killed in the conflict.",
      "Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders have previously condemned ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan\u2019s request for the warrants as disgraceful and antisemitic. U.S. President Joe Biden also blasted the prosecutor and expressed support for Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against Hamas. Hamas also slammed the request.",
      "The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 13-month-old war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 44,000, local health officials said Thursday.",
      "The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The Health Ministry said 44,056 people have been killed and 104,268 wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year.",
      "Around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are living in squalid tent camps with little food, water or basic services.",
      "Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas, where they have built tunnels, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure.",
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 A rocket fired from Lebanon killed a man and wounded two others in northern Israel on Thursday, according to the Magen David Adom rescue service.",
      "The service said paramedics found the body of the man in his 30s near a playground in the town of Nahariya, near the border with Lebanon, after a rocket attack on Thursday.",
      "Israel meanwhile struck targets in southern Lebanon and several buildings south of Beirut, the Lebanese capital, after warning people to evacuate."

      "TOKYO -- Japan approved a 39 trillion yen ($250 billion) economic stimulus package Friday centered around initiatives it said were aimed at boosting individual incomes.",
      "The broad plan passed by the Cabinet is the centerpiece of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s recently installed administration. It provides support for digital innovation in the world\u2019s fourth largest economy, subsidies to defray for rising energy costs and help for low-income households.",
      "The plan is designed to instill a sense of \u201cwell being\u201d in the Japanese people, the government said, using the English phrase.",
      "Although Japan has managed weak growth in recent quarters, the long-term outlook for the economy and for the country's standing in the world is uncertain. The plan includes measures to address the country's falling birthrate, which is one of the lowest among developed nations, help for working women and for the elderly.",
      "The plan also calls for raising the annual tax-free salary threshold from the current 1.03 million yen ($6,640). The new ceiling is not yet decided. But a level of 1.78 million yen ($11,500) has been proposed.",
      "\u201cDuring the past 30 years, our nation has overcome various challenges, including deflation and confusion that followed the burst of the \u2018bubble economy,\u2019 the global financial crisis, various natural disasters and the difficulties stemming from the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d documents provided by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said.",
      "The government says signs of growth are evident, but Japan must avoid a negative spiraling of lower prices similar to an earlier protracted bout of deflation and attain sustainable wage increases to support growth.",
      "The package promised help for small and medium-size businesses, for regional economies, farms and creative content like animation.",
      "The ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner lost their majority in the lower house of Parliament last month in an election.",
      "They face the challenge of maneuvering for support among various opposition parties. Some analysts already are projecting that Ishiba\u2019s premiership will be relatively short-lived.",

      "Germany\u2019s popular defense minister has taken himself out of contention to become the country\u2019s next leader",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's popular defense minister has taken himself out of contention to become the country's next leader, clearing the way for Chancellor Olaf Scholz to seek a second term in an early election after a week of arguments that exposed deep divisions in his struggling party.",
      "Scholz and leaders of his center-left Social Democrats vowed Friday to fight their way back from a wide poll deficit ahead of the election, expected to take place Feb. 23. They insisted that the chancellor's three years in power have brought successes and that the Social Democrats weren't responsible for the infighting that pushed his unpopular three-party coalition government to collapse this month.",
      "But a week of very public arguments about who should lead the fightback is widely viewed as having damaged the party further.",
      "Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said in a video Thursday night that he has informed the party leadership he is \u201cnot available for a candidacy for the office of chancellor.\u201d He said that \u201cOlaf Scholz is a strong chancellor and he is the right candidate for chancellor.\u201d",
      "Rather than building momentum from Scholz's firing of his finance minister two weeks ago, which brought down the coalition, party members spent days airing public doubts about the chancellor.",
      "The Social Democrats' rivals already determined who will lead their campaigns. The main opposition center-right Union bloc, which leads in polls, nominated Friedrich Merz as its challenger in September. Scholz\u2019s remaining coalition partners, the Greens, named Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck to head their challenge on Sunday.",
      "While Scholz has made clear for months that he intends to run for a second term and his party's leadership had made clear that it backed him, the lack of a formal nomination created space for persistent speculation that the party might instead choose Pistorius, who enjoys much higher popularity.",
      "On Monday, two influential lawmakers said Scholz\u2019s \u201ccurrent standing is strongly linked\" with the failed coalition, which collapsed in a dispute about how to revive Germany\u2019s stagnant economy, and that they were hearing many compliments for Pistorius. Others weighed in for and against the chancellor, who was at the Group of 20 summit in Brazil as the debate swirled.",
      "Pistorius repeatedly said he stands behind Scholz and gave no indication that he planned to run for chancellor, but also conspicuously didn't rule it out until Thursday. The discussion, he said in the video released by the Social Democrats' leadership, was damaging to the party.",
      "\u201cI did not initiate this discussion, I did not want it and I did not bring myself into discussion for anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe now have a joint responsibility to end this debate.\u201d",
      "The party leadership is expected to formally nominate Scholz as its candidate for chancellor on Monday.",
      "\u201cI know these have been hard days,\u201d party co-leader Lars Klingbeil said Friday at a conference of local Social Democratic politicians in Berlin. \u201cBut if a party can fight, then it is the Social Democrats ... I want to win with you.\u201d",
      "Scholz said it had ultimately been necessary to put an end to his coalition government \u201cbecause there had been too many arguments and too many discussions, which made it difficult to concentrate on the successes.\u201d",
      "Among those, he pointed to Germany's status as Ukraine's biggest military supplier in Europe, along with his often-criticized refusal to supply long-range Taurus cruise missiles over concerns of escalating the war with Russia. \u201cOnly with the Social Democrats will prudence come together with clear support for Ukraine,\u201d he said.",
      "The question of how to reinvigorate Germany's economy is likely to be central to the election campaign.",
      "On Friday, official figures showed that the economy grew only 0.1% in the third quarter compared with the previous three-month period, down from the 0.2% originally reported."

      "A top South Korean official says Russia has supplied air defense missile systems to North Korea in exchange for Pyongyang sending troops",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Russia has supplied air defense missile systems to North Korea in exchange for sending its troops to support Russia's war efforts against Ukraine, a top South Korean official said Friday.",
      "The U.S., South Korea and Ukraine say North Korea sent more than 10,000 troops to Russia in October, some of whom have recently begun engaging in combat on the front lines. North Korea's troop deployment threatens to escalate the war, and what Russia could give to the North in return has been a source of rampant international speculation.",
      "The most alarming development for South Korea and the U.S. would be Russia transferring sophisticated weapons technology that can enhance North Korea's nuclear-capable missiles targeting its rivals. Many experts say, though, that it is unlikely Russia would do this in the initial stage of the North\u2019s troop deployment.",
      "Shin Wonsik, national security adviser for South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, told an SBS TV program Friday that South Korea has found Russia provided missiles and other equipment to help it reinforce its air defense network for Pyongyang, the capital. Shin didn\u2019t say what specific missiles Russia gave to North Korea.",
      "Lee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea, said that Russia has likely sent S-400 long-range surface-to-air missiles, launchers and ground-based radar systems. He said that North Korea is capable of building shorter-range surface-to-air missiles on its own.",
      "The S-400 missile, with a range of 400 kilometers (250 miles), is considered one of Russia\u2019s most advanced anti-aircraft weapons. But Lee questioned how significantly it can boost Pyongyang\u2019s air defense, saying Russian air defense systems have failed to effectively deal with Ukrainian drone assaults.",
      "Many observers say North Korea has likely felt the urgent need to boost its air defense capabilities after it last month accused South Korea of flying drones to scatter propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang. North Korea threatened to take military action if leaflets were again dropped. South Korea\u2019s military has refused to confirm whether or not it was behind the alleged drone flights.",
      "Kim Dae Young, a military expert at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, said it\u2019s possible that the air defense systems North Korea acquired from Russia could include counter-drone equipment.",
      "Kim said that Pyongyang's outdated air defense system would need years of improvement and potentially huge external help to cope with the superior air forces of South Korea and the United States.",
      "Shin said Russia has also appeared to have given economic assistance to North Korea and various military technologies, including those needed for the North's efforts to build a reliable space-based surveillance system. Shin didn\u2019t say whether Russia has already transferred sensitive nuclear and missile technologies to North Korea.",
      "During a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin already said that Moscow was willing to help the North build satellites. North Korea put its first spy satellite into orbit in November last year, but foreign experts question whether that satellite can produce militarily meaningful imagery. The North's attempt to launch a second spy satellite failed in May.",
      "North Korea and Russia have been sharply boosting their military and other cooperation in the face of separate confrontations with the U.S. and its allies. Last month, South Korea's spy agency said that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. The National Intelligence Service said Wednesday that North Korea had recently sent additional artillery systems to Russia.",
      "Earlier this week, North Korea and Russia reached a new agreement for expanding economic cooperation following high-level talks in Pyongyang this week, according to the countries\u2019 state-run media."

      "Legislation for the world's first legal ban on children under 16 using social media has been introduced in Australia's Parliament",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s communications minister introduced a world-first law into Parliament on Thursday that would ban children under 16 from social media, saying online safety was one of parents\u2019 toughest challenges.",
      "Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cThis bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,\u201d she added.",
      "X owner Elon Musk warned that Australia intended to go further, posting on his platform: \u201cSeems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\u201d",
      "The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction.",
      "\u201cFor too many young Australians, social media can be harmful,\" Rowland said. \"Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits.\u201d",
      "Government research found that 95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their \"toughest parenting challenges,\u201d she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she added.",
      "\u201cThis is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we\u2019re in their corner when it comes to supporting their children\u2019s health and wellbeing,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks.",
      "Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users.",
      "\u201cWe are not saying risks don\u2019t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,\u201d she said.",
      "The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages.",
      "In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said.",
      "Age Check Certification Scheme\u2019s chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age.",
      "Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes.",
      "Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said.",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, said with Parliament expected to vote on the bill next week, there might not be time for \u201cmeaningful consultation on the details of the globally unprecedented legislation.\u201d",
      "\"Mainstream digital platforms have strict measures in place to keep young people safe, and a ban could push young people on to darker, less safe online spaces that don't have safety guardrails,\" DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. \u201cA blunt ban doesn't encourage companies to continually improve safety because the focus is on keeping teenagers off the service, rather than keeping them safe when they're on it.\u201d"

      "Pope Francis is warning that the Vatican's troubled pension fund faces a \u201cserious imbalance\u201d and cannot guarantee future obligations without \u201curgent structural\u201d reforms",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis, who has imposed a series of cost-cutting measures across the cash-strapped Vatican, warned Thursday that the city state\u2019s troubled pension fund needs urgent reform to guarantee future obligations.",
      "Vatican employees responded by expressing concern that their compensation might be targeted in any further cost-cutting to shore up the pension system, and asked for the fund's finances to be made public.",
      "In a letter to Vatican department heads and cardinals, Francis said he had named a top economic adviser Cardinal Kevin Farrell as a special administrator for the fund, suggesting that decisive, immediate action was necessary.",
      "The letter was the latest evidence of the Vatican\u2019s precarious financial situation, after years of mismanagement, financial scandals and budget deficits -- all worsened by COVID-19 and the months-long closures of a key source of revenue, the Vatican Museums.",
      "Already, Francis has cut the salaries of cardinals by 10%, suspended some seniority bonuses, trimmed special stipends for Rome-based cardinals and begun charging some market-rate rents for their apartments.",
      "The pension fund has long been the source of particular concern, and in the new letter Francis acknowledged that the current analysis \u201cindicates a serious prospective imbalance in the fund, the size of which tends to expand over time in the absence of intervention.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn concrete terms, this means that the current system is unable to guarantee in the medium term the fulfillment of the pension obligation for future generations,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The Association of Lay Vatican Employees, the closest thing the Vatican has to a labor union, voiced alarm at Francis\u2019 warning about their pensions, insisting that lay employees had already sacrificed enough in his cost-cutting initiatives and that the Vatican leadership should listen to workers\u2019 concerns.",
      "\u201cSalaries have not been indexed to the cost of living, while rent increases for Vatican properties have been related to inflation,\u201d the group said in a statement that also called for the Vatican to make public the pension fund\u2019s balance sheet.",
      "Noting that Francis frequently preaches about the need to give workers dignified wages and pay special attention to the needs of families, the union said employees were \u201cexhausted by cuts and especially by the lack of responses to their legitimate request to be heard.\u201d",
      "The Vatican has some 4,500 employees, around 3,100 of whom work for the Holy See bureaucracy and the rest for the Vatican city state itself, in the museums and other offices that run the territory. The union counts some 700 lay employees.",
      "While Vatican salaries are typically low, the benefits can be attractive to Italian laypeople, including tax-free income and access to a private health system, below-market rents and a tax-free supermarket, gas station, pharmacy and department store.",
      "Lay employees, however, have increasingly been raising their voices about cost cuts and overwork. Earlier this year 49 museum employees filed a class-action lawsuit in the Vatican tribunal about labor woes.",
      "The Holy See ended 2023 with a profit of 45.9 million euros, according to the latest financial statement.",
      "As recently as 2015, the pension fund had insisted it was in sound financial health, and that it was expected to top 500 million euros by the end of 2015 after having started out with the equivalent of 5 million euros in 1993.",
      "Farrell, an Irish-born American who heads the Vatican\u2019s laity and family office, has increasingly been entrusted with the Vatican\u2019s most sensitive financial and administrative issues under Francis. He is the camerlengo, who runs the Holy See after the death of a pope, and heads the investment committee, the commission that deals with the most sensitive \u201creserved\u201d matters facing the church and is the president of the Vatican city state\u2019s supreme court.",

      "Thousands from across the junta-led countries in Africa\u2019s Sahel region were gathering this week in the Nigerien capital of Niamey to condemn what they call the West\u2019s imperialist agenda and to drive support for their military regimes",
      "NIAMEY, Niger -- Thousands from the junta-led countries in Africa\u2019s Sahel region gathered this week in the Nigerien capital of Niamey, with music and cultural displays, to condemn what they called the West's imperialist agenda and to drive support for their military regimes.",
      "Delegates from Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali took part in the three-day conference that ended on Thursday. The junta leaders of the three countries are seeking greater popular support after they deposed democratically elected governments and severed ties with longstanding Western partners such as France, their former colonial ruler, with Russia the new preferred partner.",
      "All three nations are nearing the end of their one-year withdrawal process from the West Africa regional bloc known as ECOWAS, which they accuse of being influenced by France in sanctioning them for the coups and of failing to help address the extremist violence rampant across their shared borders.",
      "Conference delegates \u2013 including pro-junta youth, women and civil society groups as well as allies from across West Africa and beyond \u2014 discussed their countries\u2019 sovereignty as well as economic and security partnerships being forged under the bloc of the three junta-led countries known as the Alliance of Sahel States, or AES.",
      "Major highlights were the three countries' colors and cultures depicted in the attires and just about everything else as well as music performances and songs, beginning with a pro-junta rendition by Nigerien artiste Idi Sarki, who flashed back to the July 2023 coup in the country.",
      "\u201cNigeriens, wake up, we don\u2019t want the French army on our land anymore,\u201d sang Sarki, referring to the French troops asked to leave in the wake of the military takeover in Niger and other countries in the region.",
      "\u201cAfter the colonization, it\u2019s recolonization \u2026 We\u2019ll have to intervene one way or another if we want our energy and economic sovereignty \u2014 we need raw materials from sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d he sang as the ecstatic crowd chorused and waved flags of the three coup-hit countries.",
      "A women\u2019s music group also performed a song dedicated to African youth.",
      "\u201cAfter so many years of suffering, the youths rise today in an awakening of conscience for a fight towards hope and freedom,\u201d said the leader performer, wearing with others a white-and-grey traditional gown and scarf.",
      "Since the coups, the militaries in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso have promised to help address shortcomings that they said inspired them to take over power, such as the deadly violence and economic hardships faced by their citizens.",
      "But the problems have persisted, even worsening in some cases. And in Mali where the junta seized power in 2020, the civilian prime minister appointed by the military was fired on Wednesday after he criticized delays in the election that was to usher in a new government.",
      "Some at the conference, however, expressed optimism that the militaries would deliver long sought-after democratic dividends.",
      "\u201cHow can we live under a so-called democracy, when there are no schools?\u201d asked Ali Moussa, who came from the Central African country of Gabon, where a military junta is also in power. \u201cWe think that times have changed, it is no longer the time to talk about democracy,\u201d he said.",
      "The campaign for sovereignty and anti-imperialism should also extend to other African countries, said Inem Richardson, who came from Burkina Faso where she runs a pan-African library called the Thomas Sankara Center, named for a Marxist military officer who took power in a 1983 coup.",
      "\u201cAll of Africa needs to unite \u2026 the masses should be 100% engaged,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "\u2014-",

      "In an interview with German weekly Der Spiegel published Friday, Merkel said that Trump \u201cis a challenge for the world, particularly for multilateralism.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat awaits us now is really not easy,\u201d she said, because \u201cthe strongest economy in the world stands behind this president\u201d with the dollar as a dominant currency.",
      "Merkel worked with four American presidents while she was German chancellor. She was in power throughout Trump's first term \u2014 easily the most tense period for German-U.S. relations of her 16 years in office, which ended in late 2021.",
      "She recalled as \u201ca typical scene\u201d a famously awkward moment in the Oval Office when she first visited Trump at the White House in March 2017. Photographers shouted \u201chandshake!\u201d and Merkel quietly asked Trump: \u201cDo you want to have a handshake?\u201d There was no response from Trump, who looked ahead with his hands clasped.",
      "\u201cI tried to coax him into a handshake for the photographers because I thought in my constructive way that maybe he hadn't noticed they wanted such a picture,\u201d Merkel was quoted as saying. \u201cBut of course his refusal was calculation.\u201d",
      "The pair did shake hands at other points during the visit.",
      "Asked what a German chancellor should know about dealing with Trump, Merkel said he was very curious and wanted details \u2014 \u201cbut only to read them for his own advantage, to find arguments that strengthen him and weaken others.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more people there were in the room, the greater was his urge to be the winner,\u201d she added. \u201cYou can't chat with him. Every meeting is a competition: you or me.\u201d",
      "Merkel said she felt \u201csorrow\u201d at Trump's victory over Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 presidential election. \u201cIt was already a disappointment for me that Hillary Clinton didn't win in 2016. I would have liked a different outcome.\u201d",
      "The 70-year-old Merkel, a center-right Christian Democrat who has generally kept a low profile since leaving office, is due to release her memoirs next week."

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Twelve people have been arrested in Serbia in connection with a roof collapse earlier this month at a train station in the northern city of Novi Sad that killed 15 people and severely injured two others, prosecutors said Thursday.",
      "The suspects, who have not been identified, face charges of committing criminal acts against public security, causing public danger and irregular construction work, the Higher Prosecutor's Office in Novi Sad said in a statement. They face up to 12 years in prison.",
      "The prosecutor's office first announced that 11 people were arrested. Later on Thursday they said one more person was detained and another one remains at large.",
      "Serbian media reported that Goran Vesic, who resigned as construction minister after the collapse, was among those detained. Vesic said on X he came in voluntarily.",
      "The arrests came after a wave of protests erupted over the tragedy demanding that those responsible be brought to justice and punished. Many in Serbia believe that the roof collapse was the result of corruption and a lack of transparency that led to sloppy work in the renovation of the station building.",
      "Opposition politicians behind the protests said they were skeptical of the announced arrests and called for the case to be handled by organized crime prosecutors.",
      "\u201cThey (prosecutors) have avoided mentioning the deaths of the people and corruption and those are key,\u201d said Borislav Novakovic, a former mayor of Novi Sad. \u201cFor the past 20 days all suspects could influence witnesses, tamper with evidence and alter documentation.\u201d",
      "Opposition lawmakers and other protesters on Wednesday clashed with police outside the court building in Novi Sad for a third day in a row, demanding indictments over the roof collapse and the release from detention of activists who were jailed during earlier rallies.",

      "Former British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has died at age 86",
      "LONDON -- British politician John Prescott, a pugnacious and personable former merchant seaman who rose to the post of deputy prime minister in Tony Blair's Labour government, has died at age 86.",
      "Prescott\u2019s family announced his death on Thursday. They said the politician, who had been suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, died in a care home on Wednesday \u201csurrounded by the love of his family and the jazz music of Marian Montgomery.\u201d",
      "The family said Prescott had \u201cspent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment.\u201d",
      "For a decade, Prescott brought grit, humor and working-class authenticity to the government of the young, polished Blair, who became prime minister in 1997.",
      "\u201cHe was one of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics, one of the most committed and loyal, and definitely the most unusual,\u201d Blair said.",
      "King Charles III said he was saddened to hear of Prescott's death.",
      "\u201cI remember with great fondness his unique and indomitable character, as well as his infectious sense of humor,\u201d the king said.",
      "An amateur boxer in his youth, Prescott had a defining moment when he punched a man who threw an egg at him during the 2001 general election.",
      "The uproar briefly looked like it might harm the Labour Party, and Prescott\u2019s career. But Blair\u2019s response -\u2013 \u201cJohn is John\u201d -\u2013 cemented his folksy status.",
      "\u201cMany of us, all across the country, and the public, were very much on his side during that altercation,\u201d said opposition Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch. She called Prescott a \u201ctitan of British politics\" and \u201cone of this country\u2019s greatest examples of social mobility.\u201d",
      "Born in north Wales in 1938, Prescott left school at the age of 15 and worked as a cruise ship steward before entering politics through the trade union movement \u2014 a once-common route that became less frequent after Blair rebranded the left-leaning party \u201cNew Labour\u201d and shifted its politics toward the center,",
      "Prescott was a proud working-class figure in a country that still has few from that background at the top of politics. He unapologetically liked the finer things in life and was nicknamed \u201cTwo Jags\u201d by the press because he had two Jaguar luxury cars.",
      "The egg-thrower punching incident earned him another nickname: \u201cTwo Jabs.\"",
      "Prescott served as Blair\u2019s deputy between 1997 and 2007. One of his proudest achievements was working with then-U.S. Vice President Al Gore on the landmark Kyoto Protocol climate change agreement in 1997.",
      "Gore said he had \u201cnever worked with anyone in politics \u2014 on my side of the pond or his \u2014 quite like John Prescott.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe fought like hell to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol and was an unwavering champion of climate action for decades to come. I\u2019m forever grateful to John for that commitment to solving the climate crisis and will miss him as a dear friend,\u201d Gore said in a statement.",
      "Prescott helped ease the sometimes tense relationship between Blair and his Treasury chief, Gordon Brown, and acted as a bridge between the party\u2019s traditionalists and Blair\u2019s modernizing faction. Brown said he was key to keeping the party united after Blair\u2019s controversial decision to join the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.",
      "Former Cabinet minister Peter Mandelson, a Blair ally, said Prescott was \u201cthe cement that kept New Labour together.\u201d",
      "Prescott represented his home city of Hull in northern England for four decades. After Labour lost power in 2010 he was made a member of Parliament\u2019s unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords.",
      "Brown, who succeeded Blair as prime minister, described Prescott as a true working-class hero.",
      "\u201cHe wanted the good things in life for everyone and not just himself,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd he showed that Britain can be a country where if you work hard you can fill your potential.\u201d",
      "He is survived by his wife Pauline and sons Johnathan and David."

    "story": [
      "When Jean-Charles de Castelbajac saw Notre Dame cathedral burn in April 2019, he felt compelled to act",
      "PARIS -- When Jean-Charles de Castelbajac watched as Notre Dame cathedral burned in April 2019, he felt compelled to act somehow.",
      "Returning home, the French fashion designer began sketching ideas, imagining the monument\u2019s reconstruction.",
      "So, when the Paris Archbishop\u2019s emissary approached him to design the liturgical garments for the cathedral's reopening next month, Castelbajac \u2014 a believer with personal roots with the church \u2014 felt the moment transcended mere coincidence.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s bigger than a job. It\u2019s a bit mysterious \u2026 mysterious,\u201d Castelbajac said, his eyes brimming with wonder as he previewed some of the 2,000 colorful pieces for 700 celebrants at his Paris home. \u201cIt's a calling. To be called like that is synchronicity.\u201d",
      "This duty, as he calls it, led to a collection of work crafted in collaboration with the esteemed artisans of 19M studio. The garments, often in thick off-white Scottish wool gabardine, blend his signature eye-popping pop-art aesthetic with a reverence for the cathedral\u2019s centuries-old legacy with medieval touches.",
      "The unorthodox designs are fun, modern \u2014 and perhaps shockingly minimalist.",
      "They undoubtedly break with the richly embellished styles associated with the cathedral's near-900-year-old liturgical garb. At their center is a large gold cross, accented by debris fragments of vivid color-blocked red, blue, yellow, and green velvet.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that is exploded that reconstructs itself,\u201d Castelbajac said, likening the dissipated shards coming together to the cathedral\u2019s own rebirth.",
      "The commission was not subject to an open call. Instead, Castelbajac was handpicked by the Catholic leadership, due to his history of designing for the church.",
      "In 1997, he created the rainbow-colored robes worn by Pope John Paul II for World Youth Day in Paris, garments later enshrined in Notre Dame\u2019s treasury as a relic. That connection carried a special weight during the fire.",
      "\u201cAs I watched the fire, I was thinking, \u2018Are the relics burning? Are the relics safe?\u2019 So my link was not just material. It\u2019s really a strong spiritual link,\u201d he said.",
      "For Castelbajac, 74, the memory of those two hours in 2019 spent watching the fire with his wife amid people praying on their knees still evokes both grief and determination.",
      "\u201cIt was not Notre Dame burning. It was hope burning. It was spirituality burning. It was such an intense moment \u2026 I was thinking, what can I do?\u201d he said.",
      "The vestments, which will be worn in liturgies permanently \u2014 forever, as Castelbajac put it \u2014 carry a sense of continuity with his past work. The designs are a variation on the pontiff\u2019s robes, infused with Castelbajac\u2019s signature aesthetic: bright, almost childlike hues that evoke optimism.",
      "Castelbajac\u2019s fascination with color began as a child in a military boarding school in Normandy, an experience he recalled as stifling and gray. \u201cIt was the absolute loneliness. It was colorless,\u201d he said.",
      "For the young boy, color became a lifeline.",
      "\u201cColor was like my teddy bear, my transitional element in a world of conflict. Each morning, there was the stained glass in the church and the coats of arms in the refectory that filled my world with primary colors,\u201d he explained.",
      "This obsession would define his career, earning him a reputation as a provocateur in the fashion world.",
      "Castelbajac\u2019s creations have dressed pop culture royalty for decades: Madonna in her teddy bear coat, Beyonc\u00e9 in sequins, Rihanna in a Donald Duck costume. Collaborating with Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, and Jean-Michel Basquiat, he fused art and fashion into a playground of exuberance.",
      "While his designs have graced runways and music icons, Castelbajac\u2019s work for Notre Dame strikes a different, more personal chord.",
      "The playful vestments might raise eyebrows among traditional Catholics, but he has no doubt about the faith Notre Dame\u2019s leadership placed in him. \u201cMaybe I have the trust of the archbishop,\u201d he mused, reflecting on the \u201ccarte blanche\u201d he said he received for his designs.",
      "This combination produced a modern-looking body of work that reflects the unity, hope, and rebirth symbolized by Notre Dame itself\u2014just like the phoenix-like rooster gleaming like fire atop the newly constructed spire.",
      "When the cathedral reopens on the weekend of Dec. 7-8, Castelbajac hopes the vestments will be viewed by the world as a testament to renewal and the \u201cpower of color\u201d to heal and inspire."

      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has announced that his government plans to retire all coal and other fossil fuel-powered power plants within 15 years, while drastically boosting renewable energy capacity",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has announced that his government plans to retire all coal and other fossil fuel-power plants while drastically boosting the country's renewable energy capacity in the next 15 years.",
      "\u201cIndonesia is rich in geothermal resources, and we plan to phase out coal-fired and all fossil-fueled power plants within the next 15 years. Our plan includes building over 75 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity during this time,\u201d Subianto said at the summit of leaders of the Group of 20 major economies in Brazil on Tuesday.",
      "Subianto also said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d Indonesia would achieve net zero emissions by 2050, a decade sooner than the country's previous 2060 commitment.",
      "Experts and environmental activists welcomed the announcements but hedged their expectations.",
      "Indonesia is one of the world's largest producers and consumers of heavily polluting coal and most of its energy comes from fossil fuels. Over 250 coal-fired power plants are currently powering the country and more are being built, including at new industrial parks where globally-important materials like nickel, cobalt and aluminum are being processed.",
      "In 2022, Indonesia\u2019s energy sector emitted over 650 million tons of carbon dioxide, the world\u2019s seventh highest level, according to the International Energy Agency. Population and economic growth are expected to triple the country\u2019s energy consumption by 2050.",
      "Experts said that real changes need to be implemented on the ground in Indonesia quickly if the president is serious about his plans.",
      "\u201cIf the government is serious about speeding up the energy transition, efforts to shut down coal-fired power plants and prevent new permits for the construction of coal-fired power plants must be clear so that partners, investors and financial institution can see the pipeline and progress,\u201d Bhima Yudhistira, executive director of the Indonesia-based Center of Economic and Law Studies, said in written statement to The Associated Press.",
      "While Subianto's predecessor, Joko Widodo, was in office Indonesia pledged to phase out \u2014 or at least drastically reduce \u2014 the use of coal by agreeing to numerous schemes with international stakeholders.",
      "That included the largest $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership deal so far. The deal has struggled to make changes on the ground but is still underway. JETP deals still fall short of the estimated trillions of dollars that are needed to develop infrastructure needed to transition to renewable energy and put existing coal-fired power plants into early retirement.",
      "In Brazil, Prabowo also spoke about Indonesia's vast renewable energy potential from solar, hydropower, geothermal, wind and other sources. Only 14.5% of these renewable sources are currently tapped, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Current installed capacity of renewable energy in Indonesia is about 13 gigawatts, or less than 15% of total generation capacity.",
      "\u201cWe are committed to renewable and green energy. We are blessed with many resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have other renewable energy sources, and that is why we are very optimistic that we can achieve (net) zero before 2050.\"",
      "A spokesperson from Indonesia's state electric utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara, said the corporation is \u201cfully committed\u201d to supporting the renewable energy target but admitted the transition will bring challenges.",
      "\u201cThere is a mismatch between the locations of large-scale renewable energy resources, such as hydro and geothermal, and the epicenters of our industry,\u201d PLN spokesperson Gregorius Adi Trianto said in written statement to AP. \u201cWe also face the challenge of intermittency in solar and wind power. So we are developing a green smart grid to increase wind and solar capacity almost eightfold ... by 2040 to enhance our energy security.\u201d",

      "The United Nations says more aid workers, health care staffers, delivery personnel and other humanitarians have been killed in 2024 than in any other single year",
      "GENEVA -- More aid workers, health care staffers, delivery personnel and other humanitarians have been killed in 2024 than in any other single year, the United Nations reported Friday.",
      "Bloodshed in the Middle East has been the single-biggest cause of the 281 deaths among humanitarians globally this year, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.",
      "\u201cBefore the year is even over, 2024 has become the deadliest on record for humanitarian personnel worldwide,\u201d OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said. He told reporters in Geneva the figure surpassed the previous record of 280 deaths for the whole of last year.",
      "Humanitarians \"are working courageously and selflessly in places like Gaza, Sudan, Lebanon, Ukraine and so on. They show the best humanity has to offer, and they are getting killed in return \u2014 in record numbers,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThese numbers will send shockwaves around the humanitarian community, especially on the front lines of the response,\u201d he added.",
      "The U.N. said the figures come from the Aid Worker Security Database, a U.S.-funded project run by a Britain-based group called Humanitarian Outcomes.",
      "A total of 268 of the humanitarians killed \u2014 including from non-U.N. organizations like the Red Cross and Red Crescent \u2014 were national staff, while 13 were international staff.",
      "Some 230 aid workers have been killed in occupied Palestinian areas, the database showed Friday. It did not break out whether that was Gaza or the West Bank.",
      "Laerke said the threats to aid workers \u201cextend beyond Gaza, with high levels of violence, kidnappings injuries, harassment and arbitrary detention\" reported in Afghanistan, Congo, South Sudan, Sudan, Ukraine, Yemen and elsewhere.",
      "OCHA said a total of 333 humanitarians have been killed since the latest conflict between Israel and the militant Hamas group erupted when the militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250.",
      "The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 13-month-old war has surpassed 44,000, local health officials said Thursday. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence."

      "The only emperor penguin known to have swum from Antarctica to Australia has been released at sea 20 days after he waddled ashore on a popular tourist beach",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The only emperor penguin known to have swum from Antarctica to Australia was released at sea 20 days after he waddled ashore on a popular tourist beach, officials said Friday.",
      "The adult male was found on Nov. 1 on Ocean Beach sand dunes in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia \u2014 about 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, the Western Australia state government said. He was released from a Parks and Wildlife Service boat on Wednesday.",
      "The boat traveled for several hours from the state\u2019s most southerly city of Albany before the penguin was released into the Southern Ocean, but the government didn't give the distance in its statement.",
      "He had been cared for by registered wildlife caregiver Carol Biddulph, who named him Gus after the first Roman emperor Augustus.",
      "\u201cI really didn\u2019t know whether he was going to make it to begin with because he was so undernourished,\u201d Biddulph said in video recorded before the bird\u2019s release but released by the government on Friday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll miss Gus. It\u2019s been an incredible few weeks, something I wouldn\u2019t have missed,\u201d she added.",
      "Biddulph said she had found from caring for other species of lone penguins that mirrors were an important part of their rehabilitation by providing a comforting sense of company.",
      "\u201cHe absolutely loves his big mirror and I think that has been crucial in his well-being. They\u2019re social birds and he stands next to the mirror most of the time,\u201d she said.",
      "Gus gained weight in her care, from 21.3 kilograms (47 pounds) when he was found to 24.7 kilograms (54 pounds). He stands 1 meter (39 inches) tall. A healthy male emperor penguin can weigh more than 45 kilograms (100 pounds).",
      "The largest penguin species has never been reported in Australia before, University of Western Australia research fellow Belinda Cannell said, though some had reached New Zealand, nearly all of which is further south than Western Australia.",
      "The government said with the Southern Hemisphere summer approaching, it had been time-crucial to return Gus to the ocean where he could thermoregulate.",
      "Emperor penguins have been known to cover up to 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) on foraging journeys that last up to a month, the government said.",

      "Congolese police have arrested six people over a break-in and vandalism earlier this week at the mausoleum of the country\u2019s assassinated independence leader Patrice Lumumba in Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa",
      "KINSHASA, Congo -- Congolese police have arrested six people over a break-in and vandalism earlier this week at the mausoleum of the country's assassinated independence leader Patrice Lumumba in Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa.",
      "During the break-in on Monday, a case containing a single gold-capped tooth \u2014 the only part of the former leader that remained after his assassination \u2014 was broken by the vandals, according to authorities. It wasn't immediately clear what happened to the tooth.",
      "Police announced the six arrests late Wednesday and said they were still looking for two more suspects.",
      "Jacquemin Shabani, the country's interior minister, told reporters that Lumumba's tooth was not damaged during the break-in.",
      "\u201cWe assure that the relic is secure and it is protected,\u201d the minister said, without offering more information.",
      "The return of Lumumba\u2019s tooth from former colonizer Belgium in 2022 had been celebrated around Congo, with the tooth taken around the vast country so people could pay their respects.",
      "\u201cWe are happy that the perpetrators of this act have been arrested,\u201d Jean-Jacques Lumumba, one of Lumumba\u2019s grandsons, told The Associated Press over the phone.",

      "Lumumba is widely hailed as the nationalist activist who helped end colonial rule. He became Congo\u2019s first prime minister and was seen as one of Africa\u2019s most promising new leaders, but he was assassinated within a year in 1961.",
      "His body was dismembered and dissolved with acid in an apparent effort to keep any grave from becoming a pilgrimage site.",
      "For many in Congo, Lumumba is a symbol of the positive developments the country could have achieved after its independence. Instead, it became mired in decades of dictatorship that drained its vast mineral riches.",
      "A military coup toppled Lumumba, who was arrested, jailed and later killed. His assassination, blamed on separatists, cleared the way for the rise of Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled the country he later renamed Zaire for decades with support from Western powers until his death in 1997.",
      "Even though Lumumba\u2019s killers were Congolese, questions have persisted over the complicity of Belgium and the United States because of his perceived Communist ties.",
      "His one remaining tooth was kept by the Belgian police commissioner who oversaw the destruction of his body. In 2016, the tooth was seized by Belgian officials from the police commissioner\u2019s daughter.",
      "The tooth was returned to Congo after the visit of Belgium\u2019s King Philippe, who expressed regrets for his nation\u2019s abuses in Congo when it was a Belgian colony."

His companies\u2019 stocks plunged up to 20% in value Thursday after he was indicted by U.S. prosecutors on charges that he duped investors in a massive solar energy project in India by concealing that it was being facilitated by bribes.",
      "In an indictment unsealed in New York, Adani, 62, was charged with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud. Seven other executives connected to Adani's business empire also face charges. The indictment alleges a scheme to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials in India.",
      "The full impact of the case on Adani's businesses is not yet known. Kenya's president on Thursday canceled the tycoon's multimillion dollar deals for airport modernization and energy projects.",
      "The Adani group, meanwhile, decided not to proceed with a proposed U.S. dollar-denominated bond offering. Adani Renewables announced the decision in letters to the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India.",
      "In a statement, the group said the allegations against directors of Adani Green \u201care baseless and denied.\u201d",
      "U.S. prosecutors said they brought the charges to protect investors. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller said in statement that the Department of Justice \"will continue to aggressively prosecute corrupt, deceptive, and obstructive conduct that violates U.S. law, no matter where in the world it occurs.\u201d",
      "None of the people charged in the U.S. have been arrested, prosecutors said.",
      "Adani is the son of a middle-class family in Ahmedabad in western India\u2019s Gujarat state. He quit college to become a diamond trader in Mumbai, India\u2019s financial capital. In the 1980s, he started importing plastics before establishing Adani Enterprises, which traded in everything from shoes to buckets and remains his flagship company.",
      "India opened up its economy in the 1990s and a new middle class emerged as tens of millions of people escaped poverty, prompting Adani to bet on infrastructure and coal.",
      "Adani\u2019s first big project, the Mundra port in Gujarat, opened in 1998 and is now India\u2019s largest. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. is India\u2019s biggest private port operator. Within a decade, Adani became India\u2019s largest developer and operator of coal mines. According to Adani Power\u2019s website, it has expanded to Australia and Indonesia and has ambitions to become one of the world's largest mining groups.",
      "India's second-largest conglomerate operates airports in major cities, builds roads, generates electricity, manufactures defense equipment, develops agricultural drones, sells cooking oil and runs a media outlet.",
      "Adani\u2019s net worth shot up about 2,000% in recent years as share prices for his listed companies soared.",
      "Before Modi took office, Adani was friendly with the rival Congress Party, which governed Gujarat state when many of his early projects began. Adani has been \u201cclose to every politician in power,\u201d R N Bhaskar, a journalist who wrote a biography on Adani, told The Associated Press.",
      "Adani\u2019s supporters say he has cleverly aligned the group\u2019s priorities with those of the government by investing in key industries like renewable energy, defense, and agriculture. His projects overseas, in strategically important countries like neighboring Sri Lanka, help New Delhi compete with rival Beijing in the region.",
      "Adani is considered close to the Hindu nationalist government. The political opposition has long accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of having close ties with the tycoon. They both hail from the western state of Gujarat.",
      "The businessman's critics say much of his success stems from his close ties to the government and Modi. For example, they have accused the government of adjusting bidding rules to make it easier for Adani to win contracts to operate airports. The company denies this, saying contracts were won fairly.",
      "Opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi called for Adani\u2019s arrest and has accused Modi of protecting him.",
      "India\u2019s main opposition also demanded a parliamentary committee probe into Adani Group dealings, which Jairam Ramesh, a leader of the Congress Party, said are causing \"growing monopolization in key sectors of the Indian economy, fueling inflation, and posing huge foreign policy challenges as well.\u201d",
      "Last year, the Adani companies lost $68 billion in market value after short-selling firm Hindenburg Research accused Adani of \u201cpulling the largest con in corporate history,\u201d triggering a massive sell-off of the group's stocks.",

      "Brazil\u2019s former President Jair Bolsonaro has been a target for investigations since his early days in office, and the swarm of cases since his failed reelection bid in 2022 has left him in ever-deeper legal jeopardy",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro has been a target for investigations since his early days in office, and the swarm of cases since his failed reelection bid in 2022 has left him in ever-deeper legal jeopardy.",
      "In the latest indictment Thursday, he was accused of attempting a coup to keep himself in the presidency. In another case, the electoral court ruled the far-right leader ineligible to run for office until 2030.",
      "There are dozens of other probes that could produce criminal charges at low-level courts, where he could appeal any eventual conviction. But the country's Supreme Court will have the final say regarding more than five in-depth investigations, including into the alleged coup attempt, which could land the former president behind bars or under house arrest.",
      "Bolsonaro has denied wrongdoing in all of the cases, and his allies have alleged they are political persecution, while recognizing the severity of the legal risks on multiple fronts.",
      "Here's a look at the biggest threats and where they stand:",
      "Federal police on Thursday indicted Bolsonaro and 36 others for allegedly attempting a coup to keep him in office after his defeat in the 2022 elections. The indictment is sealed, but among other things authorities had been investigating whether he incited the Jan. 8, 2022 riot in which his followers ransacked the Supreme Court and presidential palace in the capital of Brasilia.",
      "STATUS: Police sent their findings to Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court, which will refer them to Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet. He will either formally charge Bolsonaro and put him on trial, or toss the investigation.",
      "Brazil\u2019s highest electoral court in June ruled that Bolsonaro used government communication channels in a meeting with diplomats to promote his reelection bid and sow distrust about the vote. The case focused on a meeting the prior year, during which Bolsonaro used government staffers, the state television channel and the presidential palace in Brasilia to tell foreign ambassadors that the country\u2019s electronic voting system was rigged. The ruling rendered him ineligible for office until 2030, although he has insisted that he will run in the 2026 race.",
      "The court also found that Bolsonaro abused his power during Brazil\u2019s Independence Day festivities, a month before the election. The ruling didn\u2019t add years to Bolsonaro\u2019s ineligibility, but made any appeal less likely to succeed. A third case is also pending at the court.",
      "STATUS: Bolsonaro\u2019s appeal of the initial ruling was denied.",
      "Bolsonaro has been indicted for directing an official to tamper with a public health database to make it appear as though he and his 12-year-old daughter had received the COVID-19 vaccine in order to bypass U.S. entry requirements. During the pandemic, he railed against the vaccine, characterized the choice to receive a shot as a matter of personal freedom and has repeatedly said he never did so.",
      "The Federal Police accused Bolsonaro of criminal association and inserting false data into public records, which carry maximum penalties of 4 and 12 years in prison, respectively. It was his first indictment since leaving office.",
      "STATUS: Brazil's Supreme Court sent the indictment to the prosecutor-general, who is weighing whether to use it to press charges. Local media reported that he was seeking to consult American authorities about whether Bolsonaro used the forged document to enter the country, and that having done so could result in U.S. legal action.",
      "Federal Police have probed whether Bolsonaro directed officials to smuggle luxury jewelry worth millions into Brazil from Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, then acted to prevent them from being incorporated into the presidential collection and instead retain ownership for himself.",
      "Investigators summoned Bolsonaro for questioning in April and August of 2023. He has returned the jewelry in question.",
      "STATUS: The Federal Police indicted Bolsonaro for money laundering and criminal association, according to a source with knowledge of the accusations. A second source confirmed the indictment, although not for which specific crimes. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Federal Police is investigating Bolsonaro for inciting crimes against public health during the COVID-19 pandemic, which include encouraging people not to wear masks and causing alarm about non-existent danger of vaccines accelerating development of AIDS. A Senate inquiry commission also spent months investigating his pandemic-era actions and decisions, and recommended nine criminal charges.",
      "Brazil\u2019s former prosecutor-general Augusto Aras, widely seen as a Bolsonaro ally, decided not to file any charges based on the lawmakers' findings. They have urged his Aras' successor to reopen the case.",
      "STATUS: The investigation is ongoing.",
      "Brazil's Supreme Court in 2020 ordered an investigation into a network allegedly spreading defamatory fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices. The probe has yielded the imprisonment of lawmakers from the former president's circle and raids of his supporters' homes. In 2021, Bolsonaro was included as a target.",
      "As an offshoot of that probe, the Federal Police is also investigating whether a group operating inside Bolsonaro\u2019s presidential palace produced social media content aimed at undermining the rule of law. The group, allegedly comprised of aides and Bolsonaro\u2019s politician son, has been widely referred to as a digital militia and \u201cthe hate cabinet.\u201d",

      "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s largest remaining non-sanctioned bank would further diminish Russia's military effort and \u201cwill make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.\u201d",
      "In addition, more than 50 internationally connected Russian banks, 40 Russian securities registrars, and 15 Russian finance officials were hit with sanctions.",
      "The move comes after President Joe Biden this weekend authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war.",
      "In addition, on Wednesday the Pentagon announced that it will send Ukraine at least $275 million in new weapons, including an undisclosed number of antipersonnel land mines, as the Biden administration rushes to do as much as it can to help Kyiv fight back against Russia before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. \u201cremains committed to putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position, and we will continue to take all available steps to do so from surging security assistance to imposing and fully enforcing sanctions and other restrictions on Russia\u2019s war machine.\u201d",

      "Gazprombank played a role in remaining Russian natural gas supplies to Europe by handling payments from foreign customers.",
      "Earlier rounds of sanctions spared Russian gas because Europe\u2019s economy was so dependent on it but Europe is now far less reliant on Russian gas, which is down to about 18% of imports. Russia cut off of most supplies in 2022, plunging the continent into an energy crisis.",
      "European governments and utilities have now lined up alternative supplies, much of it liquefied gas brought by ship from the U.S. and Qatar. Ukraine says it will halt flows of Russian gas through a pipeline across Ukraine to Europe - about 4% of Europe\u2019s gas imports - at the end of the year. Gazprom recently cut off shipments through that pipeline to Austria\u2019s OMV in a commercial dispute; OMV has said it has plenty of reserves and can find alternative supply elsewhere.

This new software won't accept a boarding pass before the group it's assigned to is called, so customers who get to the gate prematurely will be asked to go back and wait their turn.",

      "Harteveldt doesn't see American's recent move as \u201cshaming\u201d customers who cut the line. \u201cWhat it is intended to do is bring order out of chaos,\u201d he said. \"And I hope it will defuse any potential flare ups of anger (from) people who simply think they're entitled to board out of turn .... It\u2019s just not fair.\"",
      "Harteveldt added that he thinks this change will enhance the experiences of both customers and gate agents. Others say more time will tell.",
      "Seth Miller, editor and founder of air travel experience analysis site PaxEx.aero, said he can see the benefits of more orderly and universal gate-control enforcement, particularly for airlines. But he said he isn't \u201c100% convinced this is perfect for passengers\" just yet.",
      "Families, for example, might be booked on several different reservations across more than one group, he said. Airlines typically have workarounds for that, and American noted Wednesday that customers traveling with a companion in an earlier group can simply have a gate agent \u201coverride the alert\u201d to continue boarding. Still, Miller said, \u201cyou have to go through the extra hoops.\u201d",
      "And a difficult customer still might choose to hold up the line and argue when they're not allowed to board, he added.",
      "Another question is whether customers who encounter a beep will walk away feeling embarrassed. But Harteveldt said he was happy to learn that American's alert is \u201cnot a bellowing sound that can be heard throughout the terminal,\u201d or accompanied by your name read over a loudspeaker, noting that this is important to avoid feelings of shame.",
      "Expanding this technology just a week before peak Thanksgiving travel could be \u201cboth good and bad,\u201d Harteveldt adds. On one hand, the tech could help significantly improve the boarding process during such a busy time, he said, but airport employees might also have appreciated more time to prepare.",
      "Both Miller and Harteveldt said they wouldn't be surprised if other carriers soon follow American's lead. Headaches over airport line cutting are far from new. While maybe not to the extent of American's new tech, Miller noted he's seen gate agents from other airlines ask people to leave a line and wait for their group. Harteveldt added that he's been to some airports in Asia and Europe with \u201csliding doors\u201d that ensure passengers are in the right group before boarding a plane.",
      "The more than 100 airports that American is now using its gate-control technology in are all spoke, or non-hub, locations \u2014 including Austin-Bergstrom International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The airline says it expects to further expand to its hubs and other airports in the coming months.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- Penn State has won a closely watched trademark fight over an online retailer's use of its vintage sports logos and images.",
      "A Pennsylvania jury awarded Penn State $28,000 in damages on Wednesday over products made and sold by Vintage Brand and Sportswear Inc., two firms co-founded by former minor league baseball player Chad Hartvigson.",
      "Penn State accused them of selling \u201ccounterfeit\u201d clothing and accessories, while the defendants said their website makes clear they are not affiliated with the university.",
      "At least a dozen other schools have sued the defendants on similar grounds, including Purdue, Stanford and UCLA, Penn State said in its 2021 lawsuit. However, the Penn State case was the first to go to trial and seen by some as a test case in the sports merchandising industry.",
      "\u201cIt addresses an important issue with trademark law \u2014 whether or not the mark owner is able to prevent third parties from using its marks on T-shirts and paraphernalia without permission,\u201d said Tiffany Gehrke, a trademark lawyer in Chicago who was not involved in the case.",
      "The verdict, she said, maintains the status quo, while a victory for Vintage Brand \u201ccould have shaken things up.\u201d It followed a six-day trial in federal court in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, overseen by Chief U.S. District Judge Matthew W. Brann.",
      "Defense lawyers declined to comment on the verdict and whether their clients planned to appeal.",
      "Penn State, in a statement, called its trademarks \u201ccritical\u201d to the school's brand, and said it was grateful for the verdict.",

      "Founded in 1855, Penn State adopted the Nittany Lion as its mascot in 1904 and has been using various images of the animal, along with the school's seal and other logos, for decades, the lawsuit said. The school now has more than 100,000 students at 24 campuses."

      "Federal water officials have made public what they call \u201cnecessary steps\u201d for the seven states and multiple tribes that rely on the Colorado River to meet an August 2026 deadline for deciding how to manage the waterway in the future",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Federal water officials made public on Wednesday what they called \u201cnecessary steps\u201d for seven states and multiple tribes that use Colorado River water and hydropower to meet an August 2026 deadline for deciding how to manage the waterway in the future.",
      "\u201cToday we show our collective work,\u201d Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton said as she outlined four proposals for action and one \u201cno action\u201d alternative that she and Biden's government will leave for the incoming Trump Administration \u2014 with formal environmental assessments still to come and just 20 months to act.",
      "The announcement offered no recommendation or decision about how to divvy up water from the river, which provides electricity to millions of homes and businesses, irrigates vast stretches of desert farmland and reaches kitchen faucets in cities including Denver, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles.",
      "Instead it provided a bullet-point sample of elements from competing proposals submitted last March by three key river stakeholders: Upper Basin states Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming, where most of the water originates; Lower Basin states California, Arizona and Nevada, which rely most on water captured by dams at lakes Powell and Mead; and more than two dozen Native American tribes with rights to river water.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going to take the any of the proposals,\u201d said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. \u201cThe federal government put the components together in a different way ... and modeled them to provide near-maximum flexibility for negotiations to continue.\u201d",
      "One alternative would have the government act to \u201cprotect critical infrastructure\u201d including dams and oversee how much river water is delivered, relying on existing agreements during periods when demand outstrips supply. \u201cBut there would be no new delivery and storage mechanisms,\u201d the announcement said.",
      "A second option would add delivery and storage for Lake Powell and Lake Mead, along with \u201cfederal and non-federal storage\u201d to boost system sustainability and flexibility \u201cthrough a new approach to distributing\u201d water during shortages.",
      "The third, dubbed \u201ccooperative conservation,\u201d cited a proposal from advocates aimed at managing and gauging water releases from Lake Powell amid \u201cshared contributions to sustain system integrity.\"",
      "And a fourth, hybrid proposal includes parts of Upper and Lower Basin and Tribal Nations plans, the announcement said. It would add delivery and storage for Powell and Mead, encourage conservation and agreements for water use among customers and \u201cafford the Tribal and non-Tribal entities the same ability to use these mechanisms.\u201d",
      "The \u201cno action\u201d option does not meet the purpose of study but was included because it is required under the National Environmental Policy Act, the announcement said.",
      "In 2026, legal agreements that apportion the river will expire. That means that amid the effects of climate change and more than 20 years of drought, river stakeholders and the federal government have just months to agree what to do.",
      "\u201cWe still have a pretty wide gap between us,\u201d Tom Buschatzke, Arizona\u2019s main negotiator on the Colorado River, said in a conference call with reporters. He referred to positions of Upper Basin and Lower Basin states. Tribes including the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona have also been flexing their long-held water rights.",
      "Buschatzke said he saw \u201csome really positive elements\u201d in the alternatives but needed time to review them in detail. \u201cI think anything that could be done to move things forward on a faster track is a good thing,\u201d he said.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said in a statement the alternatives \u201cunderscore how serious a situation we\u2019re facing on the Colorado River.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only path forward is a collaborative, seven-state plan to solve the Colorado River crisis without taking this to court,\u201d he said. \"Otherwise, we\u2019ll watch the river run dry while we sue each other.\u201d",
      "Wednesday\u2019s announcement came two weeks after Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris lost the election to Republican former President Donald Trump, and two weeks ahead of a key meeting of the involved parties at Colorado River Water Users Association meetings in Las Vegas.",
      "Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network advocacy group, said \u201csnapshots\u201d offered in the announcement \u201cunderscore the uncertainty that is swirling around future river management as a new administration prepares to take office.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe river needs basin-wide curtailments, agreements to make tribes whole, a moratorium on new dams and diversions, commitments for endangered species and new thinking about outdated infrastructure,\u201d he said.",
      "Buschatzke declined to speculate about whether Trump administration officials will pick up where Biden's leaves off. But Porter, at the Kyl Center, said the announcement \u201cshows an expectation of continuity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe leadership is going to change, but there are a lot of people who have been working on this for a long time who will still be involved in the negotiations and modeling,\u201d she said.",

      "Legislation for the world's first legal ban on children under 16 using social media has been introduced in Australia's Parliament",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s communications minister introduced a world-first law into Parliament on Thursday that would ban children under 16 from social media, saying online safety was one of parents\u2019 toughest challenges.",
      "Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cThis bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,\u201d she added.",
      "X owner Elon Musk warned that Australia intended to go further, posting on his platform: \u201cSeems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\u201d",
      "The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction.",
      "\u201cFor too many young Australians, social media can be harmful,\" Rowland said. \"Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits.\u201d",
      "Government research found that 95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their \"toughest parenting challenges,\u201d she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she added.",
      "\u201cThis is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we\u2019re in their corner when it comes to supporting their children\u2019s health and wellbeing,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks.",
      "Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users.",
      "\u201cWe are not saying risks don\u2019t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,\u201d she said.",
      "The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages.",
      "In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said.",
      "Age Check Certification Scheme\u2019s chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age.",
      "Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes.",
      "Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said.",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, said with Parliament expected to vote on the bill next week, there might not be time for \u201cmeaningful consultation on the details of the globally unprecedented legislation.\u201d",
      "\"Mainstream digital platforms have strict measures in place to keep young people safe, and a ban could push young people on to darker, less safe online spaces that don't have safety guardrails,\" DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. \u201cA blunt ban doesn't encourage companies to continually improve safety because the focus is on keeping teenagers off the service, rather than keeping them safe when they're on it.\u201d"

      "North Korea and Russia reached a new agreement for expanding economic cooperation at talks in Pyongyang this week",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea and Russia reached a new agreement for expanding economic cooperation following high-level talks in Pyongyang this week, the North\u2019s state media said Thursday, as they continue to align in the face of their confrontations with Washington.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency didn\u2019t elaborate on the details of the agreement signed Wednesday between its senior trade officials and a Russian delegation led by Alexandr Kozlov, the country\u2019s minister of natural resources and ecology. The Russian news agency Tass on Tuesday said officials following an earlier round of talks agreed to increase the number of charter flights between the countries to promote tourism.",
      "Kozlov, who arrived in North Korea on Sunday, met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his top economic official, Premier Kim Tok Hun, before returning home on Wednesday, KCNA said. During Kozlov\u2019s visit, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s gifted Pyongyang\u2019s Central Zoo with more than 70 animals, including lions, bears and several species of birds, according to Tass, in another display of the countries\u2019 growing ties.",
      "Kim Jong Un in recent months has prioritized relations with Moscow as he attempts to break out of international isolation and strengthen his footing, actively supporting Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine while portraying the North as a player in a united front against Washington.",
      "Kim has yet to directly acknowledge that he has been providing military equipment and troops to Russia to support its fighting against Ukraine. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing on Wednesday that an estimated 11,000 North Korean soldiers in late October were moved to Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops seized parts of its territory this year, following their training in Russia\u2019s northeast.",
      "The spy agency believes the North Korean soldiers were assigned to Russia\u2019s marine and airborne forces units and some of them have already begun fighting alongside the Russians on the frontlines, said Lee Seong Kweun, a lawmaker who attended the meeting. U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian officials have claimed that the North has also been supplying Russia with artillery systems, missiles and other equipment.",
      "North Korea would be possibly getting anywhere between $320 million to $1.3 billion annually from Russia for sending its troops to Ukraine, considering the scale of the dispatch and the level of payments Russia has been providing to foreign mercenaries, according to a recent study by Lim Soo-ho, a South Korean analyst at an NIS-run think tank.",
      "While that would be meaningful income for North Korea\u2019s crippled and heavily sanctioned economy, it could be lower than the money the North earns from illicit coal exports or supplying military equipment to Russia, Lim said. This suggests that North Korea\u2019s troop dispatch is less about money than acquiring key Russian technologies to further advance its nuclear weapons and missile program, which is a major concern in Seoul, Lim said.",
      "Amid the stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations with Washington, Kim has been dialing up pressure on South Korea, abandoning his country\u2019s long-standing goal of inter-Korean reconciliation and verbally threatening to attack the South with nukes if provoked. He has used Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate the development of his nuclear-armed military, which now has various nuclear-capable systems targeting South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles that can potentially reach the U.S. mainland.",

      "U.S. regulators are proposing aggressive measures to restore competition to the online search market after a federal judge ruled Google maintained an illegal monopoly for the last decade.",
      "The sweeping set of recommendations filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice could radically alter Google's business, including possibly spinning off the Chrome web browser and syndicating its search data to competitors. Even if the courts adopt the blueprint, Google isn't likely to make any significant changes until 2026 at the earliest, because of the legal system's slow-moving wheels.",
      "Here's what it all means:",
      "Federal prosecutors are cracking down on Google in a case originally filed during near the end of then-President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. Officials say the main goal of these proposals is to get Google to stop leveraging its dominant search engine to illegally squelch competition and stifle innovation.",
      "\u201cThe playing field is not level because of Google\u2019s conduct, and Google\u2019s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\u201d the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \u201cThe remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\u201d",
      "Not surprisingly, Google sees things much differently. The Justice Department's \u201cwildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the Court\u2019s decision,\u201d Kent Walker, Google's chief legal officer, asserted in a blog post. \u201cIt would break a range of Google products \u2014 even beyond search \u2014 that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still possible that the Justice Department could ease off on its attempts to break up Google, especially if President-elect Donald Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by President Joe Biden to oversee the agency\u2019s antitrust division.",
      "Regulators want Google to sell off its industry-leading Chrome web browser, though the filing did not specify who would ultimately buy the business or how that process would work.",
      "Justice lawyers called Chrome a \u201cgateway to the internet\u201d that provides the search giant with data it then uses for targeted advertising. Regulators believe that asking Google to divest Chrome would create a more equal playing field for search competitors.",
      "Chrome also is included in the set of apps bundled with Android on phones as part of a mobile device ecosystem that regulators say gives Google a big edge.",
      "Chrome is the world\u2019s most popular mobile web browser, with about 67% adoption globally, according to StatCounter. Apple\u2019s Safari browser has the next highest adoption at 18%.",
      "Although it could be years before we see any practical effects of this case on the market, it could mean users would see more search engine options when selecting a default one to use on their favored devices.",
      "While federal regulators aren't going as far as to demand Google spin off Android, they are leaving the door open.",
      "The government asked the judge to impose behavioral limitations that would essentially blunt Android from favoring Google\u2019s own general search services.",
      "Regulators asserted U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta should make it clear that Google could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if the other proposed measures prove ineffective at restoring competition to the search market.",
      "Android is the world's most popular smartphone operating system, found on 71% of mobile phones, Statcounter says. It\u2019s free to use, so many devices by Samsung and many other tech companies \u2014 aside from Apple \u2014 have it pre-installed.",
      "The Justice Department outlined a range of behavioral measures to give rival search engines a better chance at competing with Google.",
      "The core remedy is a ban on Google from cutting deals worth billions of dollars to lock in its search engine as the default option on Apple\u2019s iPhone and other popular devices. This could potentially impact the bottom line at companies receiving such packages.",
      "Other key recommendations:",
      "1. Prohibiting Google from using search results to favor its own services, such as YouTube or its recently-launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini.2. Forcing Google to license the search index data to its rivals. 3. Requiring Google to be more transparent about how it sets the prices advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results.4. Giving publishers, websites and content creators the right to opt out of having their data indexed for Google's search results or to train its artificial intelligence models.",

      "4. Giving publishers, websites and content creators the right to opt out of having their data indexed for Google's search results or to train its artificial intelligence models.",
      "Google has the chance to submit its own list of proposed fixes in December, and federal regulators will file a revised version of their proposals in early March. Court hearings on these proposed measures are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is expected to issue a final decision before Labor Day.",
      "The remedies trial will take place after the Trump administration takes over from Biden in January and assumes oversight of the Department of Justice, which could impact the punishments it ultimately pursues.",
      "Although Trump has made comments suggesting a breakup of Google isn't in the U.S. national interest, recent nominations put forward by his transition team have favored those who have been critical of Big Tech companies. And the case was originally filed during Trump's first term, which suggests Google won\u2019t be entirely off the hook.",
      "Google is expected to appeal the case after the remedy hearings, which means the case could drag on for years in the courts."

      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. edged closer to 7% this week, climbing to its highest level since July.",
      "The rate rose to 6.84% from 6.78% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. That\u2019s still down from a year ago, when the rate averaged 7.29%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance their home loan to a lower rate, also ticked up this week. The average rate rose to 6.02% from 5.99% last week. A year ago, it averaged 6.67%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "When mortgage rates increase they can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, reducing homebuyers\u2019 purchasing power at a time when home prices remain near all-time highs, even though U.S. home sales are on track for their worst year since 1995.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage fell to a two-year low of 6.08% in late September but it\u2019s been mostly rising since then, echoing moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which has mostly hovered around 4.4% since last week and was below 3.70% in September, has been rising in recent weeks following mixed reports on inflation and the economy. It also surged after the presidential election, reflecting expectations among investors that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposed economic policies may widen the federal deficit and crank up inflation.",
      "Mortgage rates slid to just above 6% in September following the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to cut its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years. While the central bank doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, its actions and the trajectory of inflation influence the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield. The central bank\u2019s policy pivot is expected to eventually clear a path for mortgage rates to generally go lower. But that could change if the next administration\u2019s policies send inflation into overdrive again.",
      "September's pullback in mortgage rates helped drive a pickup in sales of previously occupied U.S. homes last month. However, the recent climb in rates has put a damper on the housing market in the near term, said Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com.",
      "\u201cMortgage rates reached the high-6% range in late October, and have remained elevated since, much to the disappointment of buyers hoping to find some relief in the late-fall housing market,\u201d she said.",
      "Forecasting the trajectory of mortgage rates is difficult, given that rates are influenced by many factors, from government spending and the economy, to geopolitical tensions and stock and bond market gyrations.",
      "Economists predict that mortgage rates will remain volatile this year, but generally forecast them to hover around 6% in 2025.",

      "The Labor Department reported Thursday that jobless claim applications fell by 6,000 to 213,000 for the week of Nov. 16. That\u2019s fewer than the 220,000 analysts forecast.",
      "However, continuing claims, the total number of Americans collecting jobless benefits, rose by 36,000 to 1.91 million for the week of Nov. 9. That was higher than expected and the most in three years.",
      "While the number of new people applying for jobless aid each week remains at historically healthy levels, some who are receiving benefits are finding it harder to land new jobs. That suggests that demand for workers is waning, even as the economy remains strong.",

      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for U.S. layoffs.",
      "In response to some weakening employment data and receding consumer prices, the Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rate in September by a half a percentage point and by another quarter-point earlier this month.",

      "Several surprisingly strong economic reports, combined with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policy proposals, have led to a decidedly more cautious tone from the Fed that could mean fewer cuts and higher interest rates than had been expected.",

      "Despite a slight uptick in October, inflation has retreated steadily the past two years, approaching the Fed\u2019s 2% target and leading Chair Jerome Powell to declare recently that it was largely under control.",
      "The government reported in late October that an inflation gauge closely watched by the Fed fell to its lowest level in three-and-a-half years.",
      "During the first four months of 2024, applications for jobless benefits averaged just 213,000 a week before rising in May. They hit 250,000 in late July, supporting the notion that high interest rates were finally cooling a red-hot U.S. job market.",
      "In October, the U.S. economy produced a meager 12,000 jobs, though economists pointed to recent strikes and hurricanes that left many workers temporarily off payrolls.",
      "The Labor Department reported in August that the U.S. economy added 818,000 fewer jobs from April 2023 through March this year than were originally reported. The revised total was also considered evidence that the job market has been slowing steadily, compelling the Fed to start cutting interest rates.",

      "There's no surefire way to rank global AI leadership but Stanford researchers have made an attempt by measuring the \u201cvibrancy\u201d of the AI industry across various dimensions, from how much research and investment is happening to how responsibly the technology is being pursued to prevent harm.",
      "\u201cThe gap is actually widening\u201d between the U.S. and China, said computer scientist Ray Perrault, director of the steering committee that runs Stanford's AI Index. \u201cThe U.S. is investing a lot more, at least at the level of firm creation and firm funding.\u201d",

It has far outpaced China in private AI investment, which hit $67.2 billion in the U.S. last year compared to $7.8 billion in China, according to the report. It also leads in publishing responsible AI research. It's no surprise that the home of commercial AI powerhouses such as Google and Meta, along with relative newcomers like OpenAI and Anthropic, has produced many notable AI models that have influenced how the technology is being developed and applied. The U.S. also gets some points for having a number of AI-related laws on the books, though Congress has yet to pass any broad AI regulations.",
      "China has requested far more patents than any other country regarding generative AI, the U.N. intellectual property agency said earlier this year. Stanford researchers counted that as one measure of China's strong growth in AI innovation but not enough to lead the pack. Still, the report says that \"China\u2019s focus on developing cutting-edge AI technologies and increasing its R&D investments has positioned it as a major AI powerhouse.\u201d China's universities have produced a large number of AI-related research publications and it has commercial leaders developing notable AI models, such as Baidu and its chatbot Ernie.",
      "Coming in at No. 3 is the UK, which also ranked high in research and development, and educational infrastructure due to top computer science universities churning out a skilled AI workforce. It's also home to Google's AI subsidiary DeepMind, whose co-founder recently won a Nobel Prize; and \u201chad more mentions of AI in parliamentary proceedings\u201d than any other country. Last year, the UK hosted the world\u2019s first international AI safety summit.",
      "Close behind the UK was India, thanks to a \u201cstrong AI research community,\u201d improvements in economic investments tied to AI and a robust public discourse about AI on social media, according to the report.",
      "The UAE's deliberate focus on AI appears to have paid off in the Middle Eastern nation's fifth-place score. It was one of the top locations for AI investments. Microsoft earlier this year said it was investing $1.5 billion in UAE-based tech firm G42, which is overseen by the country\u2019s powerful national security adviser. Based in Abu Dhabi, G42 runs data centers and has built what\u2019s considered the world\u2019s leading Arabic-language AI model, known as Jais.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 are France at No. 6, followed by South Korea, Germany, Japan and Singapore. France, home to the buzzy AI startup Mistral, ranked high in AI policy and governance. Both it and Germany are part of the European Union's sweeping new AI Act that places safeguards on a range of AI applications based on how risky they are. The EU also follows the U.S. in developing a plan to expand semiconductor production within the bloc."

      "Nvidia rose just 0.5% after beating analysts\u2019 estimates  for profit and revenue yet again, but it was still the strongest force pulling the S&P 500 upward. It also gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that topped most analysts\u2019 expectations due to voracious demand for its chips used in artificial-intelligence technology.",
      "Its stock initially sank in afterhours trading Wednesday following the release of the results. Some investors said the market might have been looking for Nvidia\u2019s revenue forecast to surpass expectations by even more.

      "\u201cIndonesia is rich in geothermal resources, and we plan to phase out coal-fired and all fossil-fueled power plants within the next 15 years. Our plan includes building over 75 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity during this time,\u201d Subianto said at the summit of leaders of the Group of 20 major economies in Brazil on Tuesday.",

      "Experts and environmental activists welcomed the announcements but hedged their expectations.",
      "Indonesia is one of the world's largest producers and consumers of heavily polluting coal and most of its energy comes from fossil fuels. Over 250 coal-fired power plants are currently powering the country and more are being built, including at new industrial parks where globally-important materials like nickel, cobalt and aluminum are being processed.",
      "In 2022, Indonesia\u2019s energy sector emitted over 650 million tons of carbon dioxide, the world\u2019s seventh highest level, according to the International Energy Agency. Population and economic growth are expected to triple the country\u2019s energy consumption by 2050.",

      "While Subianto's predecessor, Joko Widodo, was in office Indonesia pledged to phase out \u2014 or at least drastically reduce \u2014 the use of coal by agreeing to numerous schemes with international stakeholders.",
      "That included the largest $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership deal so far. The deal has struggled to make changes on the ground but is still underway. JETP deals still fall short of the estimated trillions of dollars that are needed to develop infrastructure needed to transition to renewable energy and put existing coal-fired power plants into early retirement.",
      "In Brazil, Prabowo also spoke about Indonesia's vast renewable energy potential from solar, hydropower, geothermal, wind and other sources. Only 14.5% of these renewable sources are currently tapped, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 07:22:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Delta and United Airlines have become the most profitable U.S. airlines by targeting premium customers while also winning a significant share of budget travelers",
    "story": [
      "Delta and United Airlines have become the most profitable U.S. airlines by targeting premium customers while also winning a significant share of budget travelers",
      "DALLAS -- DALLAS (AP) \u2014 Delta and United have become the most profitable U.S. airlines by targeting premium customers while also winning back a significant share of travelers on a tight budget.",
      "That is squeezing smaller low-fare carriers like Spirit Airlines, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday. Some travel-industry experts think Spirit\u2019s troubles indicate that travelers on a budget will be left with fewer choices and higher prices.",
      "Other discount airlines are on much better financial footing than Spirit, but they too are lagging far behind the full-service airlines when it comes to recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Most industry experts think Frontier Airlines and other so-called ultra-low-cost carriers will fill the vacuum if Spirit shrinks, and that there is still plenty of competition to prevent prices from spiking.",
      "Spirit Airlines has lost more than $2.2 billion since the start of 2020. Frontier has not reported a full-year profit since 2019, although that slump might end this year. And Allegiant Air\u2019s parent company is still profitable, but less so than before the pandemic.",
      "Those kind of numbers \u2014 and of course, some promotion of his own airline \u2014 led United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby to declare recently that low-cost carriers were using \u201ca fundamentally flawed business model\u201d and customers hate flying on them.",
      "Kirby\u2019s touchdown dance might turn out to be premature, but many analysts are wary about the near-term prospects for budget airlines, which charge cheaper fares but more fees than the big airlines.",
      "Low-cost airlines grew in the last two decades by undercutting big carriers on ticket prices, thanks in large part to lower costs, including hiring younger workers who were paid less than their counterparts at Delta Air Lines, United and American Airlines. Wages have soared across the industry in the last two years, however, narrowing that cost advantage.",
      "At the same time, the big airlines rolled out and refined their no-frills, \u201cbasic economy\u201d tickets to compete directly with Spirit, Frontier and other budget carriers for the most price-sensitive travelers.",
      "The budget airlines have also become less efficient at using planes and people. As their growth slowed, they wound up with more of both than they needed. In 2019, Spirit planes were in the air an average of 12.3 hours every day. By this summer, the planes spent an average of two more hours each day sitting on the ground, where they don't make money.",
      "Spirit's costs per mile jumped 32% between 2019 and 2023.",
      "Another issue is that airlines added too many flights. Budget airlines and Southwest Airlines were among the worst offenders, but full-service airlines piled on. To make up for a drop in business travel, the big carriers added more flights on domestic leisure routes. The result: Too many seats on flights into popular tourist destinations such as Florida and Las Vegas, which drove down prices, especially for economy-class tickets.",
      "Tom Fitzgerald, an airline analyst at TD Cowen, said that after doing a good job tweaking their basic-economy offerings, the bigger airlines now are enjoying a boom on the premium travel side.",
      "\u201cPost-COVID, people have seemingly been willing to pay a lot more to have a better experience\" with flights and lodging, he said, \u201cand the legacy carriers are a lot better positioned to cater to that demand. They have premium economy, they have first-class.\u201d",
      "Low-cost airlines are responding by following the old adage that if you can't beat them, join them. That means going premium, following the rapidly growing household wealth among upper-income people.",
      "Frontier Airlines organized its fares into four bundles in May, with buyers of higher-priced tickets getting extras such as priority boarding, more legroom, and checked bags. The airline dropped ticket-change or cancellation fees except for the cheapest bundle.",
      "Spirit followed in August with similar changes, blocking middle seats and charging passengers more for the comfort of aisle and window seats.",
      "JetBlue Airways, which began flying more than 20 years ago as a low-cost carrier but with amenities, is digging out from years of steady losses. Under new CEO Joanna Geraghty, the first woman to lead a major U.S. airline, JetBlue is cutting unprofitable routes, bolstering core markets that include the Northeast and Florida, and delaying deliveries of $3 billion worth of new planes.",
      "Perhaps the biggest change is coming at Southwest Airlines. Starting next year, Southwest will toss out a half-century tradition of \u201copen seating\u201d \u2014 passengers picking their own seat after boarding the plane. Executives say extensive surveying showed that 80% of customers preferred an assigned seat, and that's especially true with coveted business travelers.",
      "Coming out of the pandemic, \u201cthere is a clear preference for more premium,\" Southwest CEO Robert Jordan said. \"Premium is kind of self-defined \u2014 whether that is extra legroom, first-class to Europe, whatever it is \u2014 but there is a rise in the desire for premium, something a little better.\u201d",
      "Jordan said it's not clear why demand for premium products and experiences have grown so rapidly, but figures on wealth offer one explanation.",
      "The top one-fifth of U.S. households by income have added $35 trillion in wealth since 2019 and holds nearly nine times the wealth of the middle fifth, according to the Federal Reserve. That gives the wealthiest households plenty of money to spend on premium travel.",
      "More crowded planes might also be pushing passengers to spend more to escape a middle seat in the back of the plane.",
      "Whatever the reasons, Delta executives say they expect sales of premium tickets will surpass the airline's revenue from main-cabin tickets by 2027.",
      "In other parts of the world, budget carriers are doing just fine. They have bounced back from the pandemic just like their more highbrow competitors.",
      "Some industry experts say low-cost carriers in Asia and Europe have always attracted a more diverse mix of passengers, while in the United States, affluent and middle-class travelers look down their noses at low-cost carriers.",
      "Jamie Baker, an analyst for JPMorgan, says he has many college friends who work in London and fly Irish airline Ryanair all the time, but he hardly knows anyone who has ever been on a Spirit or Frontier plane.",
      "\u201cThere is no stigma for anybody to fly Ryanair or easyJet in Europe. Meanwhile \u2014 not to pick on Spirit or kick them when they are down \u2014 but it\u2019s sort of the airline booty call,\u201d Baker recently told an audience of pilots for other airlines, who roared in laughter.",
      "Delta CEO Ed Bastian is less dismissive of the \u201clower-end carriers\u201d in the U.S. than United's Kirby.",
      "\"I don\u2019t see that segment ever disappearing,\u201d Bastian said this week, after Spirit\u2019s bankruptcy filing. \u201cI think there\u2019s a market for it.\u201d",
      "At the same time, he said the upscale moves by ultra-low-cost carriers are having no effect on his airline. Delta targets upscale travelers but also introduced basic-economy fares a decade ago, when discounters emerged as a growing threat to poach some of Delta's customers.",
      "\u201cJust calling yourself a premium carrier and actually being a premium carrier are two totally different things,\u201d Bastian said \u201cIt's not the size of the seat or how much room you have; it's the overall experience.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:34:22 -0500",
    "summary": "A Scottish dairy is making the audacious bid to sell what it&rsquo;s calling Britain's most expensive cup of coffee",
    "story": [
      "A Scottish dairy is making the audacious bid to sell what it\u2019s calling Britain's most expensive cup of coffee",
      "LONDON -- It's an enormous price to pay for a little cup of coffee, but the man behind the pitch promises it won't leave a bitter taste behind because it comes with a sweetener: a share of a dairy farm.",
      "A Scottish dairy is offering what it bills as the U.K.'s most expensive cup o' joe: 272 British pounds ($344) for a flat white \u2014 a double shot of espresso topped with a layer of steamed milk and a fleeting work of foam art.",
      "The costly cup is actually a perk for purchasing shares in Mossgiel Organic Dairy's crowdfunding campaign to enlarge its sustainable operation and produce more milk. Investors who buy 34 shares in the farm get a certificate for a flat white that can be redeemed starting this weekend at one of 13 coffee shops in Scotland that use the dairy's milk.",
      "\u201cThis coffee costs nearly 80 times the price of an average flat white in the U.K. \u2014 but it\u2019s much more than just a lovely drink,\u201d said owner Bryce Cunningham. \"We know it sounds crazy, but when you break it down, it\u2019s a pretty good deal. How much is the future of farming worth?\u201d",
      "The price tops the eye-watering 265 pounds that Shot London, a coffee bar in the posh Mayfair and Marylebone neighborhoods, charged for a flat white made with rare beans from Okinawa, Japan. The Telegraph reported in April that it was the most expensive coffee in Britain.",
      "Before launching the coffee promotion, Cunningham had already raised more than a third of the 300,000 pounds he is seeking from small investors as he tries to get a 900,000 pound loan that will help him double operations and expand out of Scotland and as far as coffee shops in London.",
      "Shareholders receive other rewards, too, such farm tours, milk delivery discounts and invites to special events. But investors are also given a standard warning that they could lose some or all of the money they invest \u2014 except for the coffee.",
      "The tenant farm in Mauchline, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Glasgow, was worked in the 18th century by poet Robert Burns, who penned \u201cAuld Lang Syne\" and many other well-known works. Burns, who is considered the national poet of Scotland, wrote while working in the fields there for two years and his face graces each glass bottle of Mossgiel milk.",
      "Cunningham, a former service manager for Mercedes-Benz, took over the operation in 2014 after his father and grandfather died in 2014 from terminal illnesses.",
      "The collapse of milk prices that year and other problems forced him to sell off most of the herd and reinvent the business as an organic farm. He uses a process to \u201cbrew\u201d the milk, instead of pasteurize it, that he said gives it the creamer taste and texture of raw milk without the health risks.",
      "Todd Whiteford, one of the owners of The Good Coffee Cartel in Glasgow that is serving the costly cups, said they\u2019ve been using Mossgiel's milk for several years. Despite \u201coutrageous offers\" from competitors to switch, he said other milk producers can't match the quality and consistency that makes for \u201crounder, smoother and sweeter\u201d cappuccinos, lattes and flat whites \u2014 and better coffee art.",
      "\u201cTheirs is the best. I\u2019ll argue with anyone about that,\u201d Whiteford said.",
      "Anyone who splashes out to buy a Mossgiel coffee, though, will be getting the same cup other Coffee Cartel customers can purchase for 3.10 pounds. But Cunningham says there will be a taste of virtue with every posh cup.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll have the self-transcendence that coffee is doing greater good than just perhaps buying it otherwise,\u201d Cunningham said.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 11:38:31 -0500",
    "summary": "As Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, his election victory is likely to embolden those who think they can get his ear",
    "story": [
      "As Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, his election victory is likely to embolden those who think they can get his ear",
      "WASHINGTON -- As incoming White House chief of staff, one of Susie Wiles \u2019 vexing challenges will be policing the buffet line of powerful interests who want something from Donald Trump.",
      "It\u2019s a world she knows well. During Trump\u2019s first presidency, she lobbied for many of them.",
      "Trump was first elected on a pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington. But his transactional approach to the presidency instead ushered in a lobbying boom that showered allies, including Wiles, with lucrative contracts, empowered wealthy business associates and stymied his agenda after his administration was ensnared in a series of influence-peddling scandals.",
      "Now, as Trump prepares to return to power, his victory is likely to embolden those who think they can get his ear, raising the prospect that his second administration could face many of the same perils as his first. That will test the ability of Wiles to manage a growing number of high-powered figures \u2014 including Trump\u2019s children, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and billionaires like Elon Musk \u2014 who will not be dependent on her for access to him.",
      "The appointment of a former lobbyist to such an important job \"bodes very poorly for what we are about to see from the next Trump administration,\u201d said Craig Holman, himself a registered lobbyist for the government watchdog group Public Citizen. \u201cThis time around, Trump didn\u2019t even mention \u2018draining the swamp.\u2019 ... He\u2019s not even pretending.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Brian Hughes, a spokesman from the Trump transition effort, rejected any suggestion that Wiles\u2019 past as a lobbyist would make her susceptible to pressure.",
      "\u201cSusie Wiles has an undeniable reputation of the highest integrity and steadfast commitment to service both inside and outside government,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cShe will bring this same integrity and commitment as she serves President Trump in the White House, and that is exactly why she was selected.\u201d",
      "Wiles\u2019 selection as chief of staff was Trump\u2019s first announced hire after his win. Wiles co-led the former president's campaign and was widely credited with having run an operation that was far more disciplined than his two previous efforts. Even so, she will have her work cut out for her. Though the job has traditionally entailed policing who has access to the president, Trump chafed at such efforts during his first presidency as he churned through four chiefs of staff.",
      "During his recent victory speech, Trump called Wiles an \u201cIce Maiden\u201d while praising her as a consummate behind-the-scenes player. She will be the first woman to hold the position.",
      "What is also clear is that Wiles, 67, has successfully managed headstrong men across a lengthy career in politics, government and lobbying. The daughter of NFL player and sportscaster Pat Summerall, Wiles worked for U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp, a conservative icon, in the 1970s, followed by stints on Ronald Reagan\u2019s campaign and as a scheduler in his White House.",
      "She later headed to Florida, where she advised two Jacksonville mayors and is credited with helping businessman Rick Scott, now a U.S. senator, win the governor\u2019s office. After briefly managing Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, she oversaw Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign in Florida, when his win in the state helped him clinch the White House.",
      "Wiles was a partner at Ballard Partners, a regional firm that lobbied for Trump\u2019s companies in Florida. Shortly after Trump\u2019s election, Ballard set up shop in Washington and quickly became a dominant player, pulling in more than $70 million in lobbying fees during Trump\u2019s presidency, representing a who\u2019s who of corporate America, lobbying disclosures show.",
      "Many of Wiles\u2019 clients were plain vanilla entities with obvious aims \u2014 General Motors, a trade group for children\u2019s hospitals, homebuilders, and the City of Jacksonville.",
      "One in particular stood out that speaks to the ways, subtle or otherwise, that foreign interests seek to influence U.S. policy. In 2017, Wiles registered as a lobbyist for Globovisi\u00f3n, a Venezuelan TV network owned by Ra\u00fal Gorr\u00edn, a businessman charged in Miami with money laundering.",
      "Gorr\u00edn bought the broadcast company in 2013 and immediately softened its anti-government coverage. He hired Ballard to advise on \u201cgeneral government policies and regulations,\u201d lobbying disclosures show. But rather than working with the agencies that oversee telecommunications, Ballard\u2019s lobbying was trained on the White House, which would have little say in regulating a foreign broadcaster in the U.S. Globovisi\u00f3n paid Ballard $800,000 for a year of work.",
      "Brian Ballard, president of the firm, said that it\u2019s clear to him that Gorr\u00edn\u2019s aims weren\u2019t limited to the media business. Gorr\u00edn, who owns several luxury properties in Miami, had long positioned himself as a bridge between Venezuela\u2019s socialist government and U.S. officials.",
      "By the time Wiles and a team of Ballard lobbyists represented Globovisi\u00f3n, Gorr\u00edn was leading a quiet charm offensive for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government that sought closer ties with Trump at a time when the country was facing food shortages, violent crime and hyperinflation. It started before Trump took office when Citgo, a subsidiary of Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company, kicked in a $500,000 donation for Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "\u201cHe was a fraud and as soon as we learned he was a fraud, we fired him,\u201d said Ballard. \u201cHe would ask us to set up a lot of things, in LA and D.C., and then nothing would happen. It was all a fantasy. He just wanted to use our firm.\u201d",
      "A few days after Ballard dropped Gorr\u00edn in 2018, federal prosecutors unsealed charges against the businessman for allegedly using the U.S. finance system to supply Venezuelan officials with private jets, a yacht and champion show-jumping horses as part of a fake loan scheme perpetrated by insiders to pilfer the state\u2019s coffers. Last month, he was charged a second time, also out of Miami, in another scheme to siphon $1 billion from the state oil company, PDVSA.",
      "Ballard said Wiles had almost no role in managing the relationship with Gorr\u00edn or several other clients for which she is listed as a lobbyist. But he praised her as someone who is a highly organized \u201cstraight shooter\u201d and \u201ctough as nails\u201d despite her soft demeanor.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s the type of person who you want in a foxhole,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will serve the president well.\u201d",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Maduro engaged in a peacemaking offensive that included attempts to hire at least two other lobbyists. It fizzled out, however. In 2019, the White House slapped crushing oil sanctions on the OPEC nation, closed the U.S. Embassy in Caracas and recognized the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly as the country\u2019s legitimate ruler. Maduro was then indicted in 2020 by the U.S. Justice Department on federal drug trafficking charges out of New York.",
      "Gorr\u00edn has long denied any wrongdoing and remains a fugitive. In a brief interview with The Associated Press, he called Wiles a \u201clady\u201d and said she always acted professionally and humanely.",
      "Ballard called the firm's work for Gorr\u00edn a \u201cbig mistake.\u201d Going forward, Ballard expects access to the White House to be more tightly controlled just as his firm, after a steep learning curve during the first Trump administration, will do a better job vetting potential clients to make sure their interests align with the president's agenda.",
      "\u201cWe learned a lot,\u201d he says, \u201cand so did the president.\u201d",
      "Globovisi\u00f3n wasn\u2019t Wiles\u2019 only client with foreign ties.",
      "In early 2019, she registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent working for one of Nigeria\u2019s main political parties for two months. Another client was an auto dealership owned by Shafik Gabr, a wealthy businessman who was in a financial dispute related to selling cars in Egypt with a subsidiary of the German automaker Volkswagen.",
      "Wiles was also a registered lobbyist for the subsidiaries of a multinational gaming company and a Canadian company looking to build a massive copper and gold mine near Alaska\u2019s salmon-rich Bristol Bay.",
      "Wiles was hardly an outlier in Trump\u2019s Washington, where his eponymously named hotel served as a hub for lobbyists, business leaders and foreign governments looking to rub shoulders with Trump World figures as they sought the president\u2019s favor.",
      "Though much of it was part of the normal course of business in Washington, a number of Trump allies and advisers were investigated and charged with crimes linked to their work on behalf of foreign countries and entities.",
      "After becoming Trump\u2019s de facto campaign manager in 2022, Wiles kept on lobbying, this time for Mercury, a multinational public affairs and lobbying firm. Most recently she was representing the maker of Swisher Sweets cigars.",

      "The federal goods and services tax break would begin Dec. 14 and end Feb. 15.",
      "The government said the tax break will apply to a number of items including children\u2019s clothing and shoes, toys, diapers, restaurant meals, beer and wine. It also applies to Christmas trees, a variety of snack foods and beverages and video game consoles.",

      "Trudeau has said he will lead his Liberal Party into the next election, which could come anytime up to next October. No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms.",
      "Trudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015 when he reasserted the country\u2019s liberal identity in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the cost of living coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The Liberals trail the opposition Conservatives 39% to 26% in the latest Nanos poll. The poll of 1,047 respondents has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi says his government views the South American country of Guyana as key to its energy security",
      "GEORGETOWN, Guyana -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Thursday during a visit to Guyana that his government views the South American country as key to its energy security.",
      "Modi spoke a day after his foreign minister said India is interested in buying up to two million barrels of crude from the oil-producing nation where vast deposits of oil and gas were found offshore nearly a decade ago.",
      "Addressing a special sitting of Parliament at the end of his two-day trip, Modi said he views Guyana as an important energy source and that he plans to encourage large Indian businesses to invest in the country.",
      "Guyana produces about 650,000 barrels a day of sweet, light crude oil from three oil fields, with production expected to ramp up to more than one million barrels daily, with production at three more oilfields slated to start in the next three years.",
      "On Wednesday, External Affairs Minister Jaideep Mazumdar said India was not necessarily disappointed about not being able to seal a long-term oil sale deal with Guyana, saying talks will continue. He said such a deal would ensure \u201cgreater predictability.\u201d",
      "The two sides did sign a memorandum of understanding on Wednesday to strengthen cooperation for hydrocarbon trade and petroleum products.",
      "Guyanese Natural Resources Minister Vickram Bharrat told reporters that while Guyana is willing to supply India with a large amount of crude, the matter is not simple because ExxonMobil, the main operator in Guyana\u2019s offshore oil production, would have to be consulted and agree to such an arrangement.",
      "\u201cWe know Exxon has to do some amount of changes to their lifting schedule and logistics because their preference is for the very large vessels that can accommodate two million barrels mainly because of distance and cost,\u201d Bharrat said.",
      "He added that Guyana prefers that Indian companies bid for oil blocks and that negotiations could occur if a bid is submitted.",

      "The Los Angeles Dodgers star added his third Most Valuable Player award to his collection and first in the National League when he was chosen unanimously by the Baseball Writers' Association of America on Thursday. Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees won the American League award for the second time, also unanimously.",
      "Ohtani last year became the first two-time unanimous MVP. He won the AL award in 2021 and 2023 as a two-way star for the Los Angeles Angels and finished second to Judge in 2022 voting.",
      "He didn\u2019t pitch in 2024 following elbow surgery and signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers last December. Ohtani became the first player to reach 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in a season, then helped the Dodgers beat the Yankees in the World Series.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be able to pitch this season just made me focus more on my offensive game and fortunately I was able to produce and get this award,\u201d Ohtani said through a translator.",
      "Ohtani sat on a red sofa with his wife and dog Decoy as teammate Clayton Kershaw announced the award on the MLB Network. The Nederlanse kooikerhondje immediately jumped away.",
      "Ohtani received all 30 first-place votes and 420 points. New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor was second with 263 points and Arizona second baseman Ketel Marte third with 229.",
      "Judge was a unanimous pick for the first time. Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. got all 30 second-place votes for 270 points, and Yankees outfielder Juan Soto was third with 21 third-place votes and 229 points.",
      "Ohtani hit .310, stole 59 bases and led the NL with 54 homers and 130 RBIs exclusively as a designated hitter, becoming the first player with 50 or more homers and 50 or more stolen bases in a season.",
      "A highlight of the season was during the dog days. Ball in mouth, Decoy delivered the ceremonial first pitch to his owner at Dodger Stadium's home plate before an Aug. 28 game against Baltimore.",
      "\u201cThe most nerve-wracking game that I had, the most nervous I was when we had that Decoy throw out the first pitch,\u201d he said.",
      "Ohtani played the final three games of the World Series with a torn labrum in his left shoulder. Still recovering from right elbow surgery in September 2023, Ohtani had another operation on Nov. 5 to repair the shoulder and has been working on range of motion and started Thursday on core and lower body work.",
      "\u201cThe goal is to be ready for opening day and that includes hitting and pitching,\u201d Ohtani said. \u201cBut we are kind of taking our time.\"",
      "When Ohtani resumes pitching, could he win MVP and the Cy Young Award in the same year?",
      "\u201cThat would obviously be great, but right now my focus is just to get to get back healthy, come back stronger, get back on the mound and show everybody what I can do,\u201d Ohtani said.",
      "Ohtani became the first primary designated hitter and first player who didn't appear defensively for a single inning to win an MVP. His season started with the revelation longtime interpreter and friend, Ippei Mizuhara had stolen nearly $17 million from the star to fund gambling.",
      "Ohtani is the 12th player with three or more MVPs, joining Barry Bonds (seven) and Jimmie Foxx, Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Mike Schmidt, Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols and Mike Trout (three each).",
      "Balloting was conducted before the postseason.",
      "\u201cMoving forward, I think now we do have a target on our back,\u201d Ohtani said. \u201cWe are going to be expected to maybe even do \u2014 possibly even do more.\u201d",
      "Judge led the major leagues with 58 homers, 144 RBIs and 133 walks while hitting .322. Witt topped the big leagues with a .332 average, hitting 32 homers with 31 stolen bases and 109 RBIs. Soto batted .288 with 41 homers and 109 RBIs.",
      "When Judge won his first MVP award in 2022, he received 28 first-place votes while Ohtani got the other two. Judge had discussed the MVP award with Philadelphia\u2019s Bryce Harper, the NL winner in 2015 and \u201921.",
      "\u201cI was telling him, `Man, I\u2019m going to try to catch up to you with these MVPs here, man,\u2019\u201d Judge recalled. \u201cHe\u2019d say, hopefully, he could stay a couple ahead of me, which I think he\u2019ll do.\u201d",

      "Top football recruit Bryce Underwood has flipped to Michigan after pledging to play at LSU",
      "ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Bryce Underwood, the top-rated football recruit in the country, flipped to Michigan after pledging to play at LSU, a person familiar with the decision said Thursday night.",
      "The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the recruit's plans to join the Wolverines.",
      "Underwood pinned a post on his Instagram account, showing a post from On3.com that reported he has committed to Michigan.",
      "The 6-foot-3, 205-pound quarterback played at Belleville High School, which is about 15 miles east of Ann Arbor, and told LSU nearly a year ago that he intended to play there.",
      "Underwood and his family wore LSU jewelry in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, earlier this month when Alabama beat the Tigers 42-13.",
      "Michigan coach Sherrone Moore, whose debut season has been stunted by the lack of a productive quarterback, continued to recruit Underwood with the help of a name, image and likeness collective, and it paid off.",
      "With a player as highly regarded as Underwood, NIL offers can reach $5 million to $10 million.",
      "Michigan has partnered with a collective, Champions Circle, to create opportunities for athletes to make money, and the group responded to Underwood's commitment.",
      "\u201c We are very excited to keep Bryce home in Michigan as he continues to build his legacy,\u201d Nate Forbes, founding member and chairman of Champions Circle, said in a statement.",
      "Underwood's commitment gives the defending national champion Wolverines a jolt of hope.",
      "Michigan (5-5, 3-4 Big Ten) has to beat Northwestern (4-6, 2-5) on Saturday to become bowl eligible before closing the season on the road against second-ranked rival Ohio State.",

    "story": [
      "It was an emotional farewell from tennis for Nadal this week after Spain was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup in Malaga",
      "MALAGA, Spain -- As Rafael Nadal prepared to serve in what turned out to be the last tennis match of his career, a woman's voice broke the silence from the stands: \u201cYou make Spain proud!\u201d",
      "Not long after that, Nadal was wiping away tears from his face and waving goodbye to his fans.",
      "His farewell from tennis was as emotional as expected when it came in Malaga on Tuesday, too soon for most. Nadal deliberately set up his swansong on a home court but Spain was eliminated in the Davis Cup quarterfinals and he and they couldn't complete his exalted career with a win.",
      "It was also heart-wrenching for his fans across Spain as they saw one of the country\u2019s very best \u2014 arguably its greatest sportsperson ever \u2014 finally call it quits.",
      "\u201cIt's clear that Rafa is the best athlete ever in Spain. He is on a different level than everyone else, by far,\u201d Feliciano L\u00f3pez, a former tennis player and the tournament director of the Davis Cup Finals, told The Associated Press. \u201cNo disrespect to all other Spanish athletes, and we have very good ones, but no one has been able to inspire the fans the same way that Rafa did.\"",
      "L\u00f3pez, who was Nadal\u2019s teammate in the Davis Cup, compared him to the likes of Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali, all athletes who transcended sports.",
      "\u201cThere is a very small group of athletes who, during their careers, were able to inspire people in a special way, going beyond sports,\u201d L\u00f3pez said. \u201cRafa belongs to this small group. People everywhere in the world will remember Rafa some 40 or 50 years from now.\u201d",
      "Unable to overcome a string of injuries in recent years, the 38-year-old Nadal retired from professional tennis after more than 20 years on tour and 22 Grand Slam titles, two more than Roger Federer and second only to the 24 of Novak Djokovic, the only one of the Big Three still playing.",
      "The front pages of Spain\u2019s dailies all talked about Nadal following his farewell match \u2014 a 6-4, 6-4 defeat against No. 80 Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands.",
      "\u201cIt was an honor,\u201d the sports daily AS said.",
      "\u201cThank you, Rafa,\u201d Marca headlined.",
      "\u201cEternal,\u201d Mundo Deportivo said.",
      "It's hard to find any other Spanish athlete coming close to Nadal's fame and sporting achievements.",
      "Other Spaniards who have earned sporting greatness include five-time major golf champion Seve Ballesteros; five-time Tour de France winner Miguel Indur\u00e1in, two-time NBA champion Pau Gasol; two-time Formula 1 champion Fernando Alonso; six-time MotoGP champion Marc M\u00e1rquez; and four-time Dakar Rally winner Carlos Sainz.",
      "Spain also has a long list of successful soccer players, including World Cup winners Iker Casillas and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, but none with a status like a Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi, who have transcended sports like Nadal.",
      "Nadal is also a two-time Olympic champion, and was Spain\u2019s flag-bearer during the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "He is adored in Spain just as much for his victories as he is for his passion and unwavering dedication, and is seen as an example for society in general for his values and humbleness on and off the courts.",
      "\u201cNadal makes us Spaniards feel proud. He represents the values of passion, camaraderie, solidarity. He will always be the image of sport in Spain,\" said Clara Garc\u00eda, a 35-year-old fan who was in Malaga to watch Nadal. \u201cIt's not easy knowing that he won't be playing and representing Spain on the courts around the world anymore.\u201d",
      "Federer gushed about his friend and longtime foe's retirement in an open letter. \u201cYou made Spain proud, you made the whole tennis world proud. You have always been a role model for kids around the world.\u201d",
      "Nadal told the crowd in his farewell ceremony after Spain's loss that he always \"strived to be better and achieve my goals from a place of respect, humility, and I valued all the good things that happened to me.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve tried to be a good person, which was what mattered the most to me, and I hope that you have noticed that.\"",
      "Fellow tennis pros Djokovic and Serena Williams, as well as former soccer stars David Beckham and other athletes praised Nadal.",
      "\"Thank you for so many incredible moments and memories as a tennis fan and for everything that you have done to inspire young people around the world,\u201d former England and Real Madrid player Beckham said.",
      "\u201cMy goodness, you will be missed,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Carlos Alcaraz, regarded as Nadal's heir in Spanish tennis \u2014 he already has four Grand Slam titles at 21 \u2014 said it will be hard to avoid the inevitable pressure that will come along with following in the footsteps of his idol.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to think that we have to continue his legacy. I don\u2019t want it to be a frustration if we don\u2019t reach the level that he reached,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cIf I achieve half of what he achieved, I will be happy. His legacy is going to be eternal.\u201d",
      "It wasn't quite clear what the future would hold for Nadal, who is an avid golfer and who has always been linked to Real Madrid. He has said in the past he would probably enjoy being the club's president one day.",
      "\u201cMy life will change radically,\u201d Nadal said on Wednesday after arriving home in Mallorca, where he also has the Rafa Nadal Academy. \u201cI have to accept this change as something normal, and accept that my life will be different now than it was for the last 30 years or so. I'm excited about it, there is no doubt.\u201d",
      "One thing was certain: Nadal will never be too far away from tennis.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll retire from the sport but I will continue to be available for whatever is needed, and to being a good ambassador, which is what I have tried to do my entire life.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:50:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The PGA Tour is making sweeping changes to its eligibility and it's only going to get more difficult to keep a tour card",
    "story": [
      "The PGA Tour is making sweeping changes to its eligibility and it's only going to get more difficult to keep a tour card",
      "The PGA Tour is making the most sweeping changes to its eligibility in more than 40 years by eliminating 25 tour cards, along with shrinking the size of its fields.",
      "The all-exempt tour had been in place since 1983, meaning the top 125 players from the official money list \u2014 now the FedEx Cup standings \u2014 kept a full PGA Tour card the following season.",
      "That changes in 2026 after the PGA Tour policy board approved a new priority list on Monday.",
      "Only the top 100 players will earn full tour cards for the following year. The top 30 from the developmental Korn Ferry Tour used to advance to the PGA Tour. That number now goes to 20. Five players from qualifying school will get cards \u2014 it previously was the top five and ties.",
      "The tour also is doing away with 156-man fields except for two tournaments held on multiple courses. Most tournaments will have 120 players before Daylight Saving Time, then 132 players in spring and a maximum of 144 players in the summer months.",
      "Here's a look at what's behind the changes and what it means:",
      "The all-exempt tour led to a bloated membership in which nearly 200 players were on the membership rolls through one exemption or another, and those toward the bottom of the priority list could not get into all the tournaments they wanted to play.",
      "Those who graduated from the Korn Ferry Tour, for example, could only get in three or four tournaments over the first few months of the season, giving them a disadvantage.",
      "The PGA Tour believes that limited full status to the top 100 instead of the top 125 will give everyone who earns a card a fair chance at getting into regular tournaments.",
      "Priority to get into tournaments starts with winners of the majors and The Players Championship over the last five years; winners of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Memorial and Genesis Invitational the last three years; tournament winners the last two years and career money leaders.",
      "Next are the top 125; players who have been given a medical extension; and then the 45 players who earned cards from the Korn Ferry Tour, European tour and Q-school. After that are those who finished from No. 126 to No. 150 in the FedEx Cup.",
      "All of them have PGA Tour cards. But there's not room for them in every tournament.",
      "The most common refrain in golf is to play better to get better status. Those who perennially finish in the top 100 should have no trouble keeping their cards, and they will have fewer players to beat because the fields will be smaller.",
      "It also helps newcomers from the Korn Ferry Tour, European tour and Q-school. They can expect to get into every regular tournament, increasing their odds of getting into some of the $20 million signature events.",
      "The PGA Tour, already the strongest circuit in golf, is likely to be even more competitive with a greater chance of the top names in contention.",
      "The tour also hopes \u2014 this is still to be determined \u2014 it will improve the pace of play and keep rounds from spilling over into the next day.",
      "Players like Peter Malnati and Taylor Pendrith come to mind. Under the new system, neither would have had a full PGA Tour card this year and likely would not have been in the fields for the tournaments they won \u2014 Malnati at the Valspar Championship and Pendrith at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. Those wins make them exempt through 2026.",
      "Players who have not performed consistently well, who seem to struggle each year just to finish in the top 125, will have to be at their best to stay on tour.",
      "The PGA Tour also is reducing the four spots from Monday qualifiers at open tournaments. Now there will only two spots for the 132-man fields and none for fields of 120 players.",
      "One of golf's charms is how one week can change a career. Then again, there has been only one Monday qualifier to win in the last five years \u2014 Corey Conners in the 2019 Texas Open.",
      "The new eligibility starts in 2026, so that puts a huge emphasis on playing well this year knowing that only the top 100 will keep full status.",
      "The four majors are not run by the PGA Tour. The Masters has the smallest field, typically fewer than 100 players. The U.S. Open, British Open and PGA Championship have 156-man fields.",
      "The Players Championship, the premier event run by the PGA Tour, is reducing its field from 144 players to 120.",

      "Two New Hampshire fathers who were punished for wearing pink wristbands marked \u201cXX\u201d to represent female chromosomes at a high school soccer game say they didn't set out to harass or otherwise target a transgender athlete",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Two New Hampshire fathers who were barred from school district events for wearing pink wristbands marked \u201cXX\u201d to represent female chromosomes insisted at a federal court hearing Thursday that they didn't set out to harass or otherwise target a transgender soccer player at the game they attended.",
      "But a judge hearing the case suggested the message the parents sent may matter more than their intentions.",
      "Kyle Fellers and Anthony Foote sued the Bow school district after being banned from school grounds for wearing the wristbands at their daughters' soccer game in September. The no-trespass orders have since expired, but a judge is deciding whether the plaintiffs should be allowed to wear the wristbands and carry signs at upcoming school events, including basketball games, swim meets and a music concert, while the case proceeds.",
      "Testifying at Thursday's hearing, both men said that they did not view the wristbands as a protest against Parker Tirrell, a transgender girl on the opposing team, but rather as a show of support for their daughters and their teammates. U.S. District Court Judge Steven McAuliffe questioned whether there is a meaningful distinction and whether their intentions matter.",
      "\u201cSometimes the message you think you\u2019re sending might not be the message that is being sent,\u201d he said.",
      "McAuliffe asked Foote whether it occurred to him that a transgender person might interpret the pink XX wristbands as an attempt to invalidate their existence.",
      "\u201cIf he\u2019s a trans female, pink might be a color he likes,\u201d Foote said.",
      "McAuliffe also noted that while both plaintiffs said they had no problem with transgender people outside the issue of sports, they repeatedly referred to the athlete in question as a boy.",
      "\u201cYou seem to go out of your way to suggest there\u2019s no such thing as a trans girl,\u201d McAuliffe said.",
      "Foote disagreed, saying it was \u201clike learning a new language\u201d to refer to transgender people.",
      "In a separate courtroom earlier Thursday, another judge held a hearing on a lawsuit brought by Parker Tirrell and another student challenging the state law that bans transgender athletes in grades 5 to 12 from teams that align with their gender identity. It requires schools to designate all teams as either girls, boys or coed, with eligibility determined based on students\u2019 birth certificates \u201cor other evidence.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Court Chief Judge Landya McCafferty ruled earlier this year that the teens can try out for and play on girls school sports teams. The order only applies to those two individuals for now as they seek to overturn the Fairness in Women\u2019s Sports Act on behalf of all transgender girl students in New Hampshire.",
      "Lawyers for the teens said in court Thursday they hoped the matter could go to trial and be resolved before the start of the next school year in September. They said the teens\u2019 school districts and others in the state have asked for guidance regarding the statute. Lawyers for the state said they needed more time to prepare.",
      "Judge Talesha Saint-Marc suggested the timing of the trial was ambitious and asked that both sides talk further about scheduling.",
      "Gov. Chris Sununu, who signed the Fairness in Women\u2019s Sports Act into law in July, has said it \u201censures fairness and safety in women\u2019s sports by maintaining integrity and competitive balance in athletic competitions.\u201d About half of states have adopted similar measures.",
      "In the Bow case, school district officials have said they acted appropriately in sanctioning the parents for conduct they knew violated school policy at athletic events. They'll explain their evidence on Friday. On Thursday, the plaintiff's lawyer, Endel Kolde, accused the district of \u201cbreathtaking\u201d overreach by asserting that the wristbands target transgender students in general, regardless of whether such students were present at the events.",
      "\u201cThis is viewpoint discrimination, and it\u2019s very clear they\u2019re proud of it,\u201d Kolde said.",
      "Kolde initially conceded that a school district can limit speech \u201cto some degree\u201d to protect children from harassment, but he stopped short of agreeing with the judge\u2019s claim that yelling \u201ctransgender students out\u201d at a particular player would be subject to such regulation.",
      "\u201cIt might be,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying to get you to concede the obvious,\u201d McAuliffe said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s less than obvious to me,\u201d Kolde said.",
      "Feller, the first witness in the case involving the wristbands, said he purchased them thinking his daughter and her teammates would wear them, but ended up wearing one himself after they declined. After being told to leave the game, he stood in the parking lot with a sign that said \u201cProtect women\u2019s sports for female athletes.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanted to support women\u2019s sports and I believed what was going on was a travesty,\u201d he said."

      "LAS VEGAS -- There are three races remaining in the Formula 1 season and Max Verstappen of Red Bull is close to a fourth consecutive world championship, which can wrap up Saturday night at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.",
      "All is not smooth sailing headed into this final month of racing:",
      "\u2014 There's a new race director following the firing of Niels Wittich that blindsided the Grand Prix Drivers' Association so badly that it created an Instagram account to rebuke the lack of FIA transparency.",
      "\u201cIt was a bit of a surprise, I think, for everybody,\u201d said Mercedes driver George Russell, a GPDA director. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a lot of pressure now onto the new race director (with) just three races left. Often, as drivers, we probably feel like we\u2019re the last to find out this sort of information.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Greg Maffei, the CEO of Liberty Media, the company that holds the commercial rights to F1, said last week he was stepping down from his position. This followed months of speculation that owner John Malone was displeased with Liberty landing in two different Justice Department investigations, one surrounding F1's refusal to allow Andretti Global into the series and the other over allegations of a Live Nation concert ticket monopoly.",
      "The Andretti team is expected to receive F1 approval to join the grid, albeit without Michael Andretti, who has scaled back his role dramatically since the IndyCar season ended in September.",
      "\u2014 F1 denied over the weekend that Stefano Domenicali, CEO of Formula One Management, was also on the move amid rumors that the Italian would take over MotoGP if Liberty's purchase of the series is approved.",
      "\u2014 Renee Wilm, a longtime Liberty Media employee, CEO of the Las Vegas Grand Prix and potentially Domenicali's successor, told The Associated Press she will fulfill any role Malone tasks her with but has little desire to move from Colorado to London to replace Domenicali. Maffei's newly opened job? Who knows.",
      "Many drivers, particularly seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, have been at odds with FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem since his election following the 2021 season finale. In the GDPA statement, they reminded the sanctioning body \u201cour members are adults\u201d who don't need lectures and fines on foul language or jewelry bans, and simply want fair and consistent race control.",
      "There's been no response from Ben Sulayem, and won't be this weekend since he does not attend the LVGP. He will be at Qatar and the finale in Abu Dhabi next month.",
      "Hamilton doesn't think all the behind-the-scenes changes will be a fan topic as the season comes to a close. But he noted that consistency from race control is all the drivers have asked for, while throwing his support behind Domenicali and the job Maffei has done in growing F1 since Liberty took over.",
      "\u201cI really hope Stefano is not leaving because he's been so instrumental in changes and progress to this whole thing,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cAnd he knows the sport as well as anyone. But all good things do come to an end, and whoever they put into place, I just hope they are like-minded. But sometimes you have to shake the trees.\u201d",
      "That's just what happened with the surprise departure of race director Wittich. Although drivers have been unhappy with race officiating this season and held a private GPDA meeting in Mexico City, Russell said they had no prior warning Wittich was out.",
      "The race director is the referee each weekend and Wittich has been in charge since 2022, when Michael Masi was fired following the controversial 2021 season-ending, championship-altering finale at Abu Dhabi. Now the man in charge for the final three races is Rui Marques, the Formula 2 and Formula 3 race director.",
      "Las Vegas, which overcame multiple stumbling blocks in last year's debut before putting on one of the best races of the season, is a difficult place to start. Verstappen can win his fourth title by simply scoring three points more than Lando Norris of McLaren.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit weird with three races to go to do that,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re positive or negative about certain things. I thought in Brazil there was definitely room for improvement, for example. It\u2019s still a bit weird having to now then deal with a different race director.\u201d",
      "Charles Leclerc of Ferrari wondered why the move was made with only three races to go.",
      "\u201cTo do it so late in the season, at such a crucial moment of the season, it could have probably been managed in a better way,\u201d he said.",
      "The drivers have consistently asked for clearer guidelines in the officiating of races, specifically regarding track limits and racing rules. The drivers have no idea how Marques will officiate, highlighting a disconnect between the competitors and Ben Sulaymen's FIA.",
      "\u201cWe just want to be transparent with the FIA and have this dialogue that is happening,\u201d Russell said. \u201cAnd I think the departure of Niels is also a prime example of not being a part of these conversations.\u201d",
      "The GDPA statement made clear the drivers do not think their voice is being heard.",
      "\u201cIf we feel we\u2019re being listened to, and some of the changes that we are requesting are implemented, because ultimately we\u2019re only doing it for the benefit of the sport, then maybe our confidence will increase,\u201d Russell said. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s a number of drivers who feel a bit fed up with the whole situation. It only seems to be going in the wrong direction.\u201d",
      "He also said the relationship between the drivers and the FIA seems fractured.",
      "\u201cSometimes just hiring and firing is not the solution,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to work together to improve the problem.\u201d",
      "Norris, who has battled Verstappen this year with mixed officiating rulings, said \u201cobviously things are not running as smoothly as what we would want.\u201d",
      "Marques has his first driver meeting ahead of Thursday night's two practice sessions and then three weeks to prove to the competitors he is up for the job.",
      "Carlos Sainz Jr., who will leave Ferrari for Williams at the end of the season, hopes the drama doesn't distract from the momentum F1 has built over the last five years.",
      "\u201cI think Formula 1 is in a great moment right now and all these rumors, I think in every team, every job, there's job changes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's not big drama. I'm a big fan of the people you mentioned, they've done an incredible job in Formula 1 and Formula 1 is what it is thanks to these people. But it's just so emotional, especially the Stefano one. The only one that has a real effect is the race director. But I think if he does a good job, it should be transparent and nothing big.\u201d",

      "Items belonging to former Red Sox President and CEO Larry Lucchino, who died in April at the age of 78, will be auctioned starting Saturday with proceeds going to The Lucchino Family Foundation, which funds charities throughout New England.",
      "\u201cMy brother, Larry, embodied the spirit of generosity,\u201d said Frank Lucchino, a retired judge from Pennsylvania.",
      "Items include Lucchino\u2019s Commissioner\u2019s Trophy and ring from the curse-ending 2004 World Series in which the Red Sox had to first beat the New York Yankees for the opportunity to face the St. Louis Cardinals in the series. Two other championship trophies from Lucchino\u2019s tenure, 2007 and 2013, are being auctioned along with another one from 2018.",
      "Other items include 2004 and 2007 championship banners that flew at Fenway Park, a couple of stadium seats and a turnstile, and an electric guitar signed by Boston rockers Aerosmith when they played at Fenway in 2010.",
      "Lucchino served as Baltimore Orioles president, leading the effort to build Camden Yards, before doing the same thing for the San Diego Padres \u2014 building another new ballpark. In Boston, he helped to assemble the new ownership group led by John Henry and Tom Werner that bought the franchise in 2002. The group opted to renovate rather than replace Fenway Park, which opened in 1912, preserving the oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball for future generations.",
      "The online auction is being handled by Bonhams Skinner. Included in the auction are non-Red Sox items owned by Lucchino, such as a World Series ring won with the Orioles and a Super Bowl ring from Washington.",
      "Robin Starr from Bonhams Skinner said it was an honor for a Boston-based auction house to handle the auction.",
      "\"Larry Lucchino\u2019s lasting impact on the Boston Red Sox and Major League Baseball as a whole is undeniable,\u201d she said.",

    "summary": "With a restructuring at Andretti Global that pushed Michael Andretti into a smaller role, the chances of his organization landing a Formula 1 team have substantially increased",
    "story": [
      "With a restructuring at Andretti Global that pushed Michael Andretti into a smaller role, the chances of his organization landing a Formula 1 team have substantially increased",
      "LAS VEGAS -- With a restructuring at Andretti Global that pushed Michael Andretti into a smaller role, the chances of his organization landing a Formula 1 team have substantially increased.",
      "So much so that F1 and Formula One Management could have a decision to grant the General Motors-backed entry a spot as the 11th team on the grid in the coming weeks. Dan Towriss, now the majority owner of the Andretti organization, was at the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Thursday scoping his chances of entering the top motorsports series in the world.",
      "So was the FBI, allegedly, as part of a Department of Justice investigation into why F1 denied the Andretti organization expansion into the series. F1 currently has 10 teams that field 20 cars and only one \u2014 the organization owned by California businessman Gene Haas \u2014 is an American team.",
      "Las Vegas marks the third race this season in the United States, more than any other country, as F1 has exploded in American popularity over the last five years.",
      "Even so, Andretti could not get approval from F1 to enter the series. But, the situation changed in September when Andretti scaled back his role with his namesake organization.",
      "Now with Towriss in charge, talks have amplified, even though it is not clear what the name of an Andretti-less F1 team would even be. Cadillac would do the engines \u2014 but says it won't be ready until 2028 \u2014 which means a 2026 Towriss-led F1 team would be GM branded but with a partner engine supplier.",
      "Most of the existing teams have been largely opposed to an 11th team entering F1, citing a dilution in prize money and the massive expenses they've already committed to the series. But, Andretti among others believed the teams' position was personal in that they simply didn't like Andretti, who ran 13 races in the 1993 season. His father, Mario, is the 1978 F1 world champion.",
      "The Andretti application had already been approved by the FIA, which is F1's ruling body, but later denied by F1 itself. F1 promised to revisit the issue once General Motors had an engine ready to compete.",
      "The existing 10 F1 teams have no actual vote or say in if the grid is expanded, which Mercedes boss Toto Wolff reiterated Thursday when The Associated Press asked why the sudden chance of acceptance in a potential 11th team.",
      "\u201cWe have an obligation, a statutory obligation as directors, to present the standpoint that is the best for our company and for our employees, and we\u2019ve done that,\u201d Wolff said. \"I think if a team can add to the championship, particularly if GM decides to come in as a team owner, that is a different story.",
      "\u201cAnd as long as it is creative, that means we\u2019re growing the popularity of the sport, we\u2019re growing the revenue of the sport, then no team will be ever against it. So I\u2019m putting my hope in there.\u201d",
      "Wolff has been eager to hear from Towriss directly on what the plans for the organization are now that Andretti has a smaller role.",
      "\u201cNo one from Andretti or Andretti Global or whatever the name will be has ever spoken to me a single sentence in presentation of what the creative part is,\u201d he said. \"But they don\u2019t need to because the teams don\u2019t decide. It is the commercial rights holder, with the FIA, we have no say. If I want to be invited to a party and go to the party, I\u2019m sitting down at the table and telling who I am and why I\u2019m really good fun and sitting here and everybody will enjoy my presence.",
      "\u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened, but you know, that\u2019s now my personal point of view, not a professional, because there\u2019s nothing we can do, nothing we can say,\u201d Wolff continued. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know the people. I\u2019ve obviously spoken to Mario. I didn\u2019t speak to his son. I didn\u2019t speak to any other people that are behind that. I don\u2019t know who they are. So I know GM, GM is great.\u201d",
      "Fred Vasseur, team principal at Ferrari, said he's not opposed to another team if it adds value to F1.",
      "\u201cThe discussion is between FIA, the team, and FOM. It\u2019s not our choice,\u201d he said. \u201cFor sure, as Toto said, that if it\u2019s good for the sport, good for the show, good for the business, and adds value on the sporting side, that we are all OK.\u201d",

      "In years past, it took two extra postseason wins to capture a national title. Now, it could take up to four additional contests. That\u2019s more of a chance to shine, but also more chance for an injury.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think nobody will opt out because you\u2019re showing NFL teams that you\u2019re more focused on something else, other than the team goal,\u201d Hunter said of the expanded 12-team College Football Playoff. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think players are going to opt out of the playoffs.\u201d",
      "Hunter and quarterback Shedeur Sanders chatted Thursday in a set of Zoom calls about turning around the program at Colorado (from 4-8 last season to bowl eligibility), chasing a Big 12 title, turning pro \u2014 Hunter acknowledged he will \u201cfor sure\u201d \u2014 and, of course, the Heisman race, where Hunter is currently the odds-on favorite in an award each wants to see the other win.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s deserving of it, and if it\u2019s between me and him, I want him to get it,\u201d said Sanders, whose 16th-ranked Buffaloes (8-2, 6-1 Big 12, No. 16 CFP ) travel to Arrowhead Stadium to face Kansas (4-6, 3-4) this weekend. \u201cHe does a lot of amazing things that have never been done before.\u201d",
      "Countered Hunter: \u201cI know he wants me to win it, but I also want him to win as bad as I want to win it.\u201d",
      "Hunter is a generational talent shining on both sides of the ball. As a receiver, he has 74 catches for 911 yards and nine touchdowns. On defense, he has picked off three passes, even though teams are reluctant to throw his direction.",
      "Like he did in high school and now in college, he believes he can do both on the next level. But he understands the trepidation of the NFL team that picks him.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want their top pick to go down too early,\" Hunter said. \u201cI like when people tell me I can\u2019t do it, because they just motivate me to continue to do what I want to do.\u201d",
      "Sanders is turning in a stellar season as well with 27 touchdown passes, one away from tying Sefo Liufau for the most in a single season in program history. He's projected to be one of the first QBs off the draft board.",
      "The future certainly looks bright at Colorado thanks to the legacies Sanders and Hunter under coach Deion Sanders. But that's a point to ponder later.",

      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was a phenomenon impossible to manufacture",
      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was a phenomenon impossible to manufacture. But, more than a year later, that hasn\u2019t stopped people from trying to make \u201cGlicked\u201d \u2014 or even \u201cBabyratu\u201d \u2014 happen.",
      "The counterprogramming of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in July 2023 hit a nerve culturally and had the receipts to back it up. Unlike so many things that begin as memes, it transcended its online beginnings. Instead of an either-or, the two movies ultimately complemented and boosted one another at the box office.",
      "And ever since, moviegoers, marketers and meme makers have been trying to recreate that moment, searching the movie release schedule for odd mashups and sending candidates off into the social media void. Most attempts have fizzled (sorry, \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d ).",
      "This weekend is perhaps the closest approximation yet as the Broadway musical adaptation \u201cWicked\u201d opens Friday against the chest-thumping sword-and-sandals epic \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Two big studio releases (Universal and Paramount), with one-name titles, opposite tones and aesthetics and big blockbuster energy \u2014 it was already halfway there before the name game began: \u201cWickiator,\u201d \u201cWadiator,\u201d \u201cGladwick\u201d and even the eyebrow raising \u201cGladicked\u201d have all been suggested.",
      "\u201c'Glicked' rolls off the tongue a little bit more,\u201d actor Fred Hechinger said at the New York screening of \u201cGladiator II\u201d this week. \u201cI think we should all band around \u2018Glicked.\u2019 It gets too confusing if you have four or five different names for it.\u201d",
      "As with \u201cBarbenheimer,\" as reductive as it might seem, \u201cGlicked\u201d also has the male/female divide that make the fan art extra silly. One is pink and bright and awash in sparkles, tulle, Broadway bangers and brand tie-ins; The other is all sweat and sand, blood and bulging muscles.",
      "Both films topped Fandango\u2019s most anticipated holiday movie survey, where 65% of respondents said that they were interested in the \u201cGlicked\u201d double feature. Theaters big and small are also pulling out the stops with movie-themed tie-ins. B&B Theaters will have Roman guards tearing tickets at some locations and Maximus popcorn tubs. Marcus Theaters is doing Oz photo ops and friendship bracelet-making. Alamo Drafthouse is leaning into the singalong aspect (beware, though, not all theaters are embracing this) and the punny drinks like \u201cDefying Gravi-Tea.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than it being in competition, I think they\u2019re in conversation,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal said. \u201cThis industry needs a shot in the arm. Those films gave it last year. We hope to do it this year.\u201d",
      "And the hope is that audiences will flock to theaters to be part of this moment as well. It's a sorely needed influx of could-be blockbusters into a marketplace that's still at an 11% deficit from last year and down 27.2% from 2019, according to data from Comscore.",
      "\u201cCompetition is good for the marketplace. It\u2019s good for consumers,\u201d said Michael O'Leary, the president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \u201cHaving two great movies coming out at the same time is simply a multiplier effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cGlicked\u201d is currently tracking for a combined North American debut in the $165 million range, with \u201cWicked\u201d forecast to earn around $100 million (up from the $80 million estimates a few weeks ago) and \u201cGladiator II\u201d pegged for the $65 million range.",
      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d shattered its projections last July. Going into that weekend, \u201cBarbie\u201d had been pegged for $90 million and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d around $40 million. Ultimately, they brought in a combined $244 million in that first outing, and nearly $2.4 billion by the end of their runs.",
      "It\u2019s possible \u201cGlicked\u201d will exceed expectations, too. And it has the advantage of another behemoth coming close behind: \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which opens just five days later on the Wednesday before the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cGlickedana\u201d triple feature anyone?",
      "\u201cThese are 10 important days,\u201d O'Leary said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to show the moviegoing audience that there\u2019s a lot of compelling stuff out there for them to see.\u201d",
      "There are infinite caveats to the imperfect comparison to \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d as well. \u201cWicked\u201d is a \u201cPart One.\u201d Musicals carry their own baggage with moviegoers, even those based on wildly successful productions (ahem, \u201cCats\u201d). \u201cGladiator II\u201d got a head start and opened internationally last weekend. In fact, in the U.K. it played alongside \u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d where that double was pegged \u201cGladdington.\u201d \u201cGladiator\u201d reviews, while positive, are a little more divided than the others. And neither directors Ridley Scott nor Jon M. Chu has the built-in box office cache that Christopher Nolan\u2019s name alone carries at the moment.",
      "The new films also cost more than \u201cBarbie\u201d ($145 million) and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d ($100 million). According to reports, \u201cGladiator II\u201d had a $250 million price tag; \u201cWicked\u201d reportedly cost $150 million to produce (and that does not include the cost of the second film, due next year).",
      "The narrative, though, has shifted away from \u201cwho will win the weekend.\u201d Earlier this year, Chu told The Associated Press that he loves that this is a moment where \u201cwe can root for all movies all the time.\u201d",
      "Close behind are a bevy of Christmas releases with double feature potential, but those feel a little more niche. There\u2019s the remake of \u201cNosferatu,\u201d the Nicole Kidman kink pic \u201cBabygirl\u201d and the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The internet can\u2019t even seem to decide on its angle for that batch of contenders, and none exactly screams blockbuster. Sometimes the joy is just in the game, however. Some are sticking with the one-name mashup (\u201cBabyratu\u201d); others are suggesting that the fact that two of the movies feature real-life exes (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp) is enough reason for a double feature. And getting people talking is half the battle.",
      "When in doubt, or lacking a catchy name, there\u2019s always the default: \u201cThis is my Barbenheimer.\u201d",

      "Looking for a new social media platform",
      "LONDON -- Looking for a new social media platform because X, Threads and Mastodon just aren't cutting it? You could try Bluesky.",
      "People seeking to avoid chaos, noise and political bluster in the aftermath of the U.S. elections are noticing a different mood on the Bluesky social platform, where the vibe is seemingly welcoming and there are noticeably fewer trolls.",
      "The site announced it had rapidly added more than a million new users in the week after Election Day, and has emerged as one of the fastest growing rivals to Elon Musk\u2019s X and similar platforms.",
      "If you're tempted to check out the new space, here's a guide on how Bluesky works:",
      "Maybe you're not ready to commit to adding yet another social media account. No problem \u2014 you can still look around on Bluesky without signing up because all posts and profiles are public.",
      "You might get a sense of deja vu because the platform's look and feel are very similar to X. That should be no surprise because Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey was an early Bluesky champion. (Dorsey's no longer involved with Bluesky, which is owned and run by its executive team as a public benefit corporation.)",
      "If you take the plunge and get an account, you'll need a username. You'll notice Bluesky handles are a little bit different because they end by default in the site's domain, .bsky.social.",
      "You can personalize your handle to make it more memorable, by using your own website's domain or buying a custom one through Bluesky. But it might not be something most newbie users need or want to do right away.",
      "Bluesky boasts that it gives users \u201calgorithmic choice\u201d to tailor the content they're shown instead of leaving it up to the whims of a centralized system.",
      "\u201cOur online experience doesn\u2019t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see,\u201d it says.",
      "What it means is that you can follow custom feeds set up by other users, or design your own. If you tap #Feeds in the menu on the left, you'll see some default offerings like Cat Pics and Gardening. My Bangers is a list of your most popular posts by likes and Catch Up shows the site's most popular posts from the past 24 hours. You can find more by doing a search and tapping the Feeds button.",
      "There's also the usual \u201cDiscover\u201d feed of suggested posts and a chronological feed of accounts that you follow.",
      "To help new users settle in, Bluesky has starter packs of recommended feeds and accounts to follow, which anyone can create and share. They don\u2019t show up in Bluesky's search results but can be found in directories online.",
      "Or someone might share one with you. After I signed up, a colleague pointed me to one for major news outlets. There are tens of thousands of starter packs, ranging from broadly appealing topics like Taylor Swift to niche interests like cargo bikes or U.K. comedians. You can follow the whole pack or scroll down the list to choose individual accounts.",
      "What about people you followed on X? There's a browser extension tool called Sky Follower Bridge that will help you find X users who've migrated to Bluesky. But check before clicking the follow button to make sure it's not a different user using the same display name or handle.",
      "Ready to join the conversation? You can write posts or reply to others but keep it short because there's a limit of 300 characters \u2014 20 more than on X. You can also upload photos and videos, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are, of course, available too.",
      "You can still @ people by typing in their username, like posts by tapping a heart icon or use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a menu to hashtags, so when you click on one you'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on that topic.",
      "Bluesky's decentralization ethos extends to the content control options it offers.",
      "For starters, users can choose in their settings menu whether to see replies, reposts or quote posts in their feed. Specific words or tags can be muted temporarily, or forever, while accounts can be muted or blocked individually, or in bulk by adding them a moderation list. You can even fine tune the level of adult content that shows up in your feed.",
      "Bluesky has a team of content moderators to police the site for material that's illegal or breaks the rules. But it's also taking a different approach by open sourcing its content moderation system in an attempt to resolve problems with traditional moderation services which it says \u201clack transparency and user control.\u201d",
      "So, individuals or groups can set up their own content filters, or labelers, that go beyond what Bluesky offers. These labelers can be used to categorize content or users, which can then be blocked or hidden. But they could also be used for informational or creative purposes, like curating or verifying content.",
      "There are labelers to identify images generated by artificial intelligence or to fact check news posts. You can find lists of labelers online. After I subscribed to a U.S. politics labeler, some posts in my feeds were flagged \u201c!Donald Trump\u201d or \u201c!Democrat politician\u201d and hidden unless I click Show.",

      "The Civil Court in Bangkok said Jatupat Boonpattararaksa had failed to provide sufficient proof that his phone was infected with Pegasus spyware produced by NSO Group Technologies.",
      "Jatupat, also known as Pai Dao Din, had alleged that the NSO Group had violated his and other activists' constitutional rights by facilitating the use of Pegasus to allegedly target them and extract data from their devices.",
      "He had claimed his phone was infected on three occasions in 2021, a time of large-scale protests against the government that included unprecedented demands for reform of Thailand\u2019s powerful but opaque monarchy.",
      "The NSO Group welcomed the ruling, saying it reaffirmed \u201cthe lack of evidence to support the claims against our company.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to the responsible use of our technologies, which are exclusively provided to government agencies for the prevention of serious crimes and terrorism,\u201d spokesperson Gil Lainer said in an email to The Associated Press. \"NSO operates under strict regulatory frameworks and ethical standards, and we will continue to cooperate with authorities to ensure our products are used lawfully and effectively.\u201d",
      "An investigation last year by Thai civil society group iLaw, Thai internet freedom organization DigitalReach and Canadian internet watchdog group Citizen Lab found that 35 individuals in Thailand were targeted by government surveillance using Pegasus in 2020 and 2021. The victims were predominantly activists and scholars.",
      "Other activists alleged that Thai government agencies were behind the use of Pegasus, but officials have not commented directly on it. When pressed by the opposition in Parliament in 2022, the government acknowledged that state agencies had used Pegasus for activities related to \u201csecurity or narcotics.\u201d",
      "Speaking outside the court, Jatupat, who had been a leader of street protests in 2021, said he had brought the suit to fight for people's rights and freedoms.",
      "\u201cWe fought for this because we wanted to prove whom the law will protect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is obvious today that the court chose to protect state security.\u201d",
      "Sutawan Chanprasert from DigitalReach called the ruling \"disappointing.\"",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a lesson learned,\u201d she said. \"I think the reason the court gave will help us to prepare better for future cases.\u201d",
      "Amnesty International, which had filed a brief in support of Jatupat's suit and has investigated the use of Pegasus spyware around the world, called the ruling \u201cdeeply alarming.\u201d",
      "\u201cHowever it won\u2019t deter the fight against the unlawful use of spyware and the fight for justice for the victims of spyware in Thailand and around the world,\" the rights group said in a statement.",
      "NSO Group has previously said it only develops the spyware and does not control its use. Its products, including the Pegasus software, are typically licensed to government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to investigate terrorism and serious crime, according to the company\u2019s website."

      "Treasurer Jim Chalmers said Musk\u2019s criticism was \u201cunsurprising\u201d after the government introduced to Parliament on Thursday legislation that would fine platforms including X up to 150 million Australian dollars ($133 million) if they allow children under age 16 to hold social media accounts.",
      "\u201cThe idea that Elon Musk is not delighted with our steps to try and protect kids online is not an especially big surprise to us, nor does it trouble us greatly,\u201d Chalmers told reporters.",

      "NEW YORK -- Bitcoin topped $98,000 for the first time Thursday, extending a streak of record after record highs since the U.S. presidential election. The cryptocurrency has rocketed more than 40% in just two weeks.",
      "Now, bitcoin is at the doorstep of $100,000, just two years after dropping below $17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. The recent, dramatic rally arrives as industry players expect the incoming Trump administration to bring a more \u201ccrypto-friendly\u201d approach toward regulating the digital currency.",
      "Bitcoin traded as high as $98,349 early Thursday, according to CoinDesk, and was slightly below that level at 1:25 p.m. ET.",
      "As with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is impossible to know. And while some are bullish, other experts continue to warn of investment risks.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now. But, chances are, you've heard about it more and more over the last few years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it\u2019s typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like ethereum, tether and dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.",
      "Crypto industry players have welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for \u2014 which, generally speaking, aim for an increased sense of legitimacy without too much red tape.",
      "Trump, who was once a crypto skeptic, recently pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "How of this will actually pan out \u2014 and whether or not Trump will successfully act quickly on these promises \u2014 has yet to be seen.",
      "\u201cThis is not necessarily a short-term story, it\u2019s likely a much longer-term story,\" Citi macro strategist David Glass told The Associated Press last week. \"And there is the question of how quickly can U.S. crypto policy make a serious impact on (wider adoption).\u201d",
      "Adam Morgan McCarthy, a research analyst at Kaiko, thinks the industry is craving \u201cjust some sort of clarity.\u201d Much of the approach to regulating crypto in the past has been \u201cenforcement based,\u201d he notes, which has been helpful in weeding out some bad actors \u2014 but legislation might fill in other key gaps.",
      "Gary Gensler, who as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission under President Joe Biden has led a U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry, penalized a number of crypto companies for violating securities laws. Gensler announced Thursday that he would step down as SEC chair on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day.",
      "Despite crypto\u2019s recent excitement around Trump, McCarthy said that 2024 has already been a \u201chugely consequential year for regulation in the U.S.\u201d \u2014 pointing to January\u2019s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, for example, which mark a new way to invest in the asset.",
      "Spot ETFs have been the dominant driver of bitcoin for some time now \u2014 but, like much of the crypto\u2019s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection. According to Kaiko, bitcoin ETFs recorded $6 billion in trade volume for the week of the election alone.",
      "In April, bitcoin also saw its fourth \u201chalving\u201d \u2014 a preprogrammed event that impacts production by cutting the reward for mining, or the creation of new bitcoin, in half. In theory, if demand remains strong, some analysts say this \u201csupply shock\u201d can also help propel the price long term. Others note it may be too early to tell.",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you\u2019ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes. And in late 2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with bitcoin falling below $17,000.",

Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin\u2019s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections",

      "Legislation for the world's first legal ban on children under 16 using social media has been introduced in Australia's Parliament",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s communications minister introduced a world-first law into Parliament on Thursday that would ban children under 16 from social media, saying online safety was one of parents\u2019 toughest challenges.",
      "Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cThis bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,\u201d she added.",
      "X owner Elon Musk warned that Australia intended to go further, posting on his platform: \u201cSeems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\u201d",
      "The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction.",
      "\u201cFor too many young Australians, social media can be harmful,\" Rowland said. \"Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits.\u201d",
      "Government research found that 95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their \"toughest parenting challenges,\u201d she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she added.",
      "\u201cThis is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we\u2019re in their corner when it comes to supporting their children\u2019s health and wellbeing,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks.",
      "Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users.",
      "\u201cWe are not saying risks don\u2019t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,\u201d she said.",
      "The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages.",
      "In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said.",
      "Age Check Certification Scheme\u2019s chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age.",
      "Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes.",
      "Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said.",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, said with Parliament expected to vote on the bill next week, there might not be time for \u201cmeaningful consultation on the details of the globally unprecedented legislation.\u201d",
      "\"Mainstream digital platforms have strict measures in place to keep young people safe, and a ban could push young people on to darker, less safe online spaces that don't have safety guardrails,\" DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. \u201cA blunt ban doesn't encourage companies to continually improve safety because the focus is on keeping teenagers off the service, rather than keeping them safe when they're on it.\u201d"

      "GRINDAVIK, Iceland -- A volcano in southwestern Iceland that has roared back to life after eight centuries of silence has erupted for the seventh time since December, sending molten lava flowing towards the Blue Lagoon spa, a major tourist attraction.",
      "The eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula started with little warning at 11:14 p.m. (2314 GMT) Wednesday and created a fissure around 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) long. The activity is estimated to be considerably smaller than the previous eruption in August, according to Iceland\u2019s meteorological office that monitors seismic activity.",
      "Most of the previous eruptions have subsided within days.",
      "\u201cIn the big picture, this is a bit smaller than the last eruption, and the eruption that occurred in May,\u201d Magn\u00fas Tumi Gu\u00f0mundsson, a professor of geophysics who flew over the scene with the Civil Protection agency to monitor the event, told national broadcaster RUV.",
      "While the eruption poses no threat to air travel, authorities warned of gas emissions across parts of the peninsula, including the nearby town of Grindav\u00edk, which was largely evacuated a year ago when the volcano came to life after lying dormant for 800 years.",
      "Around 50 houses were evacuated after the Civil Protection agency issued the alert, along with guests at the Blue Lagoon By Thursday afternoon lava had spread across parking lot of the geothermal spa, one of Iceland's biggest tourist attractions, consuming a service building.",
      "Lava also reached the pipeline that supplies the peninsula with hot water for heating, the meteorological office said, though the pipes were built to withstand lava flow.",
      "The repeated volcanic eruptions close to Grindav\u00edk, which is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the capital, Reykjavik, and had a population before the eruptions of 3,800, have damaged infrastructure and property, forcing many residents to relocate to guarantee their safety.",

      "Iceland, which sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic, averages one eruption every four to five years. The most disruptive in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted trans-Atlantic air travel for months.",

      "There's no surefire way to rank global AI leadership but Stanford researchers have made an attempt by measuring the \u201cvibrancy\u201d of the AI industry across various dimensions, from how much research and investment is happening to how responsibly the technology is being pursued to prevent harm.",
      "\u201cThe gap is actually widening\u201d between the U.S. and China, said computer scientist Ray Perrault, director of the steering committee that runs Stanford's AI Index. \u201cThe U.S. is investing a lot more, at least at the level of firm creation and firm funding.\u201d",

      "Here's which countries made the top 10:",
      "The U.S. ranks No. 1 on Stanford's list and has consistently held that position since 2018 when it overtook China. It has far outpaced China in private AI investment, which hit $67.2 billion in the U.S. last year compared to $7.8 billion in China, according to the report. It also leads in publishing responsible AI research. It's no surprise that the home of commercial AI powerhouses such as Google and Meta, along with relative newcomers like OpenAI and Anthropic, has produced many notable AI models that have influenced how the technology is being developed and applied. The U.S. also gets some points for having a number of AI-related laws on the books, though Congress has yet to pass any broad AI regulations.",
      "China has requested far more patents than any other country regarding generative AI, the U.N. intellectual property agency said earlier this year. Stanford researchers counted that as one measure of China's strong growth in AI innovation but not enough to lead the pack. Still, the report says that \"China\u2019s focus on developing cutting-edge AI technologies and increasing its R&D investments has positioned it as a major AI powerhouse.\u201d China's universities have produced a large number of AI-related research publications and it has commercial leaders developing notable AI models, such as Baidu and its chatbot Ernie.",
      "Coming in at No. 3 is the UK, which also ranked high in research and development, and educational infrastructure due to top computer science universities churning out a skilled AI workforce. It's also home to Google's AI subsidiary DeepMind, whose co-founder recently won a Nobel Prize; and \u201chad more mentions of AI in parliamentary proceedings\u201d than any other country. Last year, the UK hosted the world\u2019s first international AI safety summit.",
      "Close behind the UK was India, thanks to a \u201cstrong AI research community,\u201d improvements in economic investments tied to AI and a robust public discourse about AI on social media, according to the report.",
      "The UAE's deliberate focus on AI appears to have paid off in the Middle Eastern nation's fifth-place score. It was one of the top locations for AI investments. Microsoft earlier this year said it was investing $1.5 billion in UAE-based tech firm G42, which is overseen by the country\u2019s powerful national security adviser. Based in Abu Dhabi, G42 runs data centers and has built what\u2019s considered the world\u2019s leading Arabic-language AI model, known as Jais.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 are France at No. 6, followed by South Korea, Germany, Japan and Singapore. France, home to the buzzy AI startup Mistral, ranked high in AI policy and governance. Both it and Germany are part of the European Union's sweeping new AI Act that places safeguards on a range of AI applications based on how risky they are. The EU also follows the U.S. in developing a plan to expand semiconductor production within the bloc.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has signed off on a settlement agreement Wednesday in a class action lawsuit alleging that an algorithm designed to score rental applicants discriminated on the basis of race and income",
      "Mary Louis' excitement to move into an apartment in Massachusetts in the spring of 2021 turned to dismay when Louis, a Black woman, received an email saying that a \u201cthird-party service\u201d had denied her tenancy.",
      "That third-party service included an algorithm designed to score rental applicants, which became the subject of a class action lawsuit, with Louis at the helm, alleging that the algorithm discriminated on the basis of race and income.",
      "A federal judge approved a settlement in the lawsuit, one of the first of it's kind, on Wednesday, with the company behind the algorithm agreeing to pay over $2.2 million and roll back certain parts of it's screening products that the lawsuit alleged were discriminatory.",
      "The settlement does not include any admissions of fault by the company SafeRent Solutions, which said in a statement that while it \u201ccontinues to believe the SRS Scores comply with all applicable laws, litigation is time-consuming and expensive.\"",
      "While such lawsuits might be relatively new, the use of algorithms or artificial intelligence programs to screen or score Americans isn't. For years, AI has been furtively helping make consequential decisions for U.S. residents.",
      "When a person submits a job application, applies for a home loan or even seeks certain medical care, there\u2019s a chance that an AI system or algorithm is scoring or assessing them like it did Louis. Those AI systems, however, are largely unregulated, even though some have been found to discriminate.",
      "\u201cManagement companies and landlords need to know that they\u2019re now on notice, that these systems that they are assuming are reliable and good are going to be challenged,\u201d said Todd Kaplan, one of Louis\u2019 attorneys.",
      "The lawsuit alleged SafeRent's algorithm didn't take into account the benefits of housing vouchers, which they said was an important detail for a renter's ability to pay the monthly bill, and it therefore discriminated against low-income applicants who qualified for the aid.",
      "The suit also accused SafeRent's algorithm of relying too much on credit information. They argued that it fails to give a full picture of an applicant's ability to pay rent on time and unfairly dings applicants with housing vouchers who are Black and Hispanic partly because they have lower median credit scores, attributable to historical inequities.",
      "Christine Webber, one of the plaintiff's attorneys, said that just because an algorithm or AI is not programmed to discriminate, the data an algorithm uses or weights could have \"the same effect as if you told it to discriminate intentionally.\u201d",
      "When Louis' application was denied, she tried appealing the decision, sending two landlords' references to show she\u2019d paid rent early or on time for 16 years, even if she didn't have a strong credit history.",
      "Louis, who had a housing voucher, was scrambling, having already given notice to her previous landlord that she was moving out, and she was charged with taking care of her granddaughter.",
      "The response from the management company, which used SafeRent's screening service, read, \u201cWe do not accept appeals and cannot override the outcome of the Tenant Screening.\u201d",
      "Louis felt defeated; the algorithm didn\u2019t know her, she said.",
      "\u201cEverything is based on numbers. You don\u2019t get the individual empathy from them,\u201d said Louis. \"There is no beating the system. The system is always going to beat us.\u201d",
      "While state lawmakers have proposed aggressive regulations for these types of AI systems, the proposals have largely failed to get enough support. That means lawsuits like Louis\u2019 are starting to lay the groundwork for AI accountability.",
      "SafeRent\u2019s defense attorneys argued in a motion to dismiss that the company shouldn\u2019t be held liable for discrimination because SafeRent wasn\u2019t making the final decision on whether to accept or deny a tenant. The service would screen applicants, score them and submit a report, but leave it to landlords or management companies to accept or deny a tenant.",
      "Louis\u2019 attorneys, along with the U.S. Department of Justice, which submitted a statement of interest in the case, argued that SafeRent\u2019s algorithm could be held accountable because it still plays a role in access to housing. The judge denied SafeRent's motion to dismiss on those counts.",
      "The settlement stipulates that SafeRent can't include its score feature on its tenant screening reports in certain cases, including if the applicant is using a housing voucher. It also requires that if SafeRent develops another screening score it plans to use, it must be validated by a third-party that the plaintiffs agree to.",
      "Louis' son found an affordable apartment for her on Facebook Marketplace that she has since moved into, though it was $200 more expensive and in a less desirable area.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not optimistic that I\u2019m going to catch a break, but I have to keep on keeping, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Louis. \u201cI have too many people who rely on me.\u201d",

      "U.S. regulators are proposing aggressive measures to restore competition to the online search market after a federal judge ruled Google maintained an illegal monopoly for the last decade.",
      "The sweeping set of recommendations filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice could radically alter Google's business, including possibly spinning off the Chrome web browser and syndicating its search data to competitors. Even if the courts adopt the blueprint, Google isn't likely to make any significant changes until 2026 at the earliest, because of the legal system's slow-moving wheels.",
      "Here's what it all means:",
      "Federal prosecutors are cracking down on Google in a case originally filed during near the end of then-President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. Officials say the main goal of these proposals is to get Google to stop leveraging its dominant search engine to illegally squelch competition and stifle innovation.",
      "\u201cThe playing field is not level because of Google\u2019s conduct, and Google\u2019s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\u201d the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \u201cThe remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\u201d",
      "Not surprisingly, Google sees things much differently. The Justice Department's \u201cwildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the Court\u2019s decision,\u201d Kent Walker, Google's chief legal officer, asserted in a blog post. \u201cIt would break a range of Google products \u2014 even beyond search \u2014 that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still possible that the Justice Department could ease off on its attempts to break up Google, especially if President-elect Donald Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by President Joe Biden to oversee the agency\u2019s antitrust division.",
      "Regulators want Google to sell off its industry-leading Chrome web browser, though the filing did not specify who would ultimately buy the business or how that process would work.",
      "Justice lawyers called Chrome a \u201cgateway to the internet\u201d that provides the search giant with data it then uses for targeted advertising. Regulators believe that asking Google to divest Chrome would create a more equal playing field for search competitors.",
      "Chrome also is included in the set of apps bundled with Android on phones as part of a mobile device ecosystem that regulators say gives Google a big edge.",
      "Chrome is the world\u2019s most popular mobile web browser, with about 67% adoption globally, according to StatCounter. Apple\u2019s Safari browser has the next highest adoption at 18%.",
      "Although it could be years before we see any practical effects of this case on the market, it could mean users would see more search engine options when selecting a default one to use on their favored devices.",
      "While federal regulators aren't going as far as to demand Google spin off Android, they are leaving the door open.",
      "The government asked the judge to impose behavioral limitations that would essentially blunt Android from favoring Google\u2019s own general search services.",
      "Regulators asserted U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta should make it clear that Google could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if the other proposed measures prove ineffective at restoring competition to the search market.",
      "Android is the world's most popular smartphone operating system, found on 71% of mobile phones, Statcounter says. It\u2019s free to use, so many devices by Samsung and many other tech companies \u2014 aside from Apple \u2014 have it pre-installed.",
      "The Justice Department outlined a range of behavioral measures to give rival search engines a better chance at competing with Google.",
      "The core remedy is a ban on Google from cutting deals worth billions of dollars to lock in its search engine as the default option on Apple\u2019s iPhone and other popular devices. This could potentially impact the bottom line at companies receiving such packages.",
      "Other key recommendations:",
      "1. Prohibiting Google from using search results to favor its own services, such as YouTube or its recently-launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini.2. Forcing Google to license the search index data to its rivals. 3. Requiring Google to be more transparent about how it sets the prices advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results.4. Giving publishers, websites and content creators the right to opt out of having their data indexed for Google's search results or to train its artificial intelligence models.",

      "Google has the chance to submit its own list of proposed fixes in December, and federal regulators will file a revised version of their proposals in early March. Court hearings on these proposed measures are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is expected to issue a final decision before Labor Day.",
      "The remedies trial will take place after the Trump administration takes over from Biden in January and assumes oversight of the Department of Justice, which could impact the punishments it ultimately pursues.",
      "Although Trump has made comments suggesting a breakup of Google isn't in the U.S. national interest, recent nominations put forward by his transition team have favored those who have been critical of Big Tech companies. And the case was originally filed during Trump's first term, which suggests Google won\u2019t be entirely off the hook.",
      "Google is expected to appeal the case after the remedy hearings, which means the case could drag on for years in the courts."

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:26:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Regulators want a judge to break up Google to stop it squashing competition.",

      "Regulators want a judge to break up Google to stop it squashing competition.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "A sale of Chrome \u201cwill permanently stop Google\u2019s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet,\u201d Justice Department lawyers argued in their filing.",
      "Although regulators stopped short of demanding Google sell Android too, they asserted the judge should make it clear the company could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if its oversight committee continues to see evidence of misconduct.",
      "The broad scope of the recommended penalties underscores how severely regulators operating under President Joe Biden's administration believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded the company as a monopolist.",
      "The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the government's recommendations, Google would be forced to sell its 16-year-old Chrome browser within six months of the final ruling. But the company certainly would appeal any punishment, potentially prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and a corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple\u2019s iPhone and other devices. It would also ban Google from favoring its own services, such as YouTube or its recently-launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini.",
      "Regulators also want Google to license the search index data it collects from people\u2019s queries to its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant. On the commercial side of its search engine, Google would be required to provide more transparency into how it sets the prices that advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results.",
      "Kent Walker, Google\u2019s chief legal officer, lashed out at the Justice Department for pursuing \u201ca radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America\u2019s global technology.\u201d In a blog post, Walker warned the \u201coverly broad proposal\u201d would threaten personal privacy while undermining Google\u2019s early leadership in artificial intelligence, \u201cperhaps the most important innovation of our time.\u201d",
      "Wary of Google\u2019s increasing use of artificial intelligence in its search results, regulators also advised Mehta to ensure websites will be able to shield their content from Google\u2019s AI training techniques.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year.",
      "\u201cThe playing field is not level because of Google\u2019s conduct, and Google\u2019s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\u201d the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \u201cThe remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump\u2019s first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged many business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn\u2019t elaborate on alternative penalties he might have in mind. \u201cWhat you can do without breaking it up is make sure it\u2019s more fair,\u201d Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year\u2019s trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta\u2019s ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department\u2019s contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google, and the recommendation that Android should be completely walled off from the company's own search engine.",
      "\u201cIt is probably going a little beyond,\u201d Syracuse University law professor Shubha Ghosh said of the Chrome breakup. \u201cThe remedies should match the harm, it should match the transgression. This does seem a little beyond that pale.\u201d",
      "Google rival DuckDuckGo, whose executives testified during last year's trial, asserted the Justice Department is simply doing what needs to be done to rein in a brazen monopolist.",
      "\u201cUndoing Google\u2019s overlapping and widespread illegal conduct over more than a decade requires more than contract restrictions: it requires a range of remedies to create enduring competition,\u201d Kamyl Bazbaz, DuckDuckGo's senior vice president of public affairs, said in a statement.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

    "story": [
      "A New Hampshire company is working to develop a fleet of autonomous helicopters that it hopes can be used to put out fires, spray crops and handle other dangerous jobs",
      "HENNIKER, N.H. -- When Hector Xu was learning to fly a helicopter in college, he recalled having a few \u201cnasty experiences\u201d while trying to navigate at night.",
      "The heart-stopping flights led to his research of unmanned aircraft systems while getting his doctorate degree in aerospace engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Then, he formed Rotor Technologies in 2021 to develop unmanned helicopters.",
      "Rotor has built two autonomous Sprayhawks and aims to have as many as 20 ready for market next year. The company also is developing helicopters that would carry cargo in disaster zones and to offshore oil rigs. The helicopter could also be used to fight wildfires.",
      "For now, Rotor is focused on the agriculture sector, which has embraced automation with drones but sees unmanned helicopters as a better way to spray larger areas with pesticides and fertilizers.",
      "On Wednesday, Rotor plans to conduct a public flight test with its Sprayhawk at an agriculture aviation trade show in Texas.",
      "\u201cPeople would call us up and say, \u2018hey, I want to use this for crop dusting, can I?\u2019 We\u2019d say, OK maybe,\u201d Xu said, adding that they got enough calls to realize it was a huge untapped market. The Associated Press reporters were the first people outside the company to witness a test flight of the Sprayhawk. It hovered, flew forward and sprayed the tarmac before landing.",
      "Rotor's nearly $1 million Sprayhawk helicopter is a Robinson R44, but the four seats have been replaced with flight computers and communications systems allowing it be operated remotely. It has five cameras as well as laser-sensing technology and a radar altimeter that make terrain reading more accurate along with GPS and motion sensors.",
      "At the company's hangar in Nashua, New Hampshire, Xu said this technology means there is better visibility of terrain at night.",
      "One of the big draws of automation in agriculture aviation is safety.",
      "Because crop dusters fly at around 150 mph (240 kph) and only about 10 feet (3 meters) off the ground, there are dozens of accidents each year when planes collide with power lines, cell towers and other planes. Older, poorly maintained planes and pilot fatigue contribute to accidents.",
      "A 2014 report from the National Transportation Safety Board found there were more than 800 agriculture operation accidents between 2001 and 2010 including 81 that were fatal. A separate report from the National Agriculture Aviation Association found nearly 640 accidents from 2014 until this month with 109 fatalities.",
      "\u201cIt is a very, very dangerous, profession and there are multiple fatalities every year,\u201d said Dan Martin, a research engineer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service. \u201cThey make all their money in those short few months so sometimes it may mean that they fly 10 to 12 hours a day or more.\u201d",
      "Job hazards also include exposure to chemicals.",
      "In recent years, safety concerns and the cheaper cost has led to a proliferation of drones flying above farmers' fields, Martin said, adding that some 10,000 will likely be sold this year alone.",
      "\u201cIt's growing exponentially as a market, super fast,\u201d Martin said.",
      "But the size of the drones and their limited battery power means they only can cover a fraction of the area of a plane and helicopters. That is providing an opening for companies building bigger unmanned aircraft like Rotor and another company Pyka.",
      "California-based Pyka announced in August that it had sold its first autonomous electric aircraft for crop protection to a customer in the United States. Pyka's Pelican Spray, a fixed-wing aircraft, received FAA approval last year to fly commercially for crop protection. The company also sold its Pelican Spray to Dole for use in Honduras and to the Brazilian company, SLC Agr\u00edcola.",
      "Lukas Koch, chief technology officer at Heinen Brothers Agra Services, the company which bought the Pelican Spray in August, has called unmanned aircraft part of a coming \u201crevolution,\" that will save farmers money and improve safety.",
      "The Kansas-based company operates out of airports from Texas to Illinois. Koch doesn't envision the unmanned aircraft replacing all the the company's dozens of pilots but rather taking over the riskiest jobs.",
      "\u201cThe biggest draw is taking the pilot out of the aircraft inside of those most dangerous situations,\u201d Koch said. \u201cThere\u2019s still fields that are surrounded by trees on all borders, or you\u2019ve got big, large power lines or other just dangers, wind turbines, things like that. It can be tough to fly around.\u201d",
      "But Koch acknowledges autonomous aviation systems could introduce new dangers to an already chaotic airspace \u2014 though that is less of a concern in rural areas with plenty of open space and fewer people.",
      "\u201cPutting more systems into the air that don\u2019t have a pilot inside could introduce new dangers to our current existing pilots and make their life even more dangerous,\" he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got this full size helicopter flying beyond the line of sight, how is it going to react when it sees you? What is it going to do? ... That's a giant question mark, one that we take very seriously.\u201d",
      "Companies like Rotor have incorporated built-in in contingencies should something go wrong \u2014 its helicopter features a half-dozen communications systems and, for now, a remote pilot in control.",
      "If the ground team loses contact with the helicopter, Rotor has a system which Xu referred to as a big, red button that ensures the engine can be shut off and the helicopter perform a controlled landing. \u201cThat means that we\u2019ll never have an aircraft fly away event,\" he said.",
      "The safety measures will go a long way to helping the company receive what it expects will be FAA regulatory approval to fly its helicopters commercially. Once they have that, the challenge, as Xu sees it, will be scaling up to meet the demand in the United States but also Brazil which has a huge agriculture market but more relaxed regulatory environment.",
      "\u201cI think 2025 will be production hell as Elon Musk calls it,\u201d Xu said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the difference between building a couple to building tens and hundreds at scale ... These are no longer just like bespoke Rolls-Royces. You want to be stamping these out like you would production automobiles.\""

      "Nvidia has reported a surge in third-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems remains robust",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Nvidia on Wednesday reported a surge in third-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems remains robust.",
      "For the three months that ended Oct. 27, the tech giant based in Santa Clara, California, posted revenue of $35.08 billion, up 94% from $18.12 billion a year ago.",
      "Nvidia said it earned $19.31 billion in the quarter, more than double the $9.24 billion it posted in last year\u2019s third quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, it earned 81 cents a share.",
      "Wall Street analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of 75 cents a share on revenue of $33.17 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Investors took the results in stride, however, and Nvidia\u2019s high-flying stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trading. Shares in Nvidia Corp. are up 195% so far this year. Nvidia said it expects fourth quarter revenue to grow to $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts are expecting, on average, $37.09 billion.",
      "\u201cThe age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,\u201d Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s third-quarter data center revenue was $30.8 billion, up 112% from a year ago. That growth was driven by demand for the Hopper computing platform for large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications, the company said.",
      "Analysts\u2019 were eyeing Nvidia\u2019s guidance on its Blackwell graphics processor unit, a next-generation artificial intelligence chip that's seen demand from companies like OpenAI and others building AI data centers.",
      "Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.",
      "On an earnings call Wednesday, Kress told investors that both Hopper GPU and Blackwell systems \u201chave certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery customer is racing to be the first to market,\u201d Kress said. \u201cBlackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers.\u201d",
      "The company, seen as a bellwether for AI demand, will deliver \u201cmore Blackwells than we had previously estimated\u201d this quarter, Huang added.",
      "Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.",
      "The company carved out an early lead in AI applications race, in part because of Huang\u2019s successful bet on the chip technology used to fuel the industry. The company is no stranger to big bets. Nvidia\u2019s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. The company's third-quarter gaming revenue rose to $3.3 billion, an increase of 15% from a year ago.",
      "Nvidia's fourth-quarter guidance was \u201ca little bit disappointing,\u201d said David Volpe, senior fund manager at Emerald Insights Fund, but the company still had \u201ca tremendous quarter.\"",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing touching it in terms of the growth,\u201d Volpe said.",
      "Demand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia\u2019s specialized chips over the last year. Nvidia, the most valuable publicly traded company by market cap as of Wednesday morning, is now worth over $3.5 trillion, with analysts closely monitoring Nvidia's path to $4 trillion.",
      "Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the earnings report shows \u201cthe AI Revolution is still in the early innings of playing out.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe view this as a Nvidia earnings press release that should be hung in the Louvre,\u201d Ives said. \u201cBlackwell demand is just beginning. Any sell off (in Nvidia's stock) we would view as short lived, with our view this is a $4 trillion market cap in 2025 as the Godfather of AI Jensen (Huang) drives this spending wave.\u201d",
      "Through the year\u2019s first six months, Nvidia\u2019s stock soared nearly 150%. At that point, the stock was trading at a little more than 100 times the company\u2019s earnings over the prior 12 months. That\u2019s much more expensive than it\u2019s been historically and than the S&P 500 in general.",
      "\u201cThe age of AI is upon us,\" Huang said on the call. \"And it\u2019s large and diverse.\u201d"

      "Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which dominates the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which dominates the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom.",
      "But the same qualities that make those graphics processor chips, or GPUs, so effective at creating powerful AI systems from scratch make them less efficient at putting AI products to work.",
      "That's opened up the AI chip industry to rivals who think they can compete with Nvidia in selling so-called AI inference chips that are more attuned to the day-to-day running of AI tools and designed to reduce some of the huge computing costs of generative AI.",
      "\u201cThese companies are seeing opportunity for that kind of specialized hardware,\u201d said Jacob Feldgoise, an analyst at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cThe broader the adoption of these models, the more compute will be needed for inference and the more demand there will be for inference chips.\u201d",
      "It takes a lot of computing power to make an AI chatbot. It starts with a process called training or pretraining \u2014 the \u201cP\u201d in ChatGPT \u2014 that involves AI systems \u201clearning\u201d from the patterns of huge troves of data. GPUs are good at doing that work because they can run many calculations at a time on a network of devices in communication with each other.",
      "However, once trained, a generative AI tool still needs chips to do the work \u2014 such as when you ask a chatbot to compose a document or generate an image. That's where inferencing comes in. A trained AI model must take in new information and make inferences from what it already knows to produce a response.",
      "GPUs can do that work, too. But it can be a bit like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.",
      "\u201cWith training, you\u2019re doing a lot heavier, a lot more work. With inferencing, that\u2019s a lighter weight,\u201d said Forrester analyst Alvin Nguyen.",
      "That's led startups like Cerebras, Groq and d-Matrix as well as Nvidia's traditional chipmaking rivals \u2014 such as AMD and Intel \u2014 to pitch more inference-friendly chips as Nvidia focuses on meeting the huge demand from bigger tech companies for its higher-end hardware.",
      "D-Matrix, which is launching its first product this week, was founded in 2019 \u2014 a bit late to the AI chip game, as CEO Sid Sheth explained during a recent interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in Santa Clara, California, the same Silicon Valley city that's also home to AMD, Intel and Nvidia.",
      "\u201cThere were already 100-plus companies. So when we went out there, the first reaction we got was \u2018you\u2019re too late,\u2019\u201d he said. The pandemic's arrival six months later didn't help as the tech industry pivoted to a focus on software to serve remote work.",
      "Now, however, Sheth sees a big market in AI inferencing, comparing that later stage of machine learning to how human beings apply the knowledge they acquired in school.",
      "\u201cWe spent the first 20 years of our lives going to school, educating ourselves. That\u2019s training, right?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the next 40 years of your life, you kind of go out there and apply that knowledge \u2014 and then you get rewarded for being efficient.\u201d",
      "The product, called Corsair, consists of two chips with four chiplets each, made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company \u2014 the same manufacturer of most of Nvidia's chips \u2014 and packaged together in a way that helps to keep them cool.",
      "The chips are designed in Santa Clara, assembled in Taiwan and then tested back in California. Testing is a long process and can take six months \u2014 if anything is off, it can be sent back to Taiwan.",
      "D-Matrix workers were doing final testing on the chips during a recent visit to a laboratory with blue metal desks covered with cables, motherboards and computers, with a cold server room next door.",
      "While tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have been gobbling up the supply of costly GPUs in a race to outdo each other in AI development, makers of AI inference chips are aiming for a broader clientele.",
      "Forrester's Nguyen said that could include Fortune 500 companies that want to make use of new generative AI technology without having to build their own AI infrastructure. Sheth said he expects a strong interest in AI video generation.",
      "\u201cThe dream of AI for a lot of these enterprise companies is you can use your own enterprise data,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cBuying (AI inference chips) should be cheaper than buying the ultimate GPUs from Nvidia and others. But I think there\u2019s going to be a learning curve in terms of integrating it.\u201d",
      "Feldgoise said that, unlike training-focused chips, AI inference work prioritizes how fast a person will get a chatbot's response.",
      "He said another whole set of companies is developing AI hardware for inference that can run not just in big data centers but locally on desktop computers, laptops and phones.",
      "Better-designed chips could bring down the huge costs of running AI to businesses. That could also affect the environmental and energy costs for everyone else.",
      "Sheth says the big concern right now is, \u201care we going to burn the planet down in our quest for what people call AGI \u2014 human-like intelligence?\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still fuzzy when AI might get to the point of artificial general intelligence \u2014 predictions range from a few years to decades. But, Sheth notes, only a handful of tech giants are on that quest.",
      "\u201cBut then what about the rest?\u201d he said. \u201cThey cannot be put on the same path.\u201d",
      "The other set of companies don\u2019t want to use very large AI models \u2014 it\u2019s too costly and uses too much energy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if people truly, really appreciate that inference is actually really going to be a much bigger opportunity than training. I don\u2019t think they appreciate that. It\u2019s still training that is really grabbing all the headlines,\u201d Sheth said.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 20:34:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
    "story": [
      "Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of its cable television networks that were once at the heart of the entertainment giant, as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comcast is spinning off into a new company many of the cable television networks that were once at the entertainment giant's heart as consumers increasingly swap out their cable TV subscriptions for streaming platforms.",
      "Those one-time stars for Comcast's NBCUniversal cable television networks include USA, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel, as well as CNBC and MSNBC. Movie ticketing platform Fandango and the Rotten Tomatoes movie rating site will also become part of the new company.",
      "Streaming service Peacock will remain with Comcast, as will Bravo, which provides significant content for the Peacock streaming service, and other assets like the NBCUniversal's studios and theme parks.",
      "Comcast telegraphed the shift last month, before confirming Wednesday that it will spin off assets that generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months ending Sept. 30. That\u2019s about 5.5% of Comcast\u2019s total revenue during that period, according to the company.",
      "How exactly this split will impact customers is not yet clear. Experts maintain it\u2019s too early to tell, given that Comcast aims to complete the transition over the next year.",
      "Some analysts speculate that the spun-off networks may have more freedom to bring their content elsewhere. That could mean you'll have more options to find and curate what you want to watch and where \u2014 or headaches from juggling several different subscriptions in an already-fractured media landscape.",
      "Wednesday's announcement arrives as more and more people \u201ccut the cord\u201d on cable, with millions canceling service subscriptions every year \u2014 and instead signing up for streaming platforms.",
      "Paul Verna, principal analyst and vice president of content for market research company eMarketer, said Comcast\u2019s decision to divest itself from most of its cable TV channels is a reflection of that trend.",
      "\u201cThe writing is on the wall that the cable TV business is a dwindling business,\u201d Verna said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Comcast did what it did today.\u201d",
      "Mike Proulx, a vice president and research director of Forrester, added that the spin-off marks \u201csimply a reconciliation of assets that detract from the company\u2019s inevitable all streaming future.\u201d",
      "Comcast expects the new company, which it referred to as \u201cSpinCo\u201d Wednesday, to have the financial flexibility to be \u201ca potential partner and acquirer of other complementary media businesses.\u201d And Mark Lazarus, the current chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group who will serve as the new entity\u2019s CEO, said Wednesday that the standalone company \u201cwill be better positioned to serve our audiences and drive shareholder returns.\u201d",
      "Like other cable companies, Comcast in recent years has shifted its business emphasis away from traditional cable toward streaming and other sources of revenue, such as its movie studio, theme parks and home wireless and internet services.",
      "Despite a slightly confusing, glitchy start, Peacock has been one of the company's biggest success stories, with recent boosts gained in part by the streaming platform's popularity during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. In its most recent quarter, Comcast reported that paid Peacock subscribers jumped by 3 million, or 29%, to 36 million subscribers. Peacock\u2019s revenue soared 82% to $1.5 billion in the period.",
      "Dropping \u201cmoney-losing assets\u201d to instead focus on these kinds of lucrative business is clearly beneficial to Comcast, Verna said \u2014 but the future of a new company housing primarily cable networks is less promising. He said he finds it hard \u201cto envision that this company will stay independent for a long time,\" predicting future consolidation of the networks or acquisitions through private equity.",
      "Howard Gutman, private equity strategy and coverage lead for MorganFranklin Consulting, also expects consolidation to be in the cards. He noted the spin-off might entice bigger streaming services that are in search of more content, for example, to buy up these kinds of assets.",
      "That could mean watchers of the Golf Channel, for example, finding its content on what were once rival platforms. But the spun-off assets might also find more power to focus on priorities specific to them under a smaller company umbrella, Gutman added. That would potentially open the door for networks like CNBC to further monetize its own content or expand its brand.",
      "\u201cI think it will open up opportunities,\u201d he said, adding that customers will also have more options to curate subscriptions based on what interests them the most.",
      "Verna is less optimistic. He pointed to a history of changes in the media landscape that has repeatedly been tough for consumers.",
      "People already have a hard time figuring out where to watch or stream something they're looking for, Verna said, and deals to license or spread that out further could worsen that. And paying for more and more services adds up, particularly as platforms have hiked prices over time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too early to know what impact (the Comcast spin-offs) will have .... But I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath (on there being) a net benefit to consumers,\u201d Verna said. \u201cConsumers are the ones who are supposed to be driving these trends, and to some extent they are. But they also tend to get the short end of the stick every time.\u201d",
      "The spin-off is targeted for completion in about a year, the entertainment giant said Wednesday, pending financing and approval from its board and government regulators.",
      "Beyond Lazarus' appointment to CEO of the new company, Anand Kini, the current chief financial officer of NBCUniversal, will take on the same title with the new company as well as the chief operating officer role.",
      "Shares of Comcast, based in Philadelphia, ended up 1.6% Wednesday.",
      "Comcast reported revenue of more than $32 billion and profit of $1.12 per share in its most recent quarter, boosted by the summer box-office success of \"Despicable Me 4,\" which grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",

      "Bondi and Trump both denied allegations that the donation led to her decision to not join the lawsuit, which had been filed by the New York attorney general's office.",
      "She endorsed Trump for his presidential run and spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention, leading a \"lock her up chant\" against then-Secretary of State Hilary Clinton.",
      "She also served as a co-chair of Trump's reelection bid and spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2020.",
      "Bondi was elected attorney general in 2010 and was reelected in 2014. She left the office after reaching her two-term limit in 2019.",
      "A year later, she was selected as part of Trump's defense team for his first impeachment trial. He was acquitted in the Senate.",
      "Bondi has also been a registered lobbyist since 2019 at Brian Ballard's firm, Ballard Partners. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, is also a lobbyist with the firm.",
      "Bondi\u2019s most recent clients include the Florida Sheriffs' Association, the Florida Sheriffs' Risk Management Fund and the Major County Sheriffs of America. Her quarterly retainer fees range from $20,000 to $50,000, federal lobbying disclosures show.",
      "She has previously represented investment firms and corporate clients like Amazon, General Motors, the MLB, Fidelity, Uber and the GEO Group, which is a private prison company, according to filings.",
      "In 2019 and 2020, Bondi was engaged in consulting and advocacy services on behalf of the Embassy of the State of Qatar regarding \"matters involving anti-human trafficking,\" foreign lobbying disclosures filed by Ballard Partners show. Bondi registered as a foreign agent for the government of Qatar as part of her lobbying work.",
      "After his impeachment trial, Bondi remained with Trump's legal team while he campaigned in 2020 and repeatedly made false claims about voter fraud when he lost to Joe Biden.",
      "Recently, she has been a member of the conservative think tank America First Policy Institute, which was formed by former Trump administration officials. She serves as AFPI's chair for the Center for Litigation, and co-chair of the Center for Law and Justice, according to the think tank's website.",
      "Bondi and AFPI attorneys were involved in preemptive election lawsuits in battleground states during this year's election.",
      "Trump has previously named his other personal attorneys to senior roles in the Department of Justice, including Todd Blanche, Emil Bove and D. John Sauer.",

      "Texas education officials will soon decide if a controversial Bible-infused curriculum can be taught in public schools",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas would allow Bible-infused lessons in elementary schools under changes that were set for a final vote Friday and could test boundaries between religion and public education in the U.S.",
      "The proposed curriculum narrowly cleared a preliminary vote this week at the Texas State Board of Education, whose elected members heard hours of sometimes impassioned pleas from both supporters and critics over the material that schools could begin using next year.",
      "If adopted, the new Texas curriculum would follow Republican-led efforts in neighboring states to give religion more of a presence in public schools. In Oklahoma, the state's education chief has ordered a copy of the Bible in every classroom, while Louisiana wants to make all of the state\u2019s public school classrooms post the Ten Commandments beginning next year.",
      "In Texas, it would be optional for schools to adopt the materials, but they\u2019d receive additional funding if they do so.",
      "If the board advances the curriculum, Texas would be the first state to introduce Bible lessons in schools in this manner, according to Matthew Patrick Shaw, an assistant professor of public policy and education at Vanderbilt University.",
      "The Texas Education Agency, which oversees public education for more than 5 million students statewide, created its own instruction materials after a law passed in 2023 by the GOP-controlled Legislature required the agency to do so. The lesson plans were publicly released this spring.",
      "The material draws on lessons from Christianity more than any other religion in the proposed reading and language arts modules for kindergarten through fifth grade, which critics say would alienate students from different faith backgrounds and potentially violate the First Amendment.",
      "\u201cThis curriculum is not age-appropriate or subject matter appropriate in the way that it presents these Bible stories,\u201d said Amanda Tyler, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty.",
      "Children who would read the material, she said, \u201care simply too young to tell the difference between what is a faith claim and what is a matter of fact.\u201d",
      "More than 100 people testified at a board meeting this week that rung with emotion from parents, teachers and advocates. Supporters of the curriculum argued that the Bible is a core feature of American history and teaching it will enrich students\u2019 learning.",
      "\u201cIt is said that there are close to 300 common-day phrases that actually come from the Bible,\u201d said Mary Castle, director of government relations for Texas Values, a right-leaning advocacy group. \"So students will benefit from being able to understand a lot of these references that are in literature and have a way to be able to comprehend them.\u201d",
      "The 15-member board consists of 11 Republicans and four Democrats. It signaled support for the materials in a 8-7 preliminary vote on Wednesday.",
      "One of the board members is a Republican who was appointed to the board just weeks ago by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to temporarily fill a vacant seat. Days after that appointment, a Democrat who ran unopposed was elected to fill that same board seat starting next year.",
      "Abbott has publicly supported the instruction materials.",
      "Whether the lesson plans will be considered constitutional is up in the air if the curriculum passes, Shaw said.",
      "\u201cThe question is how is Texas going to frame what is done here to avoid the establishment question or tackle it head-on,\u201d he said.",
      "Texas' plans to implement Biblical teachings in public school lesson plans is the latest effort by Republican-controlled states to bring religion into the classroom.",
      "In Louisiana, a law to place the Ten Commandments in all public classrooms was blocked by a federal judge earlier this month. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill into law in June, prompting a group of Louisiana public school parents of different faiths to sue.",
      "In Oklahoma, the state's top education official has tried to incorporate the Bible into lesson plans for children in fifth through 12th grades. A group of teachers and parents recently filed a lawsuit to stop the Republican state superintendent's plan and his efforts to spend $3 million to purchase Bibles for public schools.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 22:33:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Two lawmakers to introduce bills to 'eliminate' the Department of Education.",
    "story": [
      "Republicans Mike Rounds and Thomas Massie want to abolish the DOE.",
      "South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds introduced the \"Returning Education Back to Our States Act\" on Thursday, signaling a commitment to deliver on President-elect Donald Trump's vow to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "In the conservative movement to return education back to local control, Rounds said the legislation would \"eliminate\" the department while redistributing all critical federal programs to other agencies.",
      "Rounds' announcement was first reported by Fox News.",
      "\"For years, I've worked toward removing the federal Department of Education,\" the Republican senator wrote in a statement, adding \"I'm pleased that President-elect Trump shares this vision, and I'm excited to work with him and Republican majorities in the Senate and House to make this a reality. This legislation is a roadmap to eliminating the federal Department of Education by practically rehoming these federal programs in the departments where they belong, which will be critical as we move into next year.\"",
      "In his statement, Rounds said the United States spends too much on education for students' test scores to be lagging behind other countries in standardized assessments. He called the DOE ineffective and earmarked the department's responsibilities for the Departments of Interior, Treasury, Health and Human Services, Labor and State, according to the bill text.",
      "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and aid programs under Title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act will be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of Indian Education of the Department of Education will be transferred to the Department of the Interior, the Federal Pell Grant and other higher education loan programs will be transferred to the Department of the Treasury.",
      "According to the bill, the treasury department will allocate Block grants to states for K-12 and postsecondary education. The treasury secretary also has the power to withhold these funds if they are mishandled by the states. The Justice Department will oversee federal civil rights laws that were previously under Title VI.",
      "Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie told ABC News Thursday morning that he would also bring forward legislation to abolish the DOE within the \"first few weeks\" of the 119th Congress.",
      "\"There'll be one sentence - only thing that will change is the date: The Department of Education shall terminate on December 31, 2026,\" Massie told ABC News.",
      "Massie has been pushing to defund the U.S. Department of Education since the start of 2023 when he introduced H.R. 899. Massie's bill wasn't voted on in the House last year.",
      "However, education analyst Neal McCluskey at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, argued Massie's one-sentence bill was not realistic.",
      "\"You've got to figure out what to do with all the legislation that feeds into the Department of Education,\" McCluskey said.",
      "\"If Congress were to pass that law that says, abolish the Department of Education, technically the department would go away, but then you'd have all sorts of questions, well, who's going to administrate or be administrator for all these programs,\" he said.",
      "In March 2023, Massie wrote an amendment H.Amendment 124 in H.R. 5, the \"Parents Bill of Rights Act\" \u2013 the House's signature K-12 education policy \u2013 to abolish the department. That amendment failed as all Democrats and 60 House Republicans voted against it.",
      "Here are ways to gut the department",
      "Even as Republicans hold majorities in both chambers next Congress, the Senate typically needs 60 votes to do anything, according to McCluskey. McCluskey said, \"There's no chance they're going to be at 60, and so it's going to be tough [to abolish the department legislatively].\"",
      "\"The Department of Education administers a whole lot of laws, and then those laws have to be changed about who runs student aid and who is tasked with making decisions about canceling student debt, and who decides or who administers Title I and lots of these other federal programs,\" McCluskey told ABC News.",
      "\"He [President-elect Trump] can certainly use the bully pulpit to drive this a lot. He could provide legislative blueprints if he wanted to. But ultimately this has to come through Congress,\" McCluskey underscored.",
      "Meanwhile, Augustus Mays, vice president for partnerships and engagement at the advocacy group The Education Trust, told ABC News that the president-elect could also ask Congress to gut federal programs like Title 1, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), and others, in his congressional budget request.",
      "Public education, particularly in high-need districts, would effectively be drained of millions of dollars, according to Mays.",
      "\"It would really cripple the ability to function and aid the support that these students need to really succeed from an academic standpoint,\" Mays said.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump is seeking to cash in on his election win by selling new merchandise like Trump Boots and Trump Coins, but experts say there could be conflicts of interest.",
    "story": [
      "The president-elect has made millions licensing his name and image for profit.",
      "On the campaign trail, Donald Trump hawked apparel and keepsakes promoting his presidential bid in what experts ABC spoke with characterized as an unprecedented effort to commoditize his political platform.",
      "Now, after his triumph at the polls, the president-elect is again seeking to cash in on his personal brand with a fresh line of goods, from a pair of $299 \"Trump Landslide\" boots to a $69.99 special inaugural edition of his God Bless the USA Bible.",
      "As the former president prepares to return to the Oval Office, experts warned that the opaque structure of the companies that produce these items could create fresh conflicts of interest for Trump -- with few public details about who Trump is in business with and how much he profits.",
      "\"We've never seen a president merchandise like this,\" said Jordan Libowitz, a vice president at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit watchdog group. \"Tracking partners is very difficult unless they come forward, and there's no way to know for sure.\"",
      "Compared to his $3 billion stake in his social media company and his multimillion-dollar buildings, Trump's licensing deals comprise only a fraction of his portfolio -- but his opaque deals can be ethical \"black boxes\" that escape outside scrutiny according to Libowitz.",
      "Without knowing who the president-elect is in business with, it's impossible to know if he might use the power of his office to help his bottom line or benefit his business partners or whoever is contributing money to him, Libowitz said.",
      "Trump has entered into the licensing agreements through two companies -- CIC Ventures LLC and CIC Digital LLC -- that are fully owned by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust. According to a 2023 financial disclosure, Trump made more than $7 million though CIC Digital LLC, which entered a licensee agreement for the sale of nonfungible tokens or NFTs.",
      "Trump used CIC Ventures LLC to make more than $5 million through bible and book sales, and information is not yet public about how much Trump has made from other deals like his watches and shoes.",
      "Those companies quickly launched new items following Trump's electoral victory. Trump Sneakers unveiled a full line of \"Trump Won\" footwear, including a gold pair of low-top sneakers for $499. Trump Coins unveiled a one-ounce \"Victory Gold Medallion\" -- with the president-elect's face and signature pressed in solid gold -- for $3,645.47, a thousand-dollar upcharge compared to the price of an ounce of gold. And Trump Watches unveiled a \"Victory Collection\" priced between $599 and $1,299.",
      "\"Donald Trump proved his greatest skill was as a salesman, selling mostly junk products, and he hasn't stopped,\" said Robert Weissman, co-president of the progressive watchdog group Public Citizen.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump announced a new plan to sell electric and acoustic guitars with a company called \"Trump Guitars.\"",
      "The instruments -- which include the phrase \"Make America Great Again\" in pearl inlay -- start at $1,250. A limited version of the guitars signed by Trump is on sale for $11,250. Details about where the guitars are made and how much profit, if any, Trump makes from the sales, were not immediately available, and Trump Guitars did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Items like Trump sneakers and watches are distinct from the merchandise Trump sells through his campaign website, which offers everything from Make America Great Again hats to Christmas ornaments. The profit from those purchases goes toward Trump's joint fundraising committee, which is subject to rigorous reporting requirements for political contributions.",
      "But the external companies that Trump licenses to sell his other items aren't subject to oversight. It's an approach that Trump has taken for decades: Making money from his brand by selling everything from steaks to vodka with limited involvement, by outsourcing the design, production, and distribution of the goods under license to separate companies, about which little is often known.",
      "For someone in power, like the president, that arrangement can create \"areas of potential concern,\" according to Weissman.",
      "Details about the terms of Trump's agreements with the merchandise companies -- such as JBCZ Group LLC for his coins or TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC for his watches -- are not public, and the LLCs are registered in states that offer few details about the companies' ownership.",
      "Some of Trump's merchandise -- such as his NFTs or watches -- also sell for wildly high prices that create an avenue for individuals, including potentially foreign actors, to channel money to Trump, according to Libowitz. Trump Watches is currently offering a \"Trump Victory Tourbillon\" watch for $100,000.",
      "\"That kind of seems like it is a way to put money directly in his pockets,\" said Libowitz, who believes the watch is likely worth a fraction of its asking price. \"It's an opportunity to give money directly to him and let him know that.\"",
      "Trump Watches, Trump Coins, Trump Sneakers, and God Bless The USA Bible did not respond to ABC News' request for comment, and nor did a spokesperson for Trump's transition team.",
      "When Trump entered the White House in 2017, he resigned as the trustee of Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust and passed control to his sons and a business partner to avoid potential conflicts of interest. The setup allowed Trump to still profit from his businesses while relinquishing control of day-to-day operations and decisions.",
      "While he regained control of the Trust when he left office in 2021, it's expected that he'll again hand over control when he returns to office in January -- although experts say the arrangement is unlikely to shed additional light on his licensing deals.",
      "\"He's not constrained by any norms or regulations,\" said Weissman. \"He'll disclose what he wants to disclose.\"",
      "And with Trump's presidency two months away, watchdog groups worry that weak enforcement of ethics rules could become pervasive throughout the federal government if Trump doesn't set a strong example.",
      "\"This kind of thing trickles down,\" said Scott Amey, general counsel at the nonprofit Project on Government Accountability. \"It would be great to lead from the top.\"",

      "ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl reports that one senior Trump adviser said the message to lawmakers is, \"If you are on the wrong side of the vote, you're buying yourself a primary.\"",
      "\"That is all,\" the adviser told Karl. \"And there's a guy named Elon Musk who is going to finance it.\"",
      "\"The president gets to decide his Cabinet. No one else,\" the adviser added.",
      "The threat came as Matt Gaetz and Pete Hegseth (tapped for attorney general and defense secretary, respectively) made the rounds on Capitol Hill this week to shore up support. They were escorted by Vice President-elect JD Vance, the junior senator from Ohio.",

      "Gaetz faces allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, which he's long denied, that was the subject of a federal investigation and a House Ethics Committee probe. Hegseth has been accused of sexual assaulting a woman in 2017, an encounter Hegseth told police was consensual.",
      "Trump stood firm with the selections, which also raised eyebrows for their relative lack of experience to lead the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense. Trump said it was ultimately Gaetz's choice to withdraw.",
      "Some of the president-elect's other picks have similarly faced scrutiny over their qualifications, including Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services.",
      "Trump previously made a demand for Republican leadership to back so-called \"recess appointments\" to skirt the traditional confirmation process. That route would require lawmakers to adjourn and for senators to give up the \"advice and consent\" role they play in nominations, as laid out in the Constitution.",
      "But his demand is being met with some resistance from some Senate Republicans.",

      "Gaetz, for his part, has only expressed an intent not to take the oath of office for the 119th Congress -- which begins on Jan. 3, 2025, and for which Gaetz won reelection. He cannot preemptively resign from a session of Congress that has not yet convened or that he has not taken an oath to serve -- that means he is still eligible to serve in the 119th although he cannot under any circumstances withdraw his resignation from the 118th to return to the lame duck session, according to House rules.",
      "The House clerk read a resignation letter from Gaetz on Nov. 14 -- after President-elect Donald Trump named his as his attorney general pick -- which read: \"I hereby resign as a United States representative for Florida's first congressional district, effective immediately. And I do not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress to pursue the position of Attorney General in the Trump administration.\"",
      "If Gaetz changes his mind and alerts the House Clerk that he intends to serve in the 119th Congress, then he could be sworn in since a special election to fill the expected vacancy has not yet been scheduled.",
      "The rules of the House of Representatives mandates that at the beginning of the first session of Congress, members must make their presence known to occupy their seat.

      "Doe said she remembered Hegseth's military dog-tags \"hovering over her face\" and said he eventually \"ejaculated on her stomach,\" according to the report. Doe told police that she recalled saying \"no\" a lot during the encounter.",
      "Days later, Doe told her partner she believed she had been the victim of a sexual assault and visited a nurse, who administered a sexual assault examination and first alerted the authorities.",
      "When police approached Hegseth as part of their investigation, he \"stated that the engagement between himself and JANE DOE was mutual.\"",
      "\"HEGSETH stated there were a couple of times he had made sure JANE DOE was comfortable with what was going on between the two of them,\" according to the report.",
      "The officer who prepared the report wrote that the two had \"been drinking and the events were blurred and lacked specifics and a fluid sequence of events.\" Investigators obtained video surveillance from the hotel and collected Doe's clothes and underwear as evidence in their probe.",
      "Tim Parlatore, a lawyer for Hegseth, said in the statement on Saturday, prior to the report being posted online, that the allegations were false and Hegseth settled in December 2020 only because he feared his career would suffer if her allegations were made public.",
      "Parlatore emphasized police did not bring charges and said Hegseth was the victim of \"blackmail\" and \"false claims of sexual assault.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:01:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Even though Gaetz has withdrawn from consideration to be Trump's attorney general, Democrats will continue to try to force the Ethics Committee to release its report..",
    "story": [
      "Casten: \"No workplace would allow that information to be swept under the rug.\"",
      "Even though former Rep. Matt Gaetz has withdrawn from consideration to be President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general, Illinois Democratic Rep. Sean Casten said Thursday that he'll continue to try to compel the House Ethics Committee to release its report on Gaetz.",
      "\u201cWhile I welcome the news that Matt Gaetz is withdrawing from consideration for Attorney General, it remains important that the Gaetz report be made available to the American people,\u201d Casten said in a statement.",
      "Casten and Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee introduced privileged resolutions on Wednesday to try to force the committee to release the report after the Ethics Committee voted along party lines not to disclose it. Under House rules, once a privileged resolution is introduced, the House must take it up within two legislative days. Republicans have the majority in the House and leadership will decide when the resolution is brought up for a vote. Republicans will attempt to block the effort but it's not yet clear how this could play out.",
      "In an interview with ABC News Live on Thursday, Kasten pushed back on accusations that continuing to seek the report's release was partisan. He said a precedent had already been set for Ethics to continue its efforts, pointing to the case of former Democratic Rep. Eric Massa, who resigned from the House in 2010 amid accusations he had groped members of his staff. Despite Massa's resignation, the Ethics Committee voted to reauthorize its investigation the following year.",
      "The Ethics Committee was investigating allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift.",
      "\"No workplace would allow that information to be swept under the rug simply because someone resigned for office,\" Casten said. \"It matters for the integrity of the law, it matters for the integrity of this House and it matters for the respect that we expect the American people to give us that those of us entrusted with this job will uphold the United States as a land where all are treated equally under the law.\"",
      "On Thursday, Cohen posted on X that the Ethics Committee will have another chance to release the report when it meets in December. \"I hope they'll do the right thing. But we can't count on it. That's why I introduced a resolution yesterday to force the release of the report,\" he wrote.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson has opposed releasing the report, saying that the Ethics Committee customarily drops its investigations once a member has left Congress. Gaetz resigned last week shortly after Trump announced his intention to nominate him for ABC. Johnson said Thursday the House will take up the resolutions after it returns from its Thanksgiving break.",
      "House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said \u201cYes\u201d when asked if the report should be public, so it's likely the Democratic caucus will stand behind the efforts to force the report's release.",

Kennedy, Biden welcomed the NBA\u2019s 2024 champions and gave them a tour of the Oval Office. In all, the league\u2019s most-decorated franchise has won at least one title in eight of the last 13 presidential administrations.",
      "\u201cThe Celtics aren\u2019t just a basketball team. They\u2019re a way of life,\u201d Biden told the crowd, quoting Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach before receiving a No. 46 jersey from All-Star Jayson Tatum and guard Derrick White.",

      "Biden, who was once one of the youngest senators in U.S. history and is now the country\u2019s oldest president ever, said he felt a kinship with Mazzulla, who was 35 when he led the Celtics to the title in his second season.",

      "The Celtics were greeted with a band playing \u201cShipping up to Boston,\u201d before Biden and team owner Wyc Grousbeck joined them on the risers facing the Washington Monument; green lights shined from from the eaves of the White House behind them. Among those in attendance were Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and most of the state\u2019s congressional delegation.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really know what to expect. I walked in, I was like 'I\u2019m more excited than I thought I was going be,\u201d White told reporters afterward. \u201cTo be in the White House, to be where all the decisions \u2014 all the cool things \u2014 are happening, that was the best part.\u201d",

They went 16-3 in the playoffs, eliminating the Dallas Mavericks in five games.",
      "Biden even noted that the \u201924 Celtics had the highest ratio of points per possession in NBA history \u2013 one of the wonkier stats, but one that had team vice president and stats guru Mike Zarren beaming.",

      "\u201cThis was a very exciting and moving day,\u201d Grousbeck told reporters in a video call afterwards. \u201cWe had not been focused on this. We got through the banner and opening night, and then it was all business. Joe (Mazzulla) doesn\u2019t want us to dwell too much on the past, he wants everyone to focus on moving forward. Having said that, everyone here, including Joe, seemed to have a great time.\u201d",
      "Zarren said he spoke to a Secret Service agent who was a Celtics fan and had to bear with the Golden State Warriors\u2019 visit two years ago.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 20:05:39 -0500",
    "summary": "After offering the Trump administration land for \"deportation facilities,\" other parts of Texas near the border could be offered up, too, an official says.",
    "story": [
      "The official said the land could be used to build \"deportation facilities.\"",
      "A Texas official, who this week offered the incoming Trump administration a 1,402-acre plot of land to build \"deportation facilities,\" says other parts of Texas near the border could be offered up in a similar fashion.",
      "\"Absolutely -- I have 13 million acres, if any of them can be of help in this process, we're happy to have that discussion,\" Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham told ABC's Mireya Villarreal in an interview.",
      "The Texas General Land Office purchased the plot of land from a farmer in October originally to facilitate Texas' efforts to build a border wall. Together with this land, the state office owns about 4,000 acres in Starr County, about 35 miles from McAllen, Texas.",
      "\"My office is fully prepared to enter into an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or the United States Border Patrol to allow a facility to be built for the processing, detention, and coordination of the largest deportation of violent criminals in the nation's history,\" Buckingham wrote in a letter addressed to President-elect DonaldTrump, earlier this week.",
      "In an interview via Zoom, Buckingham claimed authorities were frequently \"getting reports from the community\" that crimes were happening on the property.",
      "\"There was a significant mass of humanity and terrible things happening on this property. We heard it again and again and again,\" she said.",
      "Buckingham placed the blame squarely on what she called the Biden administration's \"open border policies\" and said the county voted Republican for the first time in a century because residents there felt those policies are \"directly harming their communities\" and jeopardizing their safety.",
      "During the interview, Villarreal noted she had been speaking with residents and community leaders in the region who paint a different picture of the area, one of a safe community that does not have the violent crime that Buckingham has described.",
      "When asked by Villareal to provide details of where those crimes are occurring, Buckingham said most of the migrants are passing through and, using some of the same rhetoric about migrants and crime used by President-elect Donald Trump on the campaign trail, said they \"unleash some of their violent criminal habits\" in other states across the country.",
      "\"Well, a lot of it is migrant-migrant crime, but you're right, the communities along the border are lovely,\" she said. \"The people who live there are lovely. Obviously, most of the migrants who come across aren't interested in sticking around too long. They go to other parts of the country, as we have seen in faraway states -- people who came across the Texas border -- and then tend to unleash some of their violent criminal habits in other states.\"",
      "She added, \"But the bottom line is, until we have complete operational control of the border, until we have these violent criminals off of our soil that continue to hurt our sons and daughters, we need to keep working on it and get it done.\"",
      "In 2023, in the same county where the Texas commission recently bought the 1,402-acre plot of land, the Biden administration announced it had authorized building about 20 miles of southern border wall using money that was already appropriated under the first Trump administration.",
      "President Joe Biden at the time claimed he had no choice to build the wall, which directly contradicted a promise he made during his 2020 presidential run.",
      "\"I tried to get them to reappropriate -- to redirect the money,\" Biden told reporters at the time. \"They didn't, they wouldn't. And in the meantime, there's nothing under the law other than they have to use the money for what is appropriated. I can't stop that.\"",
      "After that announcement, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said there was an \"immediate need to construct physical barriers\" in the area.",
      "Buckingham said she's confident she'll hear back from the incoming Trump administration about her offer of land.",
      "\"We have heard through back channels that they're aware of our letter and they are definitely looking at it,\" she said.",
      "Incoming \"border czar\" Tom Homan, in an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, indicated the incoming administration would be open to using the land Texas is offering.",
      "\"Absolutely we will,\" he said, adding that when they arrest a migrant, they'll need a place to detain them.",
      "Democratic governors of border states -- such as Arizona and California -- have said they will not aid the Trump administration's mass deportation plans.",
      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs told ABC News Live earlier this week that she would not use state police or the National Guard to help with mass deportation.",

    "story": [
      "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by convincing average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\u201cMy father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\u201d",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry\u2019s best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer\u2019s brand, led today by his daughter Pauline, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy \u2014 stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants \u2014 changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\u201d That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn\u2019t hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship. The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn\u2019t visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer\u2019s guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer\u2019s advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks. \"It was really pioneering stuff,\u201d Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \u201cthat would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\u201d",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\" The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer \u2014 in a David vs. Goliath triumph \u2014 got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed at my age I\u2019d be working this hard,\u201d he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,\" and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \u201cmost Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. \u2026 And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn\u2019t have to be well-heeled.\u201d",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \u201cI fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\u201d he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\u201d",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer\u2019s survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren."

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 18:26:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel, stiffer competition from bigger carriers, and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The airline said it expects to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy process. Spirit told customers Monday they can book flights and use frequent-flyer points as they ordinarily would, and said employees and vendors would continue getting paid.",
      "The airline said it received commitments for a $350 million equity investment from existing bondholders and will convert $795 million of their debt into stock in the restructured company. The bondholders will also extend a $300 million loan that, combined with Spirit\u2019s remaining cash, will help the airline get through the restructuring.",
      "The airline's shares dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. Spirit, based in Dania Beach, Florida, missed a deadline for filing its third-quarter financial results but announced that its operating margin would indicate a bigger loss than the company had in the same quarter last year.",
      "Those were just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. On Monday, he called the deal with bondholders \u201ca strong vote of confidence in Spirit and our long-term plan.\u201d",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They\u2019re just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink.",
      "It\u2019s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged this summer because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. It also dropped cancellation fees after rival Frontier Airlines did so.",
      "Those were huge changes from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy, which focuses on grabbing customers with rock-bottom fares and then getting them to pay extra for things that are free on many other airlines, such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit planned to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts said should help prop up fares. But that would help rivals more than it would boost Spirit.",
      "Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

      "As Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, his election victory is likely to embolden those who think they can get his ear",
      "WASHINGTON -- As incoming White House chief of staff, one of Susie Wiles \u2019 vexing challenges will be policing the buffet line of powerful interests who want something from Donald Trump.",
      "It\u2019s a world she knows well. During Trump\u2019s first presidency, she lobbied for many of them.",
      "Trump was first elected on a pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington. But his transactional approach to the presidency instead ushered in a lobbying boom that showered allies, including Wiles, with lucrative contracts, empowered wealthy business associates and stymied his agenda after his administration was ensnared in a series of influence-peddling scandals.",
      "Now, as Trump prepares to return to power, his victory is likely to embolden those who think they can get his ear, raising the prospect that his second administration could face many of the same perils as his first. That will test the ability of Wiles to manage a growing number of high-powered figures \u2014 including Trump\u2019s children, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and billionaires like Elon Musk \u2014 who will not be dependent on her for access to him.",
      "The appointment of a former lobbyist to such an important job \"bodes very poorly for what we are about to see from the next Trump administration,\u201d said Craig Holman, himself a registered lobbyist for the government watchdog group Public Citizen. \u201cThis time around, Trump didn\u2019t even mention \u2018draining the swamp.\u2019 ... He\u2019s not even pretending.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Brian Hughes, a spokesman from the Trump transition effort, rejected any suggestion that Wiles\u2019 past as a lobbyist would make her susceptible to pressure.",
      "\u201cSusie Wiles has an undeniable reputation of the highest integrity and steadfast commitment to service both inside and outside government,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cShe will bring this same integrity and commitment as she serves President Trump in the White House, and that is exactly why she was selected.\u201d",
      "Wiles\u2019 selection as chief of staff was Trump\u2019s first announced hire after his win. Wiles co-led the former president's campaign and was widely credited with having run an operation that was far more disciplined than his two previous efforts. Even so, she will have her work cut out for her. Though the job has traditionally entailed policing who has access to the president, Trump chafed at such efforts during his first presidency as he churned through four chiefs of staff.",
      "During his recent victory speech, Trump called Wiles an \u201cIce Maiden\u201d while praising her as a consummate behind-the-scenes player. She will be the first woman to hold the position.",
      "What is also clear is that Wiles, 67, has successfully managed headstrong men across a lengthy career in politics, government and lobbying. The daughter of NFL player and sportscaster Pat Summerall, Wiles worked for U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp, a conservative icon, in the 1970s, followed by stints on Ronald Reagan\u2019s campaign and as a scheduler in his White House.",
      "She later headed to Florida, where she advised two Jacksonville mayors and is credited with helping businessman Rick Scott, now a U.S. senator, win the governor\u2019s office. After briefly managing Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, she oversaw Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign in Florida, when his win in the state helped him clinch the White House.",
      "Wiles was a partner at Ballard Partners, a regional firm that lobbied for Trump\u2019s companies in Florida. Shortly after Trump\u2019s election, Ballard set up shop in Washington and quickly became a dominant player, pulling in more than $70 million in lobbying fees during Trump\u2019s presidency, representing a who\u2019s who of corporate America, lobbying disclosures show.",
      "Many of Wiles\u2019 clients were plain vanilla entities with obvious aims \u2014 General Motors, a trade group for children\u2019s hospitals, homebuilders, and the City of Jacksonville.",
      "One in particular stood out that speaks to the ways, subtle or otherwise, that foreign interests seek to influence U.S. policy. In 2017, Wiles registered as a lobbyist for Globovisi\u00f3n, a Venezuelan TV network owned by Ra\u00fal Gorr\u00edn, a businessman charged in Miami with money laundering.",
      "Gorr\u00edn bought the broadcast company in 2013 and immediately softened its anti-government coverage. He hired Ballard to advise on \u201cgeneral government policies and regulations,\u201d lobbying disclosures show. But rather than working with the agencies that oversee telecommunications, Ballard\u2019s lobbying was trained on the White House, which would have little say in regulating a foreign broadcaster in the U.S. Globovisi\u00f3n paid Ballard $800,000 for a year of work.",
      "Brian Ballard, president of the firm, said that it\u2019s clear to him that Gorr\u00edn\u2019s aims weren\u2019t limited to the media business. Gorr\u00edn, who owns several luxury properties in Miami, had long positioned himself as a bridge between Venezuela\u2019s socialist government and U.S. officials.",
      "By the time Wiles and a team of Ballard lobbyists represented Globovisi\u00f3n, Gorr\u00edn was leading a quiet charm offensive for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government that sought closer ties with Trump at a time when the country was facing food shortages, violent crime and hyperinflation. It started before Trump took office when Citgo, a subsidiary of Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company, kicked in a $500,000 donation for Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "\u201cHe was a fraud and as soon as we learned he was a fraud, we fired him,\u201d said Ballard. \u201cHe would ask us to set up a lot of things, in LA and D.C., and then nothing would happen. It was all a fantasy. He just wanted to use our firm.\u201d",
      "A few days after Ballard dropped Gorr\u00edn in 2018, federal prosecutors unsealed charges against the businessman for allegedly using the U.S. finance system to supply Venezuelan officials with private jets, a yacht and champion show-jumping horses as part of a fake loan scheme perpetrated by insiders to pilfer the state\u2019s coffers. Last month, he was charged a second time, also out of Miami, in another scheme to siphon $1 billion from the state oil company, PDVSA.",
      "Ballard said Wiles had almost no role in managing the relationship with Gorr\u00edn or several other clients for which she is listed as a lobbyist. But he praised her as someone who is a highly organized \u201cstraight shooter\u201d and \u201ctough as nails\u201d despite her soft demeanor.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s the type of person who you want in a foxhole,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will serve the president well.\u201d",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Maduro engaged in a peacemaking offensive that included attempts to hire at least two other lobbyists. It fizzled out, however. In 2019, the White House slapped crushing oil sanctions on the OPEC nation, closed the U.S. Embassy in Caracas and recognized the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly as the country\u2019s legitimate ruler. Maduro was then indicted in 2020 by the U.S. Justice Department on federal drug trafficking charges out of New York.",
      "Gorr\u00edn has long denied any wrongdoing and remains a fugitive. In a brief interview with The Associated Press, he called Wiles a \u201clady\u201d and said she always acted professionally and humanely.",
      "Ballard called the firm's work for Gorr\u00edn a \u201cbig mistake.\u201d Going forward, Ballard expects access to the White House to be more tightly controlled just as his firm, after a steep learning curve during the first Trump administration, will do a better job vetting potential clients to make sure their interests align with the president's agenda.",
      "\u201cWe learned a lot,\u201d he says, \u201cand so did the president.\u201d",
      "Globovisi\u00f3n wasn\u2019t Wiles\u2019 only client with foreign ties.",
      "In early 2019, she registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent working for one of Nigeria\u2019s main political parties for two months. Another client was an auto dealership owned by Shafik Gabr, a wealthy businessman who was in a financial dispute related to selling cars in Egypt with a subsidiary of the German automaker Volkswagen.",
      "Wiles was also a registered lobbyist for the subsidiaries of a multinational gaming company and a Canadian company looking to build a massive copper and gold mine near Alaska\u2019s salmon-rich Bristol Bay.",
      "Wiles was hardly an outlier in Trump\u2019s Washington, where his eponymously named hotel served as a hub for lobbyists, business leaders and foreign governments looking to rub shoulders with Trump World figures as they sought the president\u2019s favor.",
      "Though much of it was part of the normal course of business in Washington, a number of Trump allies and advisers were investigated and charged with crimes linked to their work on behalf of foreign countries and entities.",
      "After becoming Trump\u2019s de facto campaign manager in 2022, Wiles kept on lobbying, this time for Mercury, a multinational public affairs and lobbying firm. Most recently she was representing the maker of Swisher Sweets cigars.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:13:52 -0500",
    "summary": "Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr says he&rsquo;s running for governor in 2026",
    "story": [
      "Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr says he\u2019s running for governor in 2026",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's Republican attorney general, Chris Carr, said Thursday that he's running for governor in 2026, becoming the first major candidate from either party to announce a bid.",
      "Prominent Republicans and Democrats are eyeing the seat, which will be open in two years after term-limited Republican Gov. Brian Kemp leaves the office. Other potential Republican contenders include Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, while the Democratic field is less well-defined.",
      "Carr is portraying himself as the best candidate to continue steady Republican leadership in the mold of the late U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, former Gov. Nathan Deal and Kemp.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen what it takes to be successful,\u201d Carr told The Associated Press in a phone interview. \u201cAnd I want to run as the proven conservative who will create jobs for hardworking Georgians, keep our families and neighborhoods safe and vigorously defend our Constitution and freedoms.\"",
      "Carr has aligned closely with Kemp but could face opposition from President-elect Donald Trump and his supporters in a primary election. Jones has been close to Trump and would likely angle for his endorsement. By contrast, Trump endorsed primary opponents who ultimately lost to both Carr and Raffensperger in 2022, fueled by his displeasure that neither Carr nor Raffensperger backed Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss in Georgia.",
      "Carr said he was confident that he could win on issues and appeal to enough voters to win a Republican primary, despite his past differences with Trump.",
      "\u201cThis race isn't going to be about how loud somebody yells or screams, it\u2019s going to be about a conservative record,\" he said. \"And I\u2019m the one that has that.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s exceptionally early to announce a 2026 political bid. Customarily, statewide candidates in Georgia would announce sometime after 2025's legislative session. But Carr let it be known more than a year ago that he was lining up donors for a run. That's in part because Jones and Raffensperger are much more wealthy than Carr.",
      "Carr filed papers with the Georgia Ethics Commission Thursday creating a campaign committee to raise money for the governor's race. Announcing now could help Carr lock down donors, especially because he won't be able to raise money for his state campaign account during the three-month legislative session that convenes on Jan. 13.",
      "The attorney general\u2019s office in Georgia traditionally has been preoccupied with defending civil lawsuits brought against the state and could only aid in a prosecution if a local district attorney requested help. But Republican lawmakers have given Carr increasing powers to directly prosecute criminals.",
      "In 2019, lawmakers gave Carr the authority to create a human trafficking prosecution unit. Carr\u2019s office says the unit has convicted 50 people, participated in 325 investigations and assisted more than 200 victims.",
      "In 2022, lawmakers directed Carr to create a statewide gang prosecution unit that now has offices in Atlanta, Albany, Augusta, Columbus, Macon and southeast Georgia. That unit has secured more than 40 convictions and indictments against more than 140 people.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s going to come here and locate a business or a job if they don\u2019t feel safe,\u201d Carr said, calling his office\u2019s expansion of prosecutions \u201cvery successful.\u201d",
      "After working as a lawyer and the vice president of the conservative Georgia Public Policy Foundation, Carr got his entry into politics when he joined U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson's staff in 2004 and became Isakson's chief of staff in 2007.",
      "Gov. Nathan Deal picked Carr to become Commissioner of Economic Development in 2013 after another old Isakson hand, Chris Cummiskey, left to work for the Southern Co., the Atlanta-based utility giant. Deal put a major emphasis on economic development as Georgia tried to dig out from the wreckage of the Great Recession, and Carr helped facilitate projects worth more than $14 billion in investment that helped create more than 83,000 jobs.",
      "Deal promoted Carr to attorney general in 2016 after Sam Olens resigned to become president of Kennesaw State University. Carr hadn't earned a living practicing law for years and had never personally tried a case. But he wasn't challenged in the Republican primary in 2018 and narrowly beat Democrat Charlie Bailey in the general election.",
      "In 2022, Carr demolished right-wing primary challenger John Gordon despite Gordon getting Trump's endorsement and then beat Democrat Jen Jordan in the narrowest victory of any Republican on the statewide ballot that year.",
      "Georgia's attorney general doesn't face term limits, meaning Carr could have chosen to run for reelection in 2026.",
      "Jones didn't say anything about his political plans Thursday, but underlined his link to Trump.",
      "\u201cGeorgians just endured a long election where the lieutenant governor was proud to fight alongside President Trump \u2014 now it's time to get to work,\u201d said Jones' chief of staff, Loree Anne Paradise. \u201cBurt is focused on delivering conservative solutions to the issues the General Assembly will tackle during the upcoming legislative session.\u201d",
      "Democratic candidates could include U.S. Rep Lucy McBath and outgoing DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond.",
      "Republicans have won six straight governor\u2019s races in Georgia since Sonny Perdue became the first Republican to be elected in modern times in 2002. Democrats had hoped to break that streak under Stacey Abrams in 2022 after she narrowly lost to Kemp in 2018, but Kemp defeated her by a comfortable margin in their rematch."

      "The U.S. special envoy to Sudan says he doesn't see enough \u201cpolitical appetite\u201d from the warring parties in the African nation to reach a resolution to the conflict that has left tens of thousands of dead, forced millions from their homes, and left a l...",
      "ROME -- The U.S. special envoy for Sudan said Thursday, just days after his first visit to the war-wrecked country since taking his post, that he doesn't see enough of \u201cpolitical appetite\u201d from the warring parties to reach a resolution to the conflict.",
      "The African nation plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital of Khartoum and spread to other regions, including western Darfur.",
      "The fighting has left tens of thousands of dead, forced millions from their homes, and pushed a large swath of the population to starvation.",
      "Tom Perriello, who was appointed as special envoy in February, travelled to Port Sudan on Monday to meet with Sudanese officials, including the head of the military Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, whose troops have been battling the rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces around the country for the past 19 months.",
      "Multiple attempts to broker a cease-fire have fallen apart, most recently in August, when the Sudanese military refused to attend U.S.-mediated talks in Geneva. Since then, fighting has only accelerated, and RSF forces have been accused by the United Nations of carrying out atrocities including killings of civilians and rapes in several parts of the country.",
      "\u201cWe do not yet see enough political appetite from the parties to find a real resolution to this conflict,\u201d Perriello said in an interview with The Associated Press in Rome. He said any solution \u201chas got to be about handing control back to the people.\u201d",
      "Sudan had been trying to establish a civilian government after a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. The short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, commander of the RSF, joined forces to carry out a military takeover in 2021.",
      "But Burhan and Dagalo soon fell out, and their long-simmering struggle for control erupted into battles in Khartoum in April 2023 and spread the other parts of the country.",
      "Since then, more than 20,000 people have been killed in the conflict, according to the U.N.. Some 14 million people \u2014 30% of the population \u2014 have been forcibly displaced, either to other parts of the country or abroad in what the U.N. says is one of the world's worst displacement crises.",
      "The U.N. recently warned that the country has been pushed to the brink of famine, and more than 26.5 million people face acute hunger.",
      "\u201cThe numbers are so large that you can\u2019t even get your head around the scale of human suffering,\u201d Perriello said. He decried the situation in which the warring parties continue to commit atrocities while civilians are trapped in the chaos.",
      "\u201cWhat we know is the numbers are astronomical,\u201d Perriello noting that, \u201cthe death toll is probably more than anything that\u2019s been estimated.\u201d",
      "He pointed to reported atrocities carried out by RSF fighters last month in the Gezira state, southeast of Khartoum. \u201cThese are horrific, horrific abuses against women and children, in this case, primarily committed by the Rapid Support Forces, and multiple attacks on civilians, murdering of civilians,\" he said.",
      "During his visit, Perriello met with members of Sudanese civil society and humanitarian aid workers in an effort to improve movement of food and medicines to people across the country.",
      "He said the United States is working to stop countries that are arming the warring parties despite a U.N. arms embargo.",
      "Sudan\u2019s ruling Sovereign Council, led by Burhan, accuses the United Arab Emirates, a U.S. ally, of arming the RSF \u2014 a charge that a U.N. panel of experts said was credible, though the UAE denies it. The RSF has also reportedly received support from Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t speak to specific conversations, but the United States has been very clear with countries all over the world that we believe it\u2019s time to stop fueling this war with more weapons,\u201d Perriello said.",
      "Burhan has received Russian support and is a close ally of neighboring Egypt and its president, former army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. In February, Sudan\u2019s foreign minister held talks in Tehran with his Iranian counterpart amid unconfirmed reports of drone purchases for government forces.",
      "\u201cWe have way too many countries that are pouring weapons into Sudan who should be pouring in food and medicine,\" Perriello said. \"We have way too many countries deciding to get involved, not in the interests of the Sudanese people, but to take advantage of the fragility of the state.\u201d",
      "Perriello, who has worked on crises in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, said he had never been involved in a disaster on such a massive scale that is getting so little attention from the rest of the world."

    "summary": "A federal judge has signed off on a settlement agreement Wednesday in a class action lawsuit alleging that an algorithm designed to score rental applicants discriminated on the basis of race and income",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has signed off on a settlement agreement Wednesday in a class action lawsuit alleging that an algorithm designed to score rental applicants discriminated on the basis of race and income",
      "Mary Louis' excitement to move into an apartment in Massachusetts in the spring of 2021 turned to dismay when Louis, a Black woman, received an email saying that a \u201cthird-party service\u201d had denied her tenancy.",
      "That third-party service included an algorithm designed to score rental applicants, which became the subject of a class action lawsuit, with Louis at the helm, alleging that the algorithm discriminated on the basis of race and income.",
      "A federal judge approved a settlement in the lawsuit, one of the first of it's kind, on Wednesday, with the company behind the algorithm agreeing to pay over $2.2 million and roll back certain parts of it's screening products that the lawsuit alleged were discriminatory.",
      "The settlement does not include any admissions of fault by the company SafeRent Solutions, which said in a statement that while it \u201ccontinues to believe the SRS Scores comply with all applicable laws, litigation is time-consuming and expensive.\"",
      "While such lawsuits might be relatively new, the use of algorithms or artificial intelligence programs to screen or score Americans isn't. For years, AI has been furtively helping make consequential decisions for U.S. residents.",
      "When a person submits a job application, applies for a home loan or even seeks certain medical care, there\u2019s a chance that an AI system or algorithm is scoring or assessing them like it did Louis. Those AI systems, however, are largely unregulated, even though some have been found to discriminate.",
      "\u201cManagement companies and landlords need to know that they\u2019re now on notice, that these systems that they are assuming are reliable and good are going to be challenged,\u201d said Todd Kaplan, one of Louis\u2019 attorneys.",
      "The lawsuit alleged SafeRent's algorithm didn't take into account the benefits of housing vouchers, which they said was an important detail for a renter's ability to pay the monthly bill, and it therefore discriminated against low-income applicants who qualified for the aid.",
      "The suit also accused SafeRent's algorithm of relying too much on credit information. They argued that it fails to give a full picture of an applicant's ability to pay rent on time and unfairly dings applicants with housing vouchers who are Black and Hispanic partly because they have lower median credit scores, attributable to historical inequities.",
      "Christine Webber, one of the plaintiff's attorneys, said that just because an algorithm or AI is not programmed to discriminate, the data an algorithm uses or weights could have \"the same effect as if you told it to discriminate intentionally.\u201d",
      "When Louis' application was denied, she tried appealing the decision, sending two landlords' references to show she\u2019d paid rent early or on time for 16 years, even if she didn't have a strong credit history.",
      "Louis, who had a housing voucher, was scrambling, having already given notice to her previous landlord that she was moving out, and she was charged with taking care of her granddaughter.",
      "The response from the management company, which used SafeRent's screening service, read, \u201cWe do not accept appeals and cannot override the outcome of the Tenant Screening.\u201d",
      "Louis felt defeated; the algorithm didn\u2019t know her, she said.",
      "\u201cEverything is based on numbers. You don\u2019t get the individual empathy from them,\u201d said Louis. \"There is no beating the system. The system is always going to beat us.\u201d",
      "While state lawmakers have proposed aggressive regulations for these types of AI systems, the proposals have largely failed to get enough support. That means lawsuits like Louis\u2019 are starting to lay the groundwork for AI accountability.",
      "SafeRent\u2019s defense attorneys argued in a motion to dismiss that the company shouldn\u2019t be held liable for discrimination because SafeRent wasn\u2019t making the final decision on whether to accept or deny a tenant. The service would screen applicants, score them and submit a report, but leave it to landlords or management companies to accept or deny a tenant.",
      "Louis\u2019 attorneys, along with the U.S. Department of Justice, which submitted a statement of interest in the case, argued that SafeRent\u2019s algorithm could be held accountable because it still plays a role in access to housing. The judge denied SafeRent's motion to dismiss on those counts.",
      "The settlement stipulates that SafeRent can't include its score feature on its tenant screening reports in certain cases, including if the applicant is using a housing voucher. It also requires that if SafeRent develops another screening score it plans to use, it must be validated by a third-party that the plaintiffs agree to.",
      "Louis' son found an affordable apartment for her on Facebook Marketplace that she has since moved into, though it was $200 more expensive and in a less desirable area.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not optimistic that I\u2019m going to catch a break, but I have to keep on keeping, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Louis. \u201cI have too many people who rely on me.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Police in New Jersey\u2019s capital have shown a pattern of misconduct, including excessive force and unlawful stops",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- Police in New Jersey\u2019s capital have shown a pattern of misconduct, including using excessive force and making unlawful stops, the Justice Department said Thursday, in a report documenting arrests without legal basis, officers escalating situations with aggression and unnecessary use of pepper spray.",
      "The 45-page report comes after a roughly yearlong investigation into the Trenton Police Department, undertaken after an officer shot and paralyzed a young Black man who attempted to drive away when officers didn\u2019t tell him why they had stopped him.",
      "The Justice Department found the police department\u2019s practices violate the Fourth Amendment and the report makes more than two dozen recommendations for remedial action.",
      "\u201cThe people of Trenton deserve nothing less than fair and constitutional policing,\u201d said U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Philip Sellinger. \u201cWhen police stop someone in Trenton, our investigation found that all too often they violated the constitutional rights of those they stopped, sometimes with tragic consequences.\u201d",
      "The DOJ report paints a scathing picture of a department with about 260 sworn officers in a city of nearly 90,000 people, where many struggle due to poverty and high crime rates. The city is uniquely deprived of a property tax base that could fund public safety because of the many state government buildings.",
      "The report outlines an incident in which an officer from the department\u2019s violent crimes unit chased a 16-year-old boy who matched the description of someone with a gun. The officer grabbed the boy by his neck, slammed him into the hood of a car and insulted him. The boy was not armed.",
      "The boy\u2019s teacher approached the officer and told him the boy ran because he was scared of the police, the report says. The officer said the police are just trying to help.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not how a Black man sees it,\u201d the teacher explained.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how an intelligent man would see it,\u201d the officer said, according to the report.",
      "In another instance, a Black woman was in her parked car on a Trenton street in 2022 when a male friend approached her to talk. An officer noticed him take something from his bag and concluded the woman must have been buying drugs. Officers drove the wrong way down a one-way street. The man ran and another officer opened the woman\u2019s car door and grabbed her by the wrist. She asked what was going on and the officer used a vulgarity to tell her to get out of the car and threatened to pepper spray her. The police found no drugs and an arresting officer said he didn\u2019t know why she had been stopped.",
      "\"Similar scenes have played out repeatedly on Trenton\u2019s streets. With inadequate supervision and little training on the legal rules and well-accepted police procedures that should constrain their conduct, Trenton police officers engage in a pattern or practice of violating those rules,\u201d the report said.",
      "Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora said in a statement that the city has cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the department, and that it has so far disbanded two police department street units that officials said violated the constitution.",
      "\u201cThe City will continue to work cooperatively with the USDOJ, our state partners at the Department of Law and Public Safety and the Department of Community Affairs, local community organizations, and residents to implement the recommendations highlighted in the Report as quickly as possible,\u201d Gusciora said.",
      "The report recommends that the police department improves its use of force policies, implements better force training, boosts accountability and enhances data collection. It wasn't immediately clear how the Justice Department would ensure the recommended changes are implemented, but Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said the department would cooperate with city officials and police.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to rolling up our sleeves and working with officials to put in place the reforms necessary to address the two core violations that we have identified,\u201d Clarke said.",
      "Asked if the recent investigation of police practices in Trenton or any other city could result in a consent decree, Clarke replied that her focus Thursday was on making the findings about Trenton public. The Justice Department has opened investigations of 12 other police departments under the Biden administration, including in Louisville, Kentucky; Minneapolis; Phoenix; and Memphis, Tennessee.",
      "The Trenton Police Department isn't the only one in New Jersey facing scrutiny for officer behavior and department practices. Police in Newark, the state's biggest city, entered into an agreement with the Justice Department nearly a decade ago to implement more community-oriented policing after a similar probe. In Paterson, the state's attorney general took over the police department after officers fatally shot a crisis intervention worker who had barricaded himself inside an apartment.",
      "A once thriving manufacturing hub whose wire rope industry contributed to the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge, Trenton is suffering. Its poverty rate is over 26%, far in excess of the national rate of 11%, and home ownership and high school graduation rates are below the state\u2019s average.",
      "Darren \u201cFreedom\u201d Green, a community advocate in the city, said the report shone a light on a known reality and that Trenton must now agree to earnest engagement and policy reform.",

      "A Pennsylvania jury awarded Penn State $28,000 in damages on Wednesday over products made and sold by Vintage Brand and Sportswear Inc., two firms co-founded by former minor league baseball player Chad Hartvigson.",
      "Penn State accused them of selling \u201ccounterfeit\u201d clothing and accessories, while the defendants said their website makes clear they are not affiliated with the university.",
      "At least a dozen other schools have sued the defendants on similar grounds, including Purdue, Stanford and UCLA, Penn State said in its 2021 lawsuit. However, the Penn State case was the first to go to trial and seen by some as a test case in the sports merchandising industry.",

      "The verdict, she said, maintains the status quo, while a victory for Vintage Brand \u201ccould have shaken things up.\u201d It followed a six-day trial in federal court in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, overseen by Chief U.S. District Judge Matthew W. Brann.",

      "JD Vance\u2019s election as vice president has opened up one of Ohio\u2019s U.S. Senate seats for the third time in as many years",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- JD Vance's election as vice president has opened up one of Ohio's U.S. Senate seats for the third time in as many years, setting off a scramble for the appointment among the state's ruling Republicans.",
      "GOP Gov. Mike DeWine is tasked with filling the vacancy, giving the pragmatic center-right politician a hand in setting his party's course in the state potentially for years to come. His decision will be made in the afterglow of sweeping wins by Republicans in November under the leadership of Donald Trump, but a poor choice could also help Democrats reclaim a place in Ohio\u2019s Senate delegation when the seat comes up for reelection in less than two years.",
      "\u201cLook, being a United States senator is a big deal,\u201d the governor told reporters in the days after the election. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal for the state, and we need to get it right.\u201d",
      "DeWine has a long list to choose from \u2014 particularly given the number of GOP candidates who competed unsuccessfully in Senate primaries in 2022 and 2024. Those under consideration who previously lost crowded Republican primaries are former Ohio Republican Chair Jane Timken; two-term Secretary of State Frank LaRose; and state Sen. Matt Dolan, whose family owns baseball's Cleveland Guardians. Two-term Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague and Republican attorney and strategist Mehek Cooke, a frequent guest on Fox News, are also in the mix.",
      "One other prospective appointee \u2014 a 2024 presidential contender, Cincinnati pharmaceutical entrepreneur and Vance insider Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 pulled out of contention after accepting a position in the new Trump administration.",
      "While Vance's departure also offers DeWine an opportunity to alleviate a bottleneck at the top of Ohio Republicans' political pecking order, where Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and Attorney General Dave Yost are preparing to face off for governor in 2026, that appears unlikely. Husted is well into building his campaign organization, and Yost has said he would decline the appointment if offered. DeWine \u2014 a 77-year-old former U.S. senator term-limited in 2026 \u2014 also has said he would not appoint himself.",
      "Meanwhile, ambitions for the seat among Republican members of Ohio\u2019s congressional delegation \u2014 which includes U.S. Reps. Jim Jordan, Mike Carey, David Joyce and Warren Davidson \u2014 are being tempered by the slim House majority their party scored in November. House vacancies necessarily take months to fill under Ohio\u2019s election protocols, likely a consideration for DeWine as Trump prepares to push early policy priorities through Congress.",
      "Under state law, whoever gets the appointment will serve from the date of Vance's resignation, which he hasn't announced, until Dec. 15, 2026. A special election for the last two years of his six-year term would be held in November 2026.",
      "That special election could provide a comeback opportunity for Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who was unseated earlier this month by Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno. Though he wasn't specific, Brown told Politico last week: \u201cI\u2019m going to stay in this arena. I\u2019m not going away.\u201d Former U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, the Democratic Senate nominee who lost to Vance in 2022, could make another run. Allison Russo, the Democratic leader of the Ohio House, also has been mentioned as a 2026 Senate contender.",
      "DeWine has made clear that he wants the Republican he chooses to be well positioned to defeat the Democrats in 2026. Their strengths as a statewide candidate and fundraiser are particularly important because Ohio's statewide elections also take place that year \u2014 and every seat is open. A strong incumbent senator at the top of that ticket could be valuable to returning Republicans to the offices of governor, attorney general, treasurer, auditor and secretary of state.",
      "Stamina also could be a factor. Timken ran for Senate most recently in 2022, LaRose ran this year, and Dolan ran both times. A win in 2026 would only give the victor a two-year reprieve before having to face Ohio voters again in 2028.",
      "\u201cThis is not for the faint-hearted,\u201d DeWine said.",
      "Dolan, who along with Timken is a millionaire, is rare among Republicans competing for the Vance appointment in not having ever won Trump's backing.",
      "In both 2022 and 2024, Dolan ran in Republicans' moderate lane, declining to align with Trump and disavowing his false claims that voter fraud lost him the 2020 election. Those stances won him DeWine's endorsement in last year's Senate primary, which could be a good sign for the term-limited Ohio Senate Finance chairman.",
      "The president-elect backed Vance in 2022 and Moreno this year \u2014 lifting both to victory. Moreno won a three-way Republican primary against Dolan and LaRose, while Vance topped a field of seven, before both went on to defeat Democratic opponents in now reliably red Ohio.",
      "In the state Legislature, Dolan opposed Ohio's now-blocked ban on abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected and an unsuccessful effort to override then-Gov. John Kasich's veto. Both LaRose and Sprague, then a state senator and representative, respectively, supported both the bill and the override effort.",
      "Timken, a Trump loyalist, has never held public office, but as a Senate candidate she described herself as \u201ca powerful ally for the pro-life movement\u201d and supported overturning Roe v. Wade.",
      "Former U.S. Sen. Rob Portman backed Timken in the 2022 Senate primary, calling the Harvard-educated attorney and wife of former TimkenSteel CEO Tim Timken a smart, hard-working conservative.",
      "Some believe DeWine's penchant for elevating women could give her or Cooke an edge in the competition. Both his chief of staff and communications director are women and more than half of his Cabinet is female.",
      "Though Trump endorsed Vance over Timken for Senate in 2022, he had earlier hand-selected her to lead the Ohio Republican Party after his first election in 2016, and he has since supported her election as RNC National Committeewoman for Ohio.",
      "While Trump also passed over LaRose for a Senate endorsement this year, he had backed both him and Sprague in bids for statewide office \u2014 and both have endorsed him back.",
      "Both have twice won statewide races, though LaRose's high profile as Ohio's elections chief keeps him in the headlines more than Sprague, and he would be the first Green Beret to serve in Congress. At the same time, the absence of controversy that has marked Sprague's tenure at the state treasury could make him less likely than LaRose to draw a primary challenger.",
      "DeWine says he wants his appointee to be focused on both state and national issues and willing to work hard and \u201cget things done.\u201d He also hinted that the person\u2019s politics can\u2019t be too extreme.",
      "\u201cIt also has to be someone who can win a primary, it has to be someone who can win a general election, and then two years later do all that again,\" he said."

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has named Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida, to be U.S. attorney general just hours after his other choice, Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has named Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida, to be U.S. attorney general just hours after his other choice, Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday he will nominate former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to lead the Justice Department, turning to a longtime ally after his first choice, Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration amid scrutiny over sex trafficking allegations.",
      "Bondi has been an outspoken defender of Trump. She was one of his lawyers during his first impeachment trial, when he was accused \u2014 but not convicted \u2014 of abusing his power as he tried to condition U.S. military assistance to Ukraine on that country investigating then-former Vice President Joe Biden. And she was among a group of Republicans who showed up to support Trump at his New York hush money criminal trial that ended in May with a conviction on 34 felony counts.",
      "\u201cFor too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans - Not anymore,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cPam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again.\u201d",
      "Gaetz stepped aside amid continued fallout over a federal sex trafficking investigation that cast doubt on his ability to be confirmed as the nation\u2019s chief federal law enforcement officer. Gaetz's vehemently denied the allegations, but his nomination stunned many career lawyers inside the Justice Department. Gaetz, who passed the bar but barely worked as a lawyer, had very little relevant experience for the job. Bondi comes with years of legal work under her belt and that other trait Trump prizes above all: loyalty.",
      "The hasty withdrawal by Gaetz and quick pivot to Bondi were the latest examples of Trump\u2019s tumultuous decision-making as he rushes out nominations \u2014 some of questionable character and credentials \u2014 at a breakneck pace without the government vetting that is typical of presidential transitions. It\u2019s an omen that despite running his most organized campaign for the White House this year, his return to the Oval Office might feature the same sort of drama that permeated his first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. told Fox News\u2019 \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that the transition team had backups in mind for his controversial nominees should they fail to get confirmed.",
      "Still, even in Trump's world, things moved fast. Trump had been seeking to capitalize on his decisive election win to force Senate Republicans to accept provocative selections like Gaetz. The decision could heighten scrutiny on other controversial Trump nominees, including Pentagon pick Pete Hegseth, who faces sexual assault allegations that he denies.",
      "\u201cWhile the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,\u201d Gaetz said in a statement one day after meeting with senators in an effort to win their support.",
      "\u201cThere is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I\u2019ll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump\u2019s DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1,\" he added.",
      "Trump, in a social media post, said: \u201cI greatly appreciate the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General. He was doing very well but, at the same time, did not want to be a distraction for the Administration, for which he has much respect. Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do!\u201d",
      "Bondi is a well-known figure in Trump's circle, and has been a chair at the America First Policy Institute, a think tank set up by former Trump administration staffers. She's been a vocal critic of the criminal cases against Trump. In one recent radio appearance, she called Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith and other prosecutors who have charged Trump \u201chorrible\u201d people she said were trying to make names for themselves by \u201cgoing after Donald Trump and weaponizing our legal system.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham predicted in a social media post that Bondi \"will be confirmed quickly,\u201d calling her selection a \u201cgrand slam, touchdown, hole in one, ace, hat trick, slam dunk, Olympic gold medal pick.\u201d",
      "If confirmed by the Republican-led Senate, Bondi would instantly become one of the most closely watched members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet given the Republican\u2019s threat to pursue retribution against perceived adversaries and concern among Democrats that he will look to bend the Justice Department to his will. A recent Supreme Court opinion not only conferred broad immunity on former presidents but also affirmed a president\u2019s exclusive authority over the Justice Department\u2019s investigative functions.",
      "As president, he demanded investigations into political opponents like Hillary Clinton and sought to use the law enforcement powers of the Justice Department to advance his own interests, including in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election.",
      "Bondi would inherit a Justice Department expected to pivot sharply on civil rights, corporate enforcement and the prosecutions of hundreds of Trump supporters charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol \u2014 defendants whom Trump has pledged to pardon.",
      "It\u2019s unlikely that Bondi would be confirmed in time to overlap with Smith, who brought two federal indictments against Trump that are both expected to wind down before the incoming president takes office. Special counsels are expected to produce reports on their work that historically are made public, but it remains unclear when such a document might be released.",
      "Bondi was accused by a Massachusetts attorney of bribery over a $25,000 campaign contribution she received from Trump in 2013. Bondi asked for the donation near the same time that her office was being asked about a New York investigation of alleged fraud at Trump University. In 2017, that complaint was found to have lacked enough evidence to move forward.",
      "In 2013, while serving as Florida attorney general, she publicly apologized for asking that the execution of a man convicted of murder be delayed because it conflicted with a campaign fundraiser. She said she was wrong and sorry for requesting that then-Gov. Rick Scott push back the execution of Marshall Lee Gore by three weeks.",
      "While Gaetz sought to lock down Senate support this week, concern over the sex trafficking allegations showed no signs of abating.",
      "In recent days, an attorney for two women said his clients told House Ethics Committee investigators that Gaetz paid them for sex on multiple occasions beginning in 2017, when Gaetz was a Florida congressman. One of the women testified she saw Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old at a party in Florida in 2017, according to the attorney, Joel Leppard.",
      "Gaetz's political future is uncertain. In a social media post, pointed at the incoming vice president, Gaetz wrote: \u201cI look forward to continuing the fight to save our country. Just maybe from a different post.\u201d",

Today\u2019s verdict sends a clear message that law enforcement officers who commit crimes cannot be insulated from the consequences of their actions.\u201d",
      "Guyger said at the time that after a long work shift, she walked to Jean\u2019s apartment \u2014 which was on the fourth floor, directly above hers on the third \u2014 and found the door unlocked. She said she thought the apartment was her own when she drew her gun and entered.",

Michigan parents Jennifer and James Crumbley, the first to be convicted in a U.S. mass school shooting, were sentenced to at least 10 years in prison for not securing a firearm at home and acting indifferently to signs of their son\u2019s deteriorating mental health before he killed four students in 2021.",
      "Investigators have said Colt Gray carried a semiautomatic assault-style rifle onto a school bus, with the barrel sticking out of his book bag, wrapped up in a poster board. They say the boy carefully plotted the shooting at the 1,900-student high school northeast of Atlanta, drawing diagrams and listing potential body counts in a notebook. He left his second-period class and emerged from a bathroom with the rifle before shooting people in a classroom and hallways."

      "U.S. intelligence officials are warning American defense companies to increase their security after a wave of sabotage in Europe blamed on Russia",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. intelligence officials warned American defense companies on Thursday to increase security precautions following several acts of sabotage in Europe that officials have blamed on Russia.",
      "The public bulletin issued by the National Counterintelligence and Security Center advised companies involved in defense work \u2014 particularly those providing support to Ukraine in its war against Russia \u2014 to step up their defenses in the face of Russia's escalating aggression toward Ukraine's allies.",
      "\u201cRussia\u2019s sabotage activities in Europe increase the risk to U.S. companies abroad and potentially at home,\" the officials wrote in the warning. \u201cSuch sabotage operations can sow fear and doubt, damage important infrastructure, disrupt commerce, or cause injury and death.\u201d",
      "U.S. and European intelligence officials have said Russia perpetrated several recent acts of sabotage targeting European defense companies, logistics facilities, public utilities and military installations. Often, the officials said, Russian intelligence has hired local criminals to carry out the acts, which include arson attacks in the United Kingdom and Poland.",
      "Earlier this month, security officials blamed Russia for a plot to smuggle incendiary devices onto cargo planes headed to North America, including one that caught fire at a courier hub in Germany and another that ignited in a warehouse in England.",
      "Along with disinformation and propaganda, it's part of a larger hybrid effort to undermine the ability of Ukraine's allies to support its defense against Russia's invasion.",
      "Russia has denied the allegations. A message left with Russia's embassy in Washington was not immediately returned Thursday.",
      "The National Counterintelligence and Security Center is an agency within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, focused on protecting national assets from intelligence threats. Thursday's bulletin was jointly issued by the FBI and several Department of Defense agencies."

    "story": [
      "Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will step down from his post on January 20",
      "Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who was aggressive in his oversight of cryptocurrencies and other financial markets, will step down from his post on Jan. 20.",
      "Gensler pushed changes that he said protected investors, but the industry and many Republicans bristled at what they saw as overreach.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump had promised during his campaign that he would remove Gensler. But Gensler on Thursday announced that he would be stepping down from his post on the day that Trump is inaugurated.",
      "Bitcoin has jumped 40% since Trump\u2019s victory. It hit new highs Thursday and was nearing $100,000. Bitcoin moved notably higher still after Gensler's resignation was announced.",
      "Gensler's stance on the rise of cryptocurrencies was captured during a speech he gave during the first year of his chairmanship in 2021 where he described the market as \u201cthe Wild West.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis asset class is rife with fraud, scams, and abuse in certain applications,\u201d he said in a speech at the Aspen Security Forum. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of hype and spin about how crypto assets work. In many cases, investors aren\u2019t able to get rigorous, balanced, and complete information.\u201d",
      "Under Gensler, the SEC brought actions against players in the crypto industry for fraud, wash trading and other violations, including as recently as last month when the commission brought fraud charges against three companies purporting to be market makers, along with nine individuals for trying to manipulate various crypto markets.",
      "Yet access to cryptocurrencies became more widespread under Gensler. In January, the SEC approved exchange-traded funds that track the spot price of bitcoin. With such ETFs, investors could get easier access to bitcoin without the huge overlays required to buy it directly.",
      "Gensler, however, acknowledged the SEC had denied earlier, similar applications for such ETFs, including Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, among the first to eventually be approved by the SEC.",
      "\u201cCircumstances, however, have changed,\u201d Gensler said, pointing to a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that said the SEC failed to adequately explain its reasoning in rejecting Grayscale\u2019s proposal.",
      "Even there, Gensler made sure not to endorse the merits of bitcoin. He pointed to how ETFs that hold precious metals are tracking prices of things that have \u201cconsumer and industrial users, while in contrast bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing.\u201d",
      "Gensler was tested early in his tenure with the rise of the meme stock phenomenon that shocked the financial system in early 2021. Earlier this year, the SEC under Gensler pushed Wall Street to speed up how long it takes for trades of stocks to settle, one of the areas where the commission\u2019s staff recommended changes following the reckoning created by GameStop, one of the first meme stocks.",
      "In the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, hordes of smaller-pocketed and novice investors suddenly piled into the stock of the struggling video-game retailer. During the height of the frenzy, several brokerages barred customers from buying GameStop after the clearinghouse that settles their trades demanded more cash to cover the increased risk created by its highly volatile price.",
      "In May 2024, new rules meant broker-dealers have to fully settle their trades within one business day of the trade date, down from the previous two.",
      "Critics of the SEC under Gensler have called many of the agency's proposals overly burdensome.",
      "The investment industry, for example, is pushing against a proposal to force some advisers and companies disclose more about their environmental, social and governance practices, otherwise known as ESG. Critics say the proposal is overly complex and increases the risk of investor confusion, while imposing unnecessary burdens and costs on funds.",
      "On Thursday, Gensler stood by the SEC's track record under his direction.",
      "\u201cThe staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike,\" Gensler said in prepared remarks. \u201cThe staff comprises true public servants.\"",
      "Gensler previously served as Chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, leading the Obama Administration\u2019s reform of the $400 trillion swaps market. He also was senior advisor to U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes in writing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) and was undersecretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance and assistant secretary of the Treasury from 1997-2001."

      "After two relatively mild winters since energy prices soared, billpayers are braced for a colder period that could stretch their finances.",
      "And over the longer term, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight said high domestic energy prices were likely to be \"the new normal\".",
      "Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the forecasts meant particularly families and people with disabilities faced \u201cimpossible choices\u201d.",
      "\"For bills to remain at this high level... and with an expectation that they'll remain at that level for the foreseeable future, we're just expecting to see people continuing to be really squeezed.\"",

      "\"We understand that the cost of energy remains a challenge for too many households,\" said Tim Jarvis, from the regulator.",

      "To estimate the effect on an individual's annual costs, billpayers can add 1.2% to their current bill.",
      "Some households will have less support than last winter because the final cost-of-living payment was made to eight million people on means-tested benefits in February.",
      "For pensioners, the previously universal winter fuel payment, worth up to \u00a3300, is now only being paid only to those on low incomes who receive certain benefits.",
      "According to the government's own estimates, an additional 50,000 pensioners will be living in relative poverty next year as a result of cuts to the payment.",
      "However, this fails to take into account any increased uptake of pension credit - which qualifies people for the winter fuel payment.",

    "title": "The superpowers of coatings make possible the impossible",
    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:05:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Hi-tech coatings make all sorts of high performance engineering, like jet engines, possible.",
    "story": [
      "Jet engines are one of the most jaw-dropping feats of engineering humans have ever come up with.",
      "But jet engines shouldn\u2019t be possible, says Ben Beake, director of materials research at Micro Materials, an equipment testing company in Wales.",
      "\u201cThe air coming in is hotter than the melting point of the metal underneath \u2013 which is obviously not a good thing,\u201d he explains, pointing out that this air reaches temperatures well above 1,000C.",
      "Designers of jet engines have got around this problem by applying heat-resistant ceramic coatings to the engine blades. And now, researchers are developing yet stronger coatings that allow the engines to run hotter still.",
      "\u201cIf you get it to go hotter, then there\u2019s a massive saving on fuel and CO2,\u201d says Dr Beake. By increasing the temperature by just 30C or so, you might get an 8% fuel saving, he estimates.",
      "This is the power of coatings \u2013 they radically transform the functionality and capabilities of an underlying material. Few people realise how important they are, but these overlays and veneers can supercharge high-performance machines, or ensure that expensive equipment survives the harshest of environments.",
      "Dr Beake and his colleagues are tasked with pushing coatings to their limits, in order to see how robust or effective they really are. His clients don\u2019t always get the results they want. He recalls telling a missile manufacturer, \u201cWe\u2019ve broken your coating,\u201d some years ago. \u201cThey stormed off in a huff,\u201d says Dr Beake.",
      "Besides exposing coatings to high temperatures, Micro Materials also has a \u201cwoodpecker\u201d device, a tiny diamond stylus, which repeatedly taps a coating at random locations to test its durability.",
      "Recently, the firm has worked with UK-based Teer Coatings to test a product that could be applied to satellite components including gears and bearings used in various moving parts.",
      "It is a tricky task, says Xiaoling Zhang, from the company, because the coating must protect such components both pre-launch (when they are exposed to atmospheric humidity at ground level) and also in orbit, against dust particles and radiation in space. However, she claims that the firm has achieved the desired results.",
      "But besides protecting spacecraft, coatings could also stop astronauts from getting sick.",
      "Biofilms \u2013 gloopy accumulations of bacteria inside pipes \u2013 grow faster in low gravity environments, which could be a problem for water supplies or machinery that moves fluid around on space stations or future spacecraft, for example.",
      "\u201cBiofilms are known to cause mechanical failures,\u201d says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d",
      "Prof Varanasi and his colleagues have developed a range of coatings that make surfaces slippery and therefore resistant to the formation of biofilms. Tests of one such coating in an experiment carried out on board the International Space Station found that it worked as intended.",
      "The idea behind the coating is to mix together a solid material and a lubricant. This is then sprayed onto the interior of a pipe or tube, which makes that inner surface extremely slippery.",
      "Prof Varanasi has previously made headlines for developing similar coatings for the insides of toothpaste packets \u2013 so you can get every last bit of toothpaste out. He and his colleagues have commercialised the technology through their spin-out company LiquiGlide.",
      "Slipperiness is, perhaps, an underappreciated attribute. Nuria Espallargas at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and colleagues have developed a silicon carbide-based coating for equipment used in aluminium manufacturing or repair.",
      "It is a sort of non-stick frying pan solution, meaning that layers of molten aluminium do not get stuck on this expensive equipment. The precise functioning of this particular coating is currently something of a mystery, though.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we really don\u2019t know how it works, the mechanism is unknown at the moment,\u201d says Prof Espallargas.",
      "Nonetheless, the coating is available commercially through her spin-out company Seram Coatings. Atlas Machine and Supply, a US firm that makes and repairs industrial machinery, has tried it out.",
      "\u201cThe real benefit lies in extending the life of the tools and improving the quality of the products being produced,\u201d says Jeremy Rydberg, chief innovation officer.",
      "He says that, without the coating, Atlas must rebuild the roller tools it uses to work aluminium every two days. This costs $4.5m annually. But the new coating means that these tools last for a whole week, not just a couple of days, slashing those rebuild costs to around $1.3m per year.",
      "Coatings can do some amazing things, but they don\u2019t always work as intended, notes Andy Hopkinson, managing director at Safinah Group, a firm that often gets called in to investigate when coatings go wrong.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of issues at the moment with car parks, where their passive fire protection system is peeling off,\u201d he says, referring to the fire-resistant paint sometimes applied to concrete structures.",
      "And his company has also found that coatings applied to commercial ships do not always prevent barnacles and other sea life from attaching themselves to the hull. This problem, known as biofouling, increases friction, meaning the ship\u2019s engine must work harder \u2013 and burn more fuel.",
      "Despite the availability of coatings that promise to help, ship owners do not always choose the correct one for their vessel. That choice should depend on where the ship is sailing, how long it is due to be idle rather than in motion, and so on, says Dr Hopkinson.",
      "The cost of fixing issues like this can run into many thousands, or even millions of pounds. \u201cTypically, paint costs between 1 and 2% of the project. The problem is, when it goes wrong, the costs become exponential,\u201d says Mr Hopkinson.",
      "The researchers working in this field, though, say that there are still many opportunities to improve coatings and develop new ones that could drastically improve the performance of machines or infrastructure in the future.",

    "summary": "The charges could jeopardise the ambitions of one of the world\u2019s richest men, both at home and abroad.",
    "story": [
      "Just weeks ago, Gautam Adani, one of the world\u2019s richest men, celebrated Donald Trump\u2019s election victory and announced plans to invest $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) in energy and infrastructure projects in the US.",
      "Now, the 62-year-old Indian billionaire and a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose sprawling $169bn empire spans ports and renewable energy, faces US fraud charges that could potentially jeopardise his ambitions at home and abroad.",
      "Federal prosecutors have accused him of orchestrating a $250m bribery scheme and concealing it to raise money in the US. They allege Mr Adani and his executives paid bribes to Indian officials to secure contracts worth $2bn in profits over 20 years. Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them \"baseless.\"",
      "But this is already hurting the group and the Indian economy.",
      "Adani Group firms lost $34bn in market value on Thursday, reducing the combined market capitalisation of its 10 companies to $147bn. Adani Green Energy, which is the firm at the centre of the allegations, also said it wouldn't proceed with a $600m bond offering.",
      "Then there are questions about the impact of the charges on India\u2019s business and politics.",
      "India\u2019s economy is deeply intertwined with Mr Adani, the country\u2019s leading  infrastructure tycoon. He operates 13 ports (30% market share),  seven airports (23% of passenger traffic), and India\u2019s second-largest cement business (20% of the market).",
      "With six coal-fired power plants, Mr Adani is India's largest private player in power. At the same time, he has pledged to invest $50bn in green hydrogen and runs a 8,000km (4,970 miles)-long natural gas pipeline. He\u2019s also building India's longest expressway and redeveloping India\u2019s largest slum. He employs over 45,000 people, but his businesses impact millions nationwide.",
      "Gautam Adani: Asia's richest man",
      "Gautam Adani: Asia's richest man",
      "His global ambitions span coal mines in Indonesia and Australia, and infrastructure projects in Africa.",
      "Mr Adani\u2019s portfolio closely mirrors Modi\u2019s policy priorities, beginning with infrastructure and more recently expanding into clean energy. He has thrived despite critics labeling his business empire as crony capitalism, pointing to his close ties with Modi, both as Gujarat's chief minister - where they both hail from - and as India's prime minister. (Like any successful businessman, Mr Adani has also forged ties with many opposition leaders, investing in their states.)",
      "\u201cThis [the bribery allegations] is big. Mr Adani and Modi have been inseparable for a long time. This is going to influence the political economy of India,\u201d says Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, an Indian journalist who has written extensively on the business group.",
      "This crisis also comes as Mr Adani has spent nearly two years trying to rebuild his image after US short-seller Hindenburg Research's 2023 report accused his conglomerate of decades of stock manipulation and fraud. Though Mr Adani denied the claims, the allegations triggered a market sell-off and an ongoing investigation by India's market regulator, SEBI.",
      "\u201cMr Adani has been trying to rehabilitate his image, and try to show that those earlier fraud allegations leveled by the Hindenburg group were not true, and his company and his businesses had actually been doing quite well. There'd been a number of new deals and investments made over the last year or so, and so this is just a body blow coming to this billionaire who had done a very good job of shaking off the potential damage of those earlier allegations,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told the BBC.",
      "For now, raising capital at home may prove challenging for Mr Adani's cash-guzzling projects.",
      "\"The market reaction shows how serious this is,\" Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst, told the BBC. \"Adanis will still secure funding for their major projects, but with delays.\"",
      "The latest charges could also throw a spanner in Mr Adani\u2019s global expansion plans. He has been already challenged in Kenya and Bangladesh over a planned takeover of an international airport and a controversial energy deal.  \"This [bribery charges] stops international expansion plans linked to the US,\" Nirmalya Kumar, Lee Kong Chian Professor at Singapore Management University, told the BBC.",
      "What\u2019s next? Politically, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has unsurprisingly called for Mr Adani\u2019s arrest and promised to stir up parliament. \u201cBribing government officials in India is not news, but the amounts mentioned are staggering. I suspect the US has names of some of those who were the intended recipients. This has potential reverberations for the Indian political scene. There is more to come,\u201d Mr Kumar believes.",
      "Mr Adani\u2019s team will undoubtedly assemble a top-tier legal defence. \"For now, we have only the indictment, leaving much still to unfold,\" says Mr Kugelman.",
      "While the US-India business relationship may face scrutiny, it\u2019s unlikely to be significantly impacted, particularly given the recent $500m US deal with Mr Adani for a port project in Sri Lanka, says Mr Kugelman. Despite the serious allegations, broader US-India business ties remain strong.",
      "\u201cThe US-India business relationship is a very large and multifaceted one. Even with these very serious allegations against someone that's such a major player in the Indian economy, I don't think we should overstate the impact that this could have on that relationship,\u201d Mr Kugelman says.",
      "Also, it's unclear if Mr Adani can be targeted, despite the US-India extradition treaty, as it depends on whether the new administration allows the cases to proceed. Mr Baliga believes it is not doom and gloom for the Adanis. \"I still do think foreign investors and banks will back them like they did post Hindenburg though, given that they are part of very important, well performing sectors of the Indian economy,\" he says.",
      "\"The sense in the market is also that this will perhaps blow over and be sorted out, once the [Donald] Trump administration takes over.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "People mis-sold finance agreements when buying cars could wait months for a decision on whether they should receive compensation.",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal has blown open an ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "Now the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has given more detail about plans to allow dealers extra time to deal with complaints.",
      "It is consulting on two options, either extending the deadline to the end of May or until December 2025.",
      "Lawyers acting for motorists say this could further delay compensation which should be paid to car buyers who may not have given their informed consent for the commission payments.",
      "Who may be in line for payouts?",
      "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements.",
      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In a complicated, and long-running, series of developments, many of these agreements have come under scrutiny.",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher than necessary interest rate.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation, potentially increasing the lenders' final bill to billions of pounds.",
      "Why was the judges' decision so important?",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",
      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he said.",
      "Following the judges decision in his - and two other car buyers' - favour, banks have set aside millions of pounds for potential compensation. Other lenders have temporarily paused any new deals.",
      "It's thought the cost of compensation could reach \u00a316bn, according to analysts.",
      "How has the regulator responded?",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers receiving a deluge of new complaints.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "The regulator is consulting on extending the time car dealers will have to respond to complaints.",
      "The two options are:",
      "Giving dealers until the end of May to deal with complaintsAllowing them until December 2025 to respond, to align the deadline for firms to deal with discretionary and non-discretionary arrangement complaints",

      "The Finance and Leasing Association, the trade body for motor finance providers, described the FCA's plan as a \"sensible move\".",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

      "It was a bad time to inherit a rubber plantation, falling rubber prices meant it kept losing money. So, 10 years ago Dr Matthew decided to experiment with cocoa trees, hoping they would generate some funds to support the rest of the farm.",
      "He bought some saplings and planted them. It didn't go well.",
      "\"It was not that successful - most of the saplings died,\" he says.",
      "Squirrels appeared to be making the situation worse by grabbing cocoa bean pods and eating them.",
      "But those raids had an unexpected benefit -  cocoa seeds were spread all over the farm.",
      "\"All the scattered seeds soon grew in to plants and they were much healthier and stronger than the saplings I had planted,\" says Dr Matthew.",
      "\"The trick was in sowing the seeds,\" he realised.",
      "Today Mr Matthews has 6,000 cocoa trees on his 50 acres of land.",
      "\"I think it was the best decision I have made,\" he says.",
      "Despite having several regions with weather conditions suitable for cocoa trees, India only accounts for 1% of the world's cocoa bean production.",
      "Global production is currently dominated by West Africa, where C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana between them produce more than half of the world's annual output.",
      "Indian growers can only supply a quarter of the beans needed by Indian makers of chocolate and other confectionary.",
      "\"The challenge is that it is grown in very fragmented small holdings, so it does not get the kind of attention cocoa should get,\" says Renny Jacob, chairman of India Cocoa, a private company that has been growing and processing cocoa beans for more than 30 years.",
      "In particular he says that Indian farmers are poor at handling beans after they have been harvested. Once removed from their pods, beans go through a fermentation process at the farm, which can make a huge difference to their flavour.",
      "\"Cocoa fermentation is a critical process in the production of chocolate, transforming raw cocoa beans into a form suitable for chocolate making,\" says Sarin Partrick, chief executive of India Cocoa.",

      "So far the programme has come up with 15 new varieties.",
      "\"These are India's first hybrid, disease-resistant seeds,\" she says.",
      "\"The seeds are drought tolerant varieties, and have withstood temperatures of even 40C, which is usually not possible,\" she adds.",
      "The hybrids are also much more productive than traditional varieties.",
      "\"The global average production is 0.25 kilogram per year per tree.",
      "\"In Kerala, we get 2.5 kilograms per year per tree. In Andhra and Telangana, we are even getting a yield of four or five kilograms per tree per year,\" she says.",
      "India's production of cocoa beans has risen significantly. This year it hit 110,000 tonnes, up 40% from 2015. But it's still not enough to meet demand from local chocolate and confectionary makers.",
      "India's Cocoa Board estimates the demand from industry is rising at 15% per year.",
      "Founded in 2019, Kocoatrait is one of a new generation of Indian chocolate makers.",

      "Choosing a new school is one of the biggest decisions a parent makes, and is often based on a mixture of visiting, speaking to friends and looking at Ofsted reports.",
      "From September 2025 a new \"report card\" based on Ofsted inspections is due to be introduced, replacing the one-word judgements scrapped this year.",
      "Three areas in England have already been looking at developing a more detailed local report in response to parents asking for more information.",
      "In the north London borough of Camden, a newly-styled school report card is being piloted, designed to be used on smartphones and tablets.",
      "It will allow parents to search in an area around them for schools, and go into a site where they can explore through words, pictures and data what the schools are like.",
      "A former head of Ofsted says the work in Camden, which has been shared with the BBC, should influence ministers thinking about what parents need in the national changes.",
      "New Ofsted school grades will not confuse parents - PM",
      "Ofsted complacent after head's death, says review",
      "The first section of Camden\u2019s school reports shows \u201cOur school in 100 words\u201d -  a description of values and strengths, written by the school.",
      "This is closely followed by \u201cOur school in 10 photos\u201d, to show the facilities and activities available to pupils.",
      "The school's latest Ofsted report, usually two to three pages of writing, is embedded within the site.",
      "But the report also pulls together some official statistics not included in Ofsted reports, such as GCSE results or those in primary national curriculum tests, often known as Sats, compared with both the local and national average. It also includes data on absence.",
      "Each school also has to set out its approaches to learning, pupils\u2019 wellbeing, its anti-bullying policy, and how it supports children with special educational needs.",
      "And all of the information has to be submitted and checked before being uploaded, so it is in a standard format allowing parents to compare schools.",
      "Shabnam Eslambolchi, whose daughter is in Year 4 at Gospel Oak Primary School, really likes the way the new site combines descriptions, photos and charts to tell her more about the school than the current Ofsted report does.",
      "\u201cYou have a chance to read what the school is about, what they offer, you learn about the school community,\u201d Mrs Eslambolchi, who is head of the PTA, says.",
      "Marcus Goddard, who chairs the school\u2019s governors, is about to start looking at secondary schools for his oldest child.",
      "\u201cI haven't taken the time to read the Ofsted reports,\u201d he admits, adding: \u201cI think I would read the report cards, largely because of the way they've been formatted.\u201d",
      "Pupils want a say in what school is best for them too - and the decision is a fresh memory for Year 7s at Regent High School.",
      "Savanna wanted to know \u201cif the teachers are good, and if the food\u2019s nice\u201d.",

      "And Tyreese wanted to know what subjects were on offer and that \u201ceverybody can be loving and caring to one another\u201d.",
      "The report card project has been led by Camden Learning, a partnership between the local schools and the council, chaired by Dame Christine Gilbert, formerly England\u2019s chief inspector of schools, running Ofsted for five years until 2011.",
      "She says the \u201cbig idea\u201d came from parents who wanted something to give them a real flavour of the school, such as how important sport was or the approach to discipline.",
      "Dame Christine is \u201camazed at how it captures the ethos of the schools\u201d and how strong the personal reactions are of parents who have tried it out.",
      "In \u201cOur School in 100 Words\u201d, one secondary said it was feminist. And when that was shown to a focus group, one parent said they would \u201creally want\u201d their child to go there, while another \u201cabsolutely wouldn\u2019t\u201d.",
      "Dame Christine says ministers and Ofsted should learn from the Camden project, as well as similar work under way in Sheffield and Milton Keynes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important we listen to the voices of parents,\" she tells me, \"and here in a very simple cost-effective way parents will have more information.\u201d",

      "A public consultation on what Ofsted\u2019s report cards should look like is due to start early next year.",
      "Leaks suggesting it will give schools coded ratings in 10 areas have proved controversial with education unions.",
      "The big difference with the Camden approach is it is created alongside schools, allowing them to have a say in what their strengths and weaknesses are.",
      "But this raises a question about whether Camden\u2019s reports would provide enough challenge to schools to improve.",

      "Gospel Oak head teacher John Hayes says he wanted to collaborate on something \u201cmore authentic, more useful to parents\u201d while also recognising \u201cas public servants with an incredibly important job, we do need to be held to account\u201d.",

      "The government has acknowledged the situation is at \"crisis point\", and says it is determined to \"drive up standards\" in schools.",
      "Jo\u2019s 10-year-old son Jacob was suspended from his primary school several times, before recently getting permanently excluded for persistent disruptive behaviour. Jacob has an education, health and care plan (EHCP) after an ADHD diagnosis, and is awaiting an autism assessment.",
      "Persistent disruptive behaviour is the most common reason given to suspend or exclude a pupil. But in primary schools, nearly 90% of those permanently excluded over the past five years also had special educational needs and disabilities (Send).",
      "Jo says her son is a \u201cvery caring boy\u201d who loves rugby and gaming, but his sensory issues meant he struggled to cope with larger class sizes.",
      "His mum says she lived with constant anxiety about when the phone would next ring because of another incident at school.",

      "The number of suspensions and exclusions in England\u2019s state schools has been rising in recent years - apart from a dip during the pandemic when most children were educated at home - reaching their highest levels since 2006.",
      "The majority of suspensions and exclusions  - around nine out of 10 - occur in secondary school, but numbers are rising among primary-age children too.",
      "BBC News has analysed Department for Education data on the annual rate of suspensions over a 10-year period, from 2012/13 to 2022/23.",
      "There were 84,300 suspensions in primary schools in 2022/23- a rate of 180 per 10,000 pupils. It has doubled in 10 years.",
      "The rate of permanent exclusions is much lower, at 2.6 in every 10,000 pupils - but it has also increased by almost 70% in the same time period.",
      "Suspended pupils must stay out of school for a fixed period up to a maximum of 45 days in a school year, while those excluded are permanently removed from their school.",
      "After being excluded, Jacob began attending Perryfields Primary pupil referral unit in Worcester. Jo says her son is now thriving, and she is optimistic about his transition to secondary school next year.",

      "It also offers training, on behaviour and Send support, to more than 100 schools across South Worcestershire.",
      "Head teacher Pete Hines has noticed growing numbers of younger children coming through his doors across his 20 years of experience.",
      "\u201cThe complexity of the needs of the children I've seen in that time is growing and growing,\u201d he says.",
      "Most of the children at Perryfields are on short-term placements, and keep strong links to their mainstream primary school by wearing their school uniform, and often revisiting their old school in the afternoon.",
      "Mr Hines says a successful referral unit \u201cshould be an intervention, not a destination\u201d and that one of the most valuable things is seeing \u201chappy children\u2026 having successes they didn\u2019t believe that they could have\u201d.",
      "Vanessa Longley, chief executive of children's charity Chance UK, says an exclusion can follow a child beyond their school life. Their research suggests 90% of those excluded at primary school fail to pass GCSE English and maths.",

    "story": [
      "The Mayor of London has said his policy of free lunch for every pupil at state primary schools in London will continue despite questions about how he will pay for it.",
      "His free lunches for every primary school child scheme was praised by a new independent report that found it had brought \u201csignificant benefits\u201d for the capital\u2019s children, parents and schools.",
      "But the London Assembly\u2019s budget committee was told next year\u2019s funding for the scheme was not in place yet.",
      "Sadiq Khan told BBC London: \u201cAs long as I am mayor of this great city I will make sure we carry on with this fantastic policy.\u201d",
      "The scheme provided meals to 287,000 children in its first year, at a cost of \u00a3135m. It is currently in its second year, with the cost having risen to \u00a3140m.",
      "The policy is currently being budgeted for on a year-by-year basis.",
      "The mayor said: \"We will be publishing our budget in due course and setting out confirmation that this policy will carry on next year.\"",
      "He added: \"My promise to Londoners is for as long as I am mayor, children going to state primary schools will receive this offer of a universal free school meal.\"",
      "Khan was re-elected in May and his third term of office ends in May 2028.",
      "Speaking to the London Assembly\u2019s budget committee, Richard Watts, the mayor's deputy chief of staff, said \u201cthe scheme has been enormously successful\u201d and \u201call the benefits that we hoped we would see based on previous evidence we are now seeing city wide\u201d.",
      "However, he said next year\u2019s funding for the scheme was not in place yet.",
      "He said: \"The whole of the mayor\u2019s budget is \u00a3130m, we think free school meals will cost \u00a3140m next year so even if we canned everything else that we did, universal free school meals will never be met from the GLA (Greater London Authority) mayor budget.",
      "\"Therefore we will announce that funding in the group budget papers in due course.\u201d",
      "Khan launched the scheme in 2023 as a one-year emergency measure to help families with the cost of living, paid for using higher than expected business rate receipts.",
      "In January this year, he announced that he had extended it for a further 12 months, to cover the 2024-25 academic year. It was again funded largely using business rate receipts which were \u201cmore buoyant than we expected\u201d.",
      "The committee heard that the GLA and mayor would have to wait until next year when the government is due to set out its multi-year plans for local government funding before setting budgets for the mayor\u2019s manifesto pledges.",
      "The mayor\u2019s chief of staff David Bellamy told the assembly\u2019s budget committee the free school meals scheme was \"not something substantively that the GLA mayoral budget has the resources to do, so that is something we will be dealing with in the group budget from the total income sources available to the mayor - we will set that out in the draft budget in January\u201d.",
      "'Positive impact'",
      "The research published by Impact on Urban Health, a group which forms part of the Guy\u2019s & St Thomas\u2019 Foundation, found that \u201cparents, whatever their household income, welcomed the policy and wanted it to continue\u201d, as \u201cthey felt it countered the effects of the rising cost of living and, in many cases, had a positive impact on family life\u201d.",
      "The scheme had also been \u201cvalued highly by those working in schools\u201d, the report found, with senior leaders saying it had \u201chelped to address the problems of hidden hunger and food insecurity\u201d.",
      "According to data collected by City Hall, in a sample of 259 schools \u2013 making up 13% of London primary schools \u2013 the scheme\u2019s average take-up was 89.1% of children across the 2023-2024 academic year.",
      "The research states: \u201cWe found the policy had greater benefits for families who were living in poverty or living on low incomes\u2026 but more affluent families were also strongly in favour of the policy, as they felt it acted as a leveller at school\u201d.",
      "It adds: \u201cSchool food costs are just one of many costs families face, including increased utilities and housing costs. Families have also noticed other school-related costs continuing to rise. This has diluted the financial effects of the policy for some families.\u201d",
      "Looking at the impact on pupils\u2019 performance in school, the report says that the policy \u201cappears to be supporting calmer behaviour in the classroom, with school staff reporting afternoon lessons running more smoothly when children have had a hot, healthy meal\u201d.",

      "Ms Richard, a former member of Danity Kane and Diddy - Dirty Money, is among more than two dozen people who have filed lawsuits against him. He is also facing criminal charges of racketeering and sex trafficking.",
      "He denies the charges, and his lawyer has called Ms Richard's claims \"manufactured\" and \"false\".",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight on Thursday, attorney Lisa Bloom said her client alleged that \"he groped and grabbed her body parts, sexually assaulted her, that he not only failed to pay her money that was promised to her, but actually prevented her from eating and sleeping during those years - just treated her terribly\".",
      "Ms Bloom also claimed the singer witnessed \"some severe acts of violence\" by Mr Combs against his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and other women.",

      "Ms Harper put out a statement saying Ms Richard's allegations \"are not representative of my experiences, and some do not align with my own truth\".",

      "\"From there, if I need to get a job so I can still make music, I'll do that.",
      "\"And then everything happened...\"",
      "Everything, in case you have not been following Gigi's story, involved scoring a global hit single out of nowhere.",
      "Sailor Song, an aching love ballad about falling for a woman who looks like the actress Anne Hathaway, exploded online in June and quickly became a real-world success.",
      "In the UK, it went to number one, ending Sabrina Carpenter's nine-week run at the top.",
      "The song also reached the summit in Ireland and Latvia and made the top 10 everywhere from New Zealand to Belgium.",
      "\"I knew the song was special to me,\" Gigi says.",
      "\"I just didn't know it was going to be special to so many other people.\"",
      "When she found out it had reached number one, \"I got out of the shower and just started crying,\" Gigi told the UK's Official Charts Company.",
      "The success marks a neat conclusion to a messy origin story.",
      "Born in New Jersey and raised in Florida, Gigi was a drama school nerd who turned to music when she realised she was \"never going to be cast in the ingenue role\".",
      "Self-taught on piano and guitar, she went straight to the top of the US streaming charts, in 2021, with her self-released debut single, Sometimes (Backwood).",
      "The song earned her a contract with Interscope Records and Gigi supported Coldplay on their Music of the Spheres tour before she had even played a headline show of her own.",
      "Looking back, she says that initial wave of success created a pressure to expand her career too quickly. For a long time, she felt \"stuck and limited\" by her lack of progression.",
      "\"It was this cognitive dissonance where I\u2019d get an amazing slot [on someone else's tour] but didn\u2019t know who\u2019d be coming to the show,\" Gigi says.",
      "And by the time she played London last November, she knew she had reached breaking point.",
      "\"I asked God, or the universe, 'Open the doors that need to be opened and close the doors that need to be shut,'\" she says.",
      "\"I knew it had to happen - but I was so terrified of what that meant.\"",
      "'Not a democracy'",
      "Interscope released her two days later. But instead of the world ending, Gigi's energy  renewed. She wrote more songs - and taught herself how to produce them, by watching YouTube tutorials.",
      "Sailor Song came to her in a sudden burst of inspiration this February.",
      "\"I was on my bed, my door was open and I was just messing around, jamming,\" Gigi says.",
      "\"My little sister walked by, and she was like, \u2018Gigi, what was that?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I have no idea, but I think it's really cool.'\"",
      "\"There are times where I spend a lot of time thinking about a song and what I want to say. This was one of those times where it just blew out.\"",
      "She teased it on TikTok in April, released it in July - and, as of Wednesday 20 November, it has been streamed 340 million times on Spotify alone.",
      "In some ways, it is an unlikely hit. The production is low-tech and homespun and Gigi's vocals are androgynous to the point where many listeners were surprised to find it was a song about two women in love.",
      "But the chorus is undeniable.",
      "\"Kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor,\" she sings. \"And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavour?\"",
      "Of course, in our terminally divided culture, no success remains untainted for long.",
      "In the US, evangelical Christians criticised Sailor Song for the line: \"I don't believe in God, but you're my saviour.\"",
      "Gigi's response, posted to TikTok, was uncompromising.",
      "\"My songwriting is not a democracy,\" she wrote, \"and that applies to every artist's work.\"",
      "The singer's struggles with faith run deep.",
      "Her parents became born-again Christians when she was in primary school, after which her mother took extra work as a bus driver to pay for Gigi and her sisters to attend a private religious school in Florida.",
      "The experience was not all positive.",
      "\"Growing up gay in an environment where you\u2019re not allowed to be that was very taxing on me,\" Gigi told the Bringin' It Backwards podcast, in 2022.",
      "Her faith was really shaken, however, when her big sister Celene died suddenly, aged 22, in the early months of 2020.",
      "The shock and the pain are unimaginable. The foundations of Gigi's world were destabilised forever.",
      "In her music, she tried to explain the unexplainable.",
      "\"The other day, I thought of something funny/ But no-one would've laughed but you,\" she sang in a song simply called Celene.",
      "\"And Mom and Dad are always crying/ And I wish I knew what to do.\"",
      "Gigi's latest release, Fable, is another attempt to confront that grief, lashing out at  people who feebly offered \"thoughts and prayers\" after her sister's death, and wondering why disconnecting from faith makes her \"skin start to burn\".",
      "\"One of the hardest parts about my grief is that I didn't have any music that touched  on my life, on my situation, to get me through it,\" she says.",
      "\"And so I made it for myself.",
      "\"I've written tons of grief songs but, finally, in Fable, I said it in the way I always felt, from the very day I lost her, and I was so just relieved by the expression of it.\"",
      "That catharsis is a sort of self-healing. And, more than anything, the singer wants her music to find its way to others who need it.",
      "\"One of my biggest wishes is to not let this experience that is so dark and isolating stay that way,\" she says.",
      "\"My hope is that there can be some way this [music] can help. And it's amazing, because I've been seeing a lot of that. It's been very healing for me.\"",
      "And with that ability to reach people in their most vulnerable moments, it won't be long before Gigi sees her name tattooed on many more arms."

      "One was a teenage Sex Pistol who fought the establishment, and the other was an MP and former government minister.",
      "But Glen Matlock and Kevin Brennan bridged the gap from punk to politics by forging an unlikely partnership to protect music venues.",
      "They were part of the campaign which led to a law to safeguard venues under threat from developers.",
      "Matlock is back on the road again, and has spoken about his unexpected friendship with former Cardiff West MP Brennan - now a top aide to Welsh First Minister Eluned Morgan - and their fight to keep music live.",

      "His solo tour includes two shows in Wales, and follows a reunion with fellow Sex Pistols Paul Cook and Steve Jones - although not John Lydon, aka Johnny Rotten, after the famously tempestuous band fell out once again.",
      "The reformed Pistols' shows raised money to help save Cook's local venue in London which was facing closure.",
      "\"Bigger bands shouldn't forget how they came through and if they can help out in some way, they should,\" said Matlock. \"We helped Shepherd's Bush Hall, and it led to the Sex Pistols reforming properly.\"",
      "In the late 1970s the Pistols, as the figureheads of the punk movement, were seen by many as public enemy number one, with their assaults on the music industry, the monarchy - and pretty much everything else.",
      "Now their bassist and main songwriter is focused on ensuring today's bands still have somewhere to play.",
      "\"I was involved with The Musicians' Union,\" he said. \"There was a photocall outside Parliament about the Agent of Change Act, calling for action to protect music venues.",
      "\"Situations like where there's a club and someone builds a block of flats next to it. Then people moan about the noise, when the venue was there first.",
      "\"Whoever changes what is already there is the 'agent of the change' and has to deal with the consequences. Something needed to be done because it was closing down venues around the country.",
      "\"This guy came up to me and said what do you think about this bill? He said: 'I can help - I'm the Labour MP for Cardiff West'. We swapped numbers and I got on the Tube.",
      "\"When I got home and got [phone] reception again, he'd sent me a draft white paper. We had a meeting and he invited me to the House of Commons.\"",
      "Brennan had already backed changes to planning laws to safeguard venues, including a campaign to protect those in Womanby Street in Cardiff.",
      "Brennan said: \"This was an issue I was interested in, so I went over, then realised who it was. I was a big fan of the Sex Pistols and The Clash.",
      "\"Quite a few politicians are into music and a lot of musicians are interested in politics. If people like Bono and Bob Geldof can get involved in politics, why can't politicians get involved with music?",
      "\"The Music Venues Trust tries to prevent the unnecessary closure of grassroots music venues. They come under pressure for all sorts of reasons: bad landlords, complaints about noise or other issues.",
      "\"We did this through a private member's bill in Westminster: The Agent of Change Bill had cross-party support and passed into law.",
      "\"So the principle has been established. But it doesn't mean there aren't still other pressures on venues, from issues like planning to financial viability rates.\"",
      "However, perhaps their friendship was not so unlikely. Brennan, who stood down as an MP in July after 23 years, played in what he called the world's first parliamentary rock band, MP4, and wrote and recorded his own songs.",
      "\"It transpired that Kevin was an accomplished folk musician,\" said Matlock. \"He told me about recording his album and I said 'I can put some bass on it if you like'.\"",
      "Brennan said: \"So I ended up making my little indie folk album The Clown and the Cigarette Girl with a Sex Pistol on bass.",
      "\"We did a launch in Cardiff, a big surprise for the crowd of 150 to see a punk legend at St John's Church in Canton. Then the next night he played with Blondie in front of a few thousand people [in Cardiff].",
      "\"He's a musician\u2019s musician - he just loves to play.",
      "\"I never thought when I became a MP I'd end up playing in a band with a Sex Pistol. Funny how things turn out!\"",
      "Matlock praised Brennan as a \"very good folk musician\" and \"one of the few people in Parliament\" who had talked about the effects of Brexit on touring musicians.",
      "The Pistols' bassist said there was now \"a realisation Brexit hasn't been good for touring musicians. There's been a huge knock-on effect, not just for musicians, but for trucking companies, catering workers, lighting guys. There has to be a better way through it.",
      "\"People like [The Who singer] Roger Daltrey and Johnny Rotten were pro-Brexit. But when they realised it would affect them they signed a petition to try to say we've got to have special rights.\"",
      "He added: \"I haven't spoken to John directly about this, but he knows what I think.\u201d",
      "For his part, Daltrey said in 2021 that he still supported Brexit, but wished the Conservative government at the time had \"made the easing of restrictions for musicians and actors a higher priority\".",
      "On his latest tour, Matlock is purposely picking venues in smaller towns that do not often feature on tour schedules.",
      "So he plays The Tivoli in Buckley, Flintshire, on Thursday, 21 November, and Clwb Crown in Merthyr on Friday 29 November.",
      "The Merthyr date brings flashbacks to a gig the Pistols played a few miles away in Caerphilly almost 48 years ago at the height of their notoriety.",
      "In December 1976 the band had just sworn on teatime TV and many shows on their Anarchy in the UK tour were banned. But although the Caerphilly gig went ahead, they were met by a large group of singing Christians, who picketed fans as they went in, which featured in the Pistols' film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.",
      "Matlock said: \"The show was rescheduled from the Anarchy tour. Things got big in the meantime, we went back a few weeks later and there were people saying we were calling up the devil and kids would go to hell if they went to the gig.",
      "\"It was cold and pouring with rain, we were inside and they were all out getting wet. One of the local councillors in more recent years admitted it was all a bit daft, really. Good publicity at the time, though.\"",
      "By next year, Matlock will have been performing live for 50 years, and has no intention of slowing down. He has played with bands like Blondie, The Faces, and Primal Scream as well as the recently reformed Pistols, has written two books about his life in music, and his latest solo LP is Consequences Coming.",
      "He said: \"I still write protest songs. I think consequences have been coming for a long time for some our more self-centred politicians. I still have so much to say.\"",
      "Matlock added: \"I never used to think past the end of the week when I was a teenager. But collectively with the Sex Pistols we really had something.",

      "\"We are aware that this case has generated significant public interest and that many people were dissatisfied with the resolution of the original case and believed it to be unjust,\" the state Supreme Court wrote in its opinion on Thursday.",
      "\"Nevertheless, what would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the State was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied.\"",
      "During Smollett's trial, prosecutors alleged he staged the attack because he was unhappy with a television studio's response to hate mail he received.",
      "Smollett said the attack was \"no hoax\u201d and that he was the victim of a hate crime in Chicago.",

      "Millard objected to \u00a3466,000 being awarded to LGBT Youth Scotland (LGBTYS) , a charity which supports young gay and transgender people.",
      "Its former chief James Rennie was convicted in 2009 of child sex assaults. The grants from Children In Need began seven months later, when the charity had new management in place.",
      "BBC News has not seen Millard's resignation letter.",
      "A Children in Need spokesman said: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of all children and young people.",

      "'Really gutted'",

    "summary": "The adaptation of Broadway show Wicked has a star-studded cast of Ariana Grande and Jeff Goldblum.",
    "story": [
      "Ariana Grande has told the BBC that she channelled her personal feelings of loss when filming Wicked.",
      "\"Losing someone you love is something we've all unfortunately had to experience - and sometimes we have the privilege to say goodbye and sometimes we don't,\" she says.",
      "Grande, 31, plays Galinda Upland in the film, which is an adaptation of the hugely successful stage musical exploring the Wizard of Oz universe from the perspective of two witches.",
      "The two-time Grammy award winner has suffered personal tragedy in recent years, after the 2017 Manchester bombing of her concert and the death of her former partner Mac Miller a year later.",
      "She says appearing in Wicked, one of the first Broadway shows she saw as a child, \"feels like a homecoming\".",
      "\"This music has always brought such comfort and now being able to spend time with it and be trusted with it is the privilege of a lifetime.\"",
      "In the weeks running up to the film's release, the close relationship between Grande and co-star Cynthia Erivo has been in the spotlight.",
      "\"From the moment we were cast, Cynthia invited me over and we hung out for five hours and we laughed and we cried and got to know each other.",
      "\"We had a real conversation right off the bat about creating a safe space for each other and being honest with each other,\" she says.",
      "Grande and Erivo's characters begin in the Oz universe as university students, before later becoming enemies as Glinda the Good Witch and Elphaba the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "Erivo, 37, has described her role as \"a real honour\" and nods to the foundations formed by the original stage actors Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel, who she calls \"the architects\".",
      "\"We've been handed something really special and it's a dream come true and truly big shoes to fill,\" she adds.",
      "Mixed reviews",
      "Critics have so far given the film mixed reviews. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw praised the \"sugar-rush fantasy\" and awarded four stars, describing Wicked as a \"blast of entertainment power\".",
      "There was another four-star review from Empire's Helen O'Hara, who said director Jon M Chu \"uses every bell and whistle possible to turn the stage show into a movie epic\".",
      "However, in a two-star review, the Telegraph's Robbie Collin described Wicked as \"utterly exhausting and hopelessly miscast\", adding that there was \"no conceivable artistic argument\" to have split the the Broadway show into two films.",
      "The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey awarded three stars and questioned the way it was shot, with characters often \"aggressively backlit\".",
      "\"Jon M Chu treats his Oz as if it were as mundane as a city block,\" she added.",
      "But Screen Daily's Fionnuala Halligan concluded: \"It\u2019s so doggedly faithful to the show, so emphatically orchestrated and so powered by Cynthia Erivo's exceptional performance, that resistance to its 169 minutes of theme park magic becomes futile.\"",
      "Erivo, who received a best actress nomination at the Oscars for her portrayal of Harriet Tubman in the biopic Harriet in 2019, is also a decorated stage performer who received a Tony Award in 2016 for the Broadway adaptation of The Color Purple.",
      "She says she was able to draw on her own experiences of struggling with acceptance for the role of Elphaba, who is outcast for her green exterior.",
      "\"Whether you feel 'other', or you feel different from everyone else, I think both of us have experience in those spaces that we have used to infuse our characters,\" she says.",
      "Wicked, which first came to Broadway in 2003, has gone on to be the third-highest grossing theatre show in the world, behind The Lion King and The Phantom of the Opera.",
      "Many have pinned its enduring success with audiences on the relatability of its content - from Elphaba's struggle with self-identity to Glinda's difficulty in making moral choices.",
      "Its reimagining for the big screen also stars Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage as the voice of Doctor Dillamond - who is an animated goat.",
      "Oscar nominee Jeff Goldblum appears as the Wizard of Oz and British star Jonathan Bailey - who has received international recognition in recent years after starring in Netflix hit Bridgerton - as Fiyero.",
      "Goldblum says the central themes of the film, which include embracing diversity, were important to the cast, who were able to \"come together to work and appreciate each other with empathy, compassion and love\".",
      "Bailey also says everyone he worked with had their own \"Elphaba story\", adding \"we have at points in our lives felt different\".",
      "He says: \"In this film particularly, it's the superpower of individuality which becomes a power to harness.",
      "\"I think it's really important right now as well, this theme that there's more that unites us than divides us.\"",
      "The musical has been a West End and Broadway institution for more than 20 years, but Chu says the central themes of the plot are more relevant than ever.",
      "\"Elphaba says something has changed within me, something's not the same - and that's the line that really got me into this movie, I felt like we all feel uneasy,\" he says.",
      "Chu, who also directed Crazy Rich Asians in 2018, says he received the script for the film during the pandemic, which made him think about how the film could reflect his real-life experience of looking for truth in a confusing time.",
      "He says the cast also made themselves \"emotionally available\" during filming and were able to put themselves personally in the shoes of their characters.",
      "\"Ariana, Cynthia and Jeff were talking about the real-world stakes of what we were putting into these characters,\" he adds.",
      "\"It wasn't just about global politics, it was more personal than that.",
      "\"We were all going through stuff in our own lives and I think they were generous to offer that up within the roles of Glinda, Elphaba and the Wizard.\"",

      "The British YouTube superstars have announced that the second season of their reality show, Inside, will debut on Netflix next year. The streaming giant will also make a US version.",
      "The Sidemen - the seven-strong group that includes content creator, rapper and boxer KSI - have more than 146 million YouTube subscribers between them.",
      "Vik Barn - aka Vikkstar123 - told the BBC the move was \"ambitious\" but it was \"exciting to conquer a new challenge\".",
      "He said: \"Netflix is the gold standard and part of us working with them is to say that over the past decade we've managed to go from filming content in our bedrooms to working with the biggest streaming platform in the world.\"",
      "The Sidemen started creating YouTube content in the early 2010s.",
      "They started by playing and reacting to video games, but in the past decade the group of friends have branched out to comedy sketches, travel challenges, podcasts and a dating show.",
      "They now employ a production team of more than 100 people who help create the videos and generate ideas, Vik said.",
      "One idea that has \"massively taken off\" is Inside, which launched in June on YouTube and racked up 14 millions of views for its opening episode.",
      "The contest's first season saw 10 influencers locked in a house for a week as they battled for a prize with up to \u00a31m.",
      "Its success caught the attention of Netflix bosses, who have now commissioned a second UK season and a US version of the show. Both will be on Netflix instead of YouTube.",
      "'Connect with new audiences'",
      "\"YouTube opened so many doors for us so we can't diminish its power and it's still unrivalled in some ways,\" Vik explained. \"But working with Netflix is a cool opportunity for us to reach a new audience.",
      "\"We're at a ceiling with YouTube - we bring in 20 million UK viewers each month and now we're thinking about how to connect with different people.\"",
      "Aside from Vik and KSI, the other Sidemen are Miniminter, Zerkaa, TBJZL, Behzinga and W2S.",
      "Vik said the group, who are aged between 27 and 32, had some reservations about bringing their work to a new platform because \"we've never done it before and we're all very particular about the way we work\".",
      "\"We also move at a really fast pace - sometimes we shoot on Wednesday and by Sunday we will have uploaded a two-hour video. So we wanted to make sure Netflix were happy with the fast turnarounds and us being very dynamic.\"",
      "But the seven members vote on everything and were unanimous in the decision to move their reality show to Netflix, he said.",

      "\"In our videos we're just ourselves, we're not aiming to be certain characters, and first and foremost we're content creators who make fun videos.\"",

    "summary": "The romcom king returns with a Christmas movie but this time it's an animation.",
    "story": [
      "As we hurtle towards Mariah Carey's most lucrative holiday, families all over the UK will be pressing play on Christmas films such as Love Actually to get themselves into the festive spirit.",
      "The 2003 movie was one of a string of hits from writer-director Richard Curtis which dominated the box office at the turn of the millennium, alongside Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral.",
      "Curtis is returning to the Christmas theme for his latest film, but this time around he has moved away from the traditional romcom and taken on his first animated project.",
      "\"The thing for me is, it's been a long time since I was, as it were, on the dating market,\" he tells BBC News. \"But I've been a dad for the last 25 years, so it was a real joy for me to be able to write about kids.\"",
      "The film-maker has described working on animation as \"a huge treat and revelation for me\", adding that the \"whole process is so different from the other movies I\u2019ve worked on\".",
      "That Christmas, released on Netflix on 4 December, is adapted from the book of short stories Curtis published in 2021.",
      "Set in the fictional coastal town of Wellington-on-Sea, the film follows a handful of families gearing up for Christmas Day. When a blizzard hits the town and leaves the parents separated from the children, their carefully planned celebrations are thrown into chaos.",
      "The theme of Christmas gone wrong was highly relatable to Swiss director Simon Otto, who has previously worked as an animator on How to Train Your Dragon and Enchanted.",
      "\"I know from my own family growing up, we had such a clear idea of the timeline of how Christmas or any tradition will unfold,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"And I can count more times where it didn't happen the way you expect and somehow something got messed up.",
      "\"We all have a Christmas memory where something goes wrong, those are the Christmases you remember the most, and at the end of that experience you always feel like, 'My god, we were able to be together for this time, and the realisation that that's what it's really all about.\"",
      "He adds: \"I thought there was a beautiful poetry in that which we really wanted to bring out in the film, and make it as familiar to people as we can, but also contemporary and real.\"",
      "The 90-minute film features the voices of Curtis regulars such as Bill Nighy, alongside Fiona Shaw, Jodie Whittaker, Lolly Adefope and Brian Cox as Santa Claus.",
      "That Christmas premiered at the London Film Festival in October, where it received broadly positive reviews from critics.",
      "\"It can be easy to sneer at the arrival of a new Christmas movie,\" noted the Hollywood Reporter's Lovia Gyarkye.",
      "\"Genuine holiday cheer is tough to conjure and, if you\u2019re not the intended audience for Hallmark-type saccharinity, the festive fare likely inspires more exasperation than joy.",
      "\"But this one slyly avoids the usual mawkishness by grounding its whimsical story in the real and prickly emotions of life.\"",
      "Next Best Picture's Philip Bagnall suggested the film is \"engineered to keep the kids busy around 4pm on Christmas Day while mum and dad sip their third Irish coffee in peace\".",
      "\"This is unlikely to become a festive classic,\" cautioned Screen Daily's Wendy Ide. \"But the message is a persuasive one: that Christmas comes in many shapes and forms and, ultimately, the only holiday tradition that is non-negotiable is goodwill to all.\"",
      "The film sees the children of the town left to fend for themselves, providing an opportunity to design the kind of Christmas Day they dreamed of, rather than the one planned by their parents which observed various family traditions.",
      "In one scene, the kids attempt to watch a Christmas film as their parents had suggested, but they get so bored they turn it off within moments. In a cheeky twist, the film they dismiss is Curtis's own Love Actually.",
      "Otto says he planted this joke in the movie without Curtis knowing. When the writer finally saw it, he jokes he found it \"very hurtful\".",
      "\"No, not really,\" he laughs. \"It reminded me of course that, when you say 'boring old Christmas movie', I think of Miracle on 34th Street or whatever, but when you say it to a young person, they say Love Actually. It was 20 years ago!\"",
      "One of the film's central questions is whether families should stick to traditions or be open to new experiences.",
      "\"The truth is that it shouldn't be all traditions nor a complete reinvention,\" Otto reflects, \"because some traditions are there for a reason, and we love them. We talk about Santa to our kids for a reason, because there's something magical.\"",
      "One striking thing about the film is how contemporary and diverse it feels. Curtis's earlier films were made in a different era, and he has said in recent years his approach to casting would be different today.",
      "But That Christmas does its best to make up for lost ground. As Ide noted in her review, the film \"unfolds in a fictional Suffolk seaside town... but the wide mix of accents and ethnicities suggests that the filmmakers have tried to cram the whole of Great Britain into this single tiny village\".",
      "It's not only the mixed-race family at the centre of the film which make it feel of the times. The children in the movie are concerned about climate change, and one has chronic anxiety.",
      "There are lighter modern flourishes too - the father in one family christens his van Beyonc\u00e9, smartphones play a big part in the plot, and the soundtrack features Dua Lipa and Ed Sheeran.",
      "Curtis acknowledges the conscious effort to make the film feel current. \"I started my career on a show called Not The Nine O'Clock News,\" he recalls, \"which was contemporary sketches, and I think always in my films I've tried to write jokes that make me laugh now, rather than traditional jokes.",
      "\"And the thing about being a parent is you spend most of your life in the real world of your kids, so I love the fact that it does feel modern, because life as it comes at you these days just is modern.\"",
      "Otto picks up: \"It felt true to me. If you take a snapshot of who lives [in the UK], it varies from region to region of course, but it's such a diverse, interesting, eclectic mix of people.",
      "\"It feels to me like that's the world we live in, and certainly we didn't want to create a world we lived in 10 years ago. If anything, we wanted to create a world we might live in 10 years from now, so more forward looking.\"",
      "The film is being released in a healthy year for animation, with The Wild Robot, Inside Out 2 and Flow among those competing in this year's awards race.",
      "But there is still a certain snobbery towards animated films, and only three have ever scored a best picture nomination - Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story 3 and Up.",
      "Director Guillermo del Toro has previously championed it as its own craft, commenting: \"Animation is not a genre for kids. It's a medium for art.\"",
      "Curtis agrees: \"I feel quite strongly about that at this moment, because for me, the two Spider-Verse movies are the most remarkable movies of the last 10 years.",
      "\"I watch them and I think, 'they must have taken 300 years to make, they're so extraordinary'. In the same way it's turned out that much pop music, which used to be looked down on, is really great, I think every genre can be great, and there are some amazing works of art in the world of animation.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 01:16:27 GMT",
    "summary": "The band scored a hit album named after an 8ft fibreglass gorilla and are finishing a sold-out tour.",
    "story": [
      "After scoring their latest number one with an album named after an eight-foot fibreglass gorilla called Gary, Manchester band Blossoms are doing a victory lap of their home city - with five sold-out gigs in five different venues in five nights.",
      "Musical inspiration can strike any time and anywhere.",
      "Few rock frontmen, though, would have been open to receiving it while in a car listening to a news report about the theft of a giant model gorilla from a Scottish garden centre.",
      "Tom Ogden wrote an indie-pop anthem about the incident, then dedicated their fifth album to the unfortunate inanimate ape.",
      "\"I'm under the impression that anything can be a song, if you approach it in the right manner,\" Ogden reasons.",
      "\"And 10 years in, you're always looking for new things to write about.",
      "\"I found the story entertaining when I heard it on the radio, so just as a laugh I went away [and said] I'm going to write a song about it.",
      "\"I mean, if the song wasn't very good, it would have never seen the light of day. But I rated the song.\"",
      "To Blossoms, Gary has now become muse and mascot, spirit animal and unofficial sixth member of the band.",
      "Both the song and the replica of Gary that the group have taken on tour are fan favourites.",
      "Some would also call it a gimmick, which is partly true, except that not even Ogden could seriously have calculated that the song and the story behind it would really catch on.",
      "\"It has connected with people,\" the singer says. \"I didn't anticipate it, but I knew I wanted to have something that made people go, what's that?",
      "\"Even if people think it is ludicrous, it's an entry point. And people were just ready for a bit of fun, I suppose.",
      "\"You can sense there's something in there which has connected with people for all ages. There are kids who love Gary, and then you've got our age, and then you've got older people.",
      "\"If you come to our shows, you'll see all different ages jumping along and singing to this song.",
      "\"I underestimated people's appetite for the ludicrous, maybe.\"",
      "Watch Blossoms perform on the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland",
      "Watch Blossoms perform on the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland",
      "A decade into their careers, and with four number one albums, Blossoms are serious enough to have the confidence to be ludicrous.",
      "They have also thrown off the indie shackles on a special edition of Gary featuring cover versions of songs by acts ranging from Bob Marley to Lady Gaga and Whitney Houston.",
      "\"We love doing a cover, and we thought we'd cover songs we loved growing up. I always loved I Wanna Dance With Somebody. It's as simple as that,\" Ogden says.",
      "And in recent years, they have joined forces with 1980s star Rick Astley to tour as a The Smiths tribute band.",
      "Blossoms' love of 80s pop was noted in a review in The Times of the Gary album, which declared the track I Like Your Look was \"Wham!-like\".",
      "\"I took that as a huge compliment, because I love Wham!\" Ogden says.",
      "Thick skin",
      "However, the same critic also dismissively described Gary as an \"ultra-shallow album\".",
      "\"I think if you call an album Gary, and you write a song about a fibreglass gorilla, you're out in the open, in terms of someone's going to say something like that,\" the singer responds.",
      "\"But I think there is depth on the album, of course, because there are songs like Mothers, which is about friendship and growing up. And then Why Do I Give You The Worst Of Me? is a very personal song.",
      "\"So I think someone's just thought, yeah, there's a song about fibreglass gorilla, maybe that's a bit of fun. And I Like Your Look\u2019s not taking itself too seriously either.",
      "\"And do you know what, you can\u2019t please everybody so... I don't really care, to be honest.",
      "\"You've got to learn to grow thick skin in this [business]. But I understand if they're saying it because we called the album Gary.",
      "\"Like, fair enough, whatever, man.\"",
      "In August, Blossoms played their biggest headline gig yet, to 30,000 people at Wythenshawe Park in Manchester.",
      "Massive outdoor shows don't always live up to expectations.",
      "In 2019, the band took over Edgeley Park, the home of Stockport County FC, in the Greater Manchester town where they grew up.",
      "\"We only had two albums, and maybe it felt like we weren't as good live, basically, as we are now,\" Ogden reflects.",
      "\"We feel like we\u2019re at the peak of our powers this year.\"",
      "Wythenshawe Park was the \"best gig we've ever done\", he says.",
      "\"We put everything into that show, and in no way did it feel disappointing. It blew us away even more than we expected.\"",
      "After that, when the band came to plan a full UK tour, they weren't sure whether to play in Manchester again.",
      "However, they decided they would - not once but five times, all at different venues of different sizes, and all of which they have played at before at different stages of their careers.",
      "Their mini one-city tour starts at Manchester Academy on Tuesday before visiting the Ritz, Albert Hall, Victoria Warehouse and Apollo.",
      "\"We thought it would be nice to play all the venues that we\u2019d played on the way up and make a week of it, and make it a bit more interesting for the fans,\" Ogden says.",
      "They are all places that hold fond memories for the band.",
      "\"The Ritz was the first big headline show we did in, when we felt like, oh, something's definitely happening here. We sold that out before we had a record deal and was the first time fans were singing and moshing around.",
      "\"I remember going to watch bands at the Academy - I remember watching Jake Bugg there, and I watched Miles Kane there when I was 15 or 16, so I always have a soft spot for that place.",
      "\"And then when we then headlined it in 2016 when our [first] album came out, it felt like, oh yeah, we're part of the big boy [club].",
      "\"The Albert Hall is just a beautiful venue, so the memories of that place are great. We support the Charlatans in the Albert Hall in 2015 and we then headlined it ourselves in 2016.",
      "\"The memories are in the walls of what you were doing last time,\" he adds.",
      "\"You've got to be grateful that you're still around, and people care about the band so much that we can fill all of these places one night after another.\"",

    "summary": "Former health secretary tells inquiry some healthcare settings did run out - \"and it was awful\".",
    "story": [
      "The NHS in England came within \u201csix or seven hours\u201d of running out of gowns and other protective equipment during the Covid pandemic, Matt Hancock has said.",
      "The former health secretary was giving evidence for the third time at the Covid inquiry, about the impact on healthcare systems.",
      "He stated there was never a \u201cnational shortage\u201d of PPE for healthcare workers but \u201cin some places, they did run out - and it was awful\u201d.",
      "Asked about reports that some nurses had to wear binbags early in the Covid crisis, he said the NHS needed to \u201clearn the lessons of what went wrong\u201d and put in place \u201cbetter stockpiles\u201d for the future.",
      "Mr Hancock - who was health secretary at the start of the pandemic in 2020 - will be giving evidence over two days, as the inquiry investigates the impact on the NHS and healthcare across all four UK nations.",
      "On Thursday, the inquiry\u2019s chair, Baroness Hallett, had to occasionally interrupt the hearing to tell bereaved families in the public gallery - some of whom were clearly highly emotional - to lower photographs of their deceased relatives.",
      "'Left to die'",
      "Earlier, the former MP faced robust questioning about the squeeze on facilities many hospitals had endured at the peak of the two most significant waves of Covid.",
      "In March 2020, Mr Hancock said he was \u201cpetrified\u201d newly announced lockdown rules might not be stringent enough to avoid a repeat of scenes in northern Italy, where some Covid patients had struggled to access any care.",
      "But while some hospitals in England came under \u201cextraordinary pressure\u201d, the wider NHS system was never overwhelmed, he added.",
      "Mr Hancock was then asked about the case of Suzie Sullivan, who died of Covid in 2020.",
      "Medical notes written at the time stated Suzie was not suitable for a transfer to intensive care due to a pre-existing heart condition and having Down's syndrome. Her father, John, told an earlier session of the inquiry she was \u201cleft to die\u201d because of her disability.",
      "Mr Hancock accepted that a bed in intensive care could not be found for every individual patient who needed it at the height of the pandemic.",
      "\u201cOf course there was enormous pressure, and of course, it has consequences,\u201d he said.",
      "He said, at times, staff ratios had to be stretched, meaning specialist critical care nurses had to look after six patients rather than give the one-to-one care they would in normal times.",
      "But he added: \u201cWhat we successfully avoided, was an overall rationing - to say, 'people, according to these characteristics, aren\u2019t going to be cared for'.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what would have happened if we had let the virus get more out of control.",
      "\u201cDid people get as good care as they would have done in normal times? Of course not. There was a pandemic,\u201d he told the inquiry.",
      "Asked about the imposed visiting restrictions, which meant some relatives could not be with dying family members in their final hours, and elsewhere, expectant fathers could not attend ante-natal scans, he said \u201con balance\u201d he believed the government got the rules \u201cabout right\u201d.",
      "\u201cWhere I think we got it wrong, for instance, was the way that the funeral guidance was applied on the ground - it wasn\u2019t as had been intended.\u201d",
      "Other witnesses, including the first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, and Scotland\u2019s former health minister Jeane Freeman, have suggested some of those restrictions, or they way they were implemented, might have gone too far.",
      "Mr Hancock also defended the government\u2019s 'Stay Home, Save Lives, Protect the NHS' messaging, saying that it was \u201cliterally true\u201d that \u201cif we didn\u2019t stop the spread of the virus, the NHS would be overwhelmed\u201d.",
      "Giving evidence recently, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, said, with hindsight, the authorities did not suceed in letting the public know the NHS was still open for non-Covid patients during the pandemic.",
      "Mr Hancock alluded to how he had had to \u201cruffle some feathers\u201d to protect the NHS from political interference.",
      "He said he felt it was his job to \u201cshield\u201d the health service from \u201cpeople being difficult in Number 10\u201d.",
      "Some of the interference by political appointees in Downing Street caused \u201cincredible difficulties\u201d when it came to rolling out Covid testing, he added."

      "News reports and testimonies suggest the tourists may have consumed alcohol laced with methanol - a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol.",
      "Just a small amount of methanol can be lethal, but it is sometimes added to drinks because it is cheaper than alcohol.",
      "But, as Christer Hogstrand, a professor of molecular ecotoxicology, at King\u2019s College London points out, it is also \u201cnot uncommon in home-distilled alcohol\".",
      "\u201cMethanol is like the alcohol in our drinks \u2013 colourless and odourless \u2013 but its impact on humans can be deadly,\" he explained. \"It has a different carbon atom structure which completely changes how humans process it in the body, leading to these potentially fatal consequences.\u201d",
      "It is not yet known where any of the people who fell sick or died were poisoned. It can take up to 24 hours for victims to start showing signs of illness.",
      "The Nana Backpacker Hostel - where the Australian teenagers were staying - has said it gave out free shots to around 100 guests the previous evening.",
      "But the hostel's manager told news agency Associated Press that no other guests had become unwell.",
      "The manager of the hostel has since been detained for questioning by police.",
      "Few details have emerged about any of the other victims and where they may have visited.",

      "The novel insight is akin to moving from the maps of the 15th Century era of Joan of Arc and Richard III to what the phone in your pocket can load.",
      "The old maps of the body had the equivalent of major roads and significant geography but also areas cartographers labelled unknown or \u201cterra incognita\u201d.",

      "The latest discoveries include a map of the gut all the way from the mouth, down the oesphagus, into the stomach and intestines and out the anus.",
      "Researchers looked at the types of cells, where they were located and how they chatted to the other cells around them.",
      "Out of the 1.6 million cells analysed was a new form, called a gut metaplastic cell. It seems to play a role in exacerbating inflammation in the seven million people that live with inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease.",
      "\u201cWe were able to uncover a pathogenic cell type that may play a role in some chronic conditions and could be a target for [drug] intervention in the future,\u201d said Dr Rasa Elmentaite, who did the research at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.",

      "A British woman, two Australian women, a US man and two Danish nationals have died. The deaths remain under police investigation, but reports suggest they may have consumed drinks tainted with methanol, a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol.",
      "Methanol poisoning has long been a well-known issue across South East Asia, particularly in the poorer countries along the Mekong river.",
      "But despite foreign governments posting warnings about alcohol consumption in these places, there is still little awareness among the backpacker party scene.",
      "Flavourless and colourless, methanol is hard to detect in drinks and victims typically don\u2019t see symptoms of poisoning straight away.",
      "And in countries like Laos - one of the poorest and least developed in Asia - the problem arises from alcohol suppliers exploiting an environment where there is low law enforcement and almost no regulation in food and hospitality industries.",
      "What is methanol poisoning?",
      "Methanol is a toxic alcohol used in industrial and household products like paint thinners, antifreeze, varnish and photocopier fluid.",
      "It is colourless and has a similar smell to ethyl alcohol - the chemical substance found in alcoholic drinks.",
      "But methanol is dangerous for humans and drinking just 25ml or half a shot can be lethal.",
      "It can take up to 24 hours for victims to start showing signs of illness which include: nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain which can escalate into hyperventilation and breathing problems.",
      "If not treated, fatality rates are often reported to be 20% to 40%, depending on the concentration of methanol and the amount taken, says international medical charity Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) which tracks the number of global outbreaks.",
      "But if a poisoning is diagnosed quickly enough, ideally within the first 30 hours, treatment can reduce some of the worse effects.",
      "How common is the problem in South East Asia?",
      "Asia has the highest prevalence of methanol poisoning worldwide, according to MSF\u2019s database.",
      "It mainly affects poorer countries- outbreaks are common in Indonesia, India, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines.",
      "Indonesia is regarded as the hotspot \u2013 it has reported the highest number of incidents in the past two decades, according to MSF, largely down to the widespread production and consumption of bootleg liquor.",
      "Towns like Vang Vieng in Laos, where the fatal poisonings took place, are known stops on the backpacking trail through South East Asia. The town's economy is built on tourism, with streets of bars, restaurants and hostels that cater to visitors.",
      "But in Laos, law enforcement is under-resourced and there are few regulations around food and alcohol standards. There is also an industry of home-brewed  alcohol, which can lead to accidental poisonings.",
      "Producers also make counterfeit drinks with methanol instead of ethanol because it is cheaper, say local observers.",

      "They said methanol poisonings were frequently reported to consulates across the region.",
      "However, a lack of data means it is hard to quantify the scale of the contamination, and where tainted drinks enter the supply chain.",

      "\"You mimic your mum who used it,\" she said. \"Baby powder was supposed to be something deemed 'safe to use', even on a baby's bum.\"",
      "If it proceeds, the legal action would be the first of its kind brought against the pharmaceutical multinational in the UK.",

      "John Prescott, the Labour Party stalwart who rose from being a steward on a cruise ship to serving as deputy prime minister for a record ten years, has died at the age of 86.",
      "Former prime ministers Sir Tony Blair and Gordon Brown led tributes to Lord Prescott, one of the most colourful politicians of their era.",
      "Here are seven of his most memorable moments.",

      "No one was quite like John Prescott, says Blair",
      "Barnstorming speech bails out leader",
      "Prescott had been a Labour MP since 1970 - and had already made two failed attempts to become the party's deputy leader, when he strode on to the party conference stage in Brighton in 1993, to deliver the speech of his life.",
      "Labour's then-leader John Smith was trying to bring in controversial changes to switch to one-member-one vote for selecting parliamentary candidates, in the teeth of strong opposition from many trade unions who saw it as a dilution of their power.",
      "With Smith facing likely defeat and, with it, possibly the end of his leadership, he turned to Prescott - the lifelong trade unionist - to win over waverers.",
      "Despite a later reputation for mangling his words, Prescott's performance in the conference hall was an impassioned tour de force.",
      "\"There is no doubt that this man, our leader, put his head on the block... He has put his head there, now it is time to vote. Give us a little trust,\" he said.",
      "He never looked back. When Smith died little more than six months later, Prescott was - at the third attempt - elected deputy Labour leader, and became deputy PM in 1997.",
      "Kyoto deal broker",
      "In December 1997, the UK delegation led by the deputy PM played a leading role in agreeing the landmark Kyoto Protocol on climate change.",
      "For the first time, nearly all UN member states committed themselves to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, based on a scientific consensus that human-made CO2 was driving global warming.",
      "The negotiations in Japan ran way past their deadline and there were fears no deal would be struck.",
      "Climate campaigner and then-US Vice-President Al Gore said Prescott \"fought like hell\" for an agreement and was \"an unwavering champion of climate action for decades to come\".",
      "He \"possessed an inherent ability to connect with people about the issues that mattered to them - a talent that others spend years studying and cultivating, but that was second nature to him,\" Gore added.",

      "'You\u2019ve got a voice kid, use it' - how John Prescott inspired Angela Rayner",
      "Left hook",
      "Prescott himself said, if he was remembered for just one thing, it would be for his punch during the 2001 general election campaign.",
      "The campaign itself is remembered for little else, as Labour was returned to power with almost as large a Commons majority as four years earlier.",
      "Arriving for a party rally in Rhyl, Denbighshire, a pro-hunting supporter cracked an egg on Prescott's head.",
      "As the TV cameras continued to roll, the deputy PM responded with a left hook.",
      "A scuffle ensued, but was quickly broken up by bystanders and police.",
      "Blair's communications chief Alastair Campbell told Prescott he needed to issue a public apology. He refused.",
      "At a press conference the following morning, Blair said it would have been better if it had not happened, while adding: \"John is John\".",
      "The incident did not appear to dent either Prescott's or Labour's ratings in the polls.",
      "Two Jags to zero Jags",
      "Prescott was given the nickname \u201ctwo Jags\u201d by the press after it was revealed he used two Jaguar cars \u2013 one of them his own and the second a ministerial car.",
      "During the Labour conference in Bournemouth in 1999, his government car took him 250 yards from his hotel to the conference centre.",
      "On stage, as environment and transport secretary, he then urged motorists to cut their carbon emissions by using public transport.",
      "He later claimed he had taken the short journey by car because his wife, Pauline, did not like to have her hair blown about on the seafront.",
      "In 2021, Lord Prescott revealed he had since decided to make his \u201cown small contribution to cutting carbon emissions\u201d.",
      "\"I am now zero Jags \u2013 selling a car or eating fish and chips with a lower carbon footprint alone won\u2019t save the planet, but as the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu once said: \u2018Great acts are made up of small deeds\u2019,\u201d he wrote in The Times.",
      "His son David told the BBC his father had given up cars for good.",
      "Devolution delayed",
      "When Prescott became deputy PM in 1997, he was also handed a very large portfolio as secretary of state for the new Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions.",
      "In 2001, this was broken up, with separate departments for environment, food and rural affairs, and for transport, hived off.",
      "One of Prescott's passions was devolution for England's regions - to follow Scotland and Wales - though the elected regional assemblies he envisaged would have had fewer powers.",
      "Because of the scale of opposition to his plans, the government held a referendum on them in 2004, in the North-East region where support was thought to be strongest.",
      "The result was a bitter pill for Prescott to swallow, with 78% of the votes cast against devolution. A young Dominic Cummings was the mastermind behind the victorious No campaign, trying out tactics and messages he would later use in the 2016 Brexit referendum.",
      "Prescott's plan for elected regional assemblies was quickly shelved.",
      "Nevertheless, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown, said Prescott was the first person to give the north of England a political profile and paved the way for later devolution to metro mayors.",
      "Old flame at a TV wedding",
      "Prescott briefly appeared in hit TV comedy Gavin & Stacey in 2010.",
      "In the third series of the BBC show, Ruth Jones\u2019s character Nessa Jenkins regularly recalled fictional previous relationships with celebrities including Prescott.",
      "In the final episode, he made a cameo appearance as himself, arriving as a guest at Nessa\u2019s wedding as she prepared to marry fiance Dave Coaches.",
      "He enters the church and congratulates Dave, who replies: \u201cCheers John, nice to see you.\u201d",
      "Prescott wrote on his blog: \"I suppose I have to accept it appears I\u2019ve lost out to a better man.\u201d",
      "According to Nessa on screen, he gave her \u201cfull use of one of the Jags\u201d.",
      "Tears over Billy Elliot",
      "For many Labour supporters and activists, there was a sense that Prescott provided an antidote to the spin and slick presentation of New Labour.",
      "Often ridiculed by parliamentary sketch writers for mangling the English language, to supporters he appeared an ordinary man facing the intellectual bullying by people with a better education.",
      "His favourite film was Billy Elliot, the tale of a northern working-class boy who fights poverty and prejudice to become a leading ballet dancer.",
      "Prescott said he had seen it five times after it first came out in 2000. He also revealed it made him cry."

    "story": [
      "Energy regulator Ofgem is urging billpayers to shop around as it announced another price rise in January - the second of the winter.",
      "Someone paying by direct debit and using a typical amount of gas and electricity will pay \u00a31,738, or \u00a321 a year more, with bills now over 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "The quarterly cap by regulator Ofgem sets a limit on the cost of each unit of energy, and affects 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "It was always meant to be a backstop, and Ofgem said more options had emerged from suppliers, with a greater choice of fixed-price tariffs for customers.",
      "The best deals are cheaper than tariffs based on the price cap. But, while offering certainty, anyone signing up risks missing out were prices to fall later next year.",
      "Ofgem has admitted that prices are volatile and difficult to predict.",
      "Some customers could immediately save \u00a3100 a year by moving from paying their bill every three months to paying by direct debit.",
      "Difficult winter",
      "Energy bills have been high for three years, which charities warn has left many struggling to cope and choosing to go without heating at the coldest time of year.",
      "After two relatively mild winters since energy prices soared, billpayers are braced for a colder period that could stretch their finances.",
      "And over the longer term, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight said high domestic energy prices were likely to be \"the new normal\".",
      "Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the forecasts meant particularly families and people with disabilities faced \u201cimpossible choices\u201d.",
      "\"For bills to remain at this high level... and with an expectation that they'll remain at that level for the foreseeable future, we're just expecting to see people continuing to be really squeezed.\"",
      "The cap means a household bill will typically rise by \u00a31.75 a month.",
      "It is also 10% down on the same period last year, but Ofgem said many billpayers would still be stretched.",
      "\"We understand that the cost of energy remains a challenge for too many households,\" said Tim Jarvis, from the regulator.",
      "\"However, with more tariffs coming into the market, there are ways for customers to bring their bill down so please shop around and look at all the options.\"",
      "What is happening to the energy price cap?",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "What are cold weather payments and who can get them?",
      "Debt building up",
      "While the cost of each unit of gas and electricity is capped, the total bill is not. So, a long, cold winter could see higher energy use and high bills.",
      "Energy companies say they have put extra support in place to help customers cope with the situation, such as emergency credit, hardship funds or striking off some debts or standing charges.",
      "However a period of high prices - which analysts say is likely to continue - means households have collectively built up debt of \u00a33.7bn to suppliers.",
      "The average household in arrears owes more than \u00a31,500 for electricity and \u00a31,300 for gas.",
      "The charity National Energy Action said many people were already \"rationing their energy use\" or building up debt to try to keep warm.",
      "Angela, from Liverpool, is one of those who has fallen behind on bills.",
      "As a carer for her mum, she told the BBC she was having to make tough choices.",
      "\"I\u2019m over \u00a31,000 in arrears with [my energy supplier] so I don\u2019t put the gas and electric on,\" she said. \"We just sit there with our onesies on of a night. I think it\u2019s terrible, it\u2019s a disgrace.\"",
      "Close to where she was speaking is Kitty's Laundrette, a co-operative which provides cheap washing and drying for the community, as well as a free service for those who need it.",
      "Anthony Scott is part of the team running it, seeing dozens of customers every day, many of whom are struggling financially.",
      "\u201cI come across a lot of anger, I feel a lot of anger. People are being priced out of using energy in their own home,\" he said.",
      "Winter fuel payment debate",
      "The cap affects those on default, variable tariffs, not those who have fixed a price for a set period.",
      "It is set every three months by Ofgem, although the regulator illustrates the change by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "To estimate the effect on an individual's annual costs, billpayers can add 1.2% to their current bill.",
      "Some households will have less support than last winter because the final cost-of-living payment was made to eight million people on means-tested benefits in February.",
      "For pensioners, the previously universal winter fuel payment, worth up to \u00a3300, is now only being paid only to those on low incomes who receive certain benefits.",
      "According to the government's own estimates, an additional 50,000 pensioners will be living in relative poverty next year as a result of cuts to the payment.",
      "However, this fails to take into account any increased uptake of pension credit - which qualifies people for the winter fuel payment.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the UK was \"exposed to the rollercoaster of global fossil fuel markets\", which was why the government was concentrating on generating power in the UK.",
      "He admitted the latest price rise would \"concern\" many families.",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey called on the government to reinstate winter fuel payments to all pensioners and \"cancel the bill rise\".",
      "Some pensioner households affected in Northern Ireland will receive a one-off \u00a3100 payment.",
      "The energy market is regulated differently in Northern Ireland, and is not governed by the same price cap.",
      "Standing charges almost unchanged",
      "The latest change in prices means:",
      "Gas prices are capped at an average of 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86p per kWh - up from 6.24p and 24.5p respectively.

      "\"The Music Venues Trust tries to prevent the unnecessary closure of grassroots music venues. They come under pressure for all sorts of reasons: bad landlords, complaints about noise or other issues.",
      "\"We did this through a private member's bill in Westminster: The Agent of Change Bill had cross-party support and passed into law.",
      "\"So the principle has been established. But it doesn't mean there aren't still other pressures on venues, from issues like planning to financial viability rates.\"",
      "However, perhaps their friendship was not so unlikely. Brennan, who stood down as an MP in July after 23 years, played in what he called the world's first parliamentary rock band, MP4, and wrote and recorded his own songs.",
      "\"It transpired that Kevin was an accomplished folk musician,\" said Matlock. \"He told me about recording his album and I said 'I can put some bass on it if you like'.\"",
      "Brennan said: \"So I ended up making my little indie folk album The Clown and the Cigarette Girl with a Sex Pistol on bass.",
      "\"We did a launch in Cardiff, a big surprise for the crowd of 150 to see a punk legend at St John's Church in Canton. Then the next night he played with Blondie in front of a few thousand people [in Cardiff].",
      "\"He's a musician\u2019s musician - he just loves to play.",
      "\"I never thought when I became a MP I'd end up playing in a band with a Sex Pistol. Funny how things turn out!\"",
      "Matlock praised Brennan as a \"very good folk musician\" and \"one of the few people in Parliament\" who had talked about the effects of Brexit on touring musicians.",
      "The Pistols' bassist said there was now \"a realisation Brexit hasn't been good for touring musicians. There's been a huge knock-on effect, not just for musicians, but for trucking companies, catering workers, lighting guys. There has to be a better way through it.",
      "\"People like [The Who singer] Roger Daltrey and Johnny Rotten were pro-Brexit. But when they realised it would affect them they signed a petition to try to say we've got to have special rights.\"",
      "He added: \"I haven't spoken to John directly about this, but he knows what I think.\u201d",
      "For his part, Daltrey said in 2021 that he still supported Brexit, but wished the Conservative government at the time had \"made the easing of restrictions for musicians and actors a higher priority\".",
      "On his latest tour, Matlock is purposely picking venues in smaller towns that do not often feature on tour schedules.",
      "So he plays The Tivoli in Buckley, Flintshire, on Thursday, 21 November, and Clwb Crown in Merthyr on Friday 29 November.",
      "The Merthyr date brings flashbacks to a gig the Pistols played a few miles away in Caerphilly almost 48 years ago at the height of their notoriety.",
      "In December 1976 the band had just sworn on teatime TV and many shows on their Anarchy in the UK tour were banned. But although the Caerphilly gig went ahead, they were met by a large group of singing Christians, who picketed fans as they went in, which featured in the Pistols' film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.",
      "Matlock said: \"The show was rescheduled from the Anarchy tour. Things got big in the meantime, we went back a few weeks later and there were people saying we were calling up the devil and kids would go to hell if they went to the gig.",
      "\"It was cold and pouring with rain, we were inside and they were all out getting wet. One of the local councillors in more recent years admitted it was all a bit daft, really. Good publicity at the time, though.\"",
      "By next year, Matlock will have been performing live for 50 years, and has no intention of slowing down. He has played with bands like Blondie, The Faces, and Primal Scream as well as the recently reformed Pistols, has written two books about his life in music, and his latest solo LP is Consequences Coming.",
      "He said: \"I still write protest songs. I think consequences have been coming for a long time for some our more self-centred politicians. I still have so much to say.\"",
      "Matlock added: \"I never used to think past the end of the week when I was a teenager. But collectively with the Sex Pistols we really had something.",

      "Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said the decision to restrict the \u00a3300 payment to all but the poorest pensioners this winter was made with a \"heavy heart\".",
      "But he insisted the \"difficult\" decision was required to repair the public finances.",
      "It comes after the government disclosed an official estimate that the move would push an extra 50,000 pensioners into poverty.",
      "It says this figure does not account for its ongoing drive to increase take-up of pension credit among an estimated 880,000 eligible pensioners not currently claiming the top-up.",
      "Winter fuel cut to put 50,000 into poverty next year",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "Winter fuel payment is a lump-sum amount of \u00a3200 a year for pensioners under 80, increasing to \u00a3300 for over 80s, paid in November or December.",
      "It was introduced in 1997 as a universal payment to reassure pensioners they would be able to heat their homes as temperatures drop, although in practice recipients can spend it on whatever they want.",
      "But from this winter, it will be restricted to those who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits, meaning around 9 million pensioners will no longer get it.",
      "It did not feature in Labour's election manifesto and the move, announced three weeks after its return to power, caught many MPs by surprise.",
      "Ministers say means-testing the payment will save the Treasury \u00a31.4bn this year and is required to help fix a \"black hole\" in the Tories' spending plans for this year identified by a specially-commissioned spending audit in July.",
      "Scottish Labour has pledged to make the payment universal again if it forms the next Scottish government after elections in 2026.",

      "Despite requests from MPs, the government did not disclose its internal assessment of the impact of the policy when a law to implement it went through Parliament.",
      "It prompted criticism from a House of Lords committee, which said the change was being introduced \"at a pace that does not permit appropriate scrutiny\".",
      "On Tuesday, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall told a Commons committee that her department estimated the move would lead to a 50,000 increase in the number of pensioners in relative poverty next year after housing costs.",
      "This had been revised down from an estimate of 100,000 made \"at the time of the original policy decision,\" she added.",
      "The figures are rounded to the nearest 50,000, with Kendall adding this meant \"small variations\" in the underlying numbers could \"lead to much larger changes in the rounded headline numbers\".",
      "The government estimates 1.9 million pensioners - around 15% - are currently in relative poverty, meaning their income is 60% less than the median average.",
      "It has estimated that around 880,000 pensioners who qualify for pension credit at the moment are not claiming it, and would therefore be eligible to continue to receive winter fuel payments if they did.",
      "The government has estimated that means-testing winter fuel payments will save \u00a31.4bn this year, based on around 100,000 pensioners out of those 880,000 coming forward to claim pension credit.",
      "The Treasury has said the scale of the take-up is the main uncertainty when it comes to working out how much the measure will save.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Kyle said the government had been \"forced to take\" the decision \"because of the inheritance that we had from the previous administration\".",

      "John Prescott, who has died aged 86, was a figurehead of New Labour, who was also instinctively sceptical of some of its instincts.",
      "He was a bridgehead to Labour's traditional working class roots who saw the value in, and indeed personified, championing the aspirations of the less well off.",
      "His value to Tony Blair, who swept to a landslide victory in 1997 and went on to win two further elections with Prescott at his side, was that he could reassure and lead those within Labour sceptical of its movement towards the centre.",
      "He was also a binding agent, skilled at holding the party and its sometimes warring factions together.",
      "It is not hard to see the parallels between then and now, when we once again have a plain-speaking working class northerner as deputy prime minister to a polished North London lawyer.",
      "Angela Rayner's backstory - and approach to politics - have clear parallels with John Prescott, something Rayner herself has openly acknowledged.",
      "Describing how she planned to do the job of deputy PM in 2022, she told LBC:  \"I'm going to be John Prescott in a skirt, I just say it how I see it.\"",
      "She added: \"Me and John are good mates, we see each other quite frequently, and I definitely look better in a skirt.\"",
      "Speaking to broadcasters after news of his death, Rayner said he had been \"a huge support to me ever since I came into politics\", offering the advice to \"be authentically yourself and keep thinking about the people you\u2019re there to represent\".",
      "She added: \"That\u2019s what he always said to me, 'you\u2019ve got a voice kid, use it'\".",

      "No one was quite like John Prescott, says Blair",
      "Both left school with few qualifications and worked their way up through the union movement, before entering politics.",
      "And both were able to articulate the authentic instincts of Labour's base of supporters, in a language, and style, they themselves would often use.",
      "Prescott sometimes had an unconventional way of wooing voters, which on one famous occasion stretched to punching one of them.",
      "And, in the 2020s, as the modern Labour Party sought to jump start its popularity, courting recent Conservative voters, it was Rayner who described some Tory ministers as \u201ca bunch of scum\u201d \u2013 remarks she later apologised for.",
      "The old jibe that all politicians look and sound the same could never apply to Prescott or Rayner.",
      "Social class is a key prism through which to reflect on Prescott\u2019s career, politics and life.",
      "For all the talk about how he was the authentic working class grit in the smooth, polished very middle class New Labour, that sense of his class \u2013 \u201cbottom class\u201d as he put it \u2013 and others was a huge part of how he saw himself, and how he saw others.",
      "If you have a moment today, I recommend listening to this wonderful documentary on BBC Sounds \u2013 Prescott At Your Service - which tells the story of a 19-year-old John Prescott working as a waiter on a cruise ship to New Zealand, where the future deputy prime minister would serve the recently resigned former prime minister Anthony Eden.",
      "Decades later, Tony Blair would reflect that Prescott\u2019s own self image was an ever present in his daily interactions in government.",

      "No one was quite like John Prescott, says Blair",
      "Ship's steward",
      "John Leslie Prescott was born in Prestatyn, then in Flintshire, on 31 May 1938. His father was a railway signalman and his mother came from a mining family.",
      "Although his family left Wales when he was four, he remained proud of his heritage and always considered himself Welsh.",
      "He became a trainee chef on leaving school at 15 and then worked for eight years as a ship's steward on passenger liners, becoming active in the National Union of Seamen.",
      "In 1962, he went to Ruskin College, Oxford, where he got a diploma in economics and politics, and later to Hull University to study for an economics degree.",
      "Active in the merchant sailors' strike of 1966, he served as an official with the National Union of Seamen for two years before his election, in 1970, as MP for Hull East, sponsored by the union.",
      "Cherished principles",
      "John Prescott became a Labour frontbench spokesman in May 1979 and joined the shadow cabinet in 1983, gaining a reputation as a pugnacious and knowledgeable spokesman on transport.",
      "The same year his showman's instincts saw him swim two miles down the River Thames to highlight opposition to Margaret Thatcher's government policy of dumping nuclear waste at sea.",
      "But it was the Labour leader John Smith who finally gave John Prescott political room to breathe, with a key role in selling modernisation to the party and unions.",
      "It was John Smith who kick-started Labour's slow return to power, overturning many of the party's most cherished principles in a drive to make it electable again.",
      "And John Prescott, with his strong union links and no-nonsense approach, offered vital support, not least in the abolition of the union block vote that had been Labour policy for years.",
      "When Tony Blair became leader, following John Smith's untimely death in 1994, he too recognised the importance of keeping John Prescott on board.",
      "The Hull East MP became deputy leader and later deputy prime minister with wide departmental responsibility over transport and the environment.",
      "He pledged to create an integrated transport system and said his success would be measured by a reduction in people needing to use a car.",
      "This caused him considerable embarrassment when, at the 1999 Labour conference, he used his ministerial car - a Jaguar - for a 200-yard journey back to his hotel.",
      "In typical Prescott style, he claimed it was so his wife Pauline's hair would not get blown about.",
      "But the politician, who also owned a Jaguar himself, was soon dubbed \"two Jags\" in the press.",
      "He once described himself as the guard on the Labour train - ready to slow it down if it moved off the rails. Yet his solid working-class credentials added powerful support to Tony Blair and the Labour modernisers.",
      "He campaigned passionately against the Conservative policy of privatising Britain's railways and was reported to have been furious when Labour failed to adopt a policy of renationalisation when returned to power.",
      "Election punch",
      "His policy of creating elected regional assemblies to oversee the new regional development agencies also hit the buffers, when, in a referendum in a pilot area in England's North East, 78% of people rejected the idea.",
      "He also faced opposition over his so-called Pathfinder project, designed to provide thousands of new homes.",
      "As part of the policy, about 200,000 homes in the North of England were demolished, which, critics said, could have been renovated at much less cost.",
      "His passion and burly style of delivery were constant features.",
      "He repeatedly described New Labour's mission as delivering \"traditional values in a modern setting\" - a powerful if somewhat intangible concept.",
      "Mocked by some for mangling his syntax, he often still managed to inject humour into difficult situations - such as when he was criticised for accusing a female French minister of being too tired to understand the intricacies of an environment summit.",
      "\"As to whether I am accused of being a macho man - moi?\" he told the Commons. \"I must say the remark leaves me most gutted.\"",
      "He hit the headlines during the 2001 general election after he was filmed throwing a punch at a member of the public who had thrown an egg at him during a protest in Rhyl, Flintshire.",
      "John Prescott said he had acted in self-defence and police refused to take any further action. Subsequent newspaper polls suggested most people supported his reaction.",
      "Oyster bar",
      "In later days, John Prescott reportedly had to act as a peacemaker between Tony Blair and the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, as speculation about the succession to the leadership ebbed and flowed.",
      "His own comment in a newspaper, that the \"tectonic plates\" in the Labour Party were moving, gave rise to suggestions of manoeuvring within the cabinet.",
      "And when he was seen sharing a car with Gordon Brown and stopping off at a Scottish oyster bar, the rumours that Tony Blair was about to stand down intensified.",
      "However, as his career as an MP neared its end, the headlines surrounding John Prescott concentrated on his private life.",
      "In 2006, he admitted to an affair with his former secretary Tracey Temple, which led to a raft of lurid stories.",
      "In a cabinet reshuffle soon after the revelations emerged, John Prescott was stripped of his department, although kept on as deputy prime minister and allowed to retain his salary and grace-and-favour homes.",
      "But, in a further embarrassment, he felt compelled to give up his country pile, Dorneywood, after being pictured on its lawns playing croquet with his staff - an image at odds with his down-to-earth reputation.",
      "It was later revealed he had visited the US ranch of businessman Philip Anschutz - whose company took over the running of the Millennium Dome and who was bidding to build Britain's first super-casino.",
      "Critics said there was a conflict of interest. John Prescott, who met Mr Anschutz seven times, failed to declare the visit for 11 months. He eventually said he had gone because he liked cowboy films.",
      "The Commons Standards and Privileges Committee ruled the ministerial code had been broken because the trip had not been declared immediately.",
      "Lording it",
      "Shortly after Tony Blair said he would be stepping down as prime minister, John Prescott announced he would relinquish his role as deputy.",
      "He ended his time in government with no ministerial brief of his own and was seen by many as a peripheral figure.",
      "To the surprise of many of his supporters, he accepted a peerage in 2010 despite reportedly having once said: \"I don't want to be a member of the House of Lords. I will not accept it.\"",
      "He defended the decision because it would give him continued influence over environmental policy and he refused to treat the red benches as an upmarket retirement home, using them as a platform to carry on campaigning.",
      "He continued to serve in the Lords until July of this year, when he was removed for non-attendance - bringing down the curtain on a parliamentary career of more than 50 years.",
      "His most robust interventions in Lords debates involved attacking the government's response to the phone-hacking scandal.",
      "For Lord Prescott, the matter was personal - his lawyers alleged the News of the World had placed him under surveillance, and in 2012 he won a pay out from the paper's parent company, News International.",
      "He was back on the stump again in 2012 when he stood as a candidate in Humberside in the elections for the new office of police and crime commissioner.",
      "He was said to be disappointed when he lost out to a Conservative opponent on the second round of balloting.",
      "Party loyalist",
      "John Prescott remained a Labour loyalist at heart.",
      "While ultimately distancing himself from Tony Blair's decision to go to war in Iraq, he defended his former boss' legacy and was equally supportive of the different leaders that followed him.",
      "He also advised the then-Labour leader Ed Miliband in the run up to the 2015 election.",
      "He was far from a natural bedfellow of Jeremy Corbyn but insisted the left-wing campaigner - who opposed nearly all of what New Labour stood for - had \"proved himself\", and urged dissident MPs to support him.",
      "His son David - who himself stood unsuccessfully for Parliament - was even part of Jeremy Corbyn's team.",
      "And speaking at Labour's 2017 conference - the 51st he had attended - he said the party was on the path back to government and had a \"really exciting\" future.",
      "In 2019, he suffered a stroke and was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary. But his former Labour colleague, Alan Johnson, said there were \"no signs of him slowing down at all\".",
      "To the very end, he represented a breed apart from many of his contemporaries - a Labour MP who had cut his campaigning teeth in a trades union rather than as a political adviser and who believed political principles had to be married to power.",

      "On a spring day, Hamid Khoshsiar decided to make the perilous journey into the European Union. He was 31 at the time, an Iranian refugee who had been living in Turkey for two years. But in 2019, he felt it was time to go.",
      "Starting out in Igneada, in the north of the country, he walked along a slippery, uneven trail for half a day, through dense forest and sharp shrubbery in the direction of Bulgaria. Eventually he reached the border.",
      "His best option, he decided, was to swim across a small river. The waters were mercifully calm. Packing his scant belongings into plastic bags, he waded in.",
      "\u201cThere was so much adrenaline in my blood,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThe only thing that was important to me was safety. All my mind was about that: am I going to find safety or not?\u201d",
      "It would take him 20 hours to reach safety in Bulgaria, where he now lives with refugee status. As for the journey, he says he could have died from dehydration had he not been found by a police patrol. Still, it was the best decision of his life.",
      "\u201cIt was worth it because I didn\u2019t have any other option. I was so lucky.\u201d",
      "Over the past five years, more and more migrants have decided to try their luck following the same path, known as the Eastern Mediterranean route. It starts in Turkey and moves into either Bulgaria or Greece; and then, for many, deeper in Europe.",
      "Whilst other routes - like the path from the north African coast to Italy - have seen a fall, the numbers entering Europe via this Eastern Mediterranean route tripled between 2021 and 2023 and is still rising, according to EU border agency Frontex.",
      "It now stands at well over 60,000 a year. Many are Afghan and a number are Turkish and Syrian. Some, eventually, end up on the shores of Britain.",
      "Since taking power, the Labour government has repeatedly promised to \u201csmash\u201d the smuggling gangs who lead them here.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s strategy focuses heavily on policing. He has promised to treat smugglers like terrorists, disrupting their plans \u201cbefore they act\u201d. On 4 November, the prime minister announced plans to create a new Border Security Command, which the government say will have enhanced powers to trace suspected traffickers and shut down their bank accounts. One hundred additional specialist investigators will be assigned to the National Crime Agency (NCA), one of the UK bodies tasked with cracking down on people smugglers, while the Crown Prosecution Service will deliver charging decisions more quickly in international organised crime cases.",
      "But is it enough? After all, the Conservatives had their own version of Labour\u2019s slogan, promising to \u201cstop the boats\u201d - and yet in the year to June 2024, some 38,784 irregular arrivals were detected - 81% of them arrived in small boats.",
      "So what makes Labour think it will fare differently, and that its police-first strategy will work?",
      "The Today Podcast",
      "Special report: Europe\u2019s frontline against illegal migration",
      "Can you smash the gangs to stop the boats?",
      "Over the last week, as part of a series on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, we traced the path of migrants from Turkey to Bulgaria to the rest of Europe - the \u201cbiggest growth route\u201d for those travelling into Europe, according to the University of Oxford\u2019s Migration Observatory - in search of what it will really take to \u201csmash the gangs\u201d.",
      "When we talk about smuggling gangs, we tend to focus on the end of the process, such as the UK's relations with France, and on the movement of people across the English Channel, but our route marks the start of the journey: it\u2019s where migrants first enter Europe.",
      "Along the way,  we spoke to migrants who shared their complicated reasons for putting their lives in the hands of people smugglers. What soon became clear was the sheer magnitude of the government\u2019s task.",
      "Gateway to Europe: the Turkey challenge",
      "The crowded shopping bazaar in the Istanbul district of Esenyurt is popular with the thousands of Syrian refugees who live in the region. \u201cYou can see Syrian shops here,\u201d Husam, a Syrian refugee, told us as he showed us around after Friday prayers. \u201cMany were not here in 2015. You have falafel, shawarma - many shops for Syrian food. It was a comfortable, safe place for Syrians.\u201d But now the mood is darkening.",
      "\u201cIn the past few years it\u2019s not safe any more,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere are groups of racist people who don\u2019t like refugees. On public transportation you cannot speak comfortably in Arabic on your phone. People are attacked [for] speaking Arabic.\u201d",
      "Turkey has more refugees than any other country. It opened its borders to people fleeing the war in Syria in 2011; now there are upwards of three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, according to the UN. But Turks are getting restless. President Recep Erdogan has urged refugees - who he calls \u201cguests\u201d - to go home.",
      "Migrants without papers are being arrested and deported. Even those who have papers face being harassed, and now many who made temporary homes in Turkey want to leave - legally if possible - but, where necessary, they use people smugglers.",
      "All of this is being watched by Westminster. With so many people so desperate to move westwards, one of the British Government\u2019s prime tasks, if it is to keep its promise to reduce illegal arrivals, is to start cracking Turkey\u2019s people-smuggling model. And that starts with social media.",
      "For years, smugglers have used Facebook and other platforms to advertise safe passage between countries, often including prices and package deals such as \u201ckids go free\u201d.",
      "Over a traditional Syrian meat-and-rice dish of maqluba, Ali, a former footballer from Damascus, gets out his phone and shows us social media videos that promote smuggling routes. They are slick and professional, with pictures of boats and people looking joyous as they arrive in Greece.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely I\u2019m thinking about leaving,\u201d Ali admits. \u201cNot just me, all my friends.\u201d",

      "Stemming the flow from Turkey",
      "The exodus from Turkey is not surprising, says Marc Pierini, EU ambassador to Turkey between 2006 and 2011. \u201cSyrian refugees in Turkey have over the past few years become the scapegoat\u2026 A whole xenophobic narrative has been [created] by the authorities.\u201d",
      "Turkey\u2019s poor economy is only adding to the problem, argues Murat Erdo\u011fan, a professor of migration studies at Ankara University, who is no relation to the president. Interest rates were raised to 40% last year amid soaring inflation.",
      "For years, successive European governments have attempted to crack down on the smuggling ring here by giving money and logistical support to Turkish police and coastguard. A 2016 deal between the EU and Turkey - in which Turkey was given aid in return for its help reducing the flow of migrants travelling to Greece on boats - was an early attempt to undermine the smuggling business model.",
      "But Rob Jones, director of operations at the NCA, says cracking down on the trade is complex - and even more difficult than policing the movement of illegal drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s harder, it\u2019s different, it\u2019s more organic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt relies on a series of informal trusted relationships\u201d.",
      "Smuggling gangs often use hawala - a payment method that avoids formal banking and instead relies on a network of agents to deliver cash across borders. \u201cThat means we don\u2019t have large amounts of cash moving between borders or even electronically, like we do with the drug trade,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also difficult because it utilises ubiquitous social media apps which allow people to be handed between groups at ease. \u201c",
      "In Britain, ministers of successive governments have recognised this as part of the problem, as well as the need to tackle social media advertising. Since 2021, the NCA has worked with Meta, X, TikTok and YouTube to remove posts promoting smuggling services. By this summer, 12,000 posts had been deleted, the agency said.",
      "The newly appointed Border Security Commander, Martin Hewitt, has told us: \u201cWe will keep chipping away and undermining their business to the point where that is no longer viable and profitable.\u201d",
      "But our experience in Turkey showed us that - to date - it\u2019s still possible to connect with a smuggler at the click of a button.",
      "Crackdown at the border",
      "The NCA has highlighted a particular area that is a \u201ccrucible\u201d for organised immigration crime: the crossing between Turkey and Bulgaria, which marks the EU\u2019s external frontier.",
      "We visited the tiny Bulgarian mountain village of Shtit, a sleepy place with dirt roads and rusting farm machinery - a place that doesn\u2019t seem to hold much geopolitical significance, but that\u2019s right at the border, which is marked by a 4m high fence and razor wire.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sharp and it\u2019s almost impossible to climb with bare hands,\u201d says Hamid, the Iranian refugee who crossed it in 2019. \u201cUsually they\u2019re using ladders, but there\u2019s some places [along the fence] that they\u2019ve already cut.\u201d",
      "Our conversation is interrupted by a passing patrol car. Two uniformed officers warn us not to take photographs of the border; presumably, if shared on social media they can help migrants make the crossing.",
      "Nikolai, a chef in a local restaurant, tells us he has seen a marked increase in security in the area - many of the guards are from Germany and Poland, and are working in Bulgaria as part of the EU\u2019s border force, Frontex.",
      "Certainly, the Bulgarians have made strides in policing their side of the border. In recent years they have installed cameras, drones, and ramped up the number of security staff.",
      "This ring-of-steel-style system has had some success: the number of migrants crossing here has fallen in the last two years, says Atanas Rusev, director of the Security Programme at the Centre for Study of Democracy. But there are gaps.",
      "The porousness of the border is apparent about 32km down the road, at the Kapitan Andreevo crossing, uniting Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey - the busiest such border in Europe. The terrain is mountainous, with parts covered by thick forests making it easy for migrants to go undetected.",
      "\u201cIn order to police you need thousands of people on the ground,\u201d Mr Rusev explains. \u201cYou cannot put a man every five metres - so you have these patrols that are moving across certain sections of the border. Then you have the fence, but the fence is not a big obstacle because you need a simple wooden ladder.\u201d",
      "The smuggling gangs are clever and \u201cknow the terrain very well\u201d, he explains. \u201cIf you think that you can stop these irregular flows just with policing and prosecution and securitising, it\u2019s a road to nowhere.\u201d",

      "And they\u2019re not just trying to stop people. Many of the rubber inflatable boats used to smuggle migrants across the Channel are manufactured in Turkey and transported over this very border.",
      "One difficulty stopping the boats is that it is legal to carry inflatables across Europe; they might be used for a fishing trip.  But following talks with the UK, the Bulgarians have changed their customs regulations to say that only certain Turkish companies are licensed to export boats.",
      "Anyone found with an unlicensed vessel in the back of their car can face a \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,666) euro fine. To help detect those boats is a dog, Adele, trained by the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency to sniff out rubber. Her harness carries both Bulgarian and UK flags.",
      "I point out to Valerie, the border agent showing us around, that smuggling gangs can make thousands of pounds of profit off each passenger. Perhaps the gangs are happy to risk a \u20ac2,000 fine?",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d comes the answer, \u201cbut we stop some.\u201d",
      "So where does this leave Britain?",
      "Back in Britain, the prime minister has suggested that policing, intelligence and more international cooperation is the answer. Our experience in Bulgaria of the attempt to disrupt the trade in boats being exported from Turkey highlights the benefits of this approach and also its limitations. Even with drones, cameras and security staff, thousands of people stream into the country illegally every year. It's certainly not a promising sign.",
      "And yet the government\u2019s heavy focus on policing and security has paid off in some ways. Earlier this month, Amanj Hasan Zada, who organised cross-Channel smuggling from his home in Lancashire and was feted as \u201cthe best smuggler\u201d, was convicted and given a 17-year sentence.",
      "Why so many prime ministers have failed to cut migration",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "Peter Walsh, head of the Migration Observatory, is more optimistic than some about Labour\u2019s beefed-up security approach, pointing out that it\u2019s possible to reduce the flow of people. But he stresses that the success or failure ultimately depends on global trends in people smuggling, over which UK ministers have little control.",
      "He also fears police might end up in a game of whack-a-mole. \u201cThe people most directly involved in smuggling activity can [be] apprehended - but they can quickly be replaced.\u201d",
      "Which poses a new question. As he puts it: can you apprehend people more quickly than they can be replaced?",
      "Alternative routes",
      "There are alternative strategies to police-first - but each is loaded with its own problems. For example, by giving money to countries such as Syria, it\u2019s possible to tackle what are termed the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration so there\u2019s less need for refugees to flee. The prime minister made a gesture to this strategy in the summer, pledging \u00a384m for education and employment opportunities in Africa and Middle East. But even the most optimistic of humanitarians don\u2019t think this is a solution in the short- or even medium-term, or that \u00a384m is enough to fix the problems.",
      "Then there\u2019s the prospect of bilateral deals. The \u201cgold standard\u201d for the UK would be to strike a generous beach-returns deal with France, says Mr Walsh, in which France agrees to take back migrants who arrive via the Channel and intercept boats. \u201cBut what\u2019s in it for France?\u201d Mr Walsh asks.",
      "Finally there\u2019s the option of offering \u201csafe and legal\u201d routes for refugees to enter Britain, the policy preferred by some charities. But other experts suggest this would amount only to a few thousand people per year - and attempt to seriously ramp up numbers may become politically toxic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be more people that want to arrive than can arrive,\u201c added Mr Walsh. And those people will make it through any means necessary.",
      "Of everything we saw in Turkey and Bulgaria, one memory stays with me that proves this very point. It was at the Harmanli refugee camp, the largest in Bulgaria. There, we met a group of 10 Syrian men who had recently made the crossing from Turkey. Their smugglers knew exactly where they could climb over the fence, they told us.",
      "But what about the hi-tech cameras, the drones, and the extra police, I asked? They just shrugged. It didn\u2019t seem like they\u2019d struggled.",
      "It impressed upon me the enormity of Labour\u2019s task. After all, ministers can throw whatever resources they want at the issue of gangs but if migrants are determined enough, and if the money for gangsters is tempting enough, some will always find a way through.",
      "Mr Walsh is also sceptical of whether people smuggling gangs can be cracked at scale, drawing the comparison of drugs gangs. \u201dThere\u2019s a fair amount of investment that goes into controlling the sale of illicit drugs, yet they continue,\u201d he argues. \u201cSo the idea that you can stamp it out entirely is just not feasible.",
      "\u201cYes you can make a difference, but it\u2019s impossible to reduce it to zero.\u201d",
      "No-one who works with migrants, no-one who works on border security, would ever say the sort of words or phrases routinely in political slogans: \u201cstop the boats\u201d or \u201csmash the gangs\u201d. What they talk about instead is a much more modest ambition of making it harder to cross borders without the right paperwork, reducing the number who do so and disrupting the people smugglers. But they all accept that those who really want to make it from one side of the border to the other will probably eventually succeed.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:27:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Why has the inheritance tax for farmers argument got so noisy, so quickly?",
    "story": [
      "The farmers' demonstration was best summed up in two images: real tractors being driven by farmers around Parliament Square, and beside them a collection of toy tractors being pedalled around by their children.",
      "They illustrated the essence of the farmers\u2019 argument: there is a deep-seated cultural expectation that they will pass on their farm to the next generation.",
      "For many, it feels like a deep responsibility that stretches high into their family tree, and so the expectation falls upon them to ensure the very thing their forebears did for them they manage to as well \u2013 hand it down to their sons and daughters.",
      "As a reporter, I love covering protests and marches at Westminster.",
      "They are an essential megaphone in the never-ending conversation of our democracy.",
      "I have been turning up at them with a microphone and camera for 20 years \u2013 to witness and scrutinise those making the most of their much-cherished right to come to London and \u2013 often \u2013 shout at the government.",
      "I love them because people sufficiently passionate about their cause to trek to the capital and then make a public, almost certainly contentious, argument often deserve to be listened to and should be vigorously questioned too.",
      "And, for me, those conversations offer an insight into not just what those protesting think, but why they think it.",
      "This gathering of farmers left me with three thoughts:",
      "Firstly, as we have already explored, there is the huge power of the cultural expectation of handing on a farm to the next generation.",
      "It is not just a business, but an identity, a belonging, a geographical rootedness \u2013 and the prospect of not being able to pass it on generates huge anger and emotion.",
      "That is a big part of the explanation for why this argument has got so noisy, so quickly.",
      "Secondly, contested notions of fairness are so often central to the most contentious political arguments, and this one is no different.",
      "The government argues existing inheritance tax isn\u2019t fair or sustainable \u2013 as everyone else sufficiently well off to pay it is charged 40% and farmers are charged nothing.",
      "Ministers also argue the exemptions have tempted rich folk to buy up farm land \u2013 pushing up its value \u2013 primarily to avoid inheritance tax.",
      "And, as they are at pains to point out over and over again, they insist the vast majority of family farms will be unaffected and those that are will be charged 20%, half the rate charged to anyone else caught within its grasp.",
      "Plus, they say, schools and hospitals desperately need more money.",
      "Others say the farmers are a noisy, well-organised lobby group seeking to shield their often considerable wealth and perpetuate a privilege to the exclusion of others.",
      "And all this brings us to the third big question here: what does it mean to be rich?",
      "Talking to farmers, very quickly our conversation would often involve very big numbers - talk of assets running into a few million pounds.",
      "These are huge figures that point to considerable wealth and yet the farmers insist, for two reasons, they are not rich.",
      "Their annual income is often modest, they point out - and they don\u2019t value their farm in numerical terms, but in emotional ones. The prospect of selling it horrifies them; handing it on is what they seek to do.",
      "The farmers insist they are determined to press on with their campaign.",
      "Ministers insist they are determined to press on with their plans for change.",
      "You may choose to sympathise with the farmers\u2019 arguments or not \u2013 or the government\u2019s arguments, or not \u2013 but the protests offer an insight into what contributes to the view of many of the farmers, and why them backing down doesn\u2019t seem likely any time soon.",

    "story": [
      "For years, the UK\u2019s relationship with China has been poor, dominated by rows about democracy in Hong Kong, human rights in Xinjiang and cyber threats against UK bodies.",

      "The current Tory critics accuse the PM of reneging on promises made in opposition to get tougher on China over its human rights abuses.",

      "During the meeting with President Xi, he offered a full UK-China meeting either in London or Beijing. The Chancellor Rachel Reeves will travel to China in the spring.",
      "For his part, Mr Xi said there was \u201cbroad space\u201d for both countries to co-operate on trade and investment, clean energy and health care.",
      "The problem is all this could become otiose if Donald Trump imposes huge tariffs on Chinese imports and triggers a global trade war.",

      "The President-elect has \u2013 through his government appointments \u2013 made clear that his priority is facing down what he sees as the challenge from China.",
      "That is why he wants Europe to spend more on its defence \u2013 so he can deploy US forces to the Pacific.",
      "And that is why Europeans are braced for fresh pressure from the US to adopt a tougher approach to China.",
      "Many in the US think the UK and the EU are trying to curry favour in Beijing by being less hostile than Washington.",
      "So the prime minister is trying to engage more closely with China, and at the very least be more consistent than his predecessors.",

    "summary": "Multiple sources say the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost of fixing social care, and that the PM is yet to decide how to proceed.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first five months have produced little sign of a plan for Labour\u2019s promised National Care Service \u2013 and now I\u2019m told there is a \u201cgenuine impasse\u201d at the top of government over what to do about social care.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting publicly acknowledges \u201cwe can\u2019t solve the NHS crisis\u201d without improving what a government source describes as an \u201cappalling\u201d situation, in a system that\u2019s meant to look after vulnerable and elderly adults in England.",
      "But multiple sources tell me the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost and that the prime minister is yet to make a decision on how to proceed.",
      "Talks have so far failed to decide even whether to hold another review of the system. \u201cDither, dither, dither,\u201d said one insider involved in the discussions.",
      "But another source said: \u201cEveryone wants to fix it but we don\u2019t want to embark on something that then doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
      "I understand the prime minister, health secretary and the Chancellor Rachel Reeves are due to meet a week on Monday to try to make some progress.",
      "What options do they have?",
      "There is little controversy about the scale of the problem in social care, the system that helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing, getting out of bed, eating and medication.",
      "There are as many as 500,000 people waiting for care. Council budgets are stretched, some teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, in part because of care costs. As the population ages, thousands upon thousands of people are stuck without the care they need, and thousands more stuck in hospital because there isn\u2019t the support they need at home.",
      "Labour has given little detail on what its National Care Service would look like, but long-term reform would likely aim to address the shortage of care, the length of waiting lists, and the costs for people who don't qualify for free care, which can be crippling for families.",
      "Why Starmer\u2019s NHS reforms may give you a sense of deja-vu",
      "No extra NHS funding without reform, says PM",
      "Ministers are considering whether to create a Royal Commission to look at the issue or a government-backed independent review, tipped to be led by the straight-talking Whitehall troubleshooter Dame Louise Casey.",
      "The advantage of a Royal Commission? It\u2019s not party political, so theoretically can bind every politician to back its solutions and make the warring parties work together.",
      "The downside? It could take two or three years, pushing possible fixes to the urgent problems until after the next election.",
      "An independent review of a year to 18 months could change things quicker. Without the kudos of the King, any plans would be easier for opposition politicians to reject \u2013 but Labour has a once-in-a-generation majority to vote through big reforms.",
      "There are nerves, however, at the top of government about what any review might recommend. If it suggests an expensive new system quickly, then that would need billions in extra tax. Does the government have a mandate for that in this parliamentary term, having ruled out changes to the main tax rates?",
      "If a review process took longer, would any political party want to go into the next election asking voters to pay more - even for the best of reasons, a shiny new social care system?",
      "\u2018Same old stalemate\u2019",
      "In truth, conversations about the process are only a symbol of the actual dilemma \u2013 not just what to do, but how to pay.",
      "The Department of Health wants to get on with the process. The Treasury agrees that it\u2019s a very serious problem that the government ought to fix (and people caught up in the system, often stuck in hospital, are costly to the whole NHS too). Yet the chancellor is understood to be nervous about the cost of any fix, which would run to many billions.",
      "One source told me: \u201cThe Treasury is the block.\u201d But a department insider rejects that characterisation, and says: \u201cNo one doubts the issue is huge, but any solution is expensive \u2013 everything is a trade-off.\u201d",
      "Others suggest Reeves wants reform but also wants to be sure of a full political backing from the neighbours at No 10. So it\u2019s suggested both Streeting and Reeves are looking to Sir Keir.",
      "A No 10 source told me the prime minister is \u201canimated by solving the issue and is keen to proceed\u201d, hence the meeting planned with the health secretary and chancellor in the next fortnight. The source denies the accusation of \u201cdither\u201d, saying it takes time to work out the right moves.",
      "There is no suggestion this is a bruising split between ministers.",
      "But another source familiar with the process told me: \"As soon as the election was out of the way we went back into the same old stalemate.\" In other words, the Department of Health says please, the Treasury says no, and No 10 wants more time to think.",
      "\u2018It\u2019s almost too late\u2019",
      "Inside the care sector itself, one leader says people are \u201cworn\u201d by the debate between different parts of government when the need for change is urgent. Another care source tells me \u201cit\u2019s already almost too late\u201d and is upset at how the industry has been treated so far.",
      "They say existing government plans and the decisions in the Budget have made life harder. Asking care providers to pay the extra costs of employers\u2019 national insurance means that, effectively, \u201cpublic services are charged to pay for a black hole in (you guessed it) public services\u201d, they say.",
      "The NHS itself will be exempt from those increased costs but, as things stand, not-for-profit organisations including some care charities providing public services will have to pay.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "A group of them have written to the chancellor as part of a grassroots campaign called Providers Unite, warning the increased payments could top \u00a31bn. They have asked Reeves to look again at the changes or face \u201ca systematic collapse of community care services across Britain\u201d.",
      "The chancellor told us after the Budget she is \u201cnot immune\u201d to pleas from particular sectors, but there is no chance of her reversing the whole policy.",
      "On top of charging more National Insurance, ministers are creating a negotiating body to improve pay and conditions for care staff. While the industry is broadly supportive of that aim, it will increase costs, and many believe they just can\u2019t cover it without extra funding.",
      "There is an obvious eagerness for the government to get on with the conversation about how to fix the system that cares for the most vulnerable adults in the long term. But, wearily, a source told me conversation in the industry is \u201cso dominated by funding emergencies now, [long-term reform] is second order\u201d.",
      "Pressure builds for a decision",
      "When the prime minister, Streeting and Reeves sit down to consider what to do about social care in a week or so, don\u2019t expect a sudden revelation or a shiny new plan. One source told me \u2013 in a line worthy of the sitcom Yes Minister \u2013 that the trio might \u201cdecide to decide, decide to delay deciding, or\u2026 decide not to decide\u201d.",
      "But the pressure is building on them to make a call.",
      "While the Conservatives promised then failed multiple times to follow through with big changes to the system, the newly emboldened Lib Dems put social care right at the centre of their successful election campaign.",
      "It\u2019s the party\u2019s signature issue, and rarely a day goes by without them pursuing a political opportunity to press the case. The Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who will join me on tomorrow's show, said that any investment in the NHS would be an \"expensive failure\" without social care reform.",
      "\"Ministers need to get a grip, and quickly,\" he said. \"The cross-party talks we've been campaigning for should start now, but there are urgent actions the government should take regardless,\" such as a higher minimum wage for care workers.",
      "And a spokesperson for the Conservatives said: \"The Labour Party are piling on costs for social care providers and charities. The Local Government Association has warned that any extra funding will be consumed by the costs as a result of Labour\u2019s budget.\"",
      "Few in government would deny that a solution for social care is long overdue. Few in government would deny that patients are being let down, and families are being left without the support they need. And few in government would deny that Sir Keir\u2019s mission to sort out the NHS is hampered by a lack of action.",
      "A source familiar with the dilemmas told me it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that minsters can talk about giving the NHS extra billions and promising reform without doing the same for social care.",
      "Yet nobody wants to repeat previous governments\u2019 pattern, where plans were drawn up, pitched to the public, then ditched (the Scottish Government has again shelved plans for its promised National Care Service).",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 12:07:36 GMT",
    "summary": "What it means for the global climate effort if another superpower comes to the fore, just as Trump steps back",
    "story": [
      "The WhatsApp message was from the chief negotiator of one of the most powerful countries at the COP climate gathering. Could I stop by for a chat, he asked.",
      "As his team hunched over computers eating takeaway pizza, he raged about the obstructionist behaviour of many of the other teams at the conference.",
      "So far, so normal. Others had been saying versions of this all week \u2013 that this was the worst COP ever; that negotiating texts, which are meant to get smaller as deadlines approached, were in fact ballooning; that COP in its current form might be dead in the water\u2026",
      "Looming over it all was the prospect of US president-elect Donald Trump withdrawing the US from the COP process when he takes office for a second time. He has called climate action a \u201cscam\u201d and, at his victory celebration in West Palm Beach earlier this month, vowed to boost US oil production beyond its current record levels, saying, \u201cWe have more liquid gold than any country in the world\u201d.",
      "But there was one positive: China.",
      "\u201cIt's the only bright spot in all of this is,\u201d the chief negotiator told me. Not only was its negotiating style markedly different to previous years, but he also observed that, as he puts it, \u201cChina could be stepping forward.\u201d",
      "So what would it mean for the global effort to tackle climate change if it does step to the fore, just as the US steps back?",
      "Negotiating styles - a change of tack",
      "In the past, China has played a dual role in these talks. Sometimes it has aligned with the US and Europe, for example on ambitious targets to boost renewable power or on the reduction of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. On other issues, meanwhile, it has slowed progress.",
      "One such example was COP15, which was held in Copenhagen in 2009. There had been high hopes that an agreement would be reached to commit countries to deep cuts in carbon emissions. But the conference nearly collapsed when China fought against US pressure to submit to a regime of international monitoring. The final non-binding deal was generally considered a failure.",
      "This year was different. The chief negotiator I spoke to said that China was being \u201cunusually cooperative\u201d across all the discussions.",
      "The most obvious sign of this came at the start of the conference, when China made public details of its climate funding.",
      "Traditionally, China has released minimal information about its climate policies and plans, so it came as a surprise when this year, for the first time, officials said they have paid developing countries more than $24 billion for climate action since 2016.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s serious money, almost nobody else is at that level,\u201d one COP insider told me.",
      "This got the conference buzzing. It is a \u201cnotable signal\u201d, says Li Shuo, a director of China Climate Hub, \u201cas it\u2019s the first time that the Chinese government has laid out a clear figure in terms of how much they have been providing.\u201d",
      "Developing country vs superpower",
      "China is classed as a developing country in the context of UN climate talks, despite being the world\u2019s second biggest economy, the result of a peculiarity in the COP rules. (This is linked to its economic status in 1992 when the talks process began.)",
      "It has long resisted pressure from developed countries to change its status, meaning it doesn\u2019t have to contribute to the pot that rich countries have agreed to pay to poorer ones.",
      "That pot has been one of the focuses in the talks at Baku. It totals $100 billion a year currently, but developing countries \u2013 those with low and middle incomes \u2013 need at least a trillion dollars a year to help them switch to clean energy and deal with the effects of climate change, according to the World Economic Forum.",
      "What form that funding takes is another question, as little data is available. What is known is that Chinese money is helping to fund projects like solar farms and energy efficient lighting in certain developing countries such as Rwanda, where Chinese manufactured electric buses have been used in the capital Kigali.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is the language the Chinese used,\u201d says Professor Michael Jacobs, an expert on climate politics at Sheffield University. \u201cThey described it as \u2018provided and mobilised\u2019 - that\u2019s the term developed countries use for their payments.\u201d",
      "Language matters at climate conferences. Negotiators can spend days discussing whether something \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d happen. So, the Chinese echoing the language of the rich world is significant, Prof Jacobs argues.",
      "\u201cThey used to calibrate everything against what the US did,\u201d he says. When Trump took office in 2016, China stood back from the talks in response. This time is different, according to Prof Jacobs.",
      "\u201cThis looks to me like a claim of leadership.\"",
      "What\u2019s in it for the East?",
      "\"This isn\u2019t [driven by] altruism on China\u2019s part,\u201d Prof Jacobs continues.",
      "According to Li Shuo, the shifting economics of renewables explains why China is likely to step forward.",
      "The green transformation is very much being led by China - not necessarily the government, but its private sector and companies\u201d. These companies lead the rest of the world by what Shuo says is a \u201cvery significant margin\u201d.",
      "Eight out of every ten solar panels are made in China, and it controls some two-thirds of wind turbine production. It is reckoned to produce at least three-quarters of the world\u2019s lithium batteries and more than 60% of the global market for electric vehicles.",
      "Earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that solar panels, EVs and batteries are the \u201cnew trio\u201d at the heart of the Chinese economy.",
      "It is the huge investments China has made in renewable technologies and the massive economies of scale that it has created that have also driven down renewable costs year after year - the challenge it faces now is finding new markets to sell it into.",
      "The developing world is where the demand is set to boom. These countries will account for two-thirds of the renewable market within 10 years, according to a recent report by a group of economists tasked by the UN with calculating the costs of the energy transition.",
      "Pakistan imported 13 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels in the first six months of this year alone, according to research by Bloomberg NEF. To put that in context, the UK has 17GW of installed solar.",
      "Shipping clean tech to emerging economies dovetails with another of China\u2019s policies: its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d an effort to develop new trade routes, including roads, railways, ports and airports, to connect with the rest of the world.",
      "China has spent more than a trillion dollars on the project, according to the World Economic Forum. Last week, President Xi opened a new port on the coast of Peru.",
      "Which begins to explain why, as Prof Jacobs sees it, while the US may withdraw, China looks like it might be stepping up. \u201cIt now sees its best interest as encouraging other countries to also cut their emissions by using Chinese technologies and equipment.\u201d",
      "A tectonic shift in climate talks",
      "If China does take a more central role, it would mark a tectonic shift in the COP process. Historically, Western countries \u2013 particularly the US and EU \u2013 have provided the momentum, cheered on by smaller climate-vulnerable nations. The difference in the way the talks play out will be marked.",
      "Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, has been to every COP and understands better than most the behind-the-scenes bartering, bullying and brinkmanship that makes or breaks deals at summits. He says that China won\u2019t lead from the front, like the US and Europe.",
      "\u201cThey're more cautious players than that. It may be that they're leading with Chinese characteristics, which is what they might say themselves.\u201d",
      "(This echoes how Deng Xiaoping, president in the early 1980s, described his economic reforms, which catapulted the country\u2019s economic growth into double figures: \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d.)",
      "Pershing suggests that China is likely to help drive the COP process forward by discreetly intervening to unblock disputes. Most of this effort will take place behind closed doors, he believes, but is likely to include urging developing and developed countries to increase their ambition \u2013 and the flow of cash.",
      "However China may not be entirely helpful on some of the challenges that slow the process, such as instances when countries use COP as a stage to champion their own interests.",
      "One of the biggest blockers in Baku was said to be Saudi Arabia, which heads up a group of fossil fuel producing countries that want to slow the transition to renewables. As a big consumer of fossil fuels, China has often thrown its weight behind them in the past, such as by resisting the UK\u2019s effort to get agreement to phase out coal at COP26 in Glasgow.",
      "Ultimately, though, there is cause for hope, according to some well-placed observers. Camilla Born, who has been part of the UK\u2019s negotiating team and helped run COP26 in Glasgow, believes that the future talks will be determined by the new economics of energy, not the politics of meetings.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about an idea of how to deal with climate change anymore,\u201d she argues. \u201cThis is about investments, about money - it\u2019s people\u2019s jobs, it\u2019s new technologies. The conversations are different.\u201d",
      "It is, after all, the biggest revolution in energy since the start of the industrial revolution. And regardless of which superpower takes the lead, or if the US is out of the game for four years, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone will want to miss out on such a vast market.",
      "Starmer will struggle to keep his \u2018smash the gangs\u2019 promise - as I saw firsthand",

      "Some developing nations and oil-rich countries are reluctant to push strong action on cutting fossil fuels because it could jeopardise their economic growth.",
      "In an open meeting of all nations, the EU Commissioner for Climate Action Wopke Hoekstra called the draft deal \"unbalanced, unworkable and unsubtle\".",
      "US Climate Envoy John Podesta said: \"We are surprised that there is nothing that carries forward...what we agreed last year in Dubai.\"",

      "Diplomats are upset with the COP29 hosts Azerbaijan. They say the draft deal reflects the views of the Arab group of countries and what\u2019s termed the Like-Minded group, which includes Saudi Arabia, China, India and Bolivia.",
      "The Saudis have suggested that the fossil fuels agreement reached was just one option for countries, rather than an specific instruction.",
      "Minister Ryan said the new proposed deal text reflected this view.",
      "\u201cWe all know that there has been backsliding. There has been an attempt to interpret what we agreed last year as a menu, and actually taking back the language and taking back the commitment, and that has to stop in the interest of the Arab group too.\u201d",

    "title": "Is nuclear power gaining new energy?",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

    "summary": "Toxic, deadly, poisonous - these words are back in the headlines as Delhi\u2019s pollution spikes again.",
    "story": [
      "Winter has come to Delhi and with it, a familiar sense of gloom. The sky here is grey and there is a thick, visible blanket of smog.",
      "If you stay outdoors for more than a few minutes, you can almost taste ash. You will feel breathless within minutes if you try to run or even walk at a brisk pace in the smog.",
      "Newspapers are back to using words like \"toxic\", \"deadly\" and \"poisonous\" in their main headlines.",
      "Most schools have been shut and people have been advised to stay indoors - though those whose livelihoods depend on working outdoors can\u2019t afford to do so.",
      "Delhi\u2019s air quality score was somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 on Monday and Tuesday, according to different monitoring agencies. The acceptable limit is under than 100.",
      "These scores measure the levels of particulate matter - called PM 2.5 and PM10 - in the air. These tiny particles can enter the lungs and cause a host of diseases.",
      "On social media, people have been expressing shock, disappointment and anguish that it\u2019s all happening again.",
      "Along with the gloom, there is a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - like we have seen this all many times before in the past 15 years.",
      "I recorded this video of my drive to the office in 2017, when smog had reduced visibility to less than 2m.",
      "On Tuesday, my drive to the office seemed even worse.",
      "And we have covered every twist and turn of this story in the past two decades.",
      "We have reported how pollution is making people sick and reducing their life expectancy reducing their life expectancy.",
      "We have reported on India's Supreme Court ordering the government to take urgent steps to curb pollution every year. The court has done the same this year.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects children the most.",
      "We have written about how politicians blame each other for the problem every year.",
      "We have discussed the root cause of the problem.",
      "We have also talked about solutions - both the ones that marginally worked and the ones that failed miserably.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects the poorest the most and how many don\u2019t have a choice but to go out and work in the smog.",
      "Covering this story feels like watching (and being in) the same dystopian film every year - following the same characters, plot and script. The outcome is always the same - nothing changes.",
      "The parks are empty again - people, particularly children and the elderly, have been told to stay indoors.",
      "Those who must work - daily-wage labourers, rickshaw pullers, delivery riders - are coughing but still going out.",
      "Hospitals are seeing an increasing number of people coming in with respiratory problems.",
      "And amid all this, we are back to the same question again - why does nothing change?",
      "The simple answer is that solving Delhi's air problem requires monumental efforts and co-ordination.",
      "The sources of the problem are many. One of them is the practice of farmers burning crop remains to clear their fields quickly to sow seeds for the next yield.",
      "This mostly happens in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The smoke from the farm fires engulfs Delhi every winter and hangs low in the atmosphere as wind speeds reduce during winter months.",
      "But farmers can\u2019t be entirely blamed for this because this is the cheapest way of clearing fields.",
      "Different governments have talked about providing machines and financial incentives to stop crop burning, but very little has happened on the ground.",
      "Delhi itself produces a huge chunk of the pollution - emission from vehicles, construction and factories.",
      "Every year, in the winter months, people get angry, journalists write and produce reports, politicians blame each other and courts fume - until we do it all over again the next year.",
      "A public health emergency like this would spark mass protests in most democracies. But the anger in Delhi is mostly limited to social media.",
      "Activists say the reason is that pollution doesn\u2019t cause immediate problems for most people. Ingesting high levels of PM2.5 causes health to deteriorate slowly. A Lancet study found that pollution led to more than 2.3 million premature deaths in India in 2019.",
      "And then there is the class divide. People who can afford to temporarily leave the city do that, those who can buy air purifiers do that, and those who can vent on social media do that.",
      "The rest, who don't have these options, just go about their lives.",
      "The collective angst has so far not resulted in a massive protest and, as the Supreme Court once observed, politicians just \u201cpass the buck\u201d and wait for the season to get over.",
      "Experts say governments at the federal level and in different states need to leave their party politics behind and work together to solve this problem. They need to focus on long-term solutions.",
      "And citizens need to hold politicians accountable and courts have to pass decisive orders months before the pollution worsens.",
      "This year, we are again in the thick of the season and temporary measures have been announced, like banning construction work.",
      "But can these bring Delhi's elusive blue skies back? The evidence from the past few years doesn\u2019t give much hope.",

      "\u2018The sixth great extinction is happening now\u2019",
      "One of the remedies she wants to talk about today is a tree-planting and habitat restoration mission that her eponymous foundation and non-profit technology company, Ecosia, are carrying out in Uganda.

      "This week, world leaders have gathered in Baku, Azerbaijan, for COP29 - the latest round of UN climate talks.",

      "\u201cWe still have a window of time to start slowing down climate change and loss of biodiversity,\u201d Dr Goodall says. \u201cBut it's a window that's closing.\u201d",
      "Destruction of forests, and other wild places, she points out, is intrinsically linked to the climate crisis.",
      "\u201cSo much has changed in my lifetime,\u201d she says, recalling that in the forests of Tanzania where she began studying chimps more than 60 years ago, \u201cyou used to be able to set your calendar by the timing of the two rainy seasons\u201d.",
      "\u201cNow, sometimes it rains in the dry season, and sometimes it's dry in the wet season. It means the trees are fruiting at the wrong time, which upsets the chimpanzees, and also the insects and the birds.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf we don't get together and impose tough regulations on what people are able to do to the environment - if we don't rapidly move away from fossil fuel, if we don't put a stop to industrial farming, that's destroying the environment and killing the soil, having a devastating effect on biodiversity - the future ultimately is doomed.\u201d",
      "\u2018He looked into my eyes and squeezed my fingers\u2019",
      "Hearing her speak in this way gives me a glimpse of a toughness that belies her well-spoken, gentle demeanour. When Jane Goodall began observing and studying chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania, she was a trailblazer. Her research, now considered groundbreaking, was controversial.",
      "She was the first person to witness and document chimpanzees making and using tools \u2013 the primates prepared sticks to fish for termites. Prior to her observations, that was a trait that was thought to be uniquely human.",

      "Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, though, saw the value in her technique: \u201cHe wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,\u201d Dr Goodall explains.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a dog, a cat, a rabbit, a horse and not give them a name. It's the same as when I studied squirrels in my garden as a little girl - they all had names.\u201d",
      "Her methods \u2013 and her sense of closeness to the primates she has dedicated her life to \u2013 have given her a unique perspective.",
      "She tells me about a \u201cwonderful moment\u201d with a chimpanzee she named David Greybeard, the male chimp who she first witnessed making and using tools to catch termites. \u201cHe was the first to lose his fear of me,\u201d she recalls.",
      "\u201cI sat down near him and, lying on the ground, was the ripe red fruit of an oil palm. I held it out towards him and he turned his head away. Then I put my hand closer and he turned and looked into my eyes, reached out and very gently squeezed my fingers.",
      "\u201cThat is how chimpanzees reassure each other. We understood each other perfectly - with a gestural language that obviously predates human speech.\u201d",
      "\u2018We need to get tougher\u2019",
      "Dr Goodall\u2019s career has often been challenging. She has written about the early years of her work for Professor Leakey, who was a renowned scientist, and who had enormous influence over her career. He repeatedly declared his love for her, putting pressure on her in a way that, today, might be viewed as sexual harassment.",
      "But she spurned his advances and kept her focus on her work and her beloved chimpanzees. Now, having turned 90 this year, she does not appear to be slowing down.",
      "So what keeps Dr Goodall going? On this she is emphatic \u2013 charmingly affronted by the question: \"Surely people want a future for their children. If they do, we have to get tougher about [environmental] legislation.",

      "The findings were published in the Nature and Science journals on Friday.",
      "While scientists already knew of volcanic activity on the near side of the moon, which we can see from Earth, the \"dark side\" is very different in its geology, and remains largely unexplored.",

      "The Sidemen - the seven-strong group that includes content creator, rapper and boxer KSI - have more than 146 million YouTube subscribers between them.",
      "Vik Barn - aka Vikkstar123 - told the BBC the move was \"ambitious\" but it was \"exciting to conquer a new challenge\".",
      "He said: \"Netflix is the gold standard and part of us working with them is to say that over the past decade we've managed to go from filming content in our bedrooms to working with the biggest streaming platform in the world.\"",
      "The Sidemen started creating YouTube content in the early 2010s.",
      "They started by playing and reacting to video games, but in the past decade the group of friends have branched out to comedy sketches, travel challenges, podcasts and a dating show.",
      "They now employ a production team of more than 100 people who help create the videos and generate ideas, Vik said.",

      "Aside from Vik and KSI, the other Sidemen are Miniminter, Zerkaa, TBJZL, Behzinga and W2S.",
      "Vik said the group, who are aged between 27 and 32, had some reservations about bringing their work to a new platform because \"we've never done it before and we're all very particular about the way we work\".",
      "\"We also move at a really fast pace - sometimes we shoot on Wednesday and by Sunday we will have uploaded a two-hour video. So we wanted to make sure Netflix were happy with the fast turnarounds and us being very dynamic.\"",

      "MrBeast, the world's most popular YouTuber, will launch Beast Games on Amazon Prime Video on 19 December, although that show has been at the centre of controversy.",
      "As one of the UK's biggest YouTube content creators, 29-year-old Vik is very aware of how many young men look up to him. But he said it's not his job to be a role model.",
      "\"In our videos we're just ourselves, we're not aiming to be certain characters, and first and foremost we're content creators who make fun videos.\"",
      "He added that the Sidemen had a \"unified stance on not speaking about political and social issues\".",
      "\"Sometimes we feel pressure to, but we would rather leave this to the experts.\"",
      "Part of the reason for this decision is the intense media scrutiny they face.",
      "KSI recently faced backlash after he shared a video of Donald Trump drinking a bottle of Prime, an energy drink he co-founded.",

      "\"Everything we do will always upset a small group of people but you just have to move forward,\" he said.",
      "'People thought I was weird'",
      "The Sheffield-based creator also said the group had got better at \"ignoring the trolling and hate\".",
      "\"The internet has become a very turbulent place recently and occasionally things do get to us.",
      "\"We try and just think about how proud we are of everything we've built and that helps us cancel out the negativity.\"",

      "The Sidemen have been working together for more than a decade, and in recent months there have been rumours that the group may disband soon.",

      "Netflix says 60 million households worldwide tuned in live to see Mike Tyson take on Jake Paul, in the streaming giant's first foray into live boxing.",
      "The event, which was free for subscribers, is being hailed by the tech giant as a \"record breaking night\".",
      "However, fans hoping to watch have expressed their anger and disappointment after some reported Netflix crashed repeatedly throughout the fight.",
      "But there was also criticism from those who were able to tune in, with many saying they found the boxing match lacklustre.",
      "In the bout, which took place at the AT&T Stadium in Texas, former world heavyweight champion Tyson, 58, was beaten by YouTuber-turned-fighter Paul, 27.",
      "The fight attracted a huge amount of media coverage. Tyson is one of the most famous boxers on the planet, while Paul drew in a younger audience.",
      "There was a star-studded ringside audience including Charlize Theron, Ralph Macchio, Joe Jonas and Hasan Minhaj.",
      "Paul says 120 million viewers watched it live globally on Netflix, while the tech firm later stated \"60 million households\" around the world tuned in. It said it will reveal further viewing figures early next week.",
      "But some viewers reported experiencing buffering issues on the site, and some said they simply couldn't get onto it.",
      "The fight was \"unwatchable,\" wrote one X user. Another said she was \"furious\", while a third complained he \"did an all-nighter for nothing\".",
      "Netflix declined to comment on the technical glitches.",
      "Brendan Ashford, who lives in Devon, told BBC News he stayed up late to watch the fight, which took place in the early hours of Saturday morning UK time.",
      "\"I was interested to see how Mike Tyson, at 58, would perform against a much younger guy,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not in the habit of staying up late, but I thought it was worth it.\"",
      "He tried signing in on Netflix at around 04:00 GMT, and says initially it loaded 25%, and then it got to 75%, but after that it got stuck.",
      "\"I knew I had a good connection, so then I looked on social media and saw others were also experiencing issues,\" he said.",
      "\"It was really disappointing. I kept trying for a good hour before I gave up.\"",
      "Mr Ashford said it made him wonder how Netflix would fare with future live sports events, given the problems people encountered this time.",
      "\"It can't be good for their reputation,\" he said.",
      "On social media, there was a similar reaction from fans, who vented their frustrations.",
      "Many also posted pictures and videos of the fight failing to load, while some said the service failed at the key moments during the event.",
      "\"Had all my friends over to watch the Tyson vs. Paul fight. Not loading,\" wrote one X user.",
      "\"Shame on Netflix for not being able to handle the streaming of the Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul fight,\" wrote another.",
      "\"The lagging is so bad the fights are unwatchable to long time subscribers like me and other people I know at home with friends, family, snacks, and drinks but no fights.\"",
      "Another person simply asked, \"did Netflix not have enough time to prepare for the Tyson / Paul fight?\"",
      "'It needs to get this fixed'",
      "This isn't the first time Netflix has had issues with live streaming.",
      "Last year, it apologised after a much-publicised livestream of its hit dating show, the Love is Blind reunion, was delayed due to a glitch.",
      "The technical reason for the delay was unclear but the streaming giant said it was \"incredibly sorry\".",
      "No reason has been given for these latest issues, but Chris Stokel-Walker, a tech reporter, said that the huge demand to watch the fight was \"Netflix's undoing\".",
      "\"Netflix has done live broadcasting before,\" he said.",
      "\"What's different, was that this fight was so hyped.",
      "\"There were so many viewers that were wanting to watch this, given the personalities involved - Jake Paul with his huge following, Mike Tyson returning to the ring for the first time in decades.",
      "\"Even people who aren't major boxing fans wanted to tune in because of all the coverage.",
      "\"As a result, there was additional demand well above and beyond your average live event, like a comedy special, or the live golf tournament they previously broadcast.\"",
      "Mr Stokel-Walker said that with Netflix intending to move towards more live sports in future, including a new deal with WWE from next year, it \"needs to get this fixed\".",
      "\"They have to expect that if they're going to get into this world, they're going to have to get used to this volume of people coming,\" he said.",
      "\"The Tyson vs Paul fight was one of the most high profile examples of an event they\u2019ve done live, so it's really not ideal.",
      "\"People will be watching this and wondering can they cope.\"",

    "story": [
      "A robotic dog named \u201cSpot\u201d made by Boston Dynamics is the latest tool in the arsenal of the US Secret Service.",
      "The device has lately been spotted patrolling the perimeter of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "They do not have weapons - and each can be controlled remotely or automatically - as long as its route is pre-programmed.",
      "Passers-by are warned by a sign on each of Spot\u2019s legs: \u201cDO NOT PET.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't know that anyone is tempted to pet these robot dogs. They do not look cuddly,\u201d said Melissa Michelson, a political scientist at Menlo College.",
      "Video of Spot strutting around the property has gone viral on TikTok - where reactions range from calling them cool and cute, to creepy - and become fodder for jokes on American late night television. But its mission is no laughing matter.",
      "\u201cSafeguarding the president-elect is a top priority,\u201d said Anthony Guglielmi, US Secret Service chief of communications, in a statement to the BBC.",
      "In the months leading up to the US presidential election, Trump was the target of two apparent assassination attempts. The first took place at a July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania and the other occurred at the Mar-a-Lago golf course in September.",
      "Citing \u201cconcern for operational security,\u201d the Secret Service declined to answer the BBC\u2019s specific questions about the use of robotic dogs in Trump\u2019s security detail, including when the agency began deploying the device at his primary residence.",
      "Boston Dynamics also declined to answer specific questions, although it confirmed the Secret Service was deploying its Spot robot.",
      "So why might the Secret Service be using them now?",
      "Ron Williams, a former Secret Service agent who is now CEO of the security and risk management firm Talon Companies, suspects the assassination attempts against Trump added urgency to the agency\u2019s push \u201cto upgrade the technology that can enhance the ability to detect and deter,\u201d Williams said.",
      "At Mar-a-Lago, where so much of the property is exposed, Williams said robotic dogs are long overdue. \u201cThey can cover a lot more area\u201d than humans alone, Williams said of the dogs, which he expects will become more of a common sight over time.",
      "And it\u2019s not just the Secret Service. Williams said robotic dogs have increasingly become a tool used by militaries and law enforcement agencies around the world.",
      "New York City police scrap 'creepy' robotic dogs",
      "A bomb squad in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania that purchased Spot in the spring deploys the device to inspect potential explosives, according to Boston Dynamics promotional materials.",
      "Last year, the New York Police Department moved forward with adding the robotic canines to its force despite complaints of \u201ca dystopian overreach of police power,\u201d according to Wired.",
      "On the other side of the globe, Ukraine has used them to conduct reconnaissance in the ongoing conflict sparked by Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022, the Kyiv Post reports.",
      "See Spot run",
      "Spot is known for its agility. It can walk up and down stairs and navigate tight spaces. It can even open doors.",
      "But its ability to reveal potential threats ranks high among the reasons that so many agencies appear willing to pay up to $75,000 (\u00a359,000) for the device.",
      "Secret Service communications chief Guglielmi said the robotic dogs were \u201cequipped with surveillance technology, and an array of advanced sensors that support our protective operations\u201d.",
      "The device comes outfitted with multiple cameras that generate a 3D map of its surroundings, according to Boston Dynamics marketing materials, and can also have extras such as thermal sensing.",
      "But none of this happens without a human master.",
      "\u201cThey basically have a joystick controlling the robot dog as it walks around,\u201d said Missy Cummings, an engineering professor at George Mason University who runs the university\u2019s Autonomy and Robotics Center. Spot can also move automatically along predefined routes.",
      "Unlike their human and real canine counterparts, robotic dogs aren\u2019t distracted by visuals, sounds or smells they encounter.",
      "But despite their many impressive features, the devices can be taken down.",
      "\u201cYou just have to spray it with Aqua Net hairspray in its \u2018face\u2019,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cAnd that would be enough to stop the cameras from working correctly.\u201d",
      "While the robotic dog seen at Mar-a-Lago is not armed, she says competitors appear to be experimenting with models that are.",
      "\u201cPeople are trying to weaponise these dogs,\u201d Cummings adds, citing a Chinese model with an attached rifle which she learned about at a robotics meeting this week.",
      "They aren\u2019t about to replace humans, says Melissa Michelson, who likens the devices to assisted-driving technology in some vehicles.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of faith in the ability of cars to drive by themselves,\u201d Michelson said.",
      "Secret Service agents at Mar-a-Lago have been seen patrolling alongside Spot.",
      "\u201cWe still do need those humans behind the scenes to use human judgment and be able to jump in if there\u2019s a technology breakdown,\u201d she says."

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:05:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Hi-tech coatings make all sorts of high performance engineering, like jet engines, possible.",
    "story": [
      "Jet engines are one of the most jaw-dropping feats of engineering humans have ever come up with.",
      "But jet engines shouldn\u2019t be possible, says Ben Beake, director of materials research at Micro Materials, an equipment testing company in Wales.",
      "\u201cThe air coming in is hotter than the melting point of the metal underneath \u2013 which is obviously not a good thing,\u201d he explains, pointing out that this air reaches temperatures well above 1,000C.",
      "Designers of jet engines have got around this problem by applying heat-resistant ceramic coatings to the engine blades. And now, researchers are developing yet stronger coatings that allow the engines to run hotter still.",
      "\u201cIf you get it to go hotter, then there\u2019s a massive saving on fuel and CO2,\u201d says Dr Beake. By increasing the temperature by just 30C or so, you might get an 8% fuel saving, he estimates.",
      "This is the power of coatings \u2013 they radically transform the functionality and capabilities of an underlying material. Few people realise how important they are, but these overlays and veneers can supercharge high-performance machines, or ensure that expensive equipment survives the harshest of environments.",
      "Dr Beake and his colleagues are tasked with pushing coatings to their limits, in order to see how robust or effective they really are. His clients don\u2019t always get the results they want. He recalls telling a missile manufacturer, \u201cWe\u2019ve broken your coating,\u201d some years ago. \u201cThey stormed off in a huff,\u201d says Dr Beake.",
      "Besides exposing coatings to high temperatures, Micro Materials also has a \u201cwoodpecker\u201d device, a tiny diamond stylus, which repeatedly taps a coating at random locations to test its durability.",
      "Recently, the firm has worked with UK-based Teer Coatings to test a product that could be applied to satellite components including gears and bearings used in various moving parts.",
      "It is a tricky task, says Xiaoling Zhang, from the company, because the coating must protect such components both pre-launch (when they are exposed to atmospheric humidity at ground level) and also in orbit, against dust particles and radiation in space. However, she claims that the firm has achieved the desired results.",
      "But besides protecting spacecraft, coatings could also stop astronauts from getting sick.",
      "Biofilms \u2013 gloopy accumulations of bacteria inside pipes \u2013 grow faster in low gravity environments, which could be a problem for water supplies or machinery that moves fluid around on space stations or future spacecraft, for example.",
      "\u201cBiofilms are known to cause mechanical failures,\u201d says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d",
      "Prof Varanasi and his colleagues have developed a range of coatings that make surfaces slippery and therefore resistant to the formation of biofilms. Tests of one such coating in an experiment carried out on board the International Space Station found that it worked as intended.",
      "The idea behind the coating is to mix together a solid material and a lubricant. This is then sprayed onto the interior of a pipe or tube, which makes that inner surface extremely slippery.",
      "Prof Varanasi has previously made headlines for developing similar coatings for the insides of toothpaste packets \u2013 so you can get every last bit of toothpaste out. He and his colleagues have commercialised the technology through their spin-out company LiquiGlide.",
      "Slipperiness is, perhaps, an underappreciated attribute. Nuria Espallargas at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and colleagues have developed a silicon carbide-based coating for equipment used in aluminium manufacturing or repair.",
      "It is a sort of non-stick frying pan solution, meaning that layers of molten aluminium do not get stuck on this expensive equipment. The precise functioning of this particular coating is currently something of a mystery, though.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we really don\u2019t know how it works, the mechanism is unknown at the moment,\u201d says Prof Espallargas.",
      "Nonetheless, the coating is available commercially through her spin-out company Seram Coatings. Atlas Machine and Supply, a US firm that makes and repairs industrial machinery, has tried it out.",
      "\u201cThe real benefit lies in extending the life of the tools and improving the quality of the products being produced,\u201d says Jeremy Rydberg, chief innovation officer.",
      "He says that, without the coating, Atlas must rebuild the roller tools it uses to work aluminium every two days. This costs $4.5m annually. But the new coating means that these tools last for a whole week, not just a couple of days, slashing those rebuild costs to around $1.3m per year.",
      "Coatings can do some amazing things, but they don\u2019t always work as intended, notes Andy Hopkinson, managing director at Safinah Group, a firm that often gets called in to investigate when coatings go wrong.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of issues at the moment with car parks, where their passive fire protection system is peeling off,\u201d he says, referring to the fire-resistant paint sometimes applied to concrete structures.",
      "And his company has also found that coatings applied to commercial ships do not always prevent barnacles and other sea life from attaching themselves to the hull. This problem, known as biofouling, increases friction, meaning the ship\u2019s engine must work harder \u2013 and burn more fuel.",
      "Despite the availability of coatings that promise to help, ship owners do not always choose the correct one for their vessel. That choice should depend on where the ship is sailing, how long it is due to be idle rather than in motion, and so on, says Dr Hopkinson.",
      "The cost of fixing issues like this can run into many thousands, or even millions of pounds. \u201cTypically, paint costs between 1 and 2% of the project. The problem is, when it goes wrong, the costs become exponential,\u201d says Mr Hopkinson.",
      "The researchers working in this field, though, say that there are still many opportunities to improve coatings and develop new ones that could drastically improve the performance of machines or infrastructure in the future.",

      "His farming career began in the 1970s when he inherited a rubber plantation in the the southern Indian state of Kerala , which he managed alongside his career as a doctor.",
      "It was a bad time to inherit a rubber plantation, falling rubber prices meant it kept losing money. So, 10 years ago Dr Matthew decided to experiment with cocoa trees, hoping they would generate some funds to support the rest of the farm.",
      "He bought some saplings and planted them. It didn't go well.",
      "\"It was not that successful - most of the saplings died,\" he says.",
      "Squirrels appeared to be making the situation worse by grabbing cocoa bean pods and eating them.",
      "But those raids had an unexpected benefit -  cocoa seeds were spread all over the farm.",
      "\"All the scattered seeds soon grew in to plants and they were much healthier and stronger than the saplings I had planted,\" says Dr Matthew.",
      "\"The trick was in sowing the seeds,\" he realised.",
      "Today Mr Matthews has 6,000 cocoa trees on his 50 acres of land.",
      "\"I think it was the best decision I have made,\" he says.",
      "Despite having several regions with weather conditions suitable for cocoa trees, India only accounts for 1% of the world's cocoa bean production.",
      "Global production is currently dominated by West Africa, where C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana between them produce more than half of the world's annual output.",
      "Indian growers can only supply a quarter of the beans needed by Indian makers of chocolate and other confectionary.",
      "\"The challenge is that it is grown in very fragmented small holdings, so it does not get the kind of attention cocoa should get,\" says Renny Jacob, chairman of India Cocoa, a private company that has been growing and processing cocoa beans for more than 30 years.",
      "In particular he says that Indian farmers are poor at handling beans after they have been harvested. Once removed from their pods, beans go through a fermentation process at the farm, which can make a huge difference to their flavour.",
      "\"Cocoa fermentation is a critical process in the production of chocolate, transforming raw cocoa beans into a form suitable for chocolate making,\" says Sarin Partrick, chief executive of India Cocoa.",

      "But nearly three years of war in Ukraine have shown that it is Vladimir Putin who embraces escalation as a means to achieving his goals - in this case, control over Ukraine or at the very least peace on Russia\u2019s terms.",
      "Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, his decision to declare four Ukrainian territories part of Russia, his deployment of North Korean troops to Kursk region, his decision on Thursday to target the Ukrainian city of Dnipro with a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile, followed up by threats to strike the West - all of these represent moments of escalation in this conflict.",

      "The \"consequences\" threatened by the Kremlin never materialised.",
      "In September Putin announced he was lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons - the decree was published this week. A clear warning to Europe and America not to allow longer-range missile strikes on Russian territory.",
      "Now this red line, too, has been crossed. In his address to the nation Putin confirmed Western reports that Ukraine had fired US-supplied Atacms and British-made Storm Shadow missiles at targets inside Russia.",
      "Earlier this week, when pro-Kremlin tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets asked a retired lieutenant-general how Russia should respond to an Atacms attack on Bryansk region, he replied:",

      "\u201cWe know he\u2019s a very emotional man. The decision to begin this war was also an emotional step. Because of that we must take seriously his idea of the changing of the nuclear doctrine. They say the fear of war must return and will contain both sides, but this is also a tool of escalation.",
      "\u201cIn this interpretation we must admit that Putin, under some circumstances, can use at least a tactical nuclear weapon in the framework of a limited nuclear war. It will not solve the problem. But it will be the start of a suicidal escalation for the whole world.\u201d",

      "This involves transferring the oil between ships out at sea \u2013 a risky, expensive and time-consuming business, according to Dr Go Myong-hyun, a senior research fellow at South Korea\u2019s Institute for National Security Strategy, which is linked to the country\u2019s spy agency.",
      "\u201cNow Kim Jong Un is getting oil directly, it\u2019s likely better quality, and chances are he\u2019s getting it for free, as quid pro quo for supplying munitions. What could be better than that?\"",
      "\u201cA million barrels is nothing for a large oil producer like Russia to release, but it is a substantial amount for North Korea to receive,\u201d Dr Go adds.",
      "Tracking the \u2018silent\u2019 transfers",
      "In all 43 of the journeys tracked by the Open Source Centre using satellite images, the North Korean-flagged tankers arrived at Russia\u2019s Vostochny Port with their trackers switched off, concealing their movements.",
      "The images show they then made their way back to one of four ports on North Korea\u2019s east and west coast.",
      "\u201cThe vessels appear silently, almost every week,\u201d says Joe Byrne, the researcher from the Open Source Centre. \u201cSince March there\u2019s been a fairly constant flow.\u201d",
      "The team, which has been tracking these tankers since the oil sanctions were first introduced, used their knowledge of each ship\u2019s capacity to calculate how many oil barrels they could carry.",
      "Then they studied images of the ships entering and leaving Vostochny and, in most instances, could see how low they sat in the water and, therefore, how full they were.",
      "The tankers, they assess, were loaded to 90% of their capacity.",
      "\u201cWe can see from some of the images that if the ships were any fuller they would sink,\u201d Mr Byrne says.",
      "Based on this, they calculate that, since March, Russia has given North Korea more than a million barrels of oil - more than double the annual cap, and around ten times the amount Moscow officially gave Pyongyang in 2023.",
      "This follows an assessment by the US government in May that Moscow had already supplied more than 500,000 barrels\u2019 worth of oil.",
      "Cloud cover means the researchers cannot get a clear image of the port every day.",
      "\u201cThe whole of August was cloudy, so we weren\u2019t able to document a single trip,\u201d Mr Byrne says, leading his team to believe that one million barrels is a \u201cbaseline\u201d figure.",
      "A \u2018new level of contempt\u2019 for sanctions",
      "Not only do these oil deliveries breach UN sanctions on North Korea, that Russia, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, signed off on \u2013 but also, more than half of the journeys tracked by the Open Source Centre were made by vessels that have been individually sanctioned by the UN.",
      "This means they should have been impounded upon entering Russian waters.",
      "But in March 2024, three weeks after the first oil transfer was documented, Russia disbanded the UN panel responsible for monitoring sanctions violations, by using its veto at the UN Security Council.",
      "Ashley Hess, who was working on the panel up until its collapse, says they saw evidence the transfers had started.",
      "\u201cWe were tracking some of the ships and companies involved, but our work was stopped, possibly after they had already breached the 500,000-barrel cap\u201d.",
      "Eric Penton-Voak, who led the group from 2021-2023, says the Russian members on the panel tried to censor its work.",
      "\u201cNow the panel is gone, they can simply ignore the rules,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe fact that Russia is now encouraging these ships to visit its ports and load up with oil shows a new level of contempt for these sanctions.\u201d",
      "But Mr Penton-Voak, who is on the board of the Open Source Centre, thinks the problem runs much deeper.",
      "\u201cYou now have these autocratic regimes increasingly working together to help one another achieve whatever it is they want, and ignoring the wishes of the international community.\u201d",
      "This is an \u201cincreasingly dangerous\u201d playbook, he argues.",

    "story": [
      "France's Emmanuel Macron has joined calls for information about Franco-Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal, who has gone missing after he flew to Algiers last Saturday.",
      "An outspoken critic of the Algerian regime, Sansal is reported by some French media to have been arrested by Algerian police when he stepped off the plane.",
      "\u201cThe president is very concerned and is following the situation closely,\u201d a spokesman at the Elys\u00e9e palace said. \u201cHe holds very dear the freedom of this great writer and intellectual.\u201d",
      "Several other prominent French politicians, mainly on the centre and right, have voiced their fears for Sansal, who made regular appearances on French media criticising both the Algerian government and the rise of Islamism.",
      "By Friday there had been no official reaction in Algeria to the French concerns.",
      "Former prime minister Edouard Philippe said he was \u201cprofoundly worried\u2026 [Sansal] embodies all that we cherish. He stands for reason, freedom and humanism against the forces of censorship, corruption and Islamism\".",
      "Far-right leader Marine Le Pen called him a \u201cfighter for liberty and a courageous opponent of Islamism.\u201d",
      "The disappearance of Sansal, 75, was first reported by friends in Paris, who found that his mobile telephone had gone dead and were told that he had not arrived at his home in Boumerd\u00e8s.",
      "Among his supporters is the writer Kamel Daoud, another Franco-Algerian critic of the government in Algiers who earlier this month was awarded France\u2019s top book award for a novel about the bloody Algerian civil war of the 1990s.",
      "It was announced only this week that Daoud was being sued in Algeria for allegedly stealing his story from a survivor of the civil war, and for breaching a 2005 \u201creconciliation law\u201d which restricts public comment on the conflict.",

      "In an article published Friday in Paris, where he now lives, Daoud expressed concern for his \u201cfriend\u201d Sansal, who he was sure had been arrested.",
      "\u201cBeing a writer in Algeria is an onerous task. The regime does not at all appreciate the profession and the Islamists are in expansion mode\u2026. Indeed the armed wing [of the Islamists] is the regime,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The difficulties facing the two writers have stoked fears of a vendetta being conducted by the Algerian government in response to an apparent switch in policy by President Macron towards friendship with Morocco, and away from Algeria.",
      "Antoine Gallimard, of Daoud\u2019s publishing firm Gallimard, said that the lawsuits against the writer were proof of a \u201ccampaign of violent defamation orchestrated by certain media close to the (Algerian) regime.\u201d",
      "Last month Macron made a state visit to Morocco, during which he declared French support for Moroccan claims to sovereignty over the disputed territory of Western Sahara. Algeria is the historic backer of the independence movement Polisario.",
      "Macron\u2019s move angered many Algerians, who view the award of France's Prix Goncourt to Daoud as a political rather than a literary gesture.",
      "Elys\u00e9e officials have told journalists that Macron was frustrated by his repeated attempts to build bridges to Algeria constantly coming to nothing because of Algerian stonewalling.",
      "Some French media speculated that Sansal had been arrested in connection with a recent interview in which he appeared to question Algerian historic sovereignty over parts of its territory adjoining Morocco. He also said Polisario had been \u201cinvented\u201d by Algeria to \u201cdestabilise Morocco\u201d.",
      "Over the years Daoud and Sansal have both attracted the wrath of official circles in Algeria, where they are regularly accused of selling out to the former colonial power.",

      "Emmanuel \"Jay Jay\" Banda, who was facing robbery charges, is accused of having escaped from custody in August as he awaited to appear in court.",
      "He is said to have escaped through a window at Chipata Central Hospital in Eastern Province where he had been admitted following his arrest and was being guarded by police and prison officers.",
      "The police then issued a bounty of 2m Zambian kwacha ($72,000; \u00a357,000) for him.",
      "He denies the allegations of robbery.",
      "At a press conference on Wednesday, the Zambian minister for home affairs said the MP had been arrested earlier this week in Harare.",
      "Jack Mwiimbu said the MP was arrested by Zimbabwean police at a flat he had been renting and would remain there pending extradition formalities.",
      "He said the government was keen to know who had facilitated the MP's escape as well as visits by his wife to Harare.",
      "He thanked the Zimbabwean authorities for their co-operation.",
      "The opposition Patriotic Front (PF) party, led by former President Edgar Lungu, condemned what he called  an \"emerging and worrying scenario\".",
      "Banda, who has been an independent MP since 2021, was previously associated with Lungu, who lost the presidency to Hakainde Hichilema that year.",
      "The PF spokesman, Emmanuel Mwamba, said what was happening was \"an abduction\" adding that the government should follow \"internationally prescribed extradition protocols\".",
      "\"We are urging the Zambian government that they should not join other African countries that are known to go other jurisdictions and pick and extract a citizen they are looking for for committing crimes,\" he told the BBC.",
      "The home affairs minister denied that the charges were politically motivated and noted that they date to before Mr Banda became an MP.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, Mwiimbu said that \"as a sitting member of parliament, we expect Mr Banda to uphold respect for Zambia\u2019s justice system and rule of law\".",
      "On Thursday, the Zambian police said that Interpol in Harare had confirmed that Banda was in their custody and had requested extradition documents.",
      "It noted that Banda had in a preliminary interview with Interpol denied the charges, \"alleging he was being targeted due to his familial ties\" with Lungu. This prompted a request for clarification on the charges, which Zambia provided.",
      "The Zambian police added that preparations to \"finalise and transmit the required documents to [Interpol in] Harare are currently under way\" and further updates would be given in due course.",
      "In May this year, Banda had been reported missing in unclear circumstances. He resurfaced a day later, saying that he had been abducted.",
      "At least three opposition politicians and a civil rights activists were arrested following the case.",
      "Two of those who were arrested - Edith Nawakwi, leader of the opposition Forum for Development and Democracy party, and civil rights activist Brebner Changala - accused the state of being behind the abductions.",

      "He faces additional charges of escaping from lawful custody.",
      "But Mr Mwamba told the BBC that the charges were \"politically motivated\".",
      "\"Hon Jay Jay Banda is one of those members of parliament who are close to the former president, who this government is pursuing relentlessly.\"",

      "Amy Friedlander, a mother of three from the Wait Mate movement - which encourages parents to delay giving their kids smartphones - agrees.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore all the positives that technology has brought into our lives. There are huge upsides, but what we haven\u2019t really considered is the impact it is having on brains which aren\u2019t ready for it.\u201d",
      "'Too blunt an instrument'",
      "Over 100 Australian academics have criticised the ban as \"too blunt an instrument\" and argued that it goes against UN advice which calls on governments to ensure young people have \u201csafe access\u201d to digital environments.",
      "It has also failed to win the backing of a bipartisan parliamentary committee that\u2019s been examining the impact of social media on adolescents. Instead, the committee recommended that tech giants face tougher regulations.",
      "To address some of those concerns, the government says it will eventually introduce \"digital duty of care\" laws, which will make it a legal obligation for tech companies to prioritise user safety.",
      "Joanne Orlando, a researcher in digital behaviour, argues that while a ban \u201ccould be part of a strategy, it absolutely can\u2019t be the whole strategy\u201d.",
      "She says \u201cthe biggest piece of the puzzle\u201d should be educating kids to think critically about the content they see on their feeds and how they use social media.",
      "The government has already spent A$6m since 2022 to develop free \u201cdigital literacy tools\u201d to try and do just that. However, research suggests that many young Australians aren\u2019t receiving regular lessons.",
      "Ms Orlando and other experts warn there are also significant hurdles to making the age-verification technology - which is required to enforce the ban - effective and safe, given the \u201cenormous risks\u201d associated with potentially housing the identification documents of every Australian online.",
      "The government has said it is aiming to solve that challenge through age-verification trials, and hopes to table a report by mid-next year. It has promised that privacy concerns will be front and centre, but offered little detail on what kind of technology will actually be tested.",
      "In its advice, the eSafety Commissioner has floated the idea of using a third-party service to anonymise a user\u2019s ID before it is passed on to any age verification sites, to \u201cpreserve\u201d their privacy.",
      "However, Ms Orlando remains sceptical. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any technology that exists at this point that can pull this off,\u201d she tells the BBC.",
      "Will Australia succeed?",
      "Australia is by no means the first country to try to restrict how young people access certain websites or platforms online.",
      "In 2011, South Korea passed its \u201cshutdown law\u201d which prevented children under 16 from playing internet games between 22:30 and 6:00, but the rules - which faced backlash - were later scrapped citing the need to \u201crespect the rights of youths\u201d.",
      "More recently France introduced legislation requiring social media platforms to block access to children under 15 without parental consent. Research indicated almost half of users were able to circumvent the ban using a simple VPN.",
      "A law in the US state of Utah - which was similar to Australia\u2019s - ran into a different issue: it was blocked by a federal judge who found it unconstitutional.",
      "Albanese has conceded that Australia's proposal may not be foolproof, and if it passes the parliament, it would be subject to a review.",
      "\"We all know technology moves fast and some people will try to find ways around these new laws but that is not a reason to ignore the responsibility that we have,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "But for mothers like Emma and Ms Friedlander - who have lobbied for the changes - it's the message that the ban sends which matters most.",
      "\u201cFor too long parents have had this impossible choice between giving in and getting their child an addictive device or seeing their child isolated and feeling left out socially,\u201d Ms Friedlander says.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been trapped in a norm that no one wants to be a part of.\u201d",
      "James says that since quitting Snapchat he\u2019s found himself spending more time outside with friends.",
      "And he hopes that the new laws could enable more kids like him to \u201cget out and do the things they love\u201d instead of feeling pressured to be online."

      "They may be among the most determined supporters of Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle the bureaucratic \u201cdeep state\u201d. The president-elect has picked particular fights in each of the areas they would oversee - law enforcement, intelligence and health.",

      "What it tells us: Aside from the economy, polls repeatedly suggested that immigration and the border with Mexico were primary concerns for many voters.",

      "The three are likely to push through Trump\u2019s pledge for much higher tariffs on Chinese imports. They see Beijing as the top economic and security threat to the US. Waltz - picked for national security adviser - has said the US is in a \u201cCold War\u201d with the ruling communist party.",
      "Ratcliffe, Trump\u2019s nominee for CIA director who served as an intelligence chief in his first term, has likened countering China\u2019s rise to the defeat of fascism or bringing down the Iron Curtain.",
      "What it tells us: While Trump often signals his own hawkish economic views on China, he has also vacillated - which could spark tensions with his top foreign policy team.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 12:07:36 GMT",
    "summary": "What it means for the global climate effort if another superpower comes to the fore, just as Trump steps back",
    "story": [
      "The WhatsApp message was from the chief negotiator of one of the most powerful countries at the COP climate gathering. Could I stop by for a chat, he asked.",
      "As his team hunched over computers eating takeaway pizza, he raged about the obstructionist behaviour of many of the other teams at the conference.",
      "So far, so normal. Others had been saying versions of this all week \u2013 that this was the worst COP ever; that negotiating texts, which are meant to get smaller as deadlines approached, were in fact ballooning; that COP in its current form might be dead in the water\u2026",
      "Looming over it all was the prospect of US president-elect Donald Trump withdrawing the US from the COP process when he takes office for a second time. He has called climate action a \u201cscam\u201d and, at his victory celebration in West Palm Beach earlier this month, vowed to boost US oil production beyond its current record levels, saying, \u201cWe have more liquid gold than any country in the world\u201d.",
      "But there was one positive: China.",
      "\u201cIt's the only bright spot in all of this is,\u201d the chief negotiator told me. Not only was its negotiating style markedly different to previous years, but he also observed that, as he puts it, \u201cChina could be stepping forward.\u201d",
      "So what would it mean for the global effort to tackle climate change if it does step to the fore, just as the US steps back?",
      "Negotiating styles - a change of tack",
      "In the past, China has played a dual role in these talks. Sometimes it has aligned with the US and Europe, for example on ambitious targets to boost renewable power or on the reduction of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. On other issues, meanwhile, it has slowed progress.",
      "One such example was COP15, which was held in Copenhagen in 2009. There had been high hopes that an agreement would be reached to commit countries to deep cuts in carbon emissions. But the conference nearly collapsed when China fought against US pressure to submit to a regime of international monitoring. The final non-binding deal was generally considered a failure.",
      "This year was different. The chief negotiator I spoke to said that China was being \u201cunusually cooperative\u201d across all the discussions.",
      "The most obvious sign of this came at the start of the conference, when China made public details of its climate funding.",
      "Traditionally, China has released minimal information about its climate policies and plans, so it came as a surprise when this year, for the first time, officials said they have paid developing countries more than $24 billion for climate action since 2016.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s serious money, almost nobody else is at that level,\u201d one COP insider told me.",
      "This got the conference buzzing. It is a \u201cnotable signal\u201d, says Li Shuo, a director of China Climate Hub, \u201cas it\u2019s the first time that the Chinese government has laid out a clear figure in terms of how much they have been providing.\u201d",
      "Developing country vs superpower",
      "China is classed as a developing country in the context of UN climate talks, despite being the world\u2019s second biggest economy, the result of a peculiarity in the COP rules. (This is linked to its economic status in 1992 when the talks process began.)",
      "It has long resisted pressure from developed countries to change its status, meaning it doesn\u2019t have to contribute to the pot that rich countries have agreed to pay to poorer ones.",
      "That pot has been one of the focuses in the talks at Baku. It totals $100 billion a year currently, but developing countries \u2013 those with low and middle incomes \u2013 need at least a trillion dollars a year to help them switch to clean energy and deal with the effects of climate change, according to the World Economic Forum.",
      "What form that funding takes is another question, as little data is available. What is known is that Chinese money is helping to fund projects like solar farms and energy efficient lighting in certain developing countries such as Rwanda, where Chinese manufactured electric buses have been used in the capital Kigali.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is the language the Chinese used,\u201d says Professor Michael Jacobs, an expert on climate politics at Sheffield University. \u201cThey described it as \u2018provided and mobilised\u2019 - that\u2019s the term developed countries use for their payments.\u201d",
      "Language matters at climate conferences. Negotiators can spend days discussing whether something \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d happen. So, the Chinese echoing the language of the rich world is significant, Prof Jacobs argues.",
      "\u201cThey used to calibrate everything against what the US did,\u201d he says. When Trump took office in 2016, China stood back from the talks in response. This time is different, according to Prof Jacobs.",
      "\u201cThis looks to me like a claim of leadership.\"",
      "What\u2019s in it for the East?",
      "\"This isn\u2019t [driven by] altruism on China\u2019s part,\u201d Prof Jacobs continues.",
      "According to Li Shuo, the shifting economics of renewables explains why China is likely to step forward.",
      "The green transformation is very much being led by China - not necessarily the government, but its private sector and companies\u201d. These companies lead the rest of the world by what Shuo says is a \u201cvery significant margin\u201d.",
      "Eight out of every ten solar panels are made in China, and it controls some two-thirds of wind turbine production. It is reckoned to produce at least three-quarters of the world\u2019s lithium batteries and more than 60% of the global market for electric vehicles.",
      "Earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that solar panels, EVs and batteries are the \u201cnew trio\u201d at the heart of the Chinese economy.",
      "It is the huge investments China has made in renewable technologies and the massive economies of scale that it has created that have also driven down renewable costs year after year - the challenge it faces now is finding new markets to sell it into.",
      "The developing world is where the demand is set to boom. These countries will account for two-thirds of the renewable market within 10 years, according to a recent report by a group of economists tasked by the UN with calculating the costs of the energy transition.",
      "Pakistan imported 13 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels in the first six months of this year alone, according to research by Bloomberg NEF. To put that in context, the UK has 17GW of installed solar.",
      "Shipping clean tech to emerging economies dovetails with another of China\u2019s policies: its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d an effort to develop new trade routes, including roads, railways, ports and airports, to connect with the rest of the world.",
      "China has spent more than a trillion dollars on the project, according to the World Economic Forum. Last week, President Xi opened a new port on the coast of Peru.",
      "Which begins to explain why, as Prof Jacobs sees it, while the US may withdraw, China looks like it might be stepping up. \u201cIt now sees its best interest as encouraging other countries to also cut their emissions by using Chinese technologies and equipment.\u201d",
      "A tectonic shift in climate talks",
      "If China does take a more central role, it would mark a tectonic shift in the COP process. Historically, Western countries \u2013 particularly the US and EU \u2013 have provided the momentum, cheered on by smaller climate-vulnerable nations. The difference in the way the talks play out will be marked.",
      "Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, has been to every COP and understands better than most the behind-the-scenes bartering, bullying and brinkmanship that makes or breaks deals at summits. He says that China won\u2019t lead from the front, like the US and Europe.",
      "\u201cThey're more cautious players than that. It may be that they're leading with Chinese characteristics, which is what they might say themselves.\u201d",
      "(This echoes how Deng Xiaoping, president in the early 1980s, described his economic reforms, which catapulted the country\u2019s economic growth into double figures: \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d.)",
      "Pershing suggests that China is likely to help drive the COP process forward by discreetly intervening to unblock disputes. Most of this effort will take place behind closed doors, he believes, but is likely to include urging developing and developed countries to increase their ambition \u2013 and the flow of cash.",
      "However China may not be entirely helpful on some of the challenges that slow the process, such as instances when countries use COP as a stage to champion their own interests.",
      "One of the biggest blockers in Baku was said to be Saudi Arabia, which heads up a group of fossil fuel producing countries that want to slow the transition to renewables. As a big consumer of fossil fuels, China has often thrown its weight behind them in the past, such as by resisting the UK\u2019s effort to get agreement to phase out coal at COP26 in Glasgow.",
      "Ultimately, though, there is cause for hope, according to some well-placed observers. Camilla Born, who has been part of the UK\u2019s negotiating team and helped run COP26 in Glasgow, believes that the future talks will be determined by the new economics of energy, not the politics of meetings.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about an idea of how to deal with climate change anymore,\u201d she argues. \u201cThis is about investments, about money - it\u2019s people\u2019s jobs, it\u2019s new technologies. The conversations are different.\u201d",
      "It is, after all, the biggest revolution in energy since the start of the industrial revolution. And regardless of which superpower takes the lead, or if the US is out of the game for four years, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone will want to miss out on such a vast market.",

    "title": "Fake alcohol deaths highlight SE Asia's methanol problem",
    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 09:29:57 GMT",
    "summary": "The deaths of five tourists after apparently drinking tainted drinks highlight the wider issue of bootleg alcohol.",
    "story": [
      "Suspected methanol poisoning from tainted drinks has reportedly killed six tourists in a Laos holiday town in the past fortnight.",
      "A British woman, two Australian women, a US man and two Danish nationals have died. The deaths remain under police investigation, but reports suggest they may have consumed drinks tainted with methanol, a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol.",
      "Methanol poisoning has long been a well-known issue across South East Asia, particularly in the poorer countries along the Mekong river.",
      "But despite foreign governments posting warnings about alcohol consumption in these places, there is still little awareness among the backpacker party scene.",
      "Flavourless and colourless, methanol is hard to detect in drinks and victims typically don\u2019t see symptoms of poisoning straight away.",
      "And in countries like Laos - one of the poorest and least developed in Asia - the problem arises from alcohol suppliers exploiting an environment where there is low law enforcement and almost no regulation in food and hospitality industries.",
      "What is methanol poisoning?",
      "Methanol is a toxic alcohol used in industrial and household products like paint thinners, antifreeze, varnish and photocopier fluid.",
      "It is colourless and has a similar smell to ethyl alcohol - the chemical substance found in alcoholic drinks.",
      "But methanol is dangerous for humans and drinking just 25ml or half a shot can be lethal.",
      "It can take up to 24 hours for victims to start showing signs of illness which include: nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain which can escalate into hyperventilation and breathing problems.",
      "If not treated, fatality rates are often reported to be 20% to 40%, depending on the concentration of methanol and the amount taken, says international medical charity Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) which tracks the number of global outbreaks.",
      "But if a poisoning is diagnosed quickly enough, ideally within the first 30 hours, treatment can reduce some of the worse effects.",
      "How common is the problem in South East Asia?",
      "Asia has the highest prevalence of methanol poisoning worldwide, according to MSF\u2019s database.",
      "It mainly affects poorer countries- outbreaks are common in Indonesia, India, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines.",
      "Indonesia is regarded as the hotspot \u2013 it has reported the highest number of incidents in the past two decades, according to MSF, largely down to the widespread production and consumption of bootleg liquor.",
      "Towns like Vang Vieng in Laos, where the fatal poisonings took place, are known stops on the backpacking trail through South East Asia. The town's economy is built on tourism, with streets of bars, restaurants and hostels that cater to visitors.",
      "But in Laos, law enforcement is under-resourced and there are few regulations around food and alcohol standards. There is also an industry of home-brewed  alcohol, which can lead to accidental poisonings.",
      "Producers also make counterfeit drinks with methanol instead of ethanol because it is cheaper, say local observers.",
      "\"You have the unscrupulous producer adding methanol to their drinks because it\u2019s cheaper \u2013 it\u2019s used to create a stronger-seeming drink or make lower-quality alcohol drinks seem more potent,\" one Western diplomat in the region told the BBC.",
      "They said methanol poisonings were frequently reported to consulates across the region.",
      "However, a lack of data means it is hard to quantify the scale of the contamination, and where tainted drinks enter the supply chain.",
      "\"I don't think it's nefarious bar owners going out of their way to poison tourists - that's not good for them or their industry either,\" the diplomat said.",
      "\"It's more about the production side \u2013 there being being low education, low regulation, people cutting corners.\"",
      "What can be done about it?",
      "Some campaigners have sought to raise attention to the dangers before. Australian man Colin Ahearn runs a Facebook page called 'Don't Drink Spirits in Bali' where he warns against mixed drinks like cocktails or drinks made from opened bottles of spirits.",
      "He told Australian media earlier this week that his page used to receive a submission a week about methanol poisoning across South East Asia.",
      "The diplomat said the risks of bootleg alcohol are well known among tourism operators and embassies, but a high-profile campaign is needed to inform tourists.",
      "\"This horrific event will probably help educate people, but not solve the cause of the problem,\u201d they added.",
      "Several Western governments updated their advice about alcohol dangers in South East Asia on their consulate and travel pages this week.",
      "They advise that contaminated drinks could include local home-brewed spirits, spirit-based drinks such as cocktails and even brand name alcohol.",

    "summary": "The nomination stunned Washington, triggering a political rollercoaster that turned into a bumpy ride for Trump's transition team.",
    "story": [
      "Eight tumultuous days after US President-elect Donald Trump picked Matt Gaetz to be attorney general, the firebrand congressman has withdrawn from consideration for the post.",
      "It was a nomination that stunned Washington and sent a shiver through the corridors of the justice department.",
      "Trump settled on Gaetz, 42, during a two-hour flight from Washington to Florida last week, according to reports.",
      "Still basking in the glow of his election victory, the president-elect was flying back to West Palm Beach last Wednesday afternoon after a cordial meeting with President Joe Biden.",
      "That morning Gaetz was not even on the shortlist for the position of America\u2019s top law officer, according to Politico, but Trump had felt underwhelmed by his other options.",
      "A plan hatched on a plane",
      "On so-called Trump Force One that day were Gaetz himself, Elon Musk, Trump\u2019s incoming White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and his top legal adviser, Boris Epshteyn, reports the New York Times.",
      "Epshteyn reportedly set about convincing Trump that Gaetz should lead the justice department, which had conducted a sex-trafficking investigation into the lawmaker before dropping the matter.",
      "Gaetz, a lawyer, has been one of Trump\u2019s most strident defenders on Capitol Hill.",
      "He helped prepare the Republican nominee for his televised debate against Biden that effectively knocked the Democrat out of the White House race.",
      "One Trump adviser explained why the president-elect - who has himself been criminally investigated by the justice department, and accuses its prosecutors of witch hunts - took a shine to Gaetz as opposed to other contenders.",
      "\u201cEveryone else looked at AG [attorney general] as if they were applying for a judicial appointment,\u201d the unnamed aide told the Bulwark.",
      "\u201cGaetz was the only one who said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll go over there and start cuttin\u2019 [expletive] heads.\u2019\u201d",

      "What does Matt Gaetz actually want?",
      "What to know about the Matt Gaetz allegations",
      "Who has joined Trump's team so far?",
      "Prosecutors outraged",
      "While Republicans on Capitol Hill reacted tepidly to the nomination, career lawyers at the justice department told US media they were stunned and outraged.",
      "Speaking at a conservative conference last year, Gaetz had suggested that the justice department and the agencies it oversees, including the FBI, ought to be abolished, as he argued they were being weaponised against conservatives. The current Attorney General, Merrick Garland, has rejected these claims.",
      "Critics said Trump - who has also named three lawyers that defended him in criminal cases for senior positions at the justice department - was more interested in hiring loyalists than appointees who will uphold the rule of law.",
      "Former Trump National Security Adviser John Bolton dismissed Gaetz as the \u201cworst cabinet-level appointment in history\u201d.",
      "But the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr, said the furore from the Washington establishment showed his father\u2019s unconventional cabinet picks were just the kind of change-makers that American voters had elected him to usher in.",
      "A ticking timebomb",
      "After being nominated last week for attorney general, Gaetz resigned as representative for Florida's 1st congressional district, a seat he has held since 2017.",
      "His resignation came as the House Ethics Committee was due to decide whether to release a report on its investigation into allegations of misconduct involving drugs, bribes and paying for sex, including with an underage girl.",
      "Gaetz dismissed the claims as a smear. But his resignation triggered a drip feed of leaks in subsequent days as the ethics panel wrangled over what to do about the report.",
      "Few Republicans seemed willing, meanwhile, to circle the wagons round one of the most unpopular lawmakers in the House.",
      "Last year, the combative Gaetz came under fire from his own side of the aisle when he proved instrumental in ousting Republican Kevin McCarthy as House Speaker.",
      "Markwayne Mullin, a former House member turned senator, told CNN at the time there was a reason why none of Gaetz\u2019s colleagues would defend him from allegations of sexual misconduct.",
      "\"Because we had all seen the videos he was showing on the House floor,\" said the Oklahoman last October, accusing Gaetz of bragging about his sexual exploits.",
      "Gaetz said Mullin was lying.",
      "A confirmation 'on steroids'",
      "As the backlash to his nomination for attorney general began to build this week, Trump made calls to senators in an effort to shore up support.",
      "Trump seemed to be holding firm on Gaetz as he attended a SpaceX rocket launch in Boca Chica, Texas, on Tuesday with Musk.",
      "Asked if he was reconsidering, the president-elect said: \"No.\"",
      "There was more encouraging news for Gaetz on Wednesday as House Ethics Committee Republicans voted not to release its investigation into him.",
      "It happened as Vice-President-elect JD Vance ferried the attorney general nominee around the Senate in a charm offensive.",
      "Gaetz said it had been \u201ca great day\u201d. But there were hints of turbulence ahead.",
      "When asked how messy the confirmation process could become, incoming Senate majority leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said the hearings could be \u201con steroids\u201d.",
      "A successor is swiftly picked",
      "On Thursday morning, Trump was still calling Republican senators to gauge Gaetz's chances.",
      "But by lunchtime, the nominee had come to the conclusion he didn't have the votes and he again shocked Washington with the announcement that he was showing himself the door.",
      "\u201cWhile the momentum was strong,\u201d he posted on X, \u201cit is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s post on Truth Social confirming the volte-face - his first political setback since his election 16 days earlier - was unusually muted for the president-elect.",
      "\u201cI greatly appreciate the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General,\u201d he wrote, adding that the nominee did not wish to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d.",
      "Hours later, Trump nominated former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi instead for the post.",
      "While Trump predicted a \"wonderful future\" for Gaetz, a question mark hangs over what he will do next.",
      "He was comfortably re-elected this month, but there are already plans for a special election to fill his vacated seat.",
      "Randy Ross, a Florida-based fundraiser for Trump, told the BBC that America had not heard the last of Matt Gaetz.",
      "\u201cMy opinion is there\u2019s still a spot in Trump\u2019s administration, Florida or our country\u2019s future leadership for this patriot,\" said Mr Ross. \"We all look forward to his next steps.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Ginger Gaetz, who wed the congressman in 2021, posted an old photo on X following his withdrawal of them both on the steps on Capitol Hill.",
      "\"The end of an era,\" she commented."

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 03:16:27 GMT",
    "summary": "The churches central to his election in 2022 are now his fiercest critics.",
    "story": [
      "William Ruto, who became Kenya\u2019s president two years ago riding on the crest of the Christian vote, has been visibly shaken to find that over the last few months church leaders of all creeds are losing faith in him - seeing him less as a saviour and more as the greedy biblical tax collector.",
      "In the run-up to his victory, some of his most ardent evangelical supporters had dubbed him \"David\", after the shepherd boy in the Bible who rose to become king.",
      "The opposition had baptised him \"deputy Jesus\", accusing him of using Christianity to gain political capital as he attended church services from Catholic masses to the gatherings of obscure sects.",
      "He would wear the appropriate religious attire for each setting, sometimes knelt in supplication and on occasion was moved to tears by sermons.",
      "Afterwards, he credited God for his electoral success, and continued this practice of criss-crossing the country to attend a different church each Sunday.",
      "But following massive opposition to the tax hikes imposed by his government, the 57-year-old gained a new nickname: \"Zakayo\" - which is Swahili for Zacchaeus, the wealthy and unpopular Jericho tax collector featured in the Bible.",
      "The president has always maintained that if people want better public services and a reduction in the country\u2019s debt burden, they have to pay up.",
      "Over the last two years, taxes on salaries have gone up, the sales tax on fuel has doubled and people are also paying a new housing levy and a health insurance tax that is yet to benefit many Kenyans.",
      "When momentous anti-tax protests erupted in June, the young people who led them, popularly referred to as Gen Zs, also called out churches for being too close to politicians and allowing them to preach from their pulpits.",
      "Their anger forced the government to retract a controversial finance bill that had included more tax increases - and it woke up the churches, whose clergy began to openly criticise Ruto and his policies.",
      "This too was a momentous development as the faith economy is big business in a country where more than 80% of the population are Christian - and a fundraiser with the right politician can greatly improve the fortunes of a church.",
      "Last month, Teresia Wairimu, founder of Faith Evangelistic Ministries (Fem), a church in the capital, Nairobi, where Ruto and his family have frequently worshipped, suggested their King David was heading back to the field where sheep grazed.",
      "\"As a voter, I\u2019m embarrassed,\" she said in her sermon.",
      "Another sermon by Rev Tony Kiama of the River of God Church recently went viral after he called out Ruto\u2019s government for \"not serving God\u2019s purpose but an evil one\", citing the killings during the recent protests, the rising cost of living and every-day corruption.",
      "The most hard-hitting criticism was last week\u2019s statement from Catholic bishops, who carry more weight because of the respect and influence they command in Kenya.",
      "They accused Ruto\u2019s government of perpetuating a \"culture of lies\", citing unfulfilled campaign promises.",
      "\"Basically, it seems that truth does not exist, and if it does, it is only what the government says,\" the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops said, also hitting out at corruption, greed and over-taxation that was stifling the economy.",
      "One bishop dubbed Kenya an \"Orwellian dystopian authoritarian\" state, where dissent was met \u201cwith intimidation, abduction or even assassination\".",
      "This was a pointed reference to the 60 people who died and the 1,300 others arrested during the anti-tax demonstrations. A further 74 people have been abducted and 26 reported missing in the last five months, according to the state-run Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.",
      "The stinging statement by the bishops was followed by the Church\u2019s rejection of a $40,000 (\u00a332,000) donation make by Ruto when he attended the Soweto Catholic Church in Nairobi last Sunday - with the Archbishop of Nairobi citing \"ethical concerns and the need to safeguard the Church from being used for political purposes\".",
      "Many of Kenya\u2019s Christians are Catholic - about 10 million people, or 20% of the population, according to government statistics.",
      "Other Christians belong to a variety of evangelical churches and other denominations, including the Anglican Church of Kenya and the Presbyterian Church.",
      "And the Catholic Church\u2019s influence in Kenya goes beyond its congregation owing to its wide investment in education, healthcare and other social programmes.",
      "It has also been angered by the chaotic transition to a new social health insurance scheme, with the government owing millions of dollars to faith-based hospitals.",
      "The bishops\u2019 outspoken assessment of the state of the nation has reminded Kenyans of the role church leaders played when they pushed for a return to multi-party democracy in the 1990s.",
      "Brave clerics such as Ndingi Mwana a\u2019Nzeki of the Catholic Church, Alexander Muge, Henry Okullu and David Gitari of the Anglican Church and Timothy Njoya of the Presbyterian Church fearlessly challenged the repressive and single-party rule of then-President Daniel arap Moi.",
      "But analysts say under Moi\u2019s successors - Mwai Kibaki and Uhuru Kenyatta, both Catholics - clerics lost their voice.",
      "\"Under President William Ruto, things got even worse because important elements of the church were seemingly co-opted into the feeding trough,\" veteran journalist and columnist Macharia Gaitho wrote in Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper this week, suggesting \"churches were bribed into silence\".",
      "The Catholic bishops\u2019 stance has won support from other denominations, as well as Muslim clerics  - despite the widespread faith-based support Ruto enjoyed previously for his tough stand on gay rights and his conservative views on abortion.",
      "A joint statement by some Pentecostal and evangelical leaders hailed the bishops for their bravery and also for \"doing the unthinkable\" in rejecting Ruto\u2019s money.",
      "Head of the Anglican Church of Kenya Archbishop Jackson Ole Sapit, who led national prayers on the day Ruto was declared winner of the presidential race, joined Catholic bishops in condemning what he described as \"escalating misrule, impunity, and widespread rights violations\".",
      "\"In the circumstances, we should not simply fold our hands and pray for miracles,\" Ole Sapit said, adding that the Catholic bishops reflected the feelings of many Kenyans.",
      "Baptist cleric Daniel Wambua added that religious leaders were now determined to end the \"transactional relationship\" with the state.",
      "Meanwhile Sheikh Abubakar Bini, chair of the North Rift Council of Imams and Preachers of Islam, urged the government to take the bishops' remarks as advice rather than criticism.",
      "At first, Ruto and his allies hit back - one accusing the bishops of spreading \"misinformation\".",
      "But analysts say Ruto, who frequently uses the scriptures to respond to critics, should be wary of a direct confrontation with the churches as even smaller ones can have thousands of followers who could negatively affect his re-election bid.",
      "The president is already facing rebellion in parts of his 2022 political strongholds after the impeachment of former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua last month.",
      "They fell out over the handling of the anti-tax demonstrations, which have rocked Ruto\u2019s administration to its core.",
      "A close ally of the president, MP Oscar Sudi, has taken to X to eat some humble pie, apologising to Catholic bishops on behalf of the government.",
      "Ruto himself has since appeared to soften his response to the growing criticism, saying he has heard the clerics and is ready to engage further.",
      "\"We have made undeniable progress in our country. However, there remains much to be done. We must continue working together to hasten the delivery of our commitments and change Kenya,\" he tweeted on Thursday.",
      "What Kenya\u2019s first evangelical Christian president is having to accept is that the churches he used so successfully to take state house could well help unseat him in the next election.",
      "\"He knows he cannot fight the church,\" said Mr Gaitho.",

    "summary": "The charges could jeopardise the ambitions of one of the world\u2019s richest men, both at home and abroad.",
    "story": [
      "Just weeks ago, Gautam Adani, one of the world\u2019s richest men, celebrated Donald Trump\u2019s election victory and announced plans to invest $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) in energy and infrastructure projects in the US.",
      "Now, the 62-year-old Indian billionaire and a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose sprawling $169bn empire spans ports and renewable energy, faces US fraud charges that could potentially jeopardise his ambitions at home and abroad.",
      "Federal prosecutors have accused him of orchestrating a $250m bribery scheme and concealing it to raise money in the US. They allege Mr Adani and his executives paid bribes to Indian officials to secure contracts worth $2bn in profits over 20 years. Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them \"baseless.\"",
      "But this is already hurting the group and the Indian economy.",
      "Adani Group firms lost $34bn in market value on Thursday, reducing the combined market capitalisation of its 10 companies to $147bn. Adani Green Energy, which is the firm at the centre of the allegations, also said it wouldn't proceed with a $600m bond offering.",
      "Then there are questions about the impact of the charges on India\u2019s business and politics.",
      "India\u2019s economy is deeply intertwined with Mr Adani, the country\u2019s leading  infrastructure tycoon. He operates 13 ports (30% market share),  seven airports (23% of passenger traffic), and India\u2019s second-largest cement business (20% of the market).",
      "With six coal-fired power plants, Mr Adani is India's largest private player in power. At the same time, he has pledged to invest $50bn in green hydrogen and runs a 8,000km (4,970 miles)-long natural gas pipeline. He\u2019s also building India's longest expressway and redeveloping India\u2019s largest slum. He employs over 45,000 people, but his businesses impact millions nationwide.",
      "Gautam Adani: Asia's richest man",
      "Gautam Adani: Asia's richest man",
      "His global ambitions span coal mines in Indonesia and Australia, and infrastructure projects in Africa.",
      "Mr Adani\u2019s portfolio closely mirrors Modi\u2019s policy priorities, beginning with infrastructure and more recently expanding into clean energy. He has thrived despite critics labeling his business empire as crony capitalism, pointing to his close ties with Modi, both as Gujarat's chief minister - where they both hail from - and as India's prime minister. (Like any successful businessman, Mr Adani has also forged ties with many opposition leaders, investing in their states.)",
      "\u201cThis [the bribery allegations] is big. Mr Adani and Modi have been inseparable for a long time. This is going to influence the political economy of India,\u201d says Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, an Indian journalist who has written extensively on the business group.",
      "This crisis also comes as Mr Adani has spent nearly two years trying to rebuild his image after US short-seller Hindenburg Research's 2023 report accused his conglomerate of decades of stock manipulation and fraud. Though Mr Adani denied the claims, the allegations triggered a market sell-off and an ongoing investigation by India's market regulator, SEBI.",
      "\u201cMr Adani has been trying to rehabilitate his image, and try to show that those earlier fraud allegations leveled by the Hindenburg group were not true, and his company and his businesses had actually been doing quite well. There'd been a number of new deals and investments made over the last year or so, and so this is just a body blow coming to this billionaire who had done a very good job of shaking off the potential damage of those earlier allegations,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told the BBC.",
      "For now, raising capital at home may prove challenging for Mr Adani's cash-guzzling projects.",
      "\"The market reaction shows how serious this is,\" Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst, told the BBC. \"Adanis will still secure funding for their major projects, but with delays.\"",
      "The latest charges could also throw a spanner in Mr Adani\u2019s global expansion plans. He has been already challenged in Kenya and Bangladesh over a planned takeover of an international airport and a controversial energy deal.  \"This [bribery charges] stops international expansion plans linked to the US,\" Nirmalya Kumar, Lee Kong Chian Professor at Singapore Management University, told the BBC.",
      "What\u2019s next? Politically, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has unsurprisingly called for Mr Adani\u2019s arrest and promised to stir up parliament. \u201cBribing government officials in India is not news, but the amounts mentioned are staggering. I suspect the US has names of some of those who were the intended recipients. This has potential reverberations for the Indian political scene. There is more to come,\u201d Mr Kumar believes.",
      "Mr Adani\u2019s team will undoubtedly assemble a top-tier legal defence. \"For now, we have only the indictment, leaving much still to unfold,\" says Mr Kugelman.",
      "While the US-India business relationship may face scrutiny, it\u2019s unlikely to be significantly impacted, particularly given the recent $500m US deal with Mr Adani for a port project in Sri Lanka, says Mr Kugelman. Despite the serious allegations, broader US-India business ties remain strong.",
      "\u201cThe US-India business relationship is a very large and multifaceted one. Even with these very serious allegations against someone that's such a major player in the Indian economy, I don't think we should overstate the impact that this could have on that relationship,\u201d Mr Kugelman says.",
      "Also, it's unclear if Mr Adani can be targeted, despite the US-India extradition treaty, as it depends on whether the new administration allows the cases to proceed. Mr Baliga believes it is not doom and gloom for the Adanis. \"I still do think foreign investors and banks will back them like they did post Hindenburg though, given that they are part of very important, well performing sectors of the Indian economy,\" he says.",
      "\"The sense in the market is also that this will perhaps blow over and be sorted out, once the [Donald] Trump administration takes over.\u201d"

    "summary": "Ordinary Palestinians in Gaza welcome the ICC's announcement, saying they hope it will bring \"justice\".",
    "story": [
      "The announcement of arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant has triggered a furious response from across Israel's political spectrum.",
      "By contrast it has been welcomed by Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and ordinary citizens in Gaza.",
      "Israel's President Isaac Herzog called it \"a dark day for justice and humanity\", saying the decision had \"chosen the side of terror and evil over democracy and freedom\".",
      "Netanyahu's office called it \"an antisemitic decision\" and said that Israel \"utterly rejects the false and absurd charges\", labelling the ICC \"a biased and discriminatory political body\".",
      "The chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, Yuli Edelstein, called it \"a shameful decision by a political body held captive by Islamist interests\". Israel's foreign minister said the ICC had lost its legitimacy.",
      "Hamas has welcomed the decision, without commenting on the issuing of a warrant for its own military commander, Mohammed Deif.",
      "In a statement it said: \"We call on all countries around the world to cooperate with the court in bringing the Zionist war criminals, Netanyahu and Gallant and to work immediately to stop the crimes of genocide against defenceless civilians in the Gaza Strip\".",
      "Ordinary Palestinians in Gaza have also welcomed the announcement. Muhammad Ali, a 40-year old man displaced from Gaza City and currently in the central area of Deir al-Balah, said:",
      "\"We have been terrorised, starved, had our homes destroyed, and lost our children, sons, and loved ones. We welcome this decision, and of course, we hope that the decisions of the ICC will be implemented\".",
      "Munira Al-Shami, whose sister was killed by Israeli forces last month, called the ICC decision \"justice for tens of thousands of victims, including my sister Wafa\".",
      "Meanwhile, some Israeli citizens said the arrests went against Israel's right to defend itself.",
      "\"Somehow I'm not surprised,\" Ron Ackerman said, adding he thinks the ICC \"is purely antisemitic and it doesn't see what's going on around Israel, only they look at Israel\".",
      "Helen Kariv from Jerusalem said: \"When I first heard it I said, 'my God, where did they get the idea of arresting the prime minister of the state of Israel and his chief of staff'?... We are fighting for survival.\"",
      "What effect will these arrest warrants have?",
      "A total of 124 countries are signatories to the ICC, including the UK, but not the US, Russia, China, nor Israel itself.",
      "So this means that technically, if either Netanyahu or Gallant sets foot in any of the signatory countries they must be arrested and handed over to the court.",
      "But international lawyers have expressed doubts over whether either man will ever be brought to The Hague for trial.",
      "The last time Netanyahu travelled outside Israel was in July to the US,  a country he could still theoretically visit with impunity.",
      "Last year he visited several countries, including the UK in March, many of which are signatories.",
      "It is thought unlikely he would want to risk arrest by doing this again and the countries in question would also be reluctant to find themselves put in that position.",
      "Hamas has little to fear from the ICC warrant for Ibrahim Al-Masri, aka Mohammed Deif. Israel believes he was killed earlier this year, although this was never confirmed by Hamas.",
      "The other two Hamas figures whom the ICC originally planned to prosecute \u2013 Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh \u2013 are both confirmed as dead.",
      "There is no question that Thursday\u2019s announcement is a major blow to Israel\u2019s international standing, to the two individuals named and most specifically to Israel\u2019s ongoing efforts to present its military campaign in Gaza as a fight between the forces of good and evil.",
      "Israelis are appalled that, in their eyes, the world seems to have already forgotten or overlooked the atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October last year.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 07:24:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Illegal miners live dangerously, but make roaring profits selling gold on the black-market.",
    "story": [
      "Along with about 600 other men, Ndumiso lives and works in a small gang-controlled \"town\" - complete with markets and a red light district - that has grown up deep underground at a disused gold mine in South Africa.",
      "Ndumiso told the BBC that after being laid off by a big mining firm, he decided to join the gang in its underground world to become what is known as a \"zama zama\", an illegal miner.",
      "He digs for the precious metal and surfaces every three months or so to sell it on the black market for a huge profit, earning more than he ever did before - though the risks now are far higher.",
      "\"The underground life is ruthless. Many do not make it out alive,\" said the 52-year-old, who spoke to the BBC on condition that his real name was not used as he feared reprisals.",
      "\"In one level of the shaft there are bodies and skeletons. We call that the zama-zama graveyard,\" he said.",
      "But for those who survive, like Ndumiso, the job can be lucrative.",
      "While he sleeps on sandbags after back-breaking days underground, his family lives in a house he has bought in a township of the main city, Johannesburg.",
      "He made cash payments of 130,000 rand (about $7,000; \u00a35,600) for the one-bedroom house, which he has now extended to include another three bedrooms, he said.",
      "An illegal miner for about eight years, Ndumiso has managed to send his three children to fee-paying schools - one of whom is now in university.",
      "\"I have to provide for my wife and children and this is the only way I know,\" he said, adding that he preferred to toil underground rather than adding to the high crime rate by becoming a car-hijacker or robber, after spending many years trying to find legal work.",
      "His current job is at a mine in the small town of Stilfontein, around 90 miles (145km) south-west of Johannesburg, which is at the centre of global attention after a government minister, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, promised to \"smoke out\" the hundreds of miners who were underground there, with the security forces preventing food and water from being sent down.",
      "\"Criminals are not to be helped. Criminals are to be persecuted,\" Ntshavheni said.",
      "A campaign group, The Society for the Protection of Our Constitution, has launched a court case to demand access to the mineshaft, which police say is about 2km (1.2 miles) deep.",
      "The court has given an interim ruling, stating that food and other essentials could be delivered to the miners.",
      "Ndumiso works at a different shaft at the mine, and surfaced last month, before the current stand-off.",
      "He is now waiting to see how the situation unfolds, before deciding whether to return.",
      "The stand-off follows a government decision to crack down on an industry that has spiralled out of control, with mafia-like gangs running it.",
      "\"The country has been grappling with the scourge of illegal mining for many years, and mining communities bore the brunt of peripheral criminal activities such as rape, robbing and damage to public infrastructure, among others,\" said Mikateko Mahlaule, chairman of the parliamentary committee on mineral resources.",
      "South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said the mine was a \"crime scene\",  but police were negotiating with the miners to end the stand-off, rather than going down to arrest them.",
      "\"Law-enforcement authorities have information that some of the miners may be heavily armed. It is well-established that illegal miners are recruited by criminal gangs and form part of wider organised crime syndicates,\" he added.",
      "Ndumiso was among hundreds of thousands of workers - both locals and nationals of neighbouring states like Lesotho - who have been retrenched as South Africa's mining industry has gone into decline over the last three decades. Many of these have gone on to become \"zama zamas\" at the abandoned mines.",
      "South Africa-based Benchmark Foundation researcher David van Wyk, who has studied the industry, said there were about 6,000 abandoned mines in the country.",
      "\"While they are not profitable for large-scale industrial mining, they are profitable for small-scaling mining,\" he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Ndumiso said he used to work as a drill operator, earning less than $220 (\u00a3175) a month, for a gold-mining company until he was laid off in 1996.",
      "After struggling for the next 20 years to find a full-time job because of South Africa's crushingly high unemployment rate, he said he decided to become an illegal miner.",
      "There are tens of thousands of illegal miners in South Africa, with Mr Van Wyk saying they number about 36,000 alone in Gauteng province - the country's economic heartland, where gold was first discovered in the 19th Century.",
      "\"Zama zamas will often spend months underground without surfacing and depend heavily on outside support for food and other necessities. It is arduous and dangerous work,\" said a report by campaign group Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime.",
      "\"Some carry pistols, shotguns and semi-automatic weapons to protect themselves from rival gangs of miners,\" it added.",
      "Ndumiso told the BBC that he did own a pistol, but he also paid his gang a monthly \"protection fee\" of about $8.",
      "Its heavily armed guards fend off threats, especially from Lesotho gangs reputed to have more lethal firepower, he said.",
      "Under the 24-hour protection of the gang, Ndumiso said he used dynamite for rock-blasting and rudimentary tools such as a pick axe, spade and chisel to find gold.",
      "Most of what he finds he gives to the gang leader, who pays him a minimum of $1,100 every two weeks. He said he was able to keep some gold, which he sells on the black market to top up his income.",
      "He was among the fortunate miners to have such an arrangement, he said - explaining that others were kidnapped and taken to the shaft to work like slave labourers, receiving no payment or gold.",
      "Ndumiso said he normally stayed underground for about three months at a time, and then came up for two to four weeks to spend time with his family and sell his gold, before going back into the deep pits.",
      "\"I look forward to sleeping on my bed and eating home-cooked meals. Breathing in fresh air is an amazingly powerful feeling.\"",
      "Ndumiso does not come out more often in case he loses his digging spot, but after three months it gets too much to remain underground.",
      "He recalled that once when he reached the surface: \"I was so blinded by the sunlight that I thought I had gone blind.\"",
      "His skin had also become so pale that his wife took him for a medical check-up: \"I was honest with the doctor about where I lived. He did not say anything, and just treated me. He gave me vitamins.\"",
      "Above ground Ndumiso does not just relax. He also works with other illegal miners as ore-bearing rocks brought up from below are blasted and crushed into fine powder.",
      "This is then \"washed\" by his group at a makeshift plant to separate the gold using dangerous chemicals like mercury and sodium cyanide.",
      "Ndumiso said he then sells his share of the gold - one gram for $55, less than the official price of about $77.",
      "He said he has a ready-made buyer, whom he contacts via WhatsApp.",
      "\"The first time I met him I did not trust him so I told him to meet me in the car park of a police station. I knew I would be safe there.",
      "\"Now we meet in any car park. We have a scale. We weigh the gold on the spot. I then hand it to over to him, and he pays me in cash,\" he said, pointing out that he  walks away with between $3,800 and $5,500.",
      "He gets this amount every three months, meaning his average annual income is between $15,500 and $22,000 - far more than the $2,700 he earned as a legally employed miner.",
      "Ndumiso said the gang leaders earned far more, but he did not know how much.",
      "As for the buyer of his gold, Ndumiso said he did not know anything about him, except that he was a white man in an illegal industry that involves people of different races and classes.",
      "This makes it difficult to clamp down on the criminal networks, with Mr Van Wyk saying the government was targeting miners - but not the \"kingpins living in the leafy suburbs of Johannesburg and Cape Town\".",
      "Mr Ramaphosa said that illegal mining was costing \"our economy billions of rands in lost export income, royalties and taxes\", and the government would continue to work with mining firms \"to ensure they take responsibility for rehabilitating or closing mines that are no longer operational\".",
      "Mr Van Wyk told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast that the government would worsen South Africa's economic crisis if it clamped down on the \"zama zamas\".",
      "\"There should be a policy to decriminalise their operations, to better organise them and to regulate them,\" he added.",
      "When Ndumiso goes back underground to work, he takes with him cartons of canned food to avoid paying the exorbitant prices at the \"markets\" that exist there.",
      "Apart from food, basic items - like cigarettes, torches, batteries - and mining tools were sold there, he said.",
      "This suggests that a community - or a small town - had developed underground over the years, with Ndumiso saying there was even a red light district, with sex workers brought underground by the gangs.",
      "Ndumiso said the mine where he worked was made up of several levels, and a labyrinth of tunnels that connected to each other.",
      "\"They are like highways, with signs painted to give directions to different places and levels - like the level that we use as the toilet, or the level that we call the zama-zama graveyard,\" he said.",
      "\"Some are killed by rival gang members; others die during rockfalls and are crushed by massive boulders. I lost a friend after he was robbed of his gold and shot in the head.\"",
      "Although life underground is perilous, it is a risk that thousands like Ndumiso are willing to take, as they say the alternative is to live and die poor in a nation where the unemployment rate stands at more than 30%.",

      "The UK manufacturer, Beck Optronic Solutions, which has worked on British Challenger 2 tanks and F35 fighter jets, told us it had not breached sanctions, had no dealings with Russia or Kyrgyzstan, and was unaware of the shipments.",
      "Our investigation raises questions about the effectiveness of sanctions imposed on Russia since the war in Ukraine began.",
      "The trail led us to Valeria Baigascina, a 25-year-old, originally from the Central Asian state of Kazakhstan but now living in Belarus. A part-time model, she posts regularly about her jet-set lifestyle on social media. In the past two years she has visited Dubai, Sri Lanka and Malaysia.",
      "Her social media gave no indication she was also the director of a firm which had channelled millions of dollars\u2019 worth of equipment to sanctioned companies in Russia, as our search of customs documents revealed.",
      "According to Belarusian registration details, Ms Baigascina was the founder and director of a company called Rama Group LLC. Set up in February 2023, it is registered to an address in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan - 2,300 miles (3,713 km) from her home in Belarus.",

      "Trade data shows that since sanctions on Russia were introduced in February 2022, UK exports to Kyrgyzstan have increased by more than 300%. Experts suspect some goods are actually destined for Moscow.",
      "The customs documents obtained by the BBC suggest that Rama Group made two shipments to Moscow of high-end optics that can be used in missiles, tanks and aircraft.",
      "The equipment is listed on the customs form as being made by Beck Optronic Solutions in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. The company manufactures high-precision lenses used in targeting and surveillance systems.",
      "Though some of its lenses are used in healthcare and engineering, Beck\u2019s website details extensive military and defence applications.",
      "The lenses and optical technology sold by Beck Optronics are specifically listed as goods that either cannot be legally exported to Russia, or that need permission from UK authorities before any sale can take place.",
      "The BBC has identified, through customs documents, a total of six shipments of products said to have been made by Beck with a total value of $2.1m (\u00a31.6m) and transferred to Moscow through Rama and another intermediary company, Shisan LLC.",
      "In December 2023 and January 2024, Rama Group made its two shipments to Moscow listing them as \u201crotating part of camera\u201d. These shipments went to Sol Group, a company based in Smolensk, 200 miles (320km) south-west of Moscow, which has been sanctioned by the US.",
      "It is not clear what international route the goods took - the documents indicate some of the shipments may actually have originated in Thailand.",
      "Shisan LLC, another Kyrgyz company, was responsible for four further shipments of Beck Optronics\u2019 products worth $1.5m (\u00a31.1m).",
      "Two of those shipments involved \u201cshort-wave infrared camera lens\u201d and went to the Ural Optical & Mechanical Plant, which makes bomb-aiming equipment and is also sanctioned because of its links to the Russian military.",
      "Rama Group and Shisan share the same address in Bishkek - a modern five-storey block in a prosperous part of the city. However, when we visited we were told Valeria Baigascina was out of the country on a business trip.",
      "We found her number through her social media posts and put our allegations to her.",
      "Ms Baigascina said she was the founder of the company but had sold it in May. She denied the allegations, saying that when she had owned it, \u201cnothing like that was supplied\u201d. She then hung up.",
      "Later, by email, she told us the accusations were \u201cridiculous\u201d and based on \u201cfalse information\u201d.",
      "Our research shows that in May this year she sold Rama Group to her best friend, Angelina Zhurenko, who runs a lingerie business in Kazakhstan.",
      "Ms Zhurenko told us: \u201cTrading activities are carried out exclusively within the framework of the current legislation of Kyrgyzstan. The company does not violate any prohibitions. Any other information is false.\u201d",
      "The director of the other intermediary company, Shisan, is listed as Evgeniy Anatolyevich Matveev. We put our allegations to him by email.",
      "He told us that our information was \u201cfalse\u201d and that he ran \u201ca business supplying exclusively civilian goods manufactured in Asian countries\u201d.",
      "He continued: \u201cThis does not contradict the laws of the state in which I work, and has nothing to do with US sanctions, because it is impossible to prohibit free trade in Asian goods available for sale and delivery.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no evidence that Beck Optronics knew about these shipments or that the final destination of the lenses was Russia.",
      "The company told us it had nothing to do with the shipments: \u201cBeck has not shipped anything contrary to UK export controls or any sanctions applying in the UK. It has had no dealings with any party or company in Russia, Kyrgyzstan or Thailand, was not aware that any shipments might ultimately be destined for any of these destinations and has not shipped anything to these destinations.\u201d",
      "It believes some of the equipment listed wasn\u2019t even made by the company and that customs documents may have been falsified.",
      "But these alleged exports are part of a much bigger picture involving shipments from a number of sources.",
      "Analysis of customs documents by the Washington-based security think tank C4ADS suggest that Shisan completed 373 shipments via Kyrgyzstan to Russia between July and December 2023.",
      "Of these, 288 contained goods that fall under customs codes for \u201chigh-priority battlefield items\u201d.",
      "Over the same six-month period, Rama Group completed a total of 1,756 shipments to Russia. Of these, 1,355 were for items on the \u201chigh-priority battlefield items\u201d list.",
      "Its most recent shipments, including electronics by US and UK companies, went to a Russian company named Titan-Mikro, which has been subject to US sanctions since May 2023 for operating within Russia\u2019s military sector.",

      "Personal struggles",
      "Lynne, now 56, was 19 when she signed a record deal in Nashville. Her first single was a duet with George Jones.",
      "Despite that early success, Lynne's private life was weighed down by a secret and family tragedy. Coming up in Nashville in the late 1980s, Lynne had to hide the fact that she was gay. She also kept her family history in the shadows. In 1986, she lost both her parents when her father shot and killed her mother and then turned the gun on himself.",

    "summary": "CBS News' Anthony Mason joins Paul Simon on a trip to the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss, to explore how researchers are getting closer to finding answers about repairing and preventing hearing loss.",
    "story": [
      "When legendary singer-songwriter\u00a0Paul Simon began to lose his hearing\u00a0nearly four years ago while working on his album, \"Seven Psalms,\" he feared he wouldn't be able to perform again.",
      "\"It was incredibly frustrating. I was very angry at first that this had happened,\" Simon told CBS News senior culture correspondent\u00a0Anthony Mason\u00a0in an interview for \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "He admits one of his biggest fears was giving up what he loves: making music.",
      "\"I guess what I'm most apprehensive about would be if I can't hear well enough to really enjoy the act of making music,\" Simon said.",
      "Since then, he's had dramatic hearing loss, sharing that he now has about 6% hearing in his left ear. But he's learned to make adjustments. He's switched to larger speakers, placing them all around him when he's playing so he can hear better. He's also had to change how and what he plays.",
      "\"I'm going through my repertoire and reducing a lot of the choices that I make to acoustic versions. It's all much quieter. It's not 'You Can Call Me Al.' That's gone. I can't do that one,\" Simon said, chuckling.",
      "Simon is still writing music and he returned to the stage in September for a rare, stripped-down performance at The Soho Sessions in New York.",
      "\"You know Matisse, when he was suffering at the end of his life, when he was in bed, he envisioned all these cut-outs and had a great creative period,\" Simon said. \"So I don't think creativity stops with disability. So far, I haven't experienced that. And I hope not to.\"",
      "Paul Simon's search for answers",
      "At first, doctors told Simon there was nothing they could do about his hearing loss. Then, he learned about the\u00a0Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss\u00a0(SICHL), which includes a team of nearly 100 scientists searching for ways to prevent, repair and replace damaged inner ear tissue.",
      "That's promising news for Simon and millions like him. Hearing loss is on the rise, affecting nearly 1.5 billion people across the globe, according to Stanford Medicine.",
      "Mason recently joined Simon during a visit to the program's facility in Palo Alto, California, sitting in on Simon's exam with Dr. Konstantina Stankovic.",
      "\"Hearing bones are the smallest bones in the body,\" Dr. Stankovic said. \"And then they are connected to the inner ear, which is called the cochlea. And it looks like a snail.\"",
      "The cochlea is so small and fragile it's impossible to biopsy without causing deafness. It's hidden in the hardest bone in the body, located deep in the skull, Dr. Stankovic explained.",
      "What can animals teach us about hearing loss?",
      "Certain animals can recover from hearing loss because their hair cells regenerate. It's the hairs in the ear, called cilia, that transmit sound to the brain.",
      "\"We actually have the same genetic machinery, it's just turned off in people,\" Dr. Stankovic told Mason. \"And the key question is how do you turn it on? And how do you turn it on safely, because cancer is regeneration gone awry.\"",
      "In a lab at the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss , geneticist Teresa Nicolson is studying zebrafish, which have similar inner ear structures to humans.",
      "Nicolson said they've made a recent, exciting discovery. They were able to rescue hearing in zebrafish with hearing loss mutations using an FDA-approved drug. The hope is it could one day be used in humans.",
      "Down the hall, biophysicist Tony Ricci is conducting an experiment focused on mice.",
      "\"So the hair bundle is the site where most damage happens. So with aging, with noise\u2026we are trying to understand how the bundle \u2013 like it's a machine, right? So how this machine works normally,\" Ricci said.",
      "\"So then when we know what piece's parts are getting broken, we can figure out how do we fix it or how do we replace it,\" he added.",
      "Surgeon and scientist Dr. Alan Cheng is using gene therapy to coax the damaged hair cells in mice to regenerate. He's also studying human cochlea samples from organ donors.",
      "\"We're the only place in the world that can do it, in fact,\" Dr. Cheng said.",
      "The team was surprised to find that damaged human hair cells do begin to regenerate on their own, but only partially. Now they need to find out whether the drug cocktail they've used in mice could work in humans.",
      "For Dr. Cheng, this research is personal.",
      "\"My mom, who has hearing loss, she's been asking how can we regenerate cells for her,\" he said.",

Payne's former bandmates Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson were among \u00a0mourners at the private service at St Mary's Church in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, just outside London.",
      "The late singer's girlfriend Kate Cassidy also attended, as did his former partner, the Girls Aloud singer Cheryl Tweedy.",
      "Around a dozen fans watched from behind a nearby cordon as guests hugged each other before walking past floral tributes into the 12th century church to pay their final respects to the singer.",
      "Payne's coffin arrived in a white horse-drawn hearse topped with floral tributes spelling the words \"Son\" and \"Daddy,\" followed by his parents.",
      "Payne was found dead on October 16 after falling from the balcony of his third-floor room at the Casa Sur Hotel in the Argentinian capital.",
      "His death, at age 31, prompted a global outpouring of grief from family, former bandmates and fans with thousands gathering in cities around the world to offer condolences.",
      "Payne shot to stardom as a teenager alongside Styles, Horan, Tomlinson and Malik after the band was formed on the hit U.K. talent show \"The X Factor\" 14 years ago.",
      "Payne died from \"multiple traumas\" and \"internal and external haemorrhaging\" after the fall from the hotel, a postmortem examination found. The balcony attached to his room overlooked a rear patio, about 45 feet high.",
      "Hotel staff had called emergency services twice to report a guest \"overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol\" who was \"destroying\" a hotel room. Investigators have said Payne was alone at the time and appeared to have been \"going through an episode of substance abuse.\"",
      "In early November, Argentine prosecutors said three people had been charged in connection with Payne's death, including one person whom they said had spent time with Payne every day he was in Buenos Aires. That individual was charged with abandonment of a person followed by death, which carries a sentence of five to 15 years in prison, according to statement released\u00a0by Argentina's National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor's Office.",
      "In a short statement following his death, Payne's family said: \"We are heartbroken. Liam will forever live in our hearts and we'll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul.\"",
      "One Direction co-stars said they had been \"completely devastated\" by his death.",
      "After forming in 2010, the band went on to release an album of radio-ready songs each year in time for the holiday shopping season and became one of the highest-grossing live acts in the world.",
      "In 2016, after Malik left, the group said it was on an indefinite hiatus but not splitting up.",
      "Payne's first solo single \"Strip That Down\" peaked at number three on the UK charts and number 10 on the US Billboard top songs list.",
      "But in recent years he had spoken publicly about struggles with substance abuse and coping with fame from an early age.",
      "His last solo work, a single called \"Teardrops,\" was released in March, with a second album promised at the time.",
      "Payne was born and raised in Wolverhampton, in central England. He is survived by his parents, two sisters, and a son with Cheryl Tweedy.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 21:50:00 -0500",
    "summary": "For years, actor and comedian Katt Williams has claimed he lied about his age as a teenager to join the Marines and passed boot camp before being drummed out. The Marines have no record of him ever serving.",
    "story": [
      "Los Angeles\u00a0\u2014 Katt Williams, the Emmy-winning actor and renowned stand-up comedian, for years has claimed to have joined the U.S. Marine Corps as a teenager and successfully navigated the rigorous training only to be drummed out of the military when his superiors discovered he was a minor. The Marines told CBS News they have no record of him.",
      "Dating back to at least 2016, Williams has claimed association with the U.S. Marine Corps when talking about his personal biography in video blogs, in his stand-up routines and in interviews viewed and heard by tens of millions of people. His claims of military service seem to not be attached to any of his critically acclaimed jokes or characters he has created for stage and screen but instead, a part of his journey towards comedy.",
      "The U.S. Marine Corps tells CBS News there's no record of Williams ever entering military service or attending any Marine Corps recruit training camps.",
      "Multiple emails and phone calls were sent to Williams' publicist, Amy Sisoyev, and his representatives at Creative Artists Agency, but no reply was returned for almost two weeks.",
      "Earlier this year, Williams sat down for a nearly 3-hour interview with ESPN's \"First Take\" correspondent Shannon Sharpe on his podcast, \"Club Shay Shay.\" The interview has racked up\u00a0more than 83 million views on YouTube as of publication and is the most watched interview in YouTube's history.",
      "Sharpe, a former Denver Bronco and ex-NFL analyst for CBS Sports, asked Williams about being raised in Florida.",
      "\"I try to join the Marine Corps and they won't accept me because I'm too young, and I've lied and told them I'm 16 and my family is moving down and I don't have my ID but it's coming. And so they [the Marines] let me go to the boot camp,\" said Williams.",
      "Similarly, on comedian Marc Maron's podcast last year, Williams said, \"And then I attempt to join the Marine Corps, and I go off to boot camp and I pass, and then they reveal that I'm too young, and they give me a little ceremony because I did pass, you know, oo-Rah.\"",
      "He added: \"I wasn't even 16. I wasn't even 16. I was already \u2014 I had miscalculated it wrong. I thought that you know, by the time I got back I would be good, but I hadn't turned 16 by the time boot camp was over.\"",
      "Maron, whose \"WTF\" podcast garners more than 55 million listens per year, asked Williams if he got through boot camp and about his ceremony.",
      "Williams reaffirmed that he passed boot camp, saying, \"When you come back everybody gets the ceremony and I was supposed to have been, probably put in the brig or court-martialed or something, but they didn't treat me like that. \u2026 As far as the Marine Corps thing, whatever those commercials were selling, you remember those commercials back in that time \u2026 if you wanted to join a gang, the Marines was the gang to join.\"",
      "On Saturday, CBS News attended the Vulture Festival in Los Angeles where Williams was interviewed about his life and career by Jesse David Fox, a Vulture writer and host of \"Good One: The Podcast About Jokes.\" Williams is set to launch his multistate \"Heaven on Earth\" tour next year.",
      "While Williams did not discuss his alleged short stint in the Marines, the comedian said \"Thank God I tell the truth\" when asked by Fox about his past statements in interviews.",
      "CBS News filed a Freedom of Information Act request for records pertaining to Williams' alleged enlistment in the Marine Corps.",
      "Marine Corps officials searched for records pertaining to Williams using his full name \u2014 Micah Sierra Williams \u2014 and other identifying information such as his date of birth and social security number. Officials told CBS News that their database of official military personnel files dates back to the 1960s, housed at the National Personnel Records Center of the National Archives.",
      "\"We searched the files maintained by the Manpower Management Performance Branch but were unable to identify Mr. Williams as a member or former member of the U.S. Marine Corps,\" wrote an official in response to CBS News' public records request.",
      "Marine Corps officials told CBS News that if Williams' story was accurate, there would be records showing his entry into military service, his graduation and discharge, even if he fraudulently enlisted as a minor.",
      "Army veteran Anthony Anderson, who runs \"Guardians of Valor,\" a popular social media website that investigates service member records, told CBS News that Williams' claims are a \"slap in the face of people who have earned the title of Marine.\"",
      "\"Boot camp for the Marine Corps is not an easy task. To call yourself a Marine, you have to go through at least 13 weeks of boot camp and successfully navigate the crucible \u2026 people have died in training at boot camp trying to earn the title of Marine,\" said Anderson.",
      "While it's unclear when exactly Williams began to claim he graduated from Marine boot camp, the earliest examples CBS News could find stemmed from Williams' 2016 feud with actor and comedian Kevin Hart.",
      "In a video that appears to have been\u00a0recorded by Williams, addressing drug abuse allegations, the comedian says, \"Ever since I got out of the Marine Corps, I can only breathe out of one nostril.\"",
      "That same year, Williams was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and battery charges after a fight at an apartment complex in Gainesville, Georgia, with a 17-year-old high school wrestler who was also charged, according to previous news reports. Williams pleaded not guilty and the case lingered on until earlier this year when local prosecutors decided to drop the case against Williams.",
      "Soon after his arrest Williams spoke about the episode on stage, suggesting that he wasn't actually put into a chokehold by the teenager and in fact, that Williams had let him win, adding, \"I'm Semper Fi till I die, Marine Corps b----. I passed motherf---ing boot camp at 16.\"",
      "Williams' routine was removed from YouTube due to copyright infringement issues, but the video still exists in the reader forum on Military.com, a military news and culture website. A user posted the video to the website in 2016 and asked: \"Katt Williams a Marine?\"",

    "summary": "With the release of part one of her new memoir, Cher talks about her relationship - on stage and off - with Sonny Bono, and why their TV partnership survived beyond their marriage.",
    "story": [
      "It took too long for Cher to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. \"I thought, what do I have to do?\" she said. \"I've had number one records in all these decades. I had a song [\"Believe\"] that changed music forever. And so, what is it that I've gotta do?\"",
      "This year she finally made it. At her induction ceremony last month, she said, \"It was easier getting divorced from two men than it was to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame!\"",
      "It also took forever for Cher to write her story. This week, \"Cher: The Memoir \u2013 Part One\" finally comes out. Asked what she wanted to say with the book, she replied, \"In the beginning, I didn't wanna say much. And then at some point, I just thought, Cher, do it or give the money back.\"",
      "The book centers on her years with Sonny, and her itinerant childhood with a mother who married at least seven times. She writes of how she had to be a grownup from the beginning: \"One time we were driving in the car and she said, 'Cher, I don't know how we're gonna pay the rent. What do you think?' And I was like, 'Okay, how is this gonna work? How are we gonna do this?'\"",
      "In 1962, Cherilyn Sarkisian met Sonny Bono in a coffee shop. He was wearing a mohair suit and a mustard-colored shirt with a white collar. \"I thought it was like when Tony met Maria,\" she said. \"Everybody disappeared, and it was just the two of us.\"",
      "But she said it was not love at first sight. \"It was something,\" Cher said. \"I never felt it before.\"",
      "Sonny was 27, Cher was 16. \"It wasn't passionate; I just loved him,\" she said.",
      "What did she love about him? \"How he was different than anyone else. And he made me laugh. And we had a dream.\"",
      "That dream came true. By the mid-1960s, Sonny & Cher had five songs in the top 50 at the same time. They had a #1 hit with \"I Got You Babe.\"",
      "In the 1970s, on \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" they'd become America's favorite couple, with their banter, their songs, and that Bob Mackie wardrobe: \"And then, when they started to realize that people were tuning in because of what I was wearing, then they just gave us all the money we needed,\" she said. \"It was so much fun.\"",
      "But Sonny began to change. \"He just started not to care,\" Cher said.",
      "About what? \"About me.\"",
      "He didn't like her going out, or even talking with their band. But one member had his eye on her: A guitarist by the name of Bill. One night Cher met up with him. \"We walked back to this place where the guys used to get high before the show. And then he kissed me, and it was like, Oh, my God.\"",
      "Somehow word got back to Sonny. \"I don't know if I can actually say what happened because it's so personal, and it's so \u2026 it's embarrassing,\" Cher said.",
      "But it's in the book: After Sonny asked her what she wanted to do, Cher writes: \"I said, 'I want to sleep with Bill.' It all seems crazy now. I didn't mean it, but I thought saying those words was the only way that he would let me go.\"",
      "\"I thought if I do this, it's over,\" she said. \"He's not gonna be able to come back. We're not gonna be able to be Sonny & Cher. I just wanna blow it up. But I didn't know I wanted to blow it up until I was blowing it up.\"",
      "They offered her anything to keep up appearances: \"Because everybody was afraid I was gonna blow up the show. They just said, 'What do you want?' And I said, 'Well, I want my own place in Malibu. And I want $5,000 a month. Hello? And I want freedom.'\"",
      "But Sonny & Cher kept up the fa\u00e7ade for two more years, until Cher's new boyfriend, record executive David Geffen, got a copy of her contract, and she learned the shocking truth: \"Sonny owned 95 percent of the company and his lawyer owned five,\" she said. \"And it was called Cher Enterprises, but I own nothing! And we'd worked together for almost 12 years.\"",
      "She confronted Sonny: \"I said, 'When was the moment that you thought this would be a good idea?' And he said, 'I always knew you'd leave me.' And I said, 'That's not a reason! Son, how could you do it? I was there by your side working, all those nights, all those days, through good, through bad.' He didn't have an answer.",
      "\"And we were still friends after that,\" she said.",
      "Even after Cher married Gregg Allman and was pregnant with their son, she rejoined Sonny for a revival of their TV show.",
      "Mason asked, \"Can you explain why it was that up on that stage all the other stuff seemed to go away?\"",
      "\"Because we had fun with each other,\" Cher replied. \"And because on stage, there was no marriage. There was no discord. There was no word for our relationship. And you couldn't cut it with a chainsaw.\"",

    "story": [
      "Walking through the streets of Dublin, Paul Mescal said, \"There's this weird sensation about landing into the city \u2013 I don't know, it just makes me feel calm.\"",
      "The Irish actor was not going to get much of that calm on this stop, attending the Dublin premiere of \"Gladiator II.\" He was here to promote the highly-anticipated film. \"There's a little bit of really enjoying it, but part of it also hanging on for dear life,\" he said. \"Just the size is something that I haven't experienced before. I also just haven't led a huge amount of films.\"",
      "In \"Gladiator II,\" he plays Lucius, who learns (along with the audience) of his connection to Russell Crowe's character from the original 2000 blockbuster. Nearly 25 years later, director Ridley Scott is back with the sequel, out this week.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Gladiator II\" click on the video player below:",
      "What was it like for Mescal to be in the middle of such an epic film? \"I would say equally epic,\" he replied.",
      "The 28-year-old has already been nominated for an Oscar, playing a single dad in \"Aftersun,\" and an Emmy for his role in \"Normal People.\" Aside from the critical acclaim, that series turned him into a Gen Z heartthrob practically overnight.",
      "Ridley Scott says he was so impressed with Mescal that he cast the young actor after just a 30-minute zoom call.",
      "\"I got a phone call and they were like, 'You're going to be in \"Gladiator II,\"'\" Mescal recalled. \"That's kind of massively life-altering news to receive.\"",
      "It's that big? \"Yeah, of course it is,\" Mescal said. \"I think there's something that comes with the legacy of Ridley Scott.\"",
      "The first \"Gladiator\" won five Academy Awards, including best picture. In this incarnation, from Paramount Pictures (a division of CBS' parent company), Mescal stars alongside Denzel Washington.",
      "I asked, \"As an actor, are you taking mental notes when you work with someone like Washington?\"",
      "\"When you go back to bed in the evening, you're like, 'How is he doing this? How is he doing that?'\" he replied. \"Every scene I did with him was never how I expected it to go, which is the dream. It was very thrilling to be five feet in front of his face watching him do that.\"",
      "Mescal has star power of his own, as we saw when we witnessed a sea of people following us when we met at Trinity College, where, not so long ago, he'd studied acting.",
      "He's proving to be a singular actor, at least until a recent look-a-like contest. \"I feel like it's easy to do a parody of me,\" he laughed.",
      "\"The shorts?\"",
      "\"Yeah yeah yeah.\"",
      "Those shorts are the uniform of his other love, Gaelic football. For \"Gladiator II,\" this athlete bulked-up, putting on 18 pounds of muscle.",
      "I asked, \"The role is so different. You're often playing these kind of softer, almost tormented, shy characters. It's a major transition for you.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is,\" he replied. \"I think going back to the sport that I played before, there was definitely a desire to make a more physically-informed choice with a character Lucius represented, like, the perfect opportunity for that to happen.\"",
      "\"Normal People,\" his big break, was shot at his alma mater. In it, Mescal portrays the sharp, nuanced emotions of a student: angst, torment, desire. \"I think it exposed an audience to me,\" Mescal said. \"That job essentially allowed me to prove to people that I can act.\"",
      "The series came after he made a commercial for an Irish sausage company: \"Yeah, that covered my rent for the year. I was absolutely delighted by it.\"",
      "He'd started acting at 16, and a high school production of \"Phantom of the Opera\" changed his trajectory. \"I think I'm still chasing that feeling again,\" he said. \"Nothing has ever really come close to that feeling.\"",
      "\"Your high school 'Phantom of the Opera' production vs. 'Gladiator II'?\" I asked.",
      "\"It sounds absolutely bizarre! I think because it felt physically dangerous in my body to be exposed to an audience of people who knew me as somebody who played sports. The adrenaline was, like, extraordinary.\"",
      "His childhood, he says, was pretty standard. His mother was a policewoman, his dad a teacher, both now retired. But he credits that upbringing with helping him navigate today's pressures.",
      "\"This is new for me,\" he said, of fame.",
      "\"But you're used to attention at this point?\"",
      "\"Uh, within reason.\"",
      "On campus, at times this star was as struck as the students.",
      "Mescal is hoping to maintain some distance, some mystery as an actor, to be able to convincingly inhabit such varied roles. \"You don't want an audience to know you innately,\" he said.",
      "And what is his relationship with fame? \"Ever-changing,\" he said.",
      "Perhaps that's because it's all changing so quickly for him. Instead of dispersing during our interview inside, the crowd, we soon discovered, had multiplied. And we got to witness Paul Mescal in a role for which there is no rehearsal, and no script.",
      "\"What the hell?\" he remarked to the assembled hordes. \"I don't know what to say other than, hello! This is f*****g bananas! I have to go finish an interview \u2026 you should all go back to school. See you later!\"",

    "summary": "Kennedy's team is weighing a significant rewrite of the FDA's rules.",
    "story": [
      "Advisers to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are weighing a significant rewrite to the Food and Drug Administration's rules governing food additives, to fulfill Kennedy and President-elect Donald Trump's \"Make America Healthy Again\" pledge to get toxic chemicals out of the food supply.",
      "The proposed crackdown, which is still in its early stages and will need to get a sign-off from Trump and his transition team, targets a provision in the FDA's regulations on which food additives are considered by the agency to be \"generally recognized as safe,\" or GRAS.",
      "Advisers to Kennedy, Trump's pick for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, have also floated other approaches to curbing the use of food additives, including working with agricultural producers to change the subsidies and incentives offered by the government for certain kinds of foods Kennedy argues are unhealthy.",
      "\"I think the overall posture of the FDA should be actually a lot of deregulation. I think we should have a golden age of innovation and drug development. Nobody's standing in the way of that,\" Calley Means, a top adviser to Kennedy's transition team, said this month on \"The Liz Wheeler Show.\"",
      "Means said \"corrupt regulatory interpretations\" had broken the regulation of additives under the GRAS process, saying it had become a \"totally rigged system.\"",
      "\"But when it comes to food, when it comes to 'generally recognized as safe,' complete self-policing from this industry, allowing them to put chemicals in our food that are banned in every other country and have hundreds of studies saying are harmful, there needs to be a review,\" Means said.",
      "\"This is a bananas system\"",
      "Advocacy groups and experts have long denounced the FDA's \"loophole\" in its regulation of these food additives, which allows companies to quietly decide which chemicals they deem safe enough to add to their products without going through the agency's oversight.",
      "\"This is a bananas system. This is not the way that new food chemicals should be approved and come into our food supply,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.",
      "While companies with new chemicals can choose to go through a \"voluntary\" process to earn a spot on the agency's list of substances that are \"generally recognized as safe,\" making it easier to market foods with the additives, officials acknowledge companies often bypass it.",
      "\"It does undermine the overall credibility of the system when it is possible to get a chemical on the market without prior review by the FDA,\" the agency's top food official, Jim Jones, said at an event hosted by the Alliance for a Stronger FDA earlier this year.",
      "Bill Freese, science director for the Center for Food Safety, cited times companies have decided to go ahead and \"self-certify\" that their food additives were safe, even after failing to earn the sign-off of the FDA's reviewers during the voluntary process.",
      "That has strayed far from the original intent of the provision, Freese said, which was supposed to narrowly \"grandfather in\" foods with a long history of safe use like salt and vinegar.",
      "\"These GRAS exemptions should be limited. The FDA just expanded the loophole until it just literally swallowed the entire statute,\" he said.",
      "Obstacles in Congress and the courts",
      "Making it mandatory for companies to go through the GRAS notification process before using any new food ingredients will likely face hurdles.",
      "Cracking down on food additives would dramatically broaden the FDA's workload. The agency would have to both screen new notifications as well as look back at previously greenlighted chemicals.",
      "FDA officials have long called for Congress to step up funding for oversight of food additives, warning that resources were stretched thin even with the current duties.",
      "One idea to broaden FDA's funding \u2014 attaching fees to applications submitted by food manufacturers, similar to the \"user fees\" programs for medical products \u2014 has also failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill. Kennedy has also been critical of the \"user fees\" approach for drugs, and has called to undo it.",
      "Another obstacle could come through the courts, especially in light of a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that curtailed agency power.",
      "Advocacy groups lost a previous federal lawsuit against the FDA trying to require the notifications back in 2021. In that case, the judge found that \"it remains unclear under the statute whether FDA even has the authority to make GRAS notifications mandatory.\"",
      "\"I think there are certainly things within FDA's power to narrow the loophole, to make it harder for companies to take advantage of the GRAS process. But there is some legal precedence saying that this is Congress' problem to fix, so we'll just have to see,\" said Benesh.",
      "While Kennedy's team acknowledges the issue may end up needing to be hashed out through legislation on Capitol Hill, changing the procedure solely through the executive branch is on the table, an adviser said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said he is asking Trump to \"declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease\" as another way to supercharge his authorities amid blowback they expect from the food industry.",
      "\"This is not a monolithic, this is not an all-powerful industry. They can be disrupted. So that's what gives me hope. The voters and President Trump's microphone are on our side,\" Means said.",

      "Nationwide rates of emergency room visits for babies with Mycoplasma pneumoniae are on track to surpass rates for school-age children, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, as doctors nationwide are grappling with a surge of \"walking pneumonia\" cases.",
      "The new figures come from the CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program, which gathers data on pneumonia-associated emergency room visits from U.S. hospitals.",
      "While cases had been higher in school-age kids compared to other age groups, rates in babies have surged in recent weeks, and are now tied with older kids. According to the latest CDC data, for the week ending Nov. 2, 7.6% of emergency department pneumonia cases for babies 0-1 years old and children ages 5-17 years old resulted in Mycoplasma pneumoniae diagnoses.",
      "\"These diagnoses dropped a little after August, but remained high through early November. Of note, diagnoses among 0\u20131-year-olds have steadily increased throughout the fall without any subsequent decrease,\" CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, cases largely disappeared. CDC officials had said that this year's wave could be heralding a return to waves of Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases that occurred prior to the pandemic.",
      "But this year's trend has also been unusual, since cases had previously been thought to be common only in school-aged kids, not younger children.",
      "\"While we are seeing right now that it is presenting as a typical respiratory infection, we want to make sure that there isn't something unusual going on with the bacteria itself or the way it's showing up that might give guidance in how to treat and prevent it,\" Dr. Adam Cohen, head of the CDC's pneumonia branch, told Medscape News earlier this month.",
      "According to Reed, while every U.S. region is seeing an increase in Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, the CDC's data suggests that since at least last month \u2014 when several states first began to raise concerns over the surge \u2014 the ERs of three regions specifically are seeing the highest levels of the bacteria.",
      "One is in the South and spans Texas and its neighbors Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The second is in the Midwest and includes Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska. The third is in the Northeast and includes New York and New Jersey.",
      "\"Maybe it's another one of those things that we didn't see, got really suppressed during COVID, and now it's coming back,\" said Dr. Jennifer Nayak, division chief of pediatric infectious disease at Golisano Children's Hospital in New York. \"It just is definitely a really bad year for Mycoplasma.\"",
      "Nayak said that around a quarter of tests from the hospital's microbiology lab have come in positive for the bacteria, which she says is unusually high.",
      "The hospital has also seen an increase in patients needing to be hospitalized for the bacteria and who are battling a range of conditions \u2014 from lung issues to more complicated neurological complications \u2014 though they remain a fraction of overall cases.",
      "\"We've definitely seen more kids on the seriously ill side of the spectrum,\" Nayak said. \"Likely not because the bacteria has changed, but because our rates overall are just higher.\"",
      "She cautioned that while the recent increase has been unusual, there has not been a lot of data tracking the disease, so comparisons to previous waves of the bacteria have been challenging.",
      "\"Our tracking of Mycoplasma infections is suboptimal,\" Nayak said. \"This is not something that is reportable to health departments. It has not, until relatively recently, been closely tracked.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the New York State Department of Health said that it has also tracked a \"marked increase\" in Mycoplasma pneumoniae based on data from the state's emergency rooms, compared to previous years.",
      "While not all pneumonia cases warrant antibiotics, Nayak said testing can be important to give answers for children and their families battling persistent or serious pneumonia cases, as well as to help make decisions about how to treat the infections.",

    "summary": "Canada legalized medically assisted dying in 2016. It was set to expand to patients suffering solely from mental illness last year, but it hasn't \u2014 yet.",
    "story": [
      "When Savannah Meadows had lunch last October with her mother, Sharon Turcott, Meadows was \"all smiles,\" the mother told CBS News.",
      "\"Maybe she's turned a corner,\" Turcott recalled thinking about her daughter, who had been struggling with serious mental illness.",
      "The next morning, she received a scheduled email: \"Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably on my way to heaven,\" it said. Her daughter had taken her own life at the age of 44.",
      "\"She did not want to die by suicide. She did not want to die alone,\" Turcott said.",
      "Instead, Meadows had been seeking a medically assisted death \u2014 something Canada legalized in 2016. It had been set to expand last year to patients who were suffering solely from mental illness, but that expansion was delayed, and Meadows ultimately died by suicide.",
      "The delay has been welcomed by some, but condemned by others.",
      "The history of Canada's, still evolving MAID law",
      "In 2016, Canada enacted a law allowing medical assistance in dying, known as MAID, for people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Under the law, following a process establishing that all eligibility criteria have been met, a physician or nurse either directly administers a substance that induces death or prescribes a drug that the person takes themselves.",
      "Five years later, the law was expanded, no longer requiring a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable as an eligibility criterion for adults with a grievous and irremediable medical condition. Under the changes, individuals suffering solely from mental illness were temporarily excluded for eligibility until March 2023.",
      "Meadows, described by her mother as a proud trans woman, had picked a date and began preparations for the end of her life.",
      "\"It gave me time to accept the fact that my daughter was going to die,\" Turcott said.",
      "A few days before Meadows would potentially have been eligible to seek a medically assisted death, however, the government announced a yearlong delay for the consideration of cases of mental illness. Seven months later, Meadows died by suicide.",
      "The delayed inclusion of patients seeking MAID on the basis of mental illness has been met with apprehension from the start.",
      "Canada's Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness, established to assist in developing the government's approach to the expansion of the law, outlined concerns in a 2022 report, including the daunting task for clinicians asked to make predictions about individual patients and establish incurability and irreversibility despite the difficulties of predicting the evolution of mental disorders.",
      "Another factor was what the report referred to as structural vulnerability, or the risk of factors such as unstable housing or lack of employment opportunities resulting in individuals viewing death as an only option.",
      "The panel offered a number of recommendations in its report for establishing an expanded MAID regime.",
      "The future of the MAID law's expansion, however, is also dependent to some degree on domestic politics, which appear set to shift. Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party is up by a significant margin in polls ahead of national elections set to take place within a year, has vowed to \"revoke entirely\" the expansion of the law to include solely mental health cases, arguing that it blurred a line \"between suicide prevention and suicide  assistance.\"",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to.\"",
      "Since her daughter's death, meanwhile, Turcott has become an advocate for MAID access for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to, and because that's what she wanted, that would have been fine with me,\" Turcott said. \"Suicide was not fine with me.\"",
      "In February, the government further postponed MAID eligibility for patients whose sole condition is mental illness until March 2027 \u2014 four years after it was initially slated to go into effect.",
      "Mark Holland, Canada's Minister of Health, said that while \"significant progress has been made in supporting practitioners in assessing MAID eligibility in complex cases,\" the country's health system was \"not yet ready for MAID where the sole underlying condition is mental illness.\"",
      "The delay has been condemned by some MAID advocates. Dying With Dignity Canada, an organization that advocates for end-of-life rights, filed a lawsuit in August alleging discriminatory exclusion in the law against people with mental illness.",
      "An ongoing debate over access to MAID",
      "Others, however, view the delay as a step to ensure necessary safeguards are in place and health care providers are prepared to handle relevant cases. The Canada Mental Health Association said in a January statement that it supported the postponement, citing what it called insufficient time and resources allocated to ensure that people with mental illnesses can access the necessary care.",
      "Some groups oppose the law's expansion outright. In September, Inclusion Canada, a nonprofit group that advocates for Canadians with intellectual disabilities, filed a lawsuit challenging MAID for people with a disability who are not dying or whose death is not \"reasonably foreseeable.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that MAID Track 2, the 2021 expansion of the law to include patients whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, had already resulted in premature deaths.",
      "\"People are dying. We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty and lack of essential supports,\" Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said in September.",
      "Compounding CMHA and Inclusion Canada's concerns, an expert committee of professionals from disciplines including ethics, social work and medicine that reviewed MAID deaths in Ontario identified cases in which it said isolation and unmet social needs, such as housing, had fueled several euthanasia recipient's requests.",
      "The committee also found that patients seeking eligibility under the expanded Track 2 criteria were about 8% more likely to reside in areas of the province with high levels of social marginalization than MAID Track 1 recipients.",
      "The committee's report acknowledged that while the deaths discussed were not necessarily representative of frequent reasons for accessing MAID Track 2, or even the majority of MAID Track 2 deaths, the themes identified were \"not uncommon within the MAID review process.\"",
      "Out of 4,644 medically assisted deaths carried out during 2023 under Canada's MAID law, only 116 deaths were Track 2 patients, according to the committee.",
      "But the report's findings don't resonate with everyone, and opposition to the law's proposed inclusion of patients who suffer from only mental illness has been deeply frustrating for some people seeking MAID.",
      "Jason, a Toronto resident who didn't want to be fully identified over concerns that his future MAID review process could be affected, is one of those people.",
      "\"When I first heard that it was delayed, my world came crashing down,\" he said.",
      "Jason told CBS News that he's struggled with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for decades, and has attempted suicide twice. He said he's tried inpatient programs, medication, electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine treatment, among other remedies, to little avail.",
      "\"I would not be alive today if there wasn't the possibility of MAID going through in 2027,\" he said, saying the chance of MAID's expansion was the only reason he hadn't attempted suicide a third time.",
      "The current safeguards for those seeking MAID whose death is not reasonably foreseeable include two independent practitioners \u2014 one of whom must have expertise in the condition affecting the patient \u2014 confirming that all eligibility criteria are met, a minimum period of 90 days for eligibility assessments to be made, and the opportunity for the patient to withdraw consent at any point up until the procedure is carried out.",
      "The patient must also be informed of counseling and palliative care options, support for disabilities and mental health, and be offered consultation with relevant professionals in addition to having discussed with their practitioner \"reasonable and available means to relieve the person's suffering, and agree [with the practitioner] that the person has seriously considered these means.\"",
      "In a poll conducted in 2023 by Dying with Dignity Canada, 78% of respondents said they supported the removal of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" natural death requirement from the MAID law, indicating strong support for the Track 2 expansion. But a 2017 survey gauging the attitudes of Canadian psychiatrists toward medical assistance in death found only a minority of 29.4% supported MAID on the basis of mental illness alone, compared to 71.8% who said other factors should also be present to determine eligibility.",
      "Jason said he understood some doctors' opposition to MAID for mental illness.",
      "\"Doctors are there to make you better,\" he said. But he added that as mental illness isn't something that \"shows up on a screen,\" it can be difficult for people without direct experience to understand the extent of someone else's pain.",
      "\"I don't have the physical pain that someone else has, but the psychological pain is just as bad,\" he said.",
      "In 2022, MAID deaths accounted for 4.1% of overall deaths in Canada, with the average age of MAID patients being 77, according to Canada's fourth and most recent annual report on Medical Assistance in Dying. Since the law was introduced in 2016 there have been a total of 44,958 medically assisted deaths in the country.",
      "Jason said he didn't want to put his family through the trauma of another suicide attempt, and that his brother and mother were helping him explore options abroad. Those options, especially for people suffering mental illness, are limited, and often complicated by varying domestic laws around the world.",
      "Jason said that, like Turcott, his own mother is supportive of his choice to seek MAID.",
      "\"As much as she doesn't want me to do this again, she would rather I die properly with the assistance of a doctor than have it done by suicide,\" he said.",
      "Turcott said she was concerned that the postponement of MAID on the basis of mental health would result in more suicides, leaving families to mourn unexpectedly.",
      "\"I don't want anybody to experience the loss of their child through suicide, and their child being so desperate that they saw no other choice but to take their life,\" she said.",

      "Officials suspect wild migrating birds are likely to blame for the first known infection of a flock in Hawaii, which had been the last state in the country with no reported cases in poultry or wild birds during the current outbreak.",
      "Sequencing done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's national lab in Iowa confirmed the infection, federal officials announced Monday.",
      "The specific genotype of the virus that infected the birds is known as A3, said Lyndsay Cole, a spokesperson for the federal Animal Plant Health Inspection Services.",
      "This is different from the B3.13 genotype that has been fueling this year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy and poultry farms and suggests the virus spilled over into the flock in Hawaii from migrating wild birds.",
      "Investigators have not turned up any links so far between the flock and imported animals or travel, a spokesperson for Hawaii's Agriculture Department said. The island has \"strict importing regulations for birds and other animals,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "All the infected birds were housed at the same site, though investigations are ongoing to root out other potential cases. The birds were also not symptomatic until several days after the fair, the state Health Department said, lowering the risk to humans.",
      "\"As the birds were not showing signs of infection at the time of the fair, the likelihood of spreading H5N1 to humans is low. However, out of an abundance of caution, DOH recommends that individuals who attended the fair and touched a duck or goose monitor for influenza-like illness (ILI) and conjunctivitis,\" the state said in a release.",
      "A quarantine order was issued for the property where the birds lived and all will be required to be \"depopulated and the premises cleaned and disinfected,\" the state Agriculture Department said. An order was also issued to prevent any animals from being moved in or out of the site.",
      "At least 10 birds, which included ducks, a goose and a zebra dove, had been reported dead at the property on Nov. 12. Samples from the dead birds were sent to be tested for the virus.",
      "Closely watching for human cases",
      "Confirmation of the infected flock in Hawaii follows a detection of the virus in the area from wastewater samples collected by the state earlier this month.",
      "Health officials around the country have been closely watching for signs of H5N1 spreading in their communities amid mounting cases in humans across North America.",
      "At least 53 cases have been confirmed across seven states so far this year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0says. Most are linked to the B3.13 version of the virus that has been infecting workers at dairy farms and nearby poultry farms in recent months. None of them are known to have been severely ill.",
      "Health officials in Canada announced this month\u00a0that they had detected a case of H5N1 bird flu in a critically ill hospitalized teenager. That patient had been infected by the D1.1 genotype of H5N1, which is related to another ongoing poultry outbreak in British Columbia, the Canadian province where they lived.",
      "Experts say the virus that infected the teenager does appear to have some worrying mutations, which might explain why the case was more severe.",
      "\"The preliminary sequence from the H5N1 human case in British Columbia has been posted and it is not good news,\" Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, posted on Nov. 16.",

      "Kennedy, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said on social media just ahead of the November 5 presidential election that Trump would rid fluoride from the public water supply on his first day in office. Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, has described fluoride as an \"industrial waste\" and linked it to arthritis, neurological deficiencies in children and other serious health problems.",

      "Dental experts have largely refuted such claims. Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0on November 13 that there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years showing that fluoride is both safe, and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",

      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",

    "summary": "There is currently no cure for Parkinson's Disease. But some with Parkinson's are finding that an unusual therapy \u2013 rock climbing \u2013 is helping them improve their balance, mobility, strength and cognition.",
    "story": [
      "We were amazed at what we were seeing on a sweltering summer's day, when a group of people with Parkinson's Disease began rock-climbing on the Carderock Cliffs of Maryland. Yes, rock-climbing!",
      "It's all part of their therapy, says Molly Cupka, the no-nonsense instructor and cheerleader for this community of courageous climbers.",
      "She started this program, called UpENDing Parkinsons, as a non-profit twelve years ago.",
      "\"There's a lot of balance involved, mobility involved, strength, cardio, and then there's the cognitive part, where you have to look at the hold, and figure out how to get your body to move to get to that hold,\" she said.",
      "How often do they fall? \"Falling is definitely part of climbing,\" said Cupka. But they never really fall, because they wear a harness that provides a layer of safety. \"You're always on the rope. You fall, but you don't fall far. We always say if you're not falling, you're not trying hard enough!\"",
      "There's no cure for Parkinson's, which usually affects mobility, coordination, balance, and even speech. Jon Lessin was diagnosed in 2003. He was once an all-around athlete. About 12 years ago he retired as a cardiac anesthesiologist because of Parkinson's. His daughter, Brittany, watched his steady decline, until he discovered climbing walls as high as 60 feet!",
      "\"My dad has a hard time walking across the room, but he can make it to the top of this giant wall,\" Brittany said. \"There's a lot that he's had to give up because of his disease. But this is something that he found through it, which is really cool.\"",
      "Jon said, \"I get to the top and I feel like I've conquered something. And I feel like the wall can't beat me. I can beat the wall.\"",
      "Full disclosure: This story is very personal to me. My late husband, Aaron Latham, had Parkinson's, and boxed as a way to fight the symptoms, as he explained on \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"Boxing's just the opposite of Parkinson's,\" said Latham. \"Everything's designed, instead of to shrink you, everything's designed to pump you up.\"",
      "Jon Lessin said Parkinson's \"makes you feel very small. You make small movements, you're hunched over. And [rock climbing] makes you feel like you can accomplish the world.\"",
      "It was Lessin who first had that big idea to use rock climbing as a therapy for Parkinson's. \"I wanted to do big-movement exercise,\" he said. \"And I found Molly at this gym.\"",
      "Lessin proposed the idea to Molly Cupka, who runs the Sportrock Climbing Center in Alexandria, Virginia. She thought it was worth a try, given the sport requires participants to plan ahead, to know where to position their hands and feet. \"I wish I could go into the brain and see what's happening while people climb,\" Cupka said.",
      "Some people with Parkinson's, like Vivek Puri, get dyskinesia (involuntary jerking motions). Puri said he's usually unaware of his. He runs a home building company in the D.C. area, and was only 38 when he found out he had Parkinson's. \"Fine motor skills have kind of really suffered dramatically,\" he said. \"When I don't climb for some periods of time, I get worse.\"",
      "But once he gets on the wall, he calls himself Spider-Man.",
      "\"Honestly, I climb like a monkey,\" he said. \"I get my finger strength moving, which gets my fine motor skills \u2013 maybe not back, but kind of keeps that in motion.\"",
      "There's no evidence climbing slows the progress of Parkinson's, but Cupka joined forces with Marymount University last year to study patients climbing for the first time. \"We have people literally walking and carrying weights, you know, walking and looking, multitasking,\" she said.",
      "The study found that, in so many words, if you climb, you may walk better.",

      "Mark de Mulder, a musician and former director of the National Geospatial Program, doesn't need a study to prove what climbing does for him. \"It allows me to say, 'All right, take that, Parkinson's! I'm doing this!' It just makes me feel stronger, and I'm fighting it. I'm doing something about it.\"",
      "Many of the climbers have become friends who climb together several times a week; and they've become a support group, Parkinson's Pals, who encourage each other.",
      "\"When I reach the top, I can turn around and look and wave, and see my wife and my friends, and that's the reward,\" said de Mulder. \"It's really wonderful.\"",

      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

    "title": "Trump's proposed tariffs could raise U.S. grocery prices, analysis finds",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:09:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could raise costs for U.S. consumers, economists say. Here's how much grocery bills could rise.",
    "story": [
      "Americans say they continue to feel the aftereffects of the highest inflation in four decades, especially at the grocery store, where prices remain 26% higher than before the pandemic. President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could cause even more financial strain in the nation's food aisles by reigniting price hikes, according to a recent study.",
      "Although it remains to be seen what he does as president, ahead of the Nov. 5 election Trump proposed a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports, as well as a 60% tariff on products from China. Manufacturers and retailers typically pass on at least some of those costs to customers.",
      "As a result, hefty new tariffs could cause prices for a range of consumer goods, from everyday items such as groceries to less frequent purchases like furniture, to rise, according to the\u00a0analysis\u00a0from Third Way, a left-leaning think tank. Trump's tariffs could cause a typical family's annual grocery budget in 2025 to swell by almost $200 next year, which would amount to an increase of more than 3%, according to Third Way.",
      "\"Prices are absolutely going to rise, because the added costs from increased tariffs will be paid by the consumer,\" Gabe Horwitz, senior vice president for the economic program at Third Way, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And those price increases are going to be a lot harder for folks lower down on the income scale.\"",
      "Third Way has been supportive of President Joe Biden's economic policies and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the election.",
      "Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, who is set to be his White House Press secretary, \u00a0disputed the claim that President-elect Trump's policies will boost inflation.",
      "\"In his first term, President Trump instituted tariffs against China that created jobs, spurred investment and resulted in no inflation. President Trump will work quickly to fix and restore an economy that puts American workers by re-shoring American jobs, lowering inflation, raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations and unshackling American energy,\" she said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "To be sure, the timing and magnitude of any new tariffs imposed once Trump takes office is unclear. Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool for negotiating leverage in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "Tariffs are considered a regressive form of taxation, meaning they hit the lowest-income consumers the hardest. That's because low-income families spend a larger share of their budgets on essentials like groceries, versus higher-income earners.",
      "Horwitz and a team of economists put together an approximation of what an average family of four might buy each week at the supermarket, noting that there can be a lot of variation from one family to another. Researchers\u00a0 compared current average prices of\u00a0 groceries with their potential costs if Trump follows through with his proposal for adding tariffs to all imports.",
      "\"We wanted to look specifically at what the tariffs could mean for family budgets,\" Horwitz said.",
      "How much more could groceries cost?",
      "Researchers assumed a weekly trip to the grocery store would include buying coffee, beer, shrimp, beef, bananas, avocados, jam and olive oil.",
      "While these might not be typical purchases for all families, researchers focused on regularly consumed goods for which the U.S. relies heavily on imports, or does not produce domestically at all.",
      "Trump's tariffs would likely cause families to spend at least $3.57 more on such groceries each week, adding up to an additional $185 per year, or an increase of 3.3%, according to the Third Way analysis. The price hikes would apply to each of the eight items on the sample grocery list.",
      "Big-box store prices",
      "Consumers could also end up paying more for items bought less frequently at big-box retail stores like Walmart and Target, Third Way found.",
      "One U.S. company is already responding to the proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden says it plans to import fewer goods made in China to the U.S., and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "\"We have been planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly,\" CEO Edward Rosenfeld told analysts on a recent earnings call. \"We've worked hard over a multiyear period to develop our factory base and our sourcing capability in alternative countries, like Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, etc.\"",
      "Families could end up paying an additional $551 per year at big-box stores, with their spending rising 14% from $3,754 to $4,305, according to Third Way's research.",
      "Big-box store purchases would rise more dramatically in cost because more goods sold at these types of stores are imported from China.",
      "\"If you take Trump at his word, the sheer cost of tariffs for low-income families is astronomical,\" Horwitz said.",
      "Imposing steep new tariffs on other countries could raise economic costs in another way \u2014 by inviting tit-for-tat levies on U.S. exports. Oxford Economics on Thursday forecast that the Trump administration would impose blanket tariffs of 30% on all Chinese imports and that Beijing would retaliate.",
      "\"Tariffs are a two-way street, and the more aggressive tariffs on China will lead to a larger retaliation,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"We assume China will impose 25% tariffs on all U.S. exports, though with exemptions for electronic products.\"",
      "Oxford also expects the U.S. to hit Japan with 10% on metals and cars, leading to reciprocal tariffs on the same U.S. exports.",

      "Yet cryptocurrency markets remain a wild place and what comes next is impossible to know. And while some are bullish, other experts are warning of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now but have come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \"digital alternative\" to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "Trump's election win boosts crypto",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. election.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who was once critical of digital currencies,\u00a0pledged during his campaign\u00a0against Vice President Kamala Harris to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to create a bitcoin \"strategic reserve.\" His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for. Trump also had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "Spot bitcoin ETFs",
      "Digital assets like bitcoin had posted notable gains in the months ahead of the election, mostly due to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.\u00a0 Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency\u00a0exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\" Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a research note two weeks ago. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Bitcoin volatility",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. Experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "How bitcoin mining works",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \"mining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth's Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin's electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:07:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy say the Department of Government Efficiency has targets in mind for cost cutting.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are sharing details about how their newly created Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 which isn't an official government department \u2014 plans to take aim at paring federal spending, with the two writing in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Wednesday that they are aiming to cut $500 billion in annual spending.",
      "The announcement of DOGE has raised a host of questions, from whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal spending, typically controlled by Congress, as well as the group's powers and how it will operate. Musk and Ramaswamy provided answers to some of those questions in their opinion piece, arguing that President-elect Donald Trump has the authority to cut spending authorized by Congress.",
      "While Musk and Ramaswamy said they \"expect to prevail\" in cutting costs, there have been plenty of examples throughout the decades of efforts aimed at reining in federal spending, which have had only limited results. For instance, President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s tapped businessman J. Peter Grace to recommend reforms, resulting in about 2,500 recommendations for cutting spending, most of which were never implemented.",
      "Musk has suggested slicing $2 trillion in annual federal spending, an amount experts say is unrealistic given that most of the nation's $6.7 trillion in yearly outlays is spent on Social Security, Medicare and the military.",
      "But in the Wednesday opinion piece, Musk and Ramaswamy wrote that their initial aim will be to cut \"the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Where will Musk's DOGE aim to cut federal spending?",
      "Two-thirds of federal spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "But as mentioned above, Musk and Ramaswamy said they'll target $500 billion in spending that is unauthorized by Congress, as well as programs they believe aren't in line with lawmakers' intentions.",
      "The biggest source of expired authorizations sits with health care for veterans, which cost $119 billion in fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "However, Musk and Ramaswamy didn't single out veterans' health care as a place where they'd seek to cut. Instead, they listed the following areas:",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which receives $535 million a year\u00a0International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grantsPlanned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",

      "International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grants",
      "Planned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",
      "Which federal programs don't have authorization?",
      "The programs mentioned by Musk and Ramaswamy are relatively tiny compared with other areas that are unauthorized, such as veterans' health care.",
      "The next biggest sources of expired authorizations, after veterans' health care, include programs that invest in opioid treatment, the State Department and housing assistance. Some smaller programs with expired funding include Head Start, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. The latter provides weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring, among other tasks.",
      "According to Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that was developed by the Heritage Foundation to guide the next conservative White House, the NOAA \"should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated.\"",
      "DOGE wants to cut federal workers. Here's how.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy also underscored that they'll push to cut the ranks of federal employees, saying their efforts could lead to \"mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.\" The pair didn't enumerate the number of workers they'll seek to push out of the federal workforce.",
      "In 2023, there were more than 2 million federal employees, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group focused on the federal government. Most of those workers are within Veterans Affairs, due to a large number of health care providers for the VA, followed by people enlisted in the armed services, its data shows.",
      "While civil service workers have job protections, Musk and Ramaswamy argued that the president would be legally allowed to enact \"reductions in force\" that don't target specific workers, as well as to make decisions including \"large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area.\"",
      "The DOGE would help federal employees \"transition into the private sector,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote. \"The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit.\"",
      "The pair also said they want to require federal workers to be in the office five days a week, a policy change that they predict would \"result in a wave of voluntary terminations.\"",
      "In a Thursday post on X, the social media service owned by Elon Musk, the DOGE wrote, \"Federal government agencies are using, on average, just 12% of the space in their DC headquarters.  The Department of Agriculture, with space for more than 7,400 people, averaged 456 workers each day (6% occupancy).\"",
      "It added, \"Why are American taxpayer dollars being spent to maintain empty buildings?\"",
      "How much do federal workers earn?",
      "Pay varies by department and seniority, with the federal government publishing a General Schedule of basic pay grades for most federal employees. For 2024, the lowest pay grade was about $22,000 in annual earnings, while the highest was about $160,000. Some agencies offer competitive salaries to compete with the private sector. Pay may also vary by location.",
      "Federal employees are located in every state, with 80% located outside the Washington, D.C. area, according to the Partnership for Public Service.",
      "Workers at the Administrative Conference of the United States, an independent federal agency charged with identifying improvements for federal agencies to protect public interests, have the highest median salary, at about $242,000, according to federal data.

      "The promotion, aimed at foreigners disenchanted with their day-to-day lives, offers residences for as low as just \u20ac1, or about $1. By incentivizing Americans and others to move overseas and spend money renovating property and patronizing local businesses, the offer, in turn, serves to boost the area's own economy. Ollolai occupies roughly 7,000 acres in the Barbagia province in Sardinia.",
      "\"Are you worned [sic] out by global politics? Looking to embrace a more balanced lifestyle while securing new opportunities? It's time to start building your European escape in the stunning paradise of Sardinia,\" reads the advertisement on a website dedicated to recruiting foreigners to live in Ollolai.",
      "Available homes in the small Italian village range from \u20ac1 to \u20ac100,000, according to the website. It's one of several rural Italian territories that have tried to revive their economies as their populations age and as younger generations see little in the way of opportunity at home.",
      "But there's a catch. The homes being practically given away typically require significant renovation and upkeep, and can end up costing buyers far more than the single-digit price tag would indicate.",
      "Ollolai appears to sense an opportunity in the post-U.S. election climate. Indeed, citizenship consultancies and migration firms that help people move abroad report receiving an uptick inquiries following November 5.",
      "That said, the realities of uprooting one's life and moving abroad can be more complicated than they might seem on the surface.",
      "And though the offer is open to foreigners from other countries, too, Ollolai is specifically targeting Americans, according to its Mayor Francesco Columbu.",
      "\"We just really want, and will focus on, Americans above all,\" Columbu told CNN. \"We can't of course ban people from other countries to apply, but Americans will have a fast-track procedure. We are betting on them to help us revive the village, they are our winning card.\"",
      "Columbu was not immediately reachable for comment Wednesday.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 09:44:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA says America's food supply is still \"one of the safest in the world,\" despite some recent high-profile recalls and outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that the U.S. food supply is still \"one of the safest in the world,\" in the wake of a number of foodborne disease outbreaks affecting items ranging from organic carrots to deli meats to McDonald's Quarter Pounders. E. coli, listeria and other contaminants have sickened thousands of people and forced a number of recalls in recent months.",
      "But despite those high-profile examples, data cited by the FDA suggest recalls were not unusually high this past year.",
      "For the fiscal year that ended in September, there were 179 recalls deemed by the agency's food and cosmetics arm as being for the highest-risk classification of issues, like potential contamination with bacteria or undeclared allergens.",
      "That's up from 145 high-risk recalls in 2023, but less than the 185 the agency recorded in 2022. There were 167 high-risk recalls in 2019.",
      "This classification includes the recall of tens of thousands of cases of onions processed by Taylor Farms that were pulled earlier this fall, after officials suspected they were to blame for a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounder burgers that has sickened more than a hundred people.",
      "\"Our ultimate goal is for industry to do their part to ensure that the foods they introduce into the market are not adulterated or misbranded. Recalls help get the food off the market quickly when something goes wrong. Outbreak advisories provide important food safety information to the public,\" an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson also pointed to The Economist's report measuring global food security. The U.S. food supply is \"one of the safest in the world\" and ranked \"joint first for the food safety indicator in 2022,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In fact, the FDA suggested, the number of recalls is an indicator that the safety system is working.",
      "\"The occurrence of recalls and outbreaks means that manufacturers, importers and distributors are monitoring for issues and taking action when they detect a problem,\" the FDA spokesperson said.",
      "An increase in illnesses in CDC data \u2014 but also an increase in testing",
      "Figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest the number of high-profile recalls have increased from last year, though not by much.",
      "So far this year, 10 \"multistate foodborne outbreak notices\" have been issued by the CDC. Last year there were nine notices. There were 24 notices issued in 2018, the most of any year over the past decade.",
      "Infections from foodborne outbreak culprits like Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, or STEC, have climbed to at least 13,962 this year, CDC records tally.",
      "Around 13,140 had been reported by health departments around this time last year and 12,119 were reported by this time in 2019.",
      "Foodborne illnesses linked to other germs have also climbed across the country in recent years, reports by the CDC's FoodNet system suggest, though improvements in how patients are tested for these germs may help explain some of the increase.",
      "\"Laboratory technology changes and that impacts what we see in the surveillance data. When laboratory testing gets faster, it gets more specific, it gets better in other ways. It makes the data a little bit less comparable,\" Sharon Shea, senior director of food safety at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told CBS News.",
      "Shea, who has also worked as a microbiologist in hospital laboratories as well as public health labs, said other ways that public health departments and doctors respond to foodborne outbreaks have gotten better as well.",
      "Some of that is a time-saving shift towards \"molecular-based\" panel tests that can be run by hospitals and clinical labs for an array of germs, instead of one-off tests for specific pathogens, that were rolled out after 2012.",
      "Labs in the PulseNet network helmed by the CDC have also switched to \"whole genome sequencing,\" Shea said \u2014 a more accurate approach to narrowing down the unique genetic fingerprint that can link different cases together for investigators. Those connections can be crucial for uncovering common foods eaten by sick people in an outbreak.",
      "\"The most preventable, needless deaths\"",
      "Food safety advocates outside the government say the U.S. still has plenty of room for improvement in food safety.",
      "\"It doesn't help to say 'Americans have the safest food in the world' when people are dying from baby carrots,\" said Sarah Sorscher, head of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Sorscher acknowledged that public health departments have gotten better at investigating outbreaks, but cautioned that still only a fraction of foodborne illnesses are solved.",
      "\"Our public health system is getting better at solving outbreaks thanks to advances in whole genome sequencing and artificial intelligence, so it may be that we are just seeing more of the iceberg now than we did a few years ago,\" she said.",
      "Staffing shortages and breakdowns in food safety had also led to an artificial dip in the number of recalls and reported illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sorscher said.",
      "\"Our food supply is not as safe as it was even five years ago. Anyone who's gone to the grocery store or rifled through their refrigerator to see which onions and carrots in the produce drawer are the subject of the latest recall knows that,\" said Scott Faber, senior vice president for government relations at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Faber pointed to a previous report tracking a rebound in food recalls after 2020, based on data from the FDA as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Inspections by the FDA of food facilities are falling short of a congressional mandate, the Environmental Working Group has argued. They have also criticized the agency for not requiring testing of irrigation water sprayed on crops, which can pose a contamination risk from nearby animal feeding operations.",
      "\"Not unlike washing your hands or not cutting your vegetables on the same cutting board as your chicken, they're just common sense measures to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. And these are the most preventable, needless deaths imaginable,\" said Faber.",

      "To demonstrate this, Meerdo took a video of investigative reporter Brian New to create a deepfake of Elon Musk.",
      "These AI-generated videos are hardly perfect, but they just need to be convincing enough to deceive an unsuspecting victim.",
      "\"If you are really trying to scam people, I think you can do some really bad things with this,\" Meerdo said.",
      "How can you spot a deepfake?",
      "Some deepfakes are easier to spot than others; there can be signs like unnatural lip movements or odd body language. But as the technology improves, it will get harder to tell just by looking.",
      "There are a growing number of websites claiming they can detect deepfakes. Using three known deepfake videos and three authentic ones, the CBS News Texas I-Team put five of these websites to an unscientific test: Deepware, Attestiv, DeepFake-O-Meter, Sensity and Deepfake Detector.",
      "In total, these five online tools correctly identified the tested videos nearly 75% of the time. The I-Team reached out to the companies with the results; their responses are below.",
      "Deepware",
      "Deepware, a website that's free to use, initially failed to flag two of the fake videos the I-Team tested. In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",
      "The frequently asked questions section of Deepware's website states: \"Deepfakes are not a solved problem yet. Our results indicate the likelihood of a specific video being a deepfake or not.\"",
      "Deepfake Detector",
      "Deepfake Detector, a tool that charges $16.80 per month, identified one of the fake videos as \"97% natural voice.\" The company, which specializes in spotting AI-generated voices, said in an email that factors like background noise or music can impact results, but it has an accuracy rate of approximately 92%.",
      "In response to a question about guidance for average consumers, the company wrote: \"Our tool is designed to be user-friendly. Average consumers can easily upload an audio file on our website or use our browser extension to analyze content directly. The tool will provide an analysis to help determine if a video may contain deepfake elements using probabilities, making it accessible even for those unfamiliar with AI technology.\"",
      "Attestiv",
      "Attestiv flagged two of the real videos as \"suspicious.\" According to the company's CEO Nicos Vekiarides, false positives can be triggered by factors like graphics and edits. Both authentic videos flagged as \"suspicious\" included graphics and edits. The site offers a free service, but it also has a paid tier, where consumers can adjust settings and calibrations for more in-depth analysis.",
      "While he acknowledges that Attestiv isn't perfect, Vekiarides said that as deepfakes become harder to spot with the naked eye, these kinds of websites are needed as part of the solution.",
      "\"Our tool can determine if something is suspicious, and then you can verify it with your own eyes to say, 'I do think that's suspicious,'\" Vekiarides said.",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter is another free tool supported by the University of Buffalo and the National Science Foundation. It identified two of the real videos as having a high percentage of being AI-generated.",
      "In an email, the creator of the open platform said a limitation of deepfake detection models is that video compression can lead to sync issues with video and audio and inconsistent mouth movements.",
      "In response to a question about how everyday users can use the tool, the company emailed: \"Currently, the main result shown to users is the probability value of this sample being a generated sample across different detection models. This can be used as a reference if multiple models agree on the same answer with confidence (e.g., over 80% for AI-generated or below 20% for real video). We are currently developing a more understandable way of showing the results, as well as new models that can output comprehensive detection results.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:10:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Some voters are hoping President-elect Donald Trump may send out another stimulus check. Here's what the experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump in his first term as president sent out two stimulus checks to millions of Americans during the pandemic, part of the federal government's goal of keeping consumers financially afloat during the crisis. Now, some social media posts are claiming that Trump, once he takes office next year, may issue another check \u2014 a likelihood that experts say is extremely slim.",
      "Posts on TikTok are suggesting Trump might issue another round of checks, while on X, some users are questioning if they're in line for a payment.",
      "When the COVID-19 health emergency shuttered the economy in 2020, millions of Americans lost their jobs, sending the jobless rate to almost 15% and causing financial hardship for many. As a result, Trump signed two bills that sent stimulus checks to eligible households, while President Biden authorized a third.",
      "Even though many Americans feel the economy is faring badly, with some pointing to the impact of the pandemic's high inflation, the U.S. isn't anywhere close to the situation of the early 2020s, economists say.",
      "\"Stimulus checks typically only happen when the economy is in really bad shape and consumers need a push to start spending money again,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not really the case in the present.\"",
      "Is the economy bad enough for a new stimulus check?",
      "While a majority of Americans give the economy poor ratings, economists say that it's in good shape overall, with solid GDP growth, inflation that is inching closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal and a jobless rate of 4.1% \u2014 which is near a 50-year low.",
      "\"Despite some pain points and general 'bad vibes' expressed by some people, the economy is currently in remarkably good shape and consumer spending is relatively strong,\" Channel said.",
      "Even so, many inflation-weary consumers say they haven't yet seen the benefit of that growth. The November 5 presidential election was viewed as a mandate from voters for a new economic direction.",
      "Could Trump issue a stimulus check?",
      "While some consumers might believe that Trump or Biden alone was responsible for sending out stimulus checks \u2014 perhaps because Trump put his name on the memo line of the first check \u2014 the payments were part of three bills passed by Congress, which were then sent to the sitting president for his signature.",
      "\"A president can't unilaterally issue stimulus checks, and the ones sent out during his last administration were largely the result of a push from Democrats in the House and Senate,\" Channel noted. \"Though Trump ultimately did sign the bill that sent stimulus checks to Americans, he isn't solely responsible for them.\"",
      "In other words, there would first need to be legislation passed by Congress to authorize another stimulus check, something that currently isn't on the horizon.",
      "Would a stimulus check impact inflation?",
      "With the Federal Reserve still aiming to pare inflation to a 2% annual rate \u2014 it stood at 2.6% last month \u2014 policymakers are likely to be cautious about any actions that could reignite inflation. Some economists have pointed to the surge in federal spending during the pandemic as\u00a0helping to create the conditions that led to the hottest inflation in 40 years.",
      "\"Because inflation is still such a big concern at the moment, the last thing a reasonable government would want to do is further stimulate consumer demand with stimulus checks because doing so would unnecessarily risk causing a resurgence in inflation,\" Channel noted.",
      "That being said, Trump's economic policies, including adding tariffs to imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could cause an inflation bump of as much of 1 percentage point, economists have said. That would push inflation to a range of about 3.6%, which Wall Street cautions could cause the Fed to hold off on further rate cuts.",
      "Could the IRS issue stimulus checks in 2024?",
      "The IRS sent the three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks after they were authorized by Congress and signed into law by Trump and Biden. In other words, without Congress' approval, the IRS won't be sending any stimulus checks in 2024.",
      "Currently there is no legislation in the works for stimulus spending, and such legislation is also considered extremely unlikely to occur in 2025. Instead, Trump and Republican lawmakers are likely to focus on tax legislation to extend the tax cuts in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as well as tackling other spending issues, experts say.",

    "story": [
      "Thanksgiving dinner ingredients will cost more this year compared with last, even as food inflation cools. Fortunately, there's one simple way to save money without skimping on staple dishes for the food-driven holiday: store brands.",
      "Buying store-brand items versus national brand products is an age-old technique for saving money. And although there are instances of store-brand goods costing more than their name-brand counterparts, they can still save consumers money overall, new research from Wells Fargo\u00a0shows.",
      "How much can I save on store brands?",
      "\"Food inflation has slowed dramatically, but it's still not cheaper than a year ago, so that's a bone of contention from consumers,\" Wells Fargo chief agricultural economist Dr. Michael Swanson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, grocery stores can undercut national brand prices by selling their own version of products from tissues to baked beans. Stores allege their products are equally good, but because they don't market them, they can sell them at a relative discount.",
      "\"The whole premise is that store brand represents a value to you. What store brand is supposed to bring is the same quality, same product, without all the marketing,\" Swanson said. \"Brands explain why you should eat theirs and not someone else's, whereas stores don't spend money and are supposed to pass the savings along to us, the consumers.\"",
      "This year, a store-brand Thanksgiving menu for 10 people, including turkey, stuffing, salad, cranberries, dinner rolls and pumpkin pie will cost consumers $73. That same menu made with name-brand products, will cost $90 this year, or $17 more, according to the Wells Fargo report.",
      "The $73 price tag is up 2.7% from last year.",
      "Keep your eye on all items \u2014 not just the turkey",
      "Grocers tend to run promotions on turkeys around Thanksgiving, given that they're such a seasonal purchase \u2014 the two-week window before the Thanksgiving holiday is when grocers make the bulk of their whole turkey sales.",
      "But buyers beware: Some retailers can lure you into the store with a deal on a turkey, only to sell you other items at high prices.",
      "\"Retailers will feature discounts on turkey to get you into store so that, while you're there, you'll pick up everything else,\" Swanson said. \"Make sure you don't just go in for the turkey and not pay attention to prices of other things on the shopping list, which can add up to a lot of money.\"",
      "Store-brand stuffing mixes are still priced high, but are an opportunity for savings nevertheless. Name-brand stuffing is up 9% compared with the same period last year, and store-brand stuffing is up 3%.",
      "Cranberries are an outlier this season. It's a category in which the name-brand product is priced lower than the store-brand alternative. A 12-ounce bag of name-brand fresh cranberries is down 3% compared with 2023, while the same-size bag of store-brand cranberries is up 6%.",

    "summary": "Americans struggling to stay financially afloat should consider debt relief before tapping into retirement accounts, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "No one wants to file for bankruptcy, but if you're heading in that direction, delaying the inevitable may only make things worse.",
      "Bankruptcies are still significantly below pre-pandemic levels, but have gone up relative to last year. Personal bankruptcies were up\u00a016% in October from a year ago, as more Americans are seeking debt relief. But those struggling to stay financially afloat should consider the option sooner rather than later, advise experts who study when and why people file.",
      "\"When a consumer feels financial pressure, the last thing on their mind is seeking bankruptcy protection,\" said Michael Hunter, vice president, business development, at Epiq Aacer, a provider of bankruptcy information and partner to the American Bankruptcy Institute, or ABI. Most people don't file until 18 to 24 months after they've incurred financial hardship, Hunter said.",
      "Researchers, over decades of interviewing thousands of people who've declared personal bankruptcy, have found that about two-thirds of individual filers struggle with paying their debts for up to five years before seeking help.",
      "\"The common response is people are struggling with their debt for more than two years\" before seeking a legal remedy, Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"People misunderstand bankruptcy and wait too long to see a bankruptcy lawyer. Most people would benefit by going earlier,\" said Lawless, a co-principal investigator in the Consumer Bankruptcy\u00a0Project, launched in 1981 by a group of academics including Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a law school professor at the time.",
      "When to file for bankruptcy",
      "Because of the stigma and shame that Americans attach to bankruptcy, people turn to it as a last resort \u2014 oftentimes after they have plowed through retirement funds and other assets that would be have been shielded from creditors by filing for debt relief.",
      "\"If you are raiding pension or other retirement assets, that is a red flag,\" said Lawless, noting those funds are protected from creditors in bankruptcy. Borrowing money to cover current expenses is another warning sign, he offered.",
      "\"It makes sense to file if a creditor is going to be able to take away something you need,\" said Pamela Foohey, a professor of law at the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens. \"If a person is dealing with a wage garnishment that is harming their lives, or if a lender is threatening to repossess your car. If there's no other way to get a car that will fit your budget, filing could be a way to keep your car, or keep your house.\"",
      "Otherwise the broad answer is to first address how they might solve the cause of their financial distress before filing for bankruptcy. \"It doesn't help to find a better-paying job if after bankruptcy more is going out than coming in,\" said Lawless.",
      "\"If you lost your job, file after you found a new job; if you have a health crisis, you file after you've gotten better to discharge all of the medical debt that you've racked up,\" said Foohey.",
      "If someone undergoes a change in their family situation, whether it's a divorce or the birth of twins, she advises that they first figure out how they're going to manage going forward on a budget\u00a0after the debt is discharged.",
      "\"Bankruptcy does one thing, it gets rid of debt. It doesn't find you a job, it doesn't put money in your pocket,\" said Lawless.",
      "Also, legally speaking, once debt is discharged or a financial repayment plan is approved by a judge, it will be another 5 to 8 years before one can file again.",
      "Chapter 7 versus Chapter 13",
      "It costs about $1,500 to file Chapter 7, and most attorneys require that their fees be paid upfront. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, where one's nonexempt property and assets \u2014 possessions not protected by bankruptcy \u2014 are turned over to a trustee, and debt is discharged in 3 to 6 months. According to Lawless, 95% of Chapter 7 don't have any assets to turn over.",
      "With a Chapter 13, payments can be spread out, however the overall cost is a lot more.",
      "Having to hire and pay an attorney several thousands dollars is also a daunting prospect for those in financial turmoil, but Lawless said a lawyer is a better option than filing for bankruptcy yourself or looking to consumer credit counseling \u2014 a service that is typically for-profit and has a long history of problems.",
      "\"In Chapter 13, attorneys can allow for nothing upfront, put all their fees in the repayment plan, and on average charge $4,500,\" Foohey said.",
      "According to Foohey, only about a third of those who file Chapter 13 make it to the end and have their debts discharged. \"Not everyone wants the discharge, but to reset their relationship with their mortgage holder,\" she said.",
      "A Chapter 13 involves committing to a 3- to 5-year repayment plan. However, many filers that enter the agreements don't complete them, Lawless relayed. \"Homeowners will file 13 so they don't lose their home. It's among the tools used to get caught up on mortgage payments,\" he said.",
      "Attorneys charge far less for Chapter 7, as it's a less-complicated process than a Chapter 13. The latter is used for, but a bad idea, to pay for one's bankruptcy.",
      "\"In 7, you have to pay for your bankruptcy upfront. In Chapter 13 you pay your attorney in that 3- to 5-year plan,\" said Lawless. \"If you're using 13 to pay your attorney feels that is generally the wrong choice.\"",
      "In Lawless' view, \"the number one thing Congress should do is make it possible to pay your Chapter 7 attorney over time, so we don't have people filing Chapter 13 when they don't need to.\"",
      "Return to pre-COVID numbers",
      "Personal bankruptcy filings averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but dropped off a cliff during the pandemic, thanks to government aid.",
      "\"It was very consistent from 2014 to 2019 \u2014 pretty flat, and then the pandemic hit. A lot of us thought volumes would surge,\" said Epiq's Hunter. But there was forbearance for student loans, cars and mortgages, he noted.",
      "\"Banks were extending olive branches, and we saw bankruptcies plummet to less than half of pre-pandemic levels,\" he said.",
      "\"There was a lot of money sloshing around,\" said Lawless, citing government stimulus programs and other aid. \"People paid down their debt,\" he stated.",
      "Now, with those financial lifelines largely unplugged, U.S. households are tacking more debt onto household balance sheets. \"The biggest surprise is bankruptcy filings haven't gone up even more,\" said Lawless, who expects a return to pre-COVID levels.",
      "Nonbusiness bankruptcy filings fell to under 400,000 before edging back up to 434,000 in 2023, according to statistics published by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. With two months left in 2024, personal bankruptcy filings stood at 405,132 at the end of October.",
      "\"We're still pretty far away from the filing numbers of 2019,\" said Foohey. \"There was a drastic drop at the time of the pandemic that continued for several years, which is now returning to pre-pandemic levels.\"",

      "\"I think we'll make a bunch of money on the tariffs,\" Lutnick said, \"but mostly, everybody else is going to negotiate with us, and we will be more fair.\"",
      "Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",

On 9/11, Cantor Fitzgerald lost about two-thirds of its New York-based workforce in the terrorist attacks, 658 employees in all, including Lutnick's brother. Lutnick survived the attack because he was late to work that day, dropping off his young son at his first day of school. In the years since the attack, Lutnick and the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund have donated $180 million to 9/11 families, according to Trump's social media post on Lutnick's selection.",
      "Lutnick, who is also a cryptocurrency enthusiast, was also under consideration for treasury secretary, a role that has been at the center of high-profile jockeying within the Trump world. At the same time, the treasury position is closely watched in financial circles, where a disruptive nominee could have immediate negative consequences on the stock market, which Trump watches closely.",

      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

    "story": [
      "H&R Block and Intuit shares dropped on Tuesday after the Washington Post reported that President-elect Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, which is run by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is looking at developing a free app for people to file their taxes.",
      "The publication cited two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, in reporting that the leaders of the incoming administration's DOGE discussed the idea of crafting a mobile app to file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "H&R Block shares tumbled 8.2%, while Intuit shed 5.1% on Tuesday. As the dominant players in tax preparation, H&R Block and Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, generate billions in revenue annually by offering online and in-person services.",
      "The Biden Administration in March rolled out a pilot Direct File program through the IRS in 12 states. It allows qualified taxpayers file directly through a federal portal. Additionally, the IRS provides services through its Free File program for those who made an adjusted gross income of $79,000 or less.",
      "More than 100,000 taxpayers used the new Direct File program to file their taxes this year, which marked the first time the system was in operation, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "The DOGE, which has been directed by Trump to slash government spending and cut federal regulations, criticized the complexity of the U.S tax code in a Nov. 16 post on X, the social media service owned by Musk.",
      "\"In 1955, there were less than 1.5 million words in the U.S. Tax Code.   Today, there are more than 16 million words,\" its X account wrote. \"Because of this complexity, Americans collectively spend 6.5 billion hours preparing and filing their taxes each year.\"",
      "Intuit and H&R Block also have free filing options.",
      "That said, the Federal Trade Commission earlier in the year barred Intuit from advertising its popular TurboTax product as free when most people have to pay to use it. The FTC in February filed an administrative complaint against H&R Block, alleging it marketed its tax-prep products as free yet deleted the data as a way to pressure them to pay for pricier services. Both companies said they'd appeal.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 09:45:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by persuading average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014\u00a0 Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by persuading average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\"My father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\"",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry's best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer's brand, led today by Pauline Frommer, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy - stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants - changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\" That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn't hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship.",
      "The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn't visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer's guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer's advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks.",
      "\"It was really pioneering stuff,\" Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \"that would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I've got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\"",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\"",
      "Frommer guides reborn",
      "The concept no longer made sense when hotels couldn't be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire didn't disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer - in a David vs. Goliath triumph - got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\"I never dreamed at my age I'd be working this hard,\" he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show.",
      "He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony posts. And he coined the phrase \"Trump Slump\" in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president the first time.",
      "Depression-era roots",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight.",
      "Eventually, he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe\" and, a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece and distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after, he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day,\" was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Frommer eventually gave up law to write the guides full-time.",
      "Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Dispelling false impressions",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \"most Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. ... And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\"",
      "He added: \"We were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn't have to be well-heeled.\"",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \"I fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\" he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \"It's wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\"",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer's survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren.",

      "Spirit has entered into a restructuring agreement\u00a0with its bondholders in order to reduce the airline's debt and provide it with increased financial flexibility, Spirit said in an open letter to customers Monday. The longterm aim, Spirit said, is to provide its guests \"with enhanced travel experiences and greater value.\"",
      "The airline, known for its bargain fares, said it expects to emerge from bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2025, \"even better positioned to deliver the best value in the sky.\"",
      "Industry experts attribute Spirit's financial woes in part to changing consumer preferences as they\u00a0demand more amenities while flying.",
      "\"We can clearly see that consumer preferences have changed in favor of a more premium product, and the low-cost airlines are struggling,\" Jungho Suh, management professor at George Washington University School of Business told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They don't want to see any added costs, they want an all-in, full-service offering.\"",
      "What if I am booked on a Spirit flight?",
      "Spirit plainly states that customers with existing reservations can still use their tickets. Their flight credits and loyalty points are also still valid, and can be redeemed as usual. Customers may also make new reservations for future travel.",
      "\"The most important thing to know is that you can continue to book and fly now and in the future,\" the airline said.",
      "Additionally, Spirit customers can still benefit from the airline's Free Spirit loyalty program, as well as accrue and redeem Saver$ Club perks and credit card terms.",
      "Schedule modifications",
      "That said, industry experts advise customers to keep a close eye on their upcoming bookings. That includes updating their contact information so that the airline can reach them with modifications to their flights.",
      "\"Make sure your contact information is up to date, and keep an eagle eye on your reservations,\" Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy \u2014 a site focused on airline deals and travel rewards \u2014 told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There's no need to panic, Kelly said, but the airline is expected to trim its schedule, which could result in your flight time changing, or being canceled.",
      "\"They're not going to stop flying tomorrow, but inevitably they're going to emerge an even smaller airline after this process, so that means there are going to be some hiccups with routes,\" he said.",
      "Aviation industry consultant Robert Mann said some consumers who were accustomed to flying Spirit out of major airports may have to fly out of a smaller hub, as Spirit withdraws from major hubs served by legacy carriers.",
      "\"You could see that happen where Spirit decided to compete, and has now decided it wasn't such a good idea,\" he said.",
      "What will happen to airfares?",
      "Spirit and other low-cost carriers have helped depress airfares, even for consumers who don't fly on budget airlines.",
      "\"Whether you like them or not, having ultra low-cost carriers is good for our overall aviation ecosystem and good for consumers, even if you never buy them,\" Kelly said.",
      "Spirit will emerge a smaller airline, which means there will be fewer low-cost flights on most routes, and airfares could rise across the board.",
      "\"The smaller Spirit is and the less routes they serve, the less pressure there will be on other airlines in those markets, resulting in overall higher fares,\" Kelly said. \"This isn't good for consumers. There's no positive side to this.\"",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s concerns about the health effects of fluoride may already be helping some Americans \u2014 investors in dental services companies.",
      "Shares in Dentsply Sirona, Envista, Henry Schein Patterson Companies, and other providers of dental products are jumping, with Wall Street betting that a potential push by the incoming Trump administration to remove fluoride from the nation's drinking water could spur demand for the companies' services.",
      "Kennedy, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said on social media just ahead of the November 5 presidential election that Trump would rid fluoride from the public water supply on his first day in office. Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, has described fluoride as an \"industrial waste\" and linked it to arthritis, neurological deficiencies in children and other serious health problems.",
      "\"The thought here is RFK will bring to HHS a voice that is in favor of reducing, or eliminating, the amount of fluoridation that is added to drinking water,\" Don Bilson, Gordon Haskett's head of event-driven research, told investors in a report, according to\u00a0NBC News. \"This will, in turn, lead to an acceleration of tooth decay and more dental visits.\"",
      "Dental experts have largely refuted such claims. Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0on November 13 that there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years showing that fluoride is both safe, and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",
      "According to\u00a0KFF Health News, some studies have linked fluoride exposure among pregnant women to a higher risk of childhood neurobehavioral problems and lower IQs, leading experts to call for further research.",
      "Fluoride is a mineral that keeps teeth healthy and reduces\u00a0cavities\u00a0by protecting them against bacteria that produces potentially damaging acid, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To prevent tooth decay, the U.S. has been adding a small quantity of fluoride to water since the 1950s.",

    "story": [
      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",
      "Bestar did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "Bestar purchased Bush Industries in 2020, with both brands now operating under a corporate parent, eSolutions Furniture Group, which was established in 2021 and is based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.

      "In a letter first reported by ProPublica and dated Nov. 8, state public health commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey said whoever shared the information violated state law and a confidential agreement signed by committee members. An agency investigation wasn't able to identify the leaker.",
      "ProPublica reported in September\u00a0that internal reports showed the Georgia Maternal Mortality Review Committee determined the deaths of two women were preventable, but found that doctors were hesitant to perform a procedure that could have saved their lives because of the state's strict abortion policies.",
      "ProPublica said the dismissal of the board members came as a result of it obtaining the internal reports on the two deaths, those of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller.",

A judge initially struck down the ban, but Georgia's Supreme Court halted the ruling in October, restoring the law.",
      "\"To have any time where we don't have this committee in place is difficult to fathom, realizing that we may lose access to really important data and information that could help us make better decisions and organize better around what we need for the state,\" Simpson said.",
      "Toomey wrote that reconstituting the committee \"will not result in a delay\" of the committee's responsibilities.",
      "The Georgia Department of Public Health will open applications for new members in the \"coming weeks,\" Toomey said in the letter, but will work to make sure there is more oversight and confidentiality in its review of cases.",

      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp doesn't appoint or release members of the committee because it's overseen by the Department of Public Health, Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas said. Kemp signed into law in 2019 a ban on abortions once the fetal heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as six weeks.",

      "An Alabama prisoner convicted of the 1994 murder of a female hitchhiker on Thursday became the third person executed by nitrogen gas in both the U.S. and Alabama. The United States Supreme Court denied a final petition to halt the execution Thursday afternoon, paving the way for it to go ahead as planned.",
      "Carey Dale Grayson, 50, was one of four teenagers convicted of killing Vickie Deblieux, 37, who was hitchhiking through Alabama on her way to her mother's home in Louisiana. He was executed Thursday evening at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in south Alabama.",
      "\"My prayer for Vickie's family is that they can find solace in the State of Alabama finally serving justice for their heartbreaking loss,\" Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said in a statement following Thursday's execution. \"And my hope is that one day it will not take three decades to provide justice for other victims of violent crimes.\"",
      "Alabama this year began using nitrogen gas to carry out some death sentences, the first use of a new execution method in the United States since lethal injection was introduced in 1982. The method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the person's face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.",
      "Alabama maintains the method is constitutional. But critics \u2014   citing how the first two people executed shook for several minutes \u2014   say the method needs more scrutiny, particularly if other states follow Alabama's path and adopt the new execution method.",
      "Deblieux's mutilated body was found at the bottom of a bluff near Odenville, Alabama, on Feb. 26, 1994. Prosecutors said Deblieux was hitchhiking from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to her mother's home in West Monroe, Louisiana, when four teens offered her a ride. Prosecutors said the teens took her to a wooded area and attacked and beat her. They threw her off a cliff and later returned to mutilate her body.",
      "A medical examiner testified that Deblieux's face was so fractured that she was identified by an earlier X-ray of her spine. Her fingers had also been severed. Investigators said the four teens were identified as suspects after one of them showed a friend a severed finger and boasted about the killing.",
      "Grayson was the only one of the four who faced a death sentence since the other teens were under 18 at the time of the killing. Grayson was 19. Two of the teens were initially sentenced to death but had those sentences set aside when the U.S. Supreme Court banned the execution of offenders who were younger than 18 at the time of their crimes. Another teen involved in Deblieux's killing was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Grayson's final appeals focused on the call for more scrutiny of the new execution method. They argued that the person experiences \"conscious suffocation\" and that the first two nitrogen executions did not result in swift unconsciousness and death as the state promised. Attorneys for Grayson asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the execution to give time to weigh the constitutionality of the method.",
      "\"Given this is the first new execution method used in the United States since lethal injection was first used in 1982, it is appropriate for this Court to reach the issues surrounding this novel method,\" Grayson's attorneys wrote.",
      "Lawyers for the Alabama attorney general's office asked justices to let the execution go forward, saying a lower court found Grayson's claims speculative.",
      "The state lawyers wrote that Alabama's \"nitrogen hypoxia protocol has been successfully used twice, and both times it resulted in a death within a matter of minutes.\"",
      "Kenny Smith was\u00a0the first person to die by nitrogen hypoxia\u00a0earlier this year, drawing international outcry.",

      "Washington \u2014 Former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary, met with senators on Capitol Hill on Thursday as new details emerged about an alleged sexual assault that took place in 2017.",
      "Hegseth was accompanied in his meetings by Vice President-elect JD Vance, an Ohio senator, as they seek to secure support among Republican senators for the former Fox News host's expected nomination. Trump selected the 44-year-old Army veteran \u2014 who served in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 last week, citing his military experience and calling him a \"Warrior for the Troops.\"",
      "Ahead of the meetings, the release of a detailed police report late Wednesday drew increased attention to the defense secretary pick, building upon information unearthed about an investigation into Hegseth for an alleged sexual assault in 2017. The report included the first detailed accounts of the incident from the unnamed woman, Hegseth and others. Hegseth denies the allegation and characterized the incident as a consensual encounter.",
      "Hegseth and Vance have met with Sens. Bill Hagerty and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Marco Rubio of Florida. Rubio was selected by Trump to serve as secretary of state but could vote on Hegseth's nomination if he is still in the Senate should it takes place.",
      "Blackburn said she had a \"great meeting\" with Hegseth, noting that he is a Tennessean whom \"we look forward to supporting.\"",
      "Hagerty likened the allegations against Hegseth to those made against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018. Kavanaugh was accused of sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford when he was in high school in the 1980s. He vehemently denied the claims, and none of the people who attended the gathering where the alleged incident happened could corroborate Ford's allegations.",
      "\"It's a disgrace that those allegations are nothing but what you said, allegations that are he-said she-said,\" he told reporters. \"This is a case that has been dismissed. This is just dredging up something, try to smear and discredit a candidate. It reminds me of what happened to Brett Kavanaugh. It's a disgrace.\"",
      "The Monterey Police Department forwarded its report about the alleged assault to the Monterey County District Attorney's Office for review back in 2017. Monterey County District Attorney Jeannine M. Pacioni said Thursday that in January 2018 her office \"declined to file charges\" as none were \"supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\"",
      "Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the Republican conference chair, praised Hegseth as a \"strong\" candidate to lead the Pentagon. Barrasso will become the second highest-ranking Senate Republican in the next Congress after he was selected to serve as majority whip.",
      "\"We had an excellent discussion about the need for America's military to remain the best in the world. That means taking care of our service members, equipping them with the latest technology, and focusing on making our military the most lethal force on the planet,\" he said in a statement. \"Pete pledged that the Pentagon will focus on strength and hard power \u2014 not the current administration's woke political agenda.\"",
      "The allegations against Hegseth were revealed last week when officials in Monterey, California, released a public statement disclosing an incident that occurred the night of Oct. 7, 2017, and into the morning of Oct. 8, 2017, at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel. An incident report was filed with the Monterey Police Department five days later.",
      "That police report, which was released Wednesday to CBS News and other outlets in response to public records requests, provided more details about the incident between Hegseth and the unidentified woman. The alleged victim told police that Hegseth sexually assaulted her after a Republican women's event at the hotel. She said he took her phone, blocked the door to a hotel room and refused to let her leave, according to the investigative report.",
      "The report said law enforcement was first notified of the alleged assault by a nurse informing police that a patient requested a sexual assault exam. Police also spoke with a hotel staffer and another woman who was at the event with Hegseth.",
      "The alleged victim told the nurse that she had been drinking with coworkers but thinks something may have been slipped into her drink because she could not remember many of the night's events. She recalled being in a coworker's hotel room, laying on either a couch or bed, and a bare-chested Hegseth hovering over her with his dog tags hanging over her face. According to the report, she said that Hegseth ejaculated on her stomach and then asked, \"Are you OK?\"",
      "The unidentified woman said her last memory was of walking into her hotel room, though she told police she did not remember how she got back to it, the report states.",
      "Hegseth also spoke with police and claimed the alleged victim led him to his room. He said the interaction was consensual and he checked multiple times to make sure the woman was comfortable with what was happening, according to the report.",
      "Timothy Parlatore, Hegseth's lawyer, said \"This police report confirms what I've said all along. That the incident was fully investigated and the police found the allegations to be false, which is why no charges were filed.\"",
      "While no charges were filed, neither Monterey police nor city officials have publicly said the allegations were found to be false.",
      "Parlatore had told CBS News on Monday that his client paid a confidential financial settlement to a woman who accused him of sexual assault because he was concerned Fox News would fire him because of the allegation.",
      "In addition to the allegations against Hegseth, his selection has drawn criticism due to his lack of high-level national security experience. The Defense Department is the largest federal agency, with more than 3 million civilian and military employees and a budget of more than $800 billion. He's also drawn criticism for his stance that women should not be in combat roles in the U.S. military.",
      "The meetings come a day after former Rep. Matt Gaetz also met with GOP senators before withdrawing his name from consideration for attorney general. Gaetz said in a post on social media that it had become clear that his candidacy \"was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.\"",
      "Shawna Mizelle, \n                                                  \n                      Alan He, \n                                                  \n                      Grace Kazarian and \n                                                  \n                      Laura Garrison\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Hegseth, a former Fox News host and President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be defense secretary, told police at the time that the encounter had been consensual and denied any wrongdoing, the report said.",
      "News of the allegations surfaced last week when local officials released a brief statement confirming that a woman had accused Hegseth of sexual assault in October 2017 after he had spoken at a Republican women's event in Monterey.",
      "Hegseth's lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment early Thursday.",
      "The 22-page police report, obtained by Mediaite, CBS News and other news outlets, was released in response to a public records request and offers the first detailed account of what the woman alleged transpired \u2014 one that is at odds with Hegseth's version of events.",
      "The report cited police interviews with the alleged victim, a nurse who treated her, a hotel staffer, another woman at the event and Hegseth.",
      "The woman's name wasn't released, and CBS News and The Associated Press don't typically name people who say they've been sexually assaulted.",
      "A spokeswoman for the Trump transition said early Thursday that the \"report corroborates what Mr. Hegseth's attorneys have said all along: the incident was fully investigated and no charges were filed because police found the allegations to be false.\"",
      "Police recommended the case report be forwarded to the Monterey County District Attorney's Office for review.",
      "Investigators were first alerted to the alleged assault, the report said, by a nurse who called them after a patient requested a sexual assault exam. The patient told medical personnel she believed she was assaulted five days earlier but couldn't remember much about what had happened. She reported something may have been slipped into her drink before ending up in the hotel room where she said the assault occurred.",
      "Police collected the unwashed dress and underwear she had worn that night, the report said.",
      "The woman's partner, who was staying at the hotel with her, told police that he was worried about her that night after she didn't come back to their room. At 2 a.m., he went to the hotel bar, but she wasn't there. She made it back a few hours later, apologizing that she \"must have fallen asleep.\" A few days later, she told him she had been sexually assaulted.",
      "The woman told police she had witnessed the TV anchor acting inappropriately throughout the night and saw him stroking women's legs. She texted a friend that Hegseth was giving off a \"creeper\" vibe, according to the report.",
      "After the event, the woman and others attended an afterparty in a hotel suite where she said she confronted Hegseth, telling him she \"did not appreciate how he treated women,\" the report states.",
      "A group of people, including Hegseth and the woman, left for the hotel's bar. That's when \"things got fuzzy,\" the woman told police.",
      "She remembered having a drink at the bar with Hegseth and others, the police report states. She also told police she argued with Hegseth near the hotel pool, an account supported by a hotel staffer who was sent to handle the disturbance and spoke to police, according to the report.",
      "Soon, the accuser told police, she was inside a hotel room with Hegseth and he took her phone and blocked the door with his body so she couldn't leave, according to the report. She also told police she remembered \"saying 'no' a lot,\" the report said.",
      "Her next memory was laying on a couch or bed with Hegseth hovering over her bare-chested, his dog tags dangling over her, the report states. Hegseth served in the National Guard, rising to the rank of major.",
      "After she said Hegseth ejaculated on her stomach, she recalled him asking if she was \"OK,\" the report states. She told police she did not recall how she got back to her own hotel room and had since suffered from nightmares and memory loss.",
      "At the time of the alleged assault in 2017, Hegseth, now 44, was going through a divorce with his second wife, with whom he has three children. She filed for divorce after he had a child with a Fox News producer who is now his wife, according to court records and social media posts by Hegseth. His first marriage ended in 2009, also after infidelity by Hegseth, according to court records.",
      "Hegseth told police that he attended an after party and drank beer but didn't consume \"hard alcohol\" and acknowledged being \"buzzed\" but not drunk, according to the police report.",
      "He said he met the woman at the hotel bar and she led him by the arm back to his hotel room, which surprised him because he initially had no intention of having sex with her, the report said.",
      "Hegseth told investigators the sexual encounter that followed was consensual, adding that he explicitly asked more than once if she was comfortable. Hegseth said in the morning the woman \"showed early signs of regret\" and he assured her that he wouldn't tell anyone about the encounter.",
      "Hegseth's attorney, Timothy Parlatore, has told CBS News Hegseth paid a confidential financial settlement to a woman who accused him of sexual assault out of concern the allegation would lead to his firing from Fox News.",
      "Parlatore said Hegseth reached the settlement agreement to deter his accuser from going forward with a lawsuit, maintaining that he is innocent and the sexual encounter was consensual. Hegseth denies any wrongdoing.",
      "Parlatore declined to disclose the amount of the settlement, saying only that it was \"far, far less than what she wanted.\" He characterized it as \"essentially an extortion and blackmail.\"",
      "Fox News Media said in a statement Monday it \"was not made aware of the incident or the settlement.\"",
      "Trump's transition team spoke with Parlatore after Hegseth was named as Trump's nominee defense secretary, the attorney said. He said that he \"explained this fully\" to them but that he did not know what prior conversations Hegseth had with the transition team, or if they had been informed about the sexual assault allegation and settlement agreement before the announcement of his impending nomination for defense secretary.",
      "\"This should have nothing to do with the confirmation process,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz announced Thursday that he is withdrawing his nomination for attorney general. His decision came amid an investigation by the\u00a0House Ethics Committee\u00a0for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "Gaetz denied any wrongdoing and called the investigation a \"smear.\" He blamed the probe on former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whose\u00a0ouster\u00a0Gaetz helped lead last year.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump was calling Republican senators and associates as recently as Thursday morning to gauge Gaetz's chances that he could be confirmed, a person familiar with his calls told CBS News. Trump did not want to risk not having an attorney general on the first day of his second term given an anticipated wave of executive orders that would face legal challenges, according to another source familiar with the situation.",
      "Gaetz concluded on his own that he lacked enough support from Republican senators, according to two people familiar with the situation. Ultimately, given the controversy surrounding Gaetz, at least 15 GOP senators might have opposed the pick, according to one of the sources. One GOP senator told CBS News that there werea at least eight hard \"no\" votes on Gaetz, a total that never budged.",
      "Trump had\u00a0tapped Gaetz to lead the Justice Department as the nation's top law enforcement officer last week. Gaetz swiftly resigned his seat in the House and was on Capitol Hill\u00a0on Wednesday with Vice President-elect JD Vance, an Ohio senator, meeting with Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee who would oversee his confirmation hearings.",
      "He said in a social media post that while he had \"excellent meetings\" with senators, his confirmation battle was taking away from the work of the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,\" he wrote on social media. \"There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump's DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.\"",
      "In response to Gaetz's decision, Trump wrote on social media, \"I greatly appreciate the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General. He was doing very well but, at the same time, did not want to be a distraction for the Administration, for which he has much respect.\" A few hours later, Trump announced a new pick for the job,\u00a0former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi.",
      "Gaetz called both Trump and Vance separately to inform them of his decision, CBS News confirmed.",
      "The Justice Department also conducted an investigation into Gaetz involving allegations of sex trafficking and obstruction. Prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz last year.",
      "Gaetz's withdrawal came amid reporting of new details about testimony to the Ethics Committee given by a woman who said she had two encounters with the Florida Republican at a party in July 2017, when she was a minor, and months after he was sworn in to the House. According to two sources familiar with the matter, the woman said the second encounter was a threesome. However, the person she identified as the other woman in the threesome has repeatedly denied under oath to the committee this happened.",
      "\"My client denies witnessing and/or participating in any sexual activities between Congressman Matt Gaetz and the 17-year-old minor in Orlando, Florida, in 2017,\" a lawyer for the third participant said.",
      "CNN was first to report the second encounter between Gaetz and the then 17-year-old.",
      "Several senators had expressed concerns about installing Gaetz as attorney general, raising doubts that he would win confirmation even with Republicans in control of the upper chamber in the next Congress, which begins in January. Some then indicated that his decision to remove himself as the attorney general candidate was the right one.",
      "\"I think the decision to withdraw the nomination is the right decision to make,\" Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, said. He continued: \"I thought from the beginning, as I shared earlier, I thought it was problematic. And I think you know, as some of our members have expressed, as they've learned more about it, there was perhaps some information out there that the president was not aware of when he made the original recommendation.\"",
      "GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer, of North Dakota, said he is \"grateful\" Gaetz withdrew, while Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said \"there were a lot of red flags.\"",
      "\"I think that he has put country first, and I'm pleased with his decision,\" she said.",
      "It is the first major blow to Trump's efforts to fill his Cabinet and key administration posts for his second term in office. The president-elect's pick for secretary of defense, former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, is also under scrutiny after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2017. A police report provided details of the incident, which Hegseth said at the time was consensual. He has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Trump's announcement of Gaetz as his pick for attorney general came just two days before the Ethics Committee was set to meet to discuss whether to release a report detailing its years-long investigation into the Florida Republican. Because he stepped down from his position in the House upon his selection to lead the Justice Department, the committee's jurisdiction over Gaetz ended, raising questions about whether the panel's report would be released.",
      "The Ethics Committee did convene Wednesday and considered the report's release. But lawmakers said the panel, divided evenly between Democrats and Republicans, did not reach agreement. The committee planned to reconvene on Dec. 5 \"to further consider this matter,\" Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the committee, told reporters after the initial meeting.",
      "The Ethics Committee said in June that it was looking into allegations against Gaetz of sexual misconduct and drug use, accepting improper gifts and giving \"special privileges and favors,\" and obstructing the investigations into his conduct. House investigators interviewed more than a dozen witnesses and issued 25 subpoenas, the committee said in a rare statement.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News at the time that four women told the committee that they had been paid to go to parties attended by Gaetz that included sex and drugs. A lawyer for two women who spoke with the panel told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the Ethics Committee.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs. One of Leppard's clients\u00a0testified before the Ethics Committee\u00a0that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old against a game table during a July 2017 party, months after he was sworn in as a House member.",
      "Leppard said following Gaetz's withdrawal that his \"clients are relieved to have this chapter behind them and eager to move forward with their lives. We're hopeful this brings final closure for all parties involved.\"",
      "Confirmation hearings for Gaetz before the Judiciary Committee would not have taken place until early next year, but Republican and Democratic senators have been pushing to see the Ethics Committee's report as they considered his nomination.",
      "On Wednesday, 10 Democrats on the Judiciary Committee asked the FBI to turn over the full evidentiary file in the now-closed federal sex trafficking probe involving Gaetz.",
      "GOP Rep. Michael Guest, chairman of the Ethics Committee, said Gaetz's decision to pull himself from consideration ends his panel's involvement.",
      "\"I think that this should end the discussion of whether or not the Ethics Committee should continue to move forward in this matter,\" he told reporters. \"He has withdrawn his nomination. He is no longer a member of Congress, and so I think that this settles any involvement that the Ethics Committee should have in any matters involving Mr. Gaetz.\"",

    "story": [
      "After former Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew himself from consideration for attorney general, President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday evening that he was selecting Pam Bondi, Florida's former attorney general, as his replacement.",
      "\"I am proud to announce former Attorney General of the Great State of Florida, Pam Bondi, as our next Attorney General of the United States,\" Trump said in a statement, adding that she was \"smart and tough\" and \"will do a terrific job.\"",
      "Bondi was the first woman elected to serve as Florida's attorney general, spending eight years in the role after working as assistant state attorney for Hillsborough County. According to Mr. Trump's social media post, Bondi focused on curbing immigration and combating the opioid epidemic during her tenure.",
      "Bondi, a Trump loyalist, then turned her attention to national politics, working in the White House as both a legal adviser and defense attorney for Mr. Trump during the Senate's 2020 impeachment trial. She also spoke at a Pennsylvania press conference following the 2020 presidential election alongside\u00a0 Eric Trump and Rudy Giuliani \u2014 falsely claiming Trump had won the state before President Biden was declared its winner. She was also a surrogate for Trump's most recent campaign.",
      "Gaetz reacted to the pick, posting to social media that Bondi was a \"stellar selection\" and a \"proven litigator, inspiring leader and a champion for all Americans.\"",
      "If confirmed, Bondi would be in charge of the Justice Department's 100,000 employees and oversee investigative components like the FBI and DEA. And she would assume the top job in a department that has investigated and prosecuted Mr. Trump for years.",
      "Special counsel Jack Smith has filed two indictments against Trump, one over his alleged illegal retention of classified records, and another over allegations that he resisted the peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election. Trump pleaded not guilty to all counts and a federal judge earlier this year dismissed the classified documents case against him.",
      "Smith is now actively working to end the election-related case\u00a0against the president-elect because of department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. Smith is likely to leave his post at the Justice Department before Trump's inauguration, according to two sources familiar with the plans.",
      "In June 2023, after he was indicted on federal charges related to classified documents, Mr. Trump vowed to, \"appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of America, Joe Biden, and go after the Biden crime family.\" Since then, he and his allies have railed against the Justice Department, alleging political interference and abuse of power.",
      "\"For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans - Not anymore,\" Trump said in his statement Thursday.",
      "Gaetz announced on Thursday that he would withdraw his nomination for attorney general, just over a week after Trump tapped him for the post. The selection was widely considered to be the most controversial the president-elect had made, with Gaetz having been the subject of multiple investigations into alleged conduct related to sex trafficking, obstruction, sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Gaetz promptly resigned from Congress following Trump's announcement, which came days before the House Ethics Committee was set to meet to consider releasing a report into its investigation into the Florida Republican's conduct. When the panel met days later, after its jurisdiction over Gaetz had ended with his decision to leave Congress, members said they did not reach agreement on whether to release the report. The next day, after meeting with Senate Republicans, Gaetz announced he would withdraw.",
      "Even Senate Republicans were skeptical of Gaetz' chances of being confirmed next year, despite being slated to hold a narrow majority in the chamber.",
      "Bondi will be the first woman to serve as U.S. attorney general since Loretta Lynch ascended to the top job during the Obama administration. Bondi's top deputy would be Todd Blanche, who has spent the last several months serving as Trump's defense attorney, and previously worked as a corporate defense attorney and federal prosecutor.",
      "Other Trump defense attorneys are also set to be nominated to Justice Department leadership positions, including Emil Bove, who will be Trump's principal deputy attorney general, and D. John Sauer, who Trump said he will nominate as solicitor general.",
      "Much of Bondi's initiatives will also depend on who Trump appoints to lead other Justice Department divisions, like those that handle national security and criminal matters. Trump's pick to oversee the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel will also be key to the agenda as it will issue decisions on presidential power, including potentially about which federal employees the president can fire.",
      "FBI Director Christopher Wray reports directly to the attorney general. He was nominated by Trump in 2017 for a ten-year term, but Vice President-elect JD Vance has said he and Trump were interviewing potential replacements earlier this week. Wray has given no indication he plans on leaving the post.",

    "summary": "Sarah McBride, set to be the first transgender member of Congress, talked with CBS News' Scott MacFarlane and commented on the GOP's effort to restrict bathroom use.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 \u00a0Rep.-elect\u00a0Sarah McBride, a Delaware Democrat who is set to become the first transgender member of Congress, characterized a GOP effort to restrict bathroom use as an attempt \"to get headlines.\"",
      "\"Everything was fine until some members of the small Republican conference majority decided to get headlines and to manufacture a crisis,\" McBride told CBS News' Scott MacFarlane.",
      "The Delaware Democrat told CBS News that she anticipated an effort to \"politicize my use of a restroom,\" and she indicated she had not intended to use multi-stall women's restrooms in the Capitol. But she also said \"that is my choice here.\"",
      "\"If anyone had thought to ask me about what I was planning on doing, I would've been happy to tell them,\" McBride said. \"But again, this is not an issue. And this has never been an issue in this complex.\"",
      "Weeks after McBride became the first transgender person elected to Congress, a Republican-led effort to restrict restroom use in the Capitol got underway this week. Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, introduced legislation Monday to change House rules to limit use of single-sex bathrooms in the Capitol complex to those corresponding to users' \"biological sex.\"",
      "McBride, who also made history as the first trans person ever elected to a state senate seat, has tended to stay above the fray, stressing that her priority is to work for Delawareans in the House. She told CBS News that she wants people to see her \"competence in governing contrast with their chaos.\"",
      "\"I would like my grace to contrast with the grandstanding that we're seeing right now.\" McBride said. \"I would like my approach of respecting everyone to contrast with the disrespect that we are seeing right now.\"",
      "Mace's two-page resolution alleges that \"allowing biological males\" into the facilities \"jeopardizes the safety and dignity of Members, officers, and employees of the House who are female\" and would task the sergeant-at-arms with enforcing the measure.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that he supports restricting the \"single-sex facilities\" in the Capitol, saying in a statement that the facilities \"are reserved for individuals of that biological sex.\"",
      "McBride pledged to follow the rules outlined by Johnson, \"even if I disagree with them,\" while asserting that she didn't run for Congress to \"fight about bathrooms.\"",
      "Anti-transgender sentiments have become a rallying cry for some Republicans in recent months, often evoked by President-elect Donald Trump and his allies on the campaign trail and over the airwaves.",

    "story": [
      "A lawsuit filed in October accused former WWE CEO Linda McMahon, President-elect Trump's nominee for secretary of education, of turning a blind eye to child sexual abuse by a former ringside announcer at the wrestling company.",
      "The suit claims McMahon, her husband Vince and others at the WWE were aware of misconduct by Melvin Phillips \u2014 and negligent in failing to prevent it. The lawsuit alleges Phillips for years hired \u2014 and later assaulted \u2014 \"ring boys\" as young as 13.",
      "Phillips died in 2012, and the lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of five unnamed men, targets the McMahons and the WWE under a new change in Maryland law that eliminates the state's statute of limitations for claims of child sex abuse.",
      "Phillips was a fixture in the WWE. The plaintiffs claim Phillips assaulted boys in arena facilities, such as dressing and locker rooms, as well as hotels.",
      "An attorney for Linda McMahon said the Cabinet nominee \"will vigorously defend against this baseless lawsuit and without doubt ultimately succeed.\"",
      "\"This civil lawsuit based upon thirty-plus year-old allegations is filled with scurrilous lies, exaggerations, and misrepresentations regarding Linda McMahon,\" said the attorney, Laura Brevetti. \"The matter at the time was investigated by company attorneys and the FBI, which found no grounds to continue the investigation.\"",
      "The lawsuit acknowledges that the FBI investigated in 1993. No charges were filed.",
      "The lawsuit cites a 1992 New York Post report, and later a sworn deposition by the report, saying Vince McMahon acknowledged at one point firing Phillips because of his \"relationship with kids seemed peculiar, and unnatural,\" but weeks later Vince and Linda McMahon decided to rehire him.",
      "Vince McMahon resigned in January from WWE's parent company after a former employee claimed in a separate lawsuit that he forced her into a sexual relationship and offered sex with her to an unnamed WWE performer.",
      "In a statement to CBS News the day of his resignation, Vince McMahon said he left \"out of respect for the WWE,\" but called that lawsuit, \"replete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and is a vindictive distortion of the truth.\"",
      "An attorney for Vince McMahon, and spokespeople for the incoming Trump administration and the WWE did not immediately return requests for comment.",
      "Linda McMahon served in the first Trump administration as administrator of the Small Business Administration. Trump announced on Tuesday that she will be his nominee for Education Secretary. McMahon spent just more than a year as a member of the Connecticut State Board of Education, in 2009 and 2010.",

      "Bitcoin topped $98,000 for the first time Thursday, extending a streak of almost daily all-time highs since the U.S. presidential election. The cryptocurrency has rocketed more than 40% in just two weeks.",
      "Now, bitcoin is at the doorstep of $100,000 and investors do not appear to be fazed by gravity or any cautionary tales of the cryptocurrencies history of volatility.",
      "Cryptocurrencies and related investments like crypto exchange traded funds have rallied because the incoming Trump administration is expected to be more \"crypto-friendly\" than the outgoing Biden administration.",
      "As of 11:02 a.m. ET, bitcoin traded at $96,747 after rising as high as $98,349 according to CoinDesk.",
      "Yet cryptocurrency markets remain a wild place and what comes next is impossible to know. And while some are bullish, other experts are warning of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now but have come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \"digital alternative\" to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "Trump's election win boosts crypto",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. election.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who was once critical of digital currencies,\u00a0pledged during his campaign\u00a0against Vice President Kamala Harris to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to create a bitcoin \"strategic reserve.\" His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for. Trump also had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "Spot bitcoin ETFs",
      "Digital assets like bitcoin had posted notable gains in the months ahead of the election, mostly due to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.\u00a0 Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency\u00a0exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\" Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a research note two weeks ago. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Bitcoin volatility",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. Experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "How bitcoin mining works",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \"mining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth's Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin's electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:07:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy say the Department of Government Efficiency has targets in mind for cost cutting.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are sharing details about how their newly created Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 which isn't an official government department \u2014 plans to take aim at paring federal spending, with the two writing in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Wednesday that they are aiming to cut $500 billion in annual spending.",
      "The announcement of DOGE has raised a host of questions, from whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal spending, typically controlled by Congress, as well as the group's powers and how it will operate. Musk and Ramaswamy provided answers to some of those questions in their opinion piece, arguing that President-elect Donald Trump has the authority to cut spending authorized by Congress.",
      "While Musk and Ramaswamy said they \"expect to prevail\" in cutting costs, there have been plenty of examples throughout the decades of efforts aimed at reining in federal spending, which have had only limited results. For instance, President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s tapped businessman J. Peter Grace to recommend reforms, resulting in about 2,500 recommendations for cutting spending, most of which were never implemented.",
      "Musk has suggested slicing $2 trillion in annual federal spending, an amount experts say is unrealistic given that most of the nation's $6.7 trillion in yearly outlays is spent on Social Security, Medicare and the military.",
      "But in the Wednesday opinion piece, Musk and Ramaswamy wrote that their initial aim will be to cut \"the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Where will Musk's DOGE aim to cut federal spending?",
      "Two-thirds of federal spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "But as mentioned above, Musk and Ramaswamy said they'll target $500 billion in spending that is unauthorized by Congress, as well as programs they believe aren't in line with lawmakers' intentions.",
      "The biggest source of expired authorizations sits with health care for veterans, which cost $119 billion in fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "However, Musk and Ramaswamy didn't single out veterans' health care as a place where they'd seek to cut. Instead, they listed the following areas:",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which receives $535 million a year\u00a0International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grantsPlanned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",

      "International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grants",
      "Planned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",
      "Which federal programs don't have authorization?",
      "The programs mentioned by Musk and Ramaswamy are relatively tiny compared with other areas that are unauthorized, such as veterans' health care.",
      "The next biggest sources of expired authorizations, after veterans' health care, include programs that invest in opioid treatment, the State Department and housing assistance. Some smaller programs with expired funding include Head Start, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. The latter provides weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring, among other tasks.",
      "According to Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that was developed by the Heritage Foundation to guide the next conservative White House, the NOAA \"should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated.\"",
      "DOGE wants to cut federal workers. Here's how.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy also underscored that they'll push to cut the ranks of federal employees, saying their efforts could lead to \"mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.\" The pair didn't enumerate the number of workers they'll seek to push out of the federal workforce.",
      "In 2023, there were more than 2 million federal employees, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group focused on the federal government. Most of those workers are within Veterans Affairs, due to a large number of health care providers for the VA, followed by people enlisted in the armed services, its data shows.",
      "While civil service workers have job protections, Musk and Ramaswamy argued that the president would be legally allowed to enact \"reductions in force\" that don't target specific workers, as well as to make decisions including \"large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area.\"",
      "The DOGE would help federal employees \"transition into the private sector,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote. \"The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit.\"",
      "The pair also said they want to require federal workers to be in the office five days a week, a policy change that they predict would \"result in a wave of voluntary terminations.\"",
      "In a Thursday post on X, the social media service owned by Elon Musk, the DOGE wrote, \"Federal government agencies are using, on average, just 12% of the space in their DC headquarters.  The Department of Agriculture, with space for more than 7,400 people, averaged 456 workers each day (6% occupancy).\"",
      "It added, \"Why are American taxpayer dollars being spent to maintain empty buildings?\"",
      "How much do federal workers earn?",
      "Pay varies by department and seniority, with the federal government publishing a General Schedule of basic pay grades for most federal employees. For 2024, the lowest pay grade was about $22,000 in annual earnings, while the highest was about $160,000. Some agencies offer competitive salaries to compete with the private sector. Pay may also vary by location.",
      "Federal employees are located in every state, with 80% located outside the Washington, D.C. area, according to the Partnership for Public Service.",
      "Workers at the Administrative Conference of the United States, an independent federal agency charged with identifying improvements for federal agencies to protect public interests, have the highest median salary, at about $242,000, according to federal data. That's followed by employees at the American Battle Monuments Commission, with a median salary of about $228,000.",

    "summary": "Kennedy's team is weighing a significant rewrite of the FDA's rules.",
    "story": [
      "Advisers to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are weighing a significant rewrite to the Food and Drug Administration's rules governing food additives, to fulfill Kennedy and President-elect Donald Trump's \"Make America Healthy Again\" pledge to get toxic chemicals out of the food supply.",
      "The proposed crackdown, which is still in its early stages and will need to get a sign-off from Trump and his transition team, targets a provision in the FDA's regulations on which food additives are considered by the agency to be \"generally recognized as safe,\" or GRAS.",
      "Advisers to Kennedy, Trump's pick for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, have also floated other approaches to curbing the use of food additives, including working with agricultural producers to change the subsidies and incentives offered by the government for certain kinds of foods Kennedy argues are unhealthy.",
      "\"I think the overall posture of the FDA should be actually a lot of deregulation. I think we should have a golden age of innovation and drug development. Nobody's standing in the way of that,\" Calley Means, a top adviser to Kennedy's transition team, said this month on \"The Liz Wheeler Show.\"",
      "Means said \"corrupt regulatory interpretations\" had broken the regulation of additives under the GRAS process, saying it had become a \"totally rigged system.\"",
      "\"But when it comes to food, when it comes to 'generally recognized as safe,' complete self-policing from this industry, allowing them to put chemicals in our food that are banned in every other country and have hundreds of studies saying are harmful, there needs to be a review,\" Means said.",
      "\"This is a bananas system\"",
      "Advocacy groups and experts have long denounced the FDA's \"loophole\" in its regulation of these food additives, which allows companies to quietly decide which chemicals they deem safe enough to add to their products without going through the agency's oversight.",
      "\"This is a bananas system. This is not the way that new food chemicals should be approved and come into our food supply,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.",
      "While companies with new chemicals can choose to go through a \"voluntary\" process to earn a spot on the agency's list of substances that are \"generally recognized as safe,\" making it easier to market foods with the additives, officials acknowledge companies often bypass it.",
      "\"It does undermine the overall credibility of the system when it is possible to get a chemical on the market without prior review by the FDA,\" the agency's top food official, Jim Jones, said at an event hosted by the Alliance for a Stronger FDA earlier this year.",
      "Bill Freese, science director for the Center for Food Safety, cited times companies have decided to go ahead and \"self-certify\" that their food additives were safe, even after failing to earn the sign-off of the FDA's reviewers during the voluntary process.",
      "That has strayed far from the original intent of the provision, Freese said, which was supposed to narrowly \"grandfather in\" foods with a long history of safe use like salt and vinegar.",
      "\"These GRAS exemptions should be limited. The FDA just expanded the loophole until it just literally swallowed the entire statute,\" he said.",
      "Obstacles in Congress and the courts",
      "Making it mandatory for companies to go through the GRAS notification process before using any new food ingredients will likely face hurdles.",
      "Cracking down on food additives would dramatically broaden the FDA's workload. The agency would have to both screen new notifications as well as look back at previously greenlighted chemicals.",
      "FDA officials have long called for Congress to step up funding for oversight of food additives, warning that resources were stretched thin even with the current duties.",
      "One idea to broaden FDA's funding \u2014 attaching fees to applications submitted by food manufacturers, similar to the \"user fees\" programs for medical products \u2014 has also failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill. Kennedy has also been critical of the \"user fees\" approach for drugs, and has called to undo it.",
      "Another obstacle could come through the courts, especially in light of a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that curtailed agency power.",
      "Advocacy groups lost a previous federal lawsuit against the FDA trying to require the notifications back in 2021. In that case, the judge found that \"it remains unclear under the statute whether FDA even has the authority to make GRAS notifications mandatory.\"",
      "\"I think there are certainly things within FDA's power to narrow the loophole, to make it harder for companies to take advantage of the GRAS process. But there is some legal precedence saying that this is Congress' problem to fix, so we'll just have to see,\" said Benesh.",
      "While Kennedy's team acknowledges the issue may end up needing to be hashed out through legislation on Capitol Hill, changing the procedure solely through the executive branch is on the table, an adviser said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said he is asking Trump to \"declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease\" as another way to supercharge his authorities amid blowback they expect from the food industry.",
      "\"This is not a monolithic, this is not an all-powerful industry. They can be disrupted. So that's what gives me hope. The voters and President Trump's microphone are on our side,\" Means said.",

Duffy would take on the role at a precarious time, as East Coast dockworkers are in stalled contract negotiations and nearing a possible strike in January.

      "As DNI, Gabbard would be involved with managing intelligence and response to terrorism-related events, overseeing the national intelligence program and advising the Homeland Security Council. Perhaps her most important role would be one that would put in her regular contact with Trump: the President's Daily Brief.

    "title": "How could the U.S. military be used for Trump's mass deportation plan?",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 08:13:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump signaled this week that he would enlist the help of the U.S. military for his massive deportation operation.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to start the largest deportation effort in American history \u2014 his signature 2024 campaign promise \u2014 as soon as he takes office, signaling this week that he would enlist the help of the U.S. military for the massive operation to deport undocumented immigrants.",
      "Earlier this week, he shared a social media post indicating that he'd declare a national emergency and deploy military assets to carry out deportations.",
      "Still, how exactly the military would be tapped to carry out this promise of mass deportations is unclear. And there are untested legal questions about involving service members in immigration enforcement operations.",
      "The Department of Defense has provided operational support to immigration and border authorities for decades, under both Republican and Democratic presidents. Roughly 4,000 service members \u2013 primarily from the National Guard \u2014 are currently authorized to support the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) security mission along the southwest border, according to the U.S. Northern Command.",
      "While longstanding federal law generally prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement \u2014 which includes immigration arrests and deportations \u2014 a few rarely invoked statutory exceptions exist.",
      "The Department of Defense's vast funding and resources could be instrumental in helping the incoming administration address the operational and financial challenges of carrying out deportations on a monumental scale. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch has a fraction of the resources that would be necessary, with 6,000 agents and 41,000 detention beds. About 11 million immigrants are estimated to be living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "What have Trump and his allies said about using the military for deportations?",
      "In an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" last month, Tom Homan, who Trump has appointed to be his \"border czar,\" indicated that one way to increase manpower for the mass deportation plan would be to re-hire retired ICE agents. Contractors, he added, could do some of the operational work, including handling transportation and setting up so-called \"soft-sided\" facilities, or tent detention sites, to hold migrant detainees.",
      "Homan said transportation and supply assets from the Department of Defense would also be helpful, suggesting that military planes could be used for deportation. But Stephen Miller, the incoming White House deputy chief of staff, has gone further than Homan, suggesting the National Guard could be deputized to arrest undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"We will deputize them as immigration enforcement officers,\" Miller said during a radio interview last year. \"They know their states, they know their communities, they know their cities.\"",
      "And while U.S. law generally bans the use of the armed forces for domestic law enforcement, during an interview with the New York Times last year, Miller said a revamped Trump administration would invoke what's known as the Insurrection Act to create an exception, enabling the use of federal troops to apprehend migrants.",
      "The military, Miller has also indicated, could be dispatched to the southern border with \"an impedance and denial mission.\"",
      "\"You reassert the fundamental constitutional principle that you don't have the right to enter into our sovereign territory, to even request an asylum claim,\" Miller said at this year's CPAC. \"The military has the right to establish a fortress position on the border to say no one can cross here at all.\"",
      "Finally, Trump has pledged to use the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 \u2014 a law invoked during World War II to approve the surveillance and detention of Italian, German, Japanese immigrants \u2014 to deport suspected migrant gang members.",
      "How could the military be deployed to the U.S. border?",
      "The U.S. military's role at the U.S.-Mexico border dates back to the Mexican American War, with additional buildup of troops at the southern border during the Mexican Revolution and World War I.",
      "\"For basically the past 40 years, the military's involvement at the border has been steadily growing,\" said Joseph Nunn, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law, \"And it has gone from sort of ad hoc to routine to deeply entrenched into how we approach border security and immigration.\"",
      "Members of the military stationed at the border have historically performed an array of support tasks, experts tell CBS News \u2013 from operating surveillance aircrafts and transporting U.S. Border Patrol personnel in helicopters to laying concertina wire and maintaining Customs and Border Protection vehicles.",
      "Homan's suggestions of using the military for some of the operational work that doesn't involve engaging with migrants would fall under this category and would be an expansion of the duties National Guard and a small number of active-duty troops have performed at the southern border under previous administrations. As recently as last year, troops were deployed to the border to help Border Patrol with administrative tasks, like warehouse management and clerical work.",
      "Military involvement now \"is just essentially to get access to more bodies and more aircrafts,\" Nunn explained, calling military mobilization a force multiplier. \"Suppose you want to set up a checkpoint on a highway in Texas or Arizona. Under normal circumstances, you need five CBP agents to run a checkpoint. If you have access to military personnel, you can run a checkpoint with one CBP agent assisted by four soldiers. Then suddenly five CBP agents assisted by soldiers can run five checkpoints instead of one.\"",
      "\"[The Trump administration] would also use the military to do things like build bases and facilities to hold people,\" senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, Thomas Warrick, told CBS News. \"He could use the military to fly detainees around the country or indeed to deport them to other countries if they can get landing rights.\"",
      "Can the U.S. military act as domestic law enforcement?",
      "Using the military in an active law enforcement role, rather than in a support capacity, would be more complex and unusual, but subject to at least one legal loophole.",
      "The Posse Comitatus Act bars federal armed forces from participating in law enforcement activities unless expressly authorized by Congress. But the 1807 Insurrection Act, which Miller mentioned, allows the president to utilize the military in domestic cases that warrant it. While the National Guard is under state control and not activated for federal service, it is not subject to Posse Comitatus.",
      "Abraham Lincoln used it during the Civil War, and in the 20th century, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy relied on the law to desegregate schools, deploying troops to the South after the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education. The most recent time it was used was in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush after both city and state leaders asked for federal help to quell the L.A. riots.",
      "According to the law, the military may be activated to enforce the laws on U.S. soil or to \"suppress rebellion\" whenever \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion\" make it \"impracticable\" to enforce federal law in that state by the \"ordinary course of judicial proceedings.\"",
      "Can this be challenged in court?",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said using the military to carry out deportations under the Alien and Sedition Acts would be \"patently unlawful,\" because current circumstances don't allow for it.",
      "\"The law requires an invasion by a foreign government,\" said Gelernt, who challenged many of the first Trump administration's immigration policies. \"That's not what is happening with immigration.\"",
      "There is already an agency, ICE, that enforces immigration laws with arrest authority that the U.S. military does not have.",
      "\"It was designed for unexpected emergencies,\" Nunn said, but added that, \"its text grants vast discretion to the president\" with \"no meaningful criteria\" to justify invoking it.",
      "In 1827, the Supreme Court ruled in Martin v. Mott that the president has the sole authority to decide whether a situation warrants deploying the military. However, \"If you can prove that the president has invoked the insurrection act in bad faith, which is going to be a high bar to clear but not impossible, you could potentially challenge the decision to invoke the Insurrection Act,\" Nunn explained, adding that the centuries-old law does not permit the military to violate constitutional rights or to violate otherwise applicable federal law.",
      "Peter Feaver, a professor of political science and public policy at Duke University who focuses on civil military relations, said using the military as law enforcement would be controversial and could degrade trust in the military, even if there is a legal case for it.",
      "\"This is not what the military trains for, but on top of all of that, it would be deeply politically polarizing because there'd be many many Americans who would view this as an inappropriate mission, a betrayal of our American values or something,\" said Feaver, who has written a book called \"Thanks for Your Service: The Causes and Consequences of Public Confidence in the US Military.\"",
      "Congress has no role in invoking the Insurrection Act. In July, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, renewed his legislative push to overhaul the law. He first introduced a bill reforming the Insurrection Act in 2020, after Trump's threats to use troops to respond to civil rights protests across the U.S. following the police killing of George Floyd, but his efforts were stalled by Republican opposition and pushback from the Trump administration.",
      "What if Trump declared a national emergency at the border?",
      "Trump declared a national emergency at the border during his first administration, after Congress declined to fund border wall construction. He used the declaration to unilaterally divert Pentagon funds to expand the border wall.",
      "\"The Pentagon budget \u2013 that's where the money is,\" Warrick said. \"It's where the people are. It's where the aircrafts are.\"",
      "The long-term cost of deporting 1 million people per year could average $88 billion annually, according to the American Immigration Council, surpassing the Department of Homeland Security's $62 billion budget in fiscal year 2025 and totalling nearly $968 billion over a decade. The operation would also demand lightning-speed expansion of the immigration court systems and detention facilities.",
      "\"It's going to be astronomically expensive,\" Nunn said. \"And not only is it going to be straightforwardly expensive, but it's also going to come with opportunity costs \u2014 every military service member and military asset that is diverted to assist with a mass deportation program or to assist with border security is a service member or asset that is not carrying out their normal duties.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration will provide Ukraine with controversial anti-personnel mines in its war against Russia, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News Tuesday night.",
      "Anti-personnel mines, or APLs, are designed to be used against people, not vehicles. They can be rapidly deployed and are meant to blunt the advances of ground forces, making them useful for Ukraine's defense against Russia's advances in Eastern Ukraine, the official said.",
      "The U.S. sought commitments from the Ukrainians on their use to further limit the risk to civilians, the official said, noting that Ukrainians are committed to not employing the mines in areas populated with their own civilians.",
      "The U.S.-provided APLs are different than the thousands of landmines being employed by Russia in eastern Ukraine in that they are \"non-persistent,\" meaning they become inert over a preset period of time, usually between four hours and two weeks, the official said. They are electrically fused and require battery power to detonate. Once the battery runs out, they will not detonate.",
      "Tuesday marked 1,000 days since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. CBS News learned Sunday that President Biden had lifted restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S. weapons to conduct strikes deep inside Russia.",
      "U.S.-supplied ATACMS were used Tuesday on targets inside Russia, U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Ukraine has been one of the most mined countries in the world since Russia's invasion in 2022, and Ukraine is inundated with APLs. They are known by deceptively innocent names such as \"butterfly\" or \"petal\" mines because they scatter like flower petals when they drop from the sky.",
      "\"Typically, several hundred of these at a time will just be liberally and indiscriminately spread across the territory,\" Pete Smith, the Ukraine program manager for the HALO Trust, a nonprofit organization focused on ridding warzones of landmines, told \"60 Minutes\" in August. \"They can rest on the roofs. They can sit in guttering. They can take years before they come back into society and into view.\"",
      "To date, 164 nations, including Ukraine, have signed onto the Mine Ban Treaty which prohibits the use of APLs. However, three dozen countries have not agreed to it, including Russia and the U.S.",
      "In January 2020, then-President Donald Trump reversed an Obama-era policy which banned the use of APLs anywhere except on the Korean Peninsula. However, in June 2022, Mr. Biden reinstated the ban, except for APLs \"required for the defense of the Republic of Korea.\"",

      "Accompanied by Vice President-elect JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, Gaetz sat down with Republican senators, whose votes will be crucial in confirming him to the position of the nation's top law enforcement officer next year. The GOP is set to take control of the Senate in the next Congress and hold 53 seats, but Gaetz will need backing from a majority of the chamber to win confirmation.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Gaetz as his pick for attorney general last week, after which the Florida Republican resigned his seat from Congress. But the selection and Gaetz's resignation came two days before the House Ethics Committee was poised to meet and vote on whether to make public its report detailing the findings of its long-running investigation into allegations Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "The Republican has denied wrongdoing and called the Ethics probe a \"smear.\" He has blamed the investigation on former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whom\u00a0Gaetz helped oust last year. Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesman for Trump's transition, said in a statement Monday that \"Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He's the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.\"",
      "Trump told reporters Tuesday that he is not reconsidering his selection for attorney general.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune met with Gaetz on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Thune confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The spokesperson said the two met \"to discuss the Senate confirmation process, and he reiterated that Mr. Gaetz deserves a fair and transparent process, something that all of President Trump's nominees deserve.\"",
      "The news of the meeting was first reported by Punchbowl.",
      "Gaetz and Vance also met with Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, John Kennedy of Louisiana, and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas. The seven sit on the Judiciary Committee, which will conduct Gaetz's confirmation hearings early next year. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa also met with Gaetz and Vance on Wednesday.",
      "Hawley told CBS News that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the need to get a confirmation hearing and ensure that Gaetz gets an opportunity \"to respond in public, under oath.\" Hawley outlined that he thinks Gaetz has talked to every member of the Judiciary Committee and many other senators who do not sit on the committee. He said he expects Gaetz to meet with all 53 incoming Republicans over the coming weeks.",
      "\"President Trump is very committed to moving this forward. And I know there's been some speculation among my colleagues that maybe this wouldn't actually go to a confirmation hearing, but they want one, and I think they're absolutely entitled to have that,\" he said. \"Gaetz wants the opportunity to testify, to respond to critics, answer questions, talk about his vision for the department.\"",
      "Hawley is likely to vote for all of Trump's nominees, he said, and believes there will be \"no shortage of information\" about Gaetz available for senators.",
      "At least one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, said she has not been asked to meet with Gaetz yet. Collins is among the most moderate members of the conference, and her vote could be critical to Gaetz's confirmation. She previously said she was \"shocked\" by his selection.",
      "After his meeting with Gaetz, Graham said that while he tends to defer to presidential Cabinet choices \"unless the evidence suggests disqualification,\" the process for Trump's selections \"will not be a rubber stamp, nor will it be driven by a lynch mob.\"",
      "\"I fear the process surrounding the Gaetz nomination is turning into an angry mob, and unverified allegations are being treated as if they are true. I have seen this movie before,\" he said, an apparent reference to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process in 2018. \"I would urge all of my Senate colleagues, particularly Republicans, not to join the lynch mob and give the process a chance to move forward.\"",
      "Lee, speaking with reporters following his meeting with Gaetz, said Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation hearings should be a \"warning\" amid the allegations against the Florida Republican.",
      "\"There were a lot of allegations thrown at Brett Kavanaugh that turned out to be uncorroborated in many, many instances,\" Lee said. \"And so I do think that is something of a voice of warning people ought to take. Just because allegations are made, and just because people talk a lot about them \u2014 and sometimes in a fit of politically driven eagerness to embrace them, assume their\u00a0 truth \u2014 doesn't mean that they are, in fact, true.\"",
      "Kavanaugh was accused of engaging in sexual misconduct decades earlier and vehemently denied the accusations. The Judiciary Committee held a set of extraordinary hearings that included testimony from Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed he assaulted her during a party when they were in high school in the 1980s. Classmates who were at the party, however, could not corroborate Ford's allegations. Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate in a 50-48 vote, the narrowest margin in more than a century.",
      "Gaetz has been under investigation for several years by the House Ethics Committee and Justice Department, which looked into allegations of sex trafficking and obstruction. Prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz last year.",
      "Ten of the 11 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee asked FBI Director Chris Wray to turn over the full evidentiary file in the now-closed federal sex trafficking probe involving Gaetz.",
      "\"The Senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on presidential nominees, and it is crucial that we review all the information necessary to fulfill this duty as we consider Mr. Gaetz's nomination,\" the Democratic senators wrote in a letter to Wray. \"The grave public allegations against Mr. Gaetz speak directly to his fitness to serve as the chief law enforcement officer for the federal government.\"",
      "The Ethics Committee said in June that it had spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas and reviewed thousands of pages of documents as part of its investigation. It said in a rare statement that \"certain allegations\" merited continued review, among those the claims of sexual misconduct and drug use, accepting improper gifts, giving \"special privileges and favors\" and obstructing government investigations into his conduct.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News at the time that four women testified to the Ethics panel that they had been paid to go to parties, which Gaetz attended, that included sex and drugs. A lawyer for two women who spoke with the panel told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the panel.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs. One of Leppard's clients testified before the Ethics Committee that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old against a game table during a July 2017 party, months after he was sworn in as a House member.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Ethics Committee, meeting to consider the release of a report on its investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, did not reach an agreement on Wednesday afternoon, the committee chairman said.",
      "The meeting came one week after the Florida Republican resigned from Congress following President-elect Donald Trump's decision to select him for attorney general.",
      "House Ethics Committee chairman Michael Guest told reporters that the panel had not reached an \"agreement to release the report\" as he exited the meeting Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Guest told CBS News that he voted against the release of the report, saying \"the committee no longer has jurisdiction on the issue so I disagreed with the release of the information.\"",
      "The committee's other members did not comment on the more than two-hour meeting as they exited.",
      "Rep. Susan Wild, the ranking Democrat on the committee, addressed reporters after Guest's comments, saying the committee members had agreed not to discuss what transpired at the meeting. She said Guest had \"betrayed the process\" by disclosing the deliberations, expressing frustration at the implication that there was unanimity among the panel.",
      "Wild said the idea that the committee had reached an agreement not to move forward was \"untrue.\" She noted that in order to move something forward in the evenly divided committee, a member has to cross party lines and vote with the other side.",
      "\"There was no consensus on this issue,\" she continued. \"We did agree that we would reconvene as a committee on Dec. 5 to further consider this matter.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Gaetz and Vice President-elect JD Vance met Wednesday with a number of Senate Republicans in the Capitol as they look to shore up support for his nomination. When asked by reporters Wednesday evening  for his reaction to the developments from the Ethics Committee, Gaetz said he wasn't paying much attention to the panel.",
      "\"I'll be honest with you, I've been focused on what we got to do to reform the Department of Justice,\" Gaetz said. \"I have been meeting with senators. I haven't been paying much attention to that.\"",
      "Gaetz said he was looking forward to his confirmation hearing in the Senate.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune also met with Gaetz Wednesday, a spokesperson for Thune confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The spokesperson said that the two met \"to discuss the Senate confirmation process, and he reiterated that Mr. Gaetz deserves a fair and transparent process, something that all of President Trump's nominees deserve.\"",
      "The news of the meeting was first reported by Punchbowl.",
      "The House Ethics Committee, which is made up of five Republicans and five Democrats, had been investigating allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. The investigation first began in 2021, but was put on pause as the Justice Department conducted a sex trafficking and obstruction probe of Gaetz. Last year, the Ethics Committee resumed its work, after the DOJ declined to charge Gaetz, who has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The panel has faced growing pressure to release the potentially damaging report following Trump's announcement, as the Senate gears up for a fight over the president-elect's most controversial Cabinet picks seeking confirmation. Before the move, the committee had planned to meet Friday for a vote on whether to release the report, sources told CBS News. But Gaetz's resignation from the House ended the committee's jurisdiction, complicating the path forward since normally reports on former members are not released.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson himself urged the committee not to release the report, warning last week of the \"terrible precedent\" the move would set, opening \"Pandora's box.\" But the committee's top Democrat has advocated for the report to be released, while senators on both sides of the aisle have pushed for it to be made available to the Senate Judiciary Committee as the chamber looks to exercise its advice and consent role over Trump's Cabinet selections. On Wednesday morning, Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee also sent a letter to the FBI requesting Gaetz's complete evidentiary file related to the investigation into alleged sex trafficking of minors.",
      "In June, the Ethics Committee said as part of its investigation, it had spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas and reviewed thousands of pages of documents. It noted that \"certain allegations\" merited continued review, including claims of sexual misconduct, drug use and obstructing government investigations into his conduct, among others.",
      "A lawyer for two women who spoke with the committee told CBS News that the women testified to the committee that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and noted that Venmo transactions related to the encounters had been obtained by the panel. One of the attorney's clients testified that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old during a July 2017 party.",
      "The Ethics Committee's move on Wednesday comes as Senate Republicans, who flipped the upper chamber in the 2024 elections, are set to hold a narrow majority in the new Congress, bolstering Trump's agenda and likely helping to streamline confirmation of his administration and judicial nominees. But their majority is a narrow one, putting the fate of Trump's more controversial picks \u2014 such as Gaetz \u2014 up in the air.",
      "Trump said on Tuesday that he is not reconsidering his selection of Gaetz for attorney general.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 17:46:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Conspiracies persist, although it is effectively impossible to steal a major election in the United States.",
    "story": [
      "We just had another election with a clear and verifiable victor, overseen by hundreds of thousands of election officials. Those public servants have suffered years of harassment, and despite their successes, are still being accused of taking part in a massive and impossible conspiracy \u2014 a conspiracy led by the party out of power to steal an election and cover up all evidence.",
      "Despite all evidence, many still believe that the opposition Democrats secretly overwhelmed the power of the Trump administration in 2020 to steal an election by 7 million popular votes and 70 electoral votes. And they believe that the Biden administration suddenly lost this mythical election-stealing power while controlling the executive branch in 2024.",
      "Within hours of President-elect Donald\u00a0Trump's projected victory in the 2024 election, conspiracy theories began to spread among those who opposed him. On the left, there were claims that \"the math just didn't add up,\" that 20 million ballots were \"missing\" or that Elon Musk's Starlink was uploading fake votes to help Trump. There was mischaracterization about why voters might split their votes between Trump and a Democrat.",
      "On the right, from those who supported Trump came claims that the \"20 million missing ballots\" were actually proof that the 2020 election had been stolen and that there was no possible way that President Biden could have received 81 million votes that year.",
      "For those who work in elections, and particularly the election officials around the country \u2014 public servants of both parties \u2014 these claims are familiar, and exhausting. And to be clear, these claims are false on their face.",
      "Millions of ballots weren't missing \u2013 they were being counted, and when the election is officially certified, we will confirm that the 2024 election saw only slightly lower turnout than 2020's all-time record. For those questioning \"missing votes,\" the 2024 election will end up seeing the second-largest number of ballots cast in any American election, and the second-highest turnout in any election in over 100 years, behind only 2020's record turnout.",
      "As for split votes, that happens all the time. Sometimes, as in 2020, there are a large number of voters who dislike both presidential candidates and choose to leave that race blank on their ballots. Sometimes, as in 2024, a significant number of people vote only for president, and leave the rest of their ballots blank. This is normal. Republicans in Arizona, Nevada, and Wisconsin didn't game the system to give Trump a win this year while allowing Democratic senators to win in each of those states. Democrats in 2020 didn't rig the system to defeat Trump that year, only to then give up key seats in state legislatures right before redistricting that would decide control of Congress. And we have the paper ballots that confirm this.",
      "And those paper ballots are the key. Trump won in 2024 in a verified, confirmed election with over 95% paper ballots, including all the ballots in all the swing states. Hand audits of those ballots are nearly complete and will confirm the results.",
      "Similarly, Mr. Biden won in 2020 in a verified, confirmed election with over 95% audited paper ballots, including all the ballots in all the swing states. The math adds up because the ballots add up, and the election officials have shown their work.",
      "We know who won the last two presidential elections, thanks to the paper ballots, audits, and more election litigation and court review than any election in world history. In dozens of court cases, losing candidates couldn't produce a single piece of evidence that raised any question about the 2020 election outcome.",
      "When Rudy Giuliani and Kari Lake were sued for defamation about their false claims, they could have defended themselves with evidence that they were speaking the truth. Instead, they conceded liability (Giuliani's assets have begun to be seized, and Lake just settled her case this past weekend). Fox News settled its defamation case with Dominion Voting Systems for nearly $800 million, rather than attempt to present evidence of the truth of its claims. A group of esteemed conservative legal scholars further confirmed the 2020 election was \"Lost, not Stolen.\"",
      "But whether coming from the right or the left, the conspiracies continue, and our nation's election officials are concerned about the lasting damage. Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer of the Georgia Secretary of State's office told me, \"Ideas that Musk's Starlink or black box voting might change votes plant seeds that will germinate into deeper conspiracy theories, and then further undermine faith in elections and institutions.\"",
      "Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates confirmed, \"People who push conspiracy theories without basis that tabulation machines have been breached or that dead people have voted by the thousands do harm to our democracy, regardless of whether the allegations come from the right, left or the middle of the political spectrum.\"",
      "Our elections are incredibly decentralized, with nearly 10,000 different election jurisdictions nationwide, varying in technologies and processes. Our process is run by hundreds of thousands of election officials nationwide, of both parties. Every voter registration requires ID under federal law, and our voter records are as accurate as ever. In the exceedingly rare cases where fraud is attempted, it is caught and prosecuted. It is effectively impossible to steal a major election in the United States.",
      "But foreign adversaries and domestic grifters understand how to exploit concerns about the security of American elections. They have employed a more effective strategy, to convince us against all evidence that our elections are being stolen. They have become masters at leveraging the losing side's disappointment at the outcome to create a fantasy world of election denial and to stoke fear, anger and hate directed at our fellow citizens, including our public servants. We saw on Jan. 6, 2021,\u00a0how this anger can lead to violence.",
      "Entertaining these delusions could threaten our agency as voters. Worse, our susceptibility to these false claims aids U.S. adversaries, and puts public servants at risk. If we become a nation where both parties can only accept the integrity of our election system when they win, we are truly lost as a democracy.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:10:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Some voters are hoping President-elect Donald Trump may send out another stimulus check. Here's what the experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump in his first term as president sent out two stimulus checks to millions of Americans during the pandemic, part of the federal government's goal of keeping consumers financially afloat during the crisis. Now, some social media posts are claiming that Trump, once he takes office next year, may issue another check \u2014 a likelihood that experts say is extremely slim.",
      "Posts on TikTok are suggesting Trump might issue another round of checks, while on X, some users are questioning if they're in line for a payment.",
      "When the COVID-19 health emergency shuttered the economy in 2020, millions of Americans lost their jobs, sending the jobless rate to almost 15% and causing financial hardship for many. As a result, Trump signed two bills that sent stimulus checks to eligible households, while President Biden authorized a third.",
      "Even though many Americans feel the economy is faring badly, with some pointing to the impact of the pandemic's high inflation, the U.S. isn't anywhere close to the situation of the early 2020s, economists say.",
      "\"Stimulus checks typically only happen when the economy is in really bad shape and consumers need a push to start spending money again,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not really the case in the present.\"",
      "Is the economy bad enough for a new stimulus check?",
      "While a majority of Americans give the economy poor ratings, economists say that it's in good shape overall, with solid GDP growth, inflation that is inching closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal and a jobless rate of 4.1% \u2014 which is near a 50-year low.",
      "\"Despite some pain points and general 'bad vibes' expressed by some people, the economy is currently in remarkably good shape and consumer spending is relatively strong,\" Channel said.",
      "Even so, many inflation-weary consumers say they haven't yet seen the benefit of that growth. The November 5 presidential election was viewed as a mandate from voters for a new economic direction.",
      "Could Trump issue a stimulus check?",
      "While some consumers might believe that Trump or Biden alone was responsible for sending out stimulus checks \u2014 perhaps because Trump put his name on the memo line of the first check \u2014 the payments were part of three bills passed by Congress, which were then sent to the sitting president for his signature.",
      "\"A president can't unilaterally issue stimulus checks, and the ones sent out during his last administration were largely the result of a push from Democrats in the House and Senate,\" Channel noted. \"Though Trump ultimately did sign the bill that sent stimulus checks to Americans, he isn't solely responsible for them.\"",
      "In other words, there would first need to be legislation passed by Congress to authorize another stimulus check, something that currently isn't on the horizon.",
      "Would a stimulus check impact inflation?",
      "With the Federal Reserve still aiming to pare inflation to a 2% annual rate \u2014 it stood at 2.6% last month \u2014 policymakers are likely to be cautious about any actions that could reignite inflation. Some economists have pointed to the surge in federal spending during the pandemic as\u00a0helping to create the conditions that led to the hottest inflation in 40 years.",
      "\"Because inflation is still such a big concern at the moment, the last thing a reasonable government would want to do is further stimulate consumer demand with stimulus checks because doing so would unnecessarily risk causing a resurgence in inflation,\" Channel noted.",
      "That being said, Trump's economic policies, including adding tariffs to imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could cause an inflation bump of as much of 1 percentage point, economists have said. That would push inflation to a range of about 3.6%, which Wall Street cautions could cause the Fed to hold off on further rate cuts.",
      "Could the IRS issue stimulus checks in 2024?",
      "The IRS sent the three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks after they were authorized by Congress and signed into law by Trump and Biden. In other words, without Congress' approval, the IRS won't be sending any stimulus checks in 2024.",
      "Currently there is no legislation in the works for stimulus spending, and such legislation is also considered extremely unlikely to occur in 2025. Instead, Trump and Republican lawmakers are likely to focus on tax legislation to extend the tax cuts in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as well as tackling other spending issues, experts say.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 10:48:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Director of Pentagon office probing UFOs showed Congress 3 cases it's resolved, but also discussed 3 \u2014 out of nearly two dozen \u2014 still under active investigation.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon office investigating UFOs, or what the government calls unidentified anomalous phenomena, resolved one of its most prominent cases \u2014 nicknamed \"GOFAST\" \u2014 its director told Congress in a hearing on Tuesday. (It's the last one listed on the office's website here).",
      "The GOFAST video was made public in 2017 and shows what appears to be an object flying at a high speed just above water, but Dr. Jon Kosloski, the director of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, told Congress the object depicted is not actually too unusual.",
      "\"Through a very careful geospatial intelligence analysis and using trigonometry, we assess with high confidence that the object is not actually close to the water, but is rather closer to 13,000 feet,\" Kosloski said.",
      "Kosloski did not identify the object, but he said that a \"trick of the eye\" called parallax made the object appear anomalous \u2014 or out of the ordinary \u2014 when it was not. He said a detailed report on parallax will be available on the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office website.",
      "The \"GOFAST\" video was recorded by a fighter jet from the USS Theodore Roosevelt off the East coast of the U.S. and made public in 2017.",
      "Former F/A-18 pilot Ryan Graves, who has spoken with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" about UAP sightings and later founded Americans for Safe Aerospace, told NBC News Now in an interview after the hearing that the Pentagon should continue to investigate the GOFAST case.",
      "\"I would argue that some of these cases aren't quote unquote debunked or no longer of interest, specifically the GOFAST video itself was never really interesting because it was going fast,\" Graves said. \"The pilots certainly didn't say that, nor did they name the video. If anything, the Pentagon simply debunked their own naming for that video.\"",
      "Graves also said there were more objects in the air at the time than the one depicted in the GOFAST video. The Pentagon is still investigating another video nicknamed GIMBAL that was taken around the time of the GOFAST video.",
      "After providing examples to Congress of two other resolved cases the Defense Department calls \"The Puerto Rico Objects\" and \"Mt. Etna,\" Kosloski described cases his office is still actively investigating, notably, an \"orange orb\" and \"a metallic cylinder.\"",
      "These cases are likely part of the 21 cases that the recently released annual unidentified aerial phenomena report said contain enough information and data for the office to actively investigate.",
      "One case was reported by a law enforcement officer \"out West\" who observed \"a large orange orb floating several hundred feet above the ground,\" according to Kosloski.",
      "As the officer approached where he thought the orb would be, he saw \"a blacker than black object\" that was about the size of a Prius. When he reached a distance of 40-60 meters away from the object, it tilted 45 degrees and shot up vertically, traveling faster than any drone he had seen before.",
      "Just as it left his field of view, it emitted bright red and blue lights that lit up the inside of his vehicle \"as brightly as if someone had set off fireworks just outside of his vehicle,\" Kosloski told Congress.",
      "Another case was reported from the southeastern part of the United States after two cars driven by government contractors left a facility around 9 a.m. and saw \"a large metallic cylinder about the size of a commercial airplane.\"",
      "After they observed it for 15-20 seconds, it disappeared.",
      "\"Obviously an object that large and stationary \u2014 unless it's a blimp \u2014 is unusual but then disappearing, we can't explain how that would happen,\" Kosloski said.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 19:00:22 -0500",
    "summary": "As he gets ready to retire, GOP Rep. Brad Wenstrup often thinks about the day Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the House Republican leaders, was shot during a baseball practice.",
    "story": [
      "As Rep. Brad Wenstrup prepares for his retirement in six weeks, he often recalls one day in particular. He was prone on the ground, face down in the grass, with a baseball helmet on his head.",
      "The piercing sounds of screaming, gunfire and chaos surrounded him, persisting for several minutes. When it finally quieted, Wenstrup sprang to his feet and ran to his gravely injured colleague, GOP Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House majority whip, a few hundred feet away.",
      "With each stride that day in June 2017, Wenstrup said he was consumed by the memories of Iraq from 12 years earlier. And as Wenstrup, a decorated combat surgeon, made his run along the field to provide help to his colleague, Wenstrup pictured the patient he and his surgical team were not able to save 12 years earlier.",
      "This time would be different, Wenstrup hoped.",
      "He not only helped save the patient, but along with emergency responders, played a key role in heading off a political assassination.",
      "Wenstrup, who was elected to Congress from suburban Cincinnati in 2012, helped treat Scalise, who had been shot by a gunman who opened fire at a House Republican baseball practice just before their 2017 annual congressional baseball game against Democrats.",
      "\"I saw the entry wound from the bullet, but I didn't see an exit wound, so I knew he was in trouble,\" Wenstrup said. \"I had no doubt he was bleeding internally. I knew that if I couldn't stop the bleeding, I at least needed to get him to drink fluids.\" He began applying pressure to slow the bleeding and talking to Scalise to keep him alert and conscious.",
      "Scalise had suffered a shot to his hip. His femur was shattered and his pelvis severely damaged.",
      "Scalise recalled some of the immediate aftermath of the shooting and of Wenstrup's care. He told CBS News, \"He was putting pressure on the spot where the bullet went in. He then ultimately put a tourniquet on. And you know, later, my trauma surgeon told me that tourniquet saved my life.\" Wenstrup had improvised a tourniquet with a belt and bandages to help slow the blood flow until Scalise was ushered away by emergency responders.",
      "After he was airlifted to George Washington University hospital for emergency surgery, Scalise would spend several days unconscious. Grueling rehabilitation and reconstructive surgeries helped Scalise walk again.",
      "With little fanfare last year, Wenstrup announced his retirement from Congress, which takes effect Jan. 3, 2025. Amid a wave of retirements of longtime members of Congress and a sea change in Washington after the 2024 elections, Wenstrup's departure has been overlooked by some.",
      "But not by Scalise or by many of Wenstrup's House colleagues.",
      "\"He's such a man of high integrity,\" Scalise told CBS News. \"He's respected by his colleagues. He's a chairman of a committee. He could have done even more things here in Congress, and his constituents would have elected him overwhelmingly. But he also knew it's time.\"",
      "The man who opened fire on Scalise and his fellow Republicans was killed after an exchange of gunfire with a Capitol Police protective detail assigned to Scalise, who was given an additional protection as a member of House leadership. Gunman James Hodgkinson acted alone and was not connected to terrorism, federal investigators determined. He was carrying an SKS rifle and a 9 mm handgun when he opened fire.",
      "Wenstrup is haunted by thoughts of the carnage that could have ensued if Scalise and the police unit had not been at the practice to protect the group.",
      "\"There were 136 rounds fired. I don't think most people know that,\" Wenstrup said. \"If Steve Scalise wasn't there and didn't take a bullet for all of us, then there's no (security) detail there.\" Wenstrup said the gunman could have killed 20 to 30 members of Congress and staff.\"",
      "As he performed the initial emergency medical triage on Scalise, Wenstrup recalled eerily similar images from 12 years earlier, when he was deployed as a military doctor at Abu Ghraib in Iraq. He served in the U.S. Army Reserves in Iraq in the months before the troop surge. One day, a soldier was grievously wounded nearby and was rushed to Wenstrup's post for surgery.",
      "Wenstrup said the victim was a servicemember who had likely been hit by an improvised explosive device. \u00a0 \"He was badly hit. There was no doubt about it, but he was still alive, and he was intubated and on the table,\" Wenstrup recalled, sitting back in his chair and lowering the volume of his voice as he shared the account.",
      "\"It was a blunt injury. There severed arteries internally and his blood pressure started dropping,\" Wenstrup said, \"We opened him up, went in and there was blood everywhere. And we couldn't stop. We couldn't stop it.\"",
      "\"We were just really distraught after that one,\" Wenstrup said. \"And that was going through my mind when I was with (Scalise) on that field.\"",
      "He urged arriving medics to rush an IV to Scalise, to ensure he stayed hydrated. The flashbacks to Iraq and 2005 continued. But this was different from that patient 12 years earlier, Wenstrup told himself. Scalise had not suffered the same blunt force trauma.",
      "In a 2018 interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Scalise recalled, \"In a weird way, your body kind of goes numb. You know, as bad as the wounds were, and obviously I know now how severe it was. At the time, I guess my body had been shutting down a lot of the real pain. And I was just thinking about what was going on at the moment.\"",
      "The surgeons who saved Scalise at the hospital would credit Wenstrup with effective care at the shooting site, Scalise said.",
      "Wenstrup's efforts to help save Scalise also had an untold impact on America, averting a would-be assassination and any cascading impact it would have inflicted upon the nation.",
      "Wenstrup said he and Scalise were casual acquaintances before the shooting. They later became friends \u2014 and roommates at a house in Washington, D.C., sharing a living quarters on days when Congress is in session.",
      "\"We are just very, very tight in our friendship,\" Scalise told CBS News. \"I've really gotten to know him and his wife. They're just wonderful people.\"",
      "Wenstrup's congressional career is ending amid uniquely toxic politics in the House. His departure comes as members of Congress complain of a loss of civility and cross-party relationships. Some of his Democratic colleagues told CBS News that Wenstrup's departure will deprive the House of another of its more civil members.",
      "\"People will miss Brad up here, including me,\" Rep. Greg Landsman, an Ohio Democrat told CBS News. \"He leads with his heart and cares about making things happen for the people he serves. I love the guy.\"",
      "But Wenstrup has engaged in some heated political battles, including in the closing months of his career. In June, a House subcommittee chaired by Wenstrup, held a charged and animated hearing questioning Dr. Anthony Fauci, focusing on Fauci's response to the COVID pandemic.",
      "Wenstrup accused Fauci of running an office that was \"unaccountable to the American people.\" Wenstrup's panel pursued Fauci's personal emails and staged a two-day, 14-hour closed door deposition that Wenstrup characterized as \"cordial\" but pressing.",
      "Democrats accused Wenstrup's subcommittee of spreading misinformation about Fauci. The subcommittee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Raul Ruiz of California, said in his opening statement, \"After 15 months, the select subcommittee still does not possess a shred of evidence to substantiate these extreme allegations that Republicans have levied against Dr. Fauci for nearly four years.\"",
      "Sitting at a small table in the lobby of his office suite in the Rayburn House Office Building, Wenstrup recalled his blistering testimony during hearings into the formation of the House Jan. 6 select committee, which investigated the Capitol siege.",
      "Wenstrup criticized Democratic leaders for not including a review of the baseball field shooting in the Jan. 6 committee's work. \"If the shooting killed 20 to 30 members of Congress, it would have changed the balance of power in the House of Representatives against the will of the people. That's an insurrection. You're throwing around that word? That's an insurrection, I said. So, if you're truly interested in protecting this beautiful Capitol and those who work in here, then we should make this part of this commission as well.\"",
      "Many of the other congressional Republicans who were on the field at the 2017 baseball practice shooting have long since departed, including those who were defeated in elections or retired. Gov. Ron DeSantis, who represented Florida, and former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona are among those who have left.",
      "Wenstrup's colleagues gave him a standing ovation on the House floor in September 2017, when Scalise returned to duties at the Capitol.",
      "But Wenstrup's retirement contributes to an unexpected dynamic. Among the officeholders from the shooting spree who are still in the House is the man who was hit. Scalise is expected to serve another term in 2025 as the House majority leader.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:41:28 -0500",
    "summary": "A volcano erupted in southern Iceland, near the town of Grindav\u00edk and the Blue Lagoon spa, marking the region's seventh eruption in a year.",
    "story": [
      "A volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula in Iceland flared again late Wednesday night, marking the region's seventh eruption in just one year.",
      "Lava burst from a crack in the ground before midnight local time, originating in a spot where there has been a resurgence of volcanic activity. It happened quickly and sent a molten stream traveling toward the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's most famous tourist attraction. It's a geothermal spa set in a lava field just outside the town of Grindav\u00edk that draws nearly a million visitors each year.",
      "Tourists were evacuated from the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's national broadcaster R\u00daV\u00a0reported. Some can be seen venturing startlingly close to the magma, in an apparent effort to capture the eruption on their phones, in a video published by the broadcaster. Response crews ushered them to safety before the magma roiled farther over the area, covering a section of the parking lot adjacent to the Blue Lagoon as well as a critical pipeline that funnels hot water from a geothermal power station, called Svartsengi, into the spa and around the peninsula.",
      "Striking aerial footage of the situation also published by R\u00daV showed the expanse of the eruption. Fiery magma blankets the ground in the video, and thick smoke rises from it into the air.",
      "People were evacuated from about 50 homes Wednesday in Grindav\u00edk, a small fishing town on Iceland's southern peninsula, according to the country's Civil Protection Agency. The agency said it was unclear exactly which volcano was erupting, but noted the lava came from the same area experiencing volcanic activity.\u00a0Grindav\u00edk is some 30 miles south of Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland's capital city. Icelandic officials have not reported issues in the capital caused by the eruption.",
      "Officials said Thursday that volcanic activity was ongoing, with seismic monitors indicating the magma had spread over at least 7 square kilometers of land, slightly less than 4 1/2 square miles. The Njar\u00f0v\u00edk pipeline could still function Thursday beneath the magma, said the Icelandic Meteorological Office. Magma had crossed the road into Grindav\u00edk when the office shared its most recent update, but the eruption's peak had seemingly passed by then and the fissure from which it originated had shortened, according to measurements taken by the National Police Commissioner's special forces unit.",
      "Earthquakes in the area caused the ground to split and triggered the volcano, the office said. Iceland is situated on top of a rift between two tectonic plates, which makes the island nation vulnerable to\u00a0earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which have rocked portions of the country and displaced residents in recent years.",
      "It was the seventh time Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula experienced a volcanic eruption since December 2023, with multiple previous flares breaking out over the summer. Officials said the latest eruption was less severe than the last one, which happened in August and resulted in multiple ground fissures as well as a subsequent 4.1-magnitude earthquake. The August incident came just two months after an eruption continued spewing lava for more than three weeks.",
      "At the time, a regional police chief told Icelandic media that most of Grindav\u00edk's 4,000 residents had evacuated from their homes the prior November when the spell of volcanic activity started to kick up. While some had returned part-time to the town, few were comfortable staying overnight, the police chief said. Those who had returned were successfully evacuated.",
      "Before the Mount Fagradalsfjall eruption in March 2021, the Reykjanes peninsula had not seen volcanic activity in roughly 800 years. Since then, seismologists have carefully observed the reawakening of a long-dormant fault line running under the landscape.",

      "Medford, Oregon \u2014 In the heart of Southern Oregon's Fremont-Winema National Forest, crews are going to new heights to harvest a precious commodity.",
      "\"We're looking for the ripe cones on the top of the tree,\" said Brian Kittler, chief program officer for the Resilient Forests program at the nonprofit conservation group American Forests.",
      "Using lift operators and climbers, Kittler and his team showed CBS News how his team hunts for pine cones.",
      "\"The more that we lose forest, we're losing our clean air and clean water, our ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere and address climate change,\" Kittler said.",
      "The threat comes from the West's unprecedented breed of megafires which, fueled by climate change, have destroyed more than 33 million acres since 2020, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That's around the size of the state of Arkansas.",
      "If nothing is done to restore a forest after a wildfire, a vicious cycle begins. Fewer surviving trees means fewer pine cones for humans to pick and plant. That's what happened in the Fremont-Winema National Forest during the Barry Point Fire in 2012, Kittler said.",
      "\"There's basically no live trees, and there's no natural regeneration happening,\" Kittler said.",
      "Once the pine cones are collected, they're brought to a network of nurseries, where the seeds are extracted and grown into seedlings. One million seedlings will plant about 4,500 acres of new forest.",
      "But the program alone is not enough to restore the forest, said Brian Reatini, a geneticist with the U.S. Forest Service. He says they're short about 200,000 acres \u2014 and that's just in one part of Oregon.",
      "The warming environment also means fewer seedlings will likely grow to maturity, which takes about 20 years.",
      "\"It's become much more arid, hotter and dryer. One of the consequences of that, it can push trees towards the edge of what they can physiologically tolerate,\" Reatini said.",
      "To help combat that problem, they're sourcing seeds from more \"drought tolerant\" tree species.",

    "story": [
      "Giraffe populations are in trouble \u2014 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday proposed listing three subspecies of the tall animals as endangered and two species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their populations have been declining because of poaching, habitat loss and climate change, officials said. While giraffes are not native to the U.S., listing them under the act would still provide protections to giraffe populations.",
      "The Endangered Species Act, enacted in 1973, establishes protections for fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Under the act, federal agencies are required to ensure their actions are unlikely to jeopardize listed species, according to the agency.",
      "\"Federal protections for giraffes will help protect a vulnerable species, foster biodiversity, support ecosystem health, combat wildlife trafficking, and promote sustainable economic practices,\" USFWS Director Martha Williams said in a press release. \"This action supports giraffe conservation while ensuring the United States does not contribute further to their decline.\"",
      "Specifically, officials said the listing would help giraffes by reducing the illegal hunting and trade of giraffes by requiring permits for import into the U.S. Trade is not the primary factor behind population decline, but it is playing a role, USFWS said. Their hair and tails have long been used in traditional medicine, the agency added, and in recent years giraffes have also been targeted by hunters for bushmeat.",
      "Listing them under the Endangered Species Act would also increase funding for species conservation in range countries and for research efforts to address conservation. It would also provide some limited financial support for developing and managing programs to conserve giraffes, the USFWS said.",
      "Giraffe subspecies from across Africa are at risk, according to the agency. The service proposed listing West African, Kordofan and Nubian giraffes as endangered. It also proposed listing Masai and reticulated giraffes as threatened.",
      "The West African, Kordofan and Nubian \u2014 all subspecies of the northern giraffe \u2014 have seen their population fall around 77% since 1985, according to federal officials. There are around 5,900 left, including only about 690 West African giraffes remain.",
      "The vast majority of reticulated giraffes live in Kenya, and their population is estimated at 15,985, according to USFWS. There are around 45,400 Masai giraffes \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to 67% of their population in the 1970s.",
      "Giraffes feed on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits, so human population growth and habitat loss can hurt the species. Instances of drought have also led to increased human-wildlife conflicts.",

      "An endangered fin whale that washed up near a coastal trail in Alaska's largest city has attracted curious onlookers while biologists seek answers as to what caused the animal's death.",
      "The carcass found over the weekend near Anchorage was 47 feet (14.3 meters) long \u2014 comparable to the width of a college basketball court \u2014 and female, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration biologists.",
      "Barbara Mahoney, a NOAA biologist examining the whale, told the Anchorage Daily News the whale was likely 1 to 3 years old.",
      "Fin whales are the second-largest whale species, according to NOAA Fisheries, and fully grown can reach up to 85 feet long and weigh between 40 tons and 80 tons. Strikes by ships, entanglements in\u00a0fishing gear, underwater noise and the effects of climate change are among the threats that fin whales face, according to the agency.",
      "Mandy Keogh, a NOAA marine mammal stranding coordinator, said fin whales generally aren't seen this close to Anchorage and that recent high tides may have pushed the animal further into the Knik Arm.",
      "People trekked across the mudflats to see the whale, which NOAA biologists and staff from Alaska Veterinary Pathology Services had anchored to the shore Sunday so they would be able to gather samples from the animal. But even after samples are analyzed, it can be difficult to determine a cause of death because of decomposition or a lack of obvious injuries, Keogh said.",
      "Daisy Grandlinard was among the parents who accompanied a group of children to see the whale Monday. As they drew closer, they could smell it, she said.",
      "\"It was really interesting for the kids to be able to feel it, touch the bottom because it kind of had tracks on it, like a sled almost. And just to see the size of it, that was pretty cool,\" she said. \"We had already studied whales a couple of weeks ago, so it was fun to see one in person and say, 'Oh, that's what the baleen looks like in real life,' and 'Where is the blow hole?'\"",
      "Biologists hoped to complete their work Tuesday, untether the carcass and \"let the tide push it or move it,\" Mahoney said. \"Whatever it does or doesn't do \u2014 we don't know.\"",

    "story": [
      "Parts of the Great Barrer Reef have suffered the highest coral mortality on record, Australian research showed Tuesday, with scientists fearing the rest of it has suffered a similar fate.",
      "The Australian Institute of Marine Science said surveys of 12 reefs found up to 72 percent coral mortality, thanks to a summer of mass bleaching, two cyclones, and flooding.",
      "In one northern section of the reef, about a third of hard coral had died, the \"largest annual decline\" in 39 years of government monitoring, the agency said.",
      "Often dubbed the world's largest living structure, the Great Barrier Reef is a 1,400-mile expanse of tropical corals that house a stunning array of biodiversity.",
      "But repeated mass bleaching events have threatened to rob the tourist drawcard of its wonder, turning banks of once-vibrant corals into a sickly shade of white.",
      "Bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise and the coral expels microscopic algae, known as zooxanthellae, to survive.",
      "If high temperatures persist, the coral can eventually turn white and die.",
      "This year had already been confirmed as the fifth mass bleaching on the reef in the past eight years.",
      "But this latest survey also found a rapid-growing type of coral -- known as acropora -- had suffered the highest rate of death.",
      "This coral is quick to grow, but one of the first to bleach.",
      "Lead researcher Mike Emslie told public broadcaster ABC the past summer was \"one of the most severe events\" across the Great Barrier Reef, with heat stress levels surpassing previous events.",
      "\"These are serious impacts. These are serious losses,\" he said.",
      "World Wildlife Fund-Australia's head of oceans, Richard Leck, said the initial surveys confirmed his \"worst fears.\"",
      "\"The Great Barrier Reef can bounce back but there are limits to its resilience,\" he said. \"It can't get repeatedly hammered like this. We are fast approaching a tipping point.\"",
      "Leck added the area surveyed was \"relatively small\" and feared that when the full report was released next year \"similar levels of mortality\" would be observed.",
      "He said the findings reinforced Australia's need to commit to stronger emission reduction targets of at least 90 percent below 2005 levels by 2035 and move away from fossil fuels.",
      "The country is one of the world's largest gas and coal exporters and has only recently set targets to become carbon neutral.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump was on hand with Elon Musk for the sixth test flight of SpaceX's huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump and newly-minted\u00a0efficiency czar\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0looking on, SpaceX launched the world's most powerful rocket on its sixth test flight Tuesday, an up-and-down trip to space by a gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship to evaluate a variety of safety and performance upgrades.",
      "Shattering the afternoon calm with an ear-splitting roar, the huge 30-foot-wide, 397-foot-tall rocket blasted off from Musk's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test facility on the Gulf Coast near Brownsville at 5 p.m. EST, the opening of a 30-minute launch window.",
      "With its 33 Raptor engines gulping 40,000 pounds of liquid oxygen and methane fuel per second, the Super Heavy-Starship majestically climbed away to the east over the Gulf of Mexico atop a brilliant plume of white-hot flame and a churning cloud of exhaust.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, after pushing the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the Starship's six Raptor engines ignited to continue the climb to space while the Super Heavy booster fell away, reversed course and began flying back to the launch site.",
      "The flight plan called for the Super Heavy to fly back to its launch pad for capture by a giant set of mechanical arms. But an issue of some sort, either with the rocket or the capture mechanism on the pad, prompted flight controllers to order a diversion to splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "As it was, the final descent appeared normal and well controlled as the rocket restarted three Raptors to slow is rate of fall before settling to a vertical, low-speed splashdown just off shore Boca Chica while the Starship upper stage continued on into space.",
      "The International Space Station was passing 260 miles above eastern Mexico at the moment of liftoff.",
      "\"We just saw Starship launch,\" astronaut Sunita Williams radioed. \"Pretty awesome! We're getting pictures.\" Crewmate Don Pettit told flight controllers in Houston \"it looked pretty cool from orbit. We're downloading them now.\"",
      "Trump attends the SpaceX Starship launch",
      "Trump flew to Texas earlier in the afternoon and watched the launch and booster recovery with Musk. During a Sept. 21 campaign speech in Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump urged Musk to \"get those rocket ships going because we want to reach Mars before the end of my term. We want to do it.\"",
      "His reaction to watching the giant rocket take off and land was not immediately known.",
      "Ahead of the launch, Trump\u00a0posted\u00a0on social media: \"I'm heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground. Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\"",
      "What's different about launch 6 than the previous 5 launches?",
      "As with the rocket's fifth test flight last month, the primary goals of Tuesday's flight was to boost the Starship out of the lower atmosphere on a sub-orbital flight to re-entry over the Indian Ocean while the Super Heavy booster executed the return-to-launch-site mid-air capture or, as it turned out, a safe ocean splashdown.",
      "But this time around, one of the Starship's methane-burning Raptor engines was successfully restarted in space to demonstrate the propulsion system's ability to perform critical maneuvers and future de-orbit burns.",
      "Engineers also were testing \"a suite of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for ship reentry and descent over the Indian Ocean,\" SpaceX said on its website, along with software and booster hardware upgrades intended to add additional propulsion system redundancy and increase the rocket's structural strength.",
      "Spectacular video from cameras mounted on the Starship showed a sheath of super-hot plasma engulfing the vehicle as it rapidly slowed in a blaze of atmospheric friction.",
      "And even though it was using an older-generation heat shield and flying in a deliberately more difficult-to-control orientation, the Starship executed a picture-perfect splashdown, firing three Raptors to slow down for a vertical descent into the ocean.",
      "The October test flight was the first featuring a successful launch pad \"catch\" and the first with a Starship that reached the Indian Ocean essentially intact.",
      "For Tuesday's flight, launch was moved to the late afternoon in Texas to ensure a daylight splashdown for video documentation.",
      "Plans for the Super Heavy-Starship",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the centerpiece of Musk's drive to develop a fully reusable heavy-lift rocket, which he says is the key to making humanity \"multi-planetary.\" And now, with Trump's support, he may be able to kick start that effort.",
      "Shortly after winning the presidential election, Trump announced that Musk and one-time presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy would lead a new agency known as the Department of Government Efficiency. The goal, Trump said in a statement, is to \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulation, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk said in the same statement: \"This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people.\"",
      "SpaceX already holds billions in government contracts and is building a variant of the Starship to serve as the initial lunar lander in NASA's Artemis moon program. It remains to be seen how Musk's role in the new administration might advance SpaceX's plans or how questions about conflicts of interest might be resolved.",
      "Politics aside, \"we are looking at a serious effort to return to the moon, and maybe a serious effort ... to send, if not humans to Mars in the next four years, a lot of stuff and a lot of infrastructure that will enable humans to get to Mars,\" said Casey Drier, director of space policy for the Planetary Society.",
      "\"Maybe not in four years, but maybe in the next 10.\"",
      "The key to those plans is the Super Heavy-Starship.",
      "How does the Super Heavy-Starship work?",
      "The Super Heavy booster is powered by 33 Raptor engines burning liquid methane and oxygen to generate more than 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle, more than twice the liftoff power of NASA's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. The Starship is powered by six Raptors and will be capable of carrying astronauts, satellites and science probes.",
      "Like the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, the 230-foot-tall first stage is designed to be fully reusable, flying itself back to the launch pad where giant \"chopsticks\" mounted on the pad gantry can catch the booster as it descends, enabling rapid servicing, re-fueling and launch.",
      "Unlike the Falcon 9, which uses a throw-away second stage, the 160-foot-tall Starship also is reusable, capable of safely returning to Earth after launching satellites or carrying astronauts to the moon and eventually, Musk says, to Mars.",
      "SpaceX already ferries astronauts and cosmonauts to and from the International Space Station using Falcon 9s carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft and is building a variant of the Starship for NASA to carry astronauts back to the moon's surface in the 2026-27 timeframe.",
      "The company also launches commercial and military satellites, is building a powerful space tug for NASA to help drive the International Space Station safely out of orbit when the program is retired in 2030 and is launching thousands of its own Starlink satellites to provide global access to the internet.",
      "\"SpaceX functionally has the monopoly on access to space,\" said Drier. \"Pretty much any asset that you want to launch into space, whether you're the U.S. government or commercial provider, a satellite company, even the European Space Agency, they are all using SpaceX rockets.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:47:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed breakup calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years.

He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for. Trump also had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",

      "Digital assets like bitcoin had posted notable gains in the months ahead of the election, mostly due to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.\u00a0 Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency\u00a0exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\" Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a research note two weeks ago. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Bitcoin volatility",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.",

In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",
      "The frequently asked questions section of Deepware's website states: \"Deepfakes are not a solved problem yet. Our results indicate the likelihood of a specific video being a deepfake or not.\"",
      "Deepfake Detector",
      "Deepfake Detector, a tool that charges $16.80 per month, identified one of the fake videos as \"97% natural voice.\" The company, which specializes in spotting AI-generated voices, said in an email that factors like background noise or music can impact results, but it has an accuracy rate of approximately 92%.",
      "In response to a question about guidance for average consumers, the company wrote: \"Our tool is designed to be user-friendly. Average consumers can easily upload an audio file on our website or use our browser extension to analyze content directly. The tool will provide an analysis to help determine if a video may contain deepfake elements using probabilities, making it accessible even for those unfamiliar with AI technology.\"",
      "Attestiv",
      "Attestiv flagged two of the real videos as \"suspicious.\" According to the company's CEO Nicos Vekiarides, false positives can be triggered by factors like graphics and edits. Both authentic videos flagged as \"suspicious\" included graphics and edits. The site offers a free service, but it also has a paid tier, where consumers can adjust settings and calibrations for more in-depth analysis.",
      "While he acknowledges that Attestiv isn't perfect, Vekiarides said that as deepfakes become harder to spot with the naked eye, these kinds of websites are needed as part of the solution.",
      "\"Our tool can determine if something is suspicious, and then you can verify it with your own eyes to say, 'I do think that's suspicious,'\" Vekiarides said.",

      "In an email, the creator of the open platform said a limitation of deepfake detection models is that video compression can lead to sync issues with video and audio and inconsistent mouth movements.",
      "In response to a question about how everyday users can use the tool, the company emailed: \"Currently, the main result shown to users is the probability value of this sample being a generated sample across different detection models. This can be used as a reference if multiple models agree on the same answer with confidence (e.g., over 80% for AI-generated or below 20% for real video). We are currently developing a more understandable way of showing the results, as well as new models that can output comprehensive detection results.\"",

    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

    "story": [
      "Authorities have seen a surge of guns and ammunition flowing from the United States to Latin America and the Caribbean, fueling conflict in regions already struggling with violence and unrest.",
      "Last week, U.S.-based airlines were struck by gunfire while flying over Haiti's airspace. While the origin of the firearms remains uncertain, Haiti has no domestic firearms manufacturing capacity, and aside from a small artisanal market, the majority of weapons fueling the violence are likely sourced from the U.S.",
      "A new report from research organization Small Arms Survey reveals a staggering nearly 120% surge in firearm shipments seized en route from the U.S. to the Caribbean and Latin America since 2016.",
      "\"Available evidence indicates that traffickers in the U.S. are a major source of illicit weapons in the Caribbean and Latin America,\" said Matt Schroeder, senior researcher at Small Arms Survey and author of the report. \"The illicit acquisition and use of firearms in the Caribbean and Latin America ranks among the most pressing security threats in the hemisphere.\"",
      "Their analysis, based on previously unpublished border seizure data obtained through public records requests, highlights a growing problem. These figures represent only the weapons actually seized, leaving out the vast number of guns trafficked across the U.S. or uncovered through criminal investigations. While it's unclear if these increases reflect more thorough screening, a rise in trafficking or improved data collection, the trend unmistakably points to a consistent demand for illicit firearms.",
      "The black market of American guns and ammunition has been well-established by U.S. and international law enforcement as a key source of weapons fueling humanitarian crises and violence in places like Mexico, Haiti and beyond. A 2023 CBS Reports investigation found up to a million firearms are smuggled across the border annually, including military-grade weapons like grenade launchers and belt-fed Gatling-style miniguns.",
      "The illicit flow of firearms is now a major concern across the Caribbean as well. A recent report by the Government Accountability Office shows that U.S.-sourced firearms account for the vast majority of the violence in Caribbean nations. The report states that 73% of the firearms recovered in the Caribbean between 2018 and 2023 were traced back to the U.S., with a significant portion of these weapons sold in Florida, Georgia and Texas. These firearms are responsible for 90% of homicides in some of the region's most vulnerable nations.",
      "The Small Arms Survey's latest findings reflect these broader trends, with a troubling shift in the types of firearms being seized in shipments bound for the Caribbean. While shipments to Latin America, particularly Mexico, still account for the majority of firearm seizures, the Caribbean has seen a notable increase in the interception of AK- and AR-style rifles, as well as high-capacity magazines.",
      "Of the seized rifles headed for the Caribbean, 77% were AK- and AR-style rifles, compared with 48% in shipments to Mexico and 61% to other Latin American countries \u2014 though the total number of rifles seized while heading to the Caribbean remains lower than the quantities seized in shipments to Latin America. In the Caribbean-bound shipments, 93% of the magazines that were identifiable by capacity were capable of holding more than 10 rounds, making them high-capacity magazines.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary, met with senators on Capitol Hill on Thursday as new details emerged about an alleged sexual assault that took place in 2017.",
      "Hegseth was accompanied in his meetings by Vice President-elect JD Vance, an Ohio senator, as they seek to secure support among Republican senators for the former Fox News host's expected nomination. Trump selected the 44-year-old Army veteran \u2014 who served in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 last week, citing his military experience and calling him a \"Warrior for the Troops.\"",
      "Ahead of the meetings, the release of a detailed police report late Wednesday drew increased attention to the defense secretary pick, building upon information unearthed about an investigation into Hegseth for an alleged sexual assault in 2017. The report included the first detailed accounts of the incident from the unnamed woman, Hegseth and others. Hegseth denies the allegation and characterized the incident as a consensual encounter.",
      "Hegseth and Vance have met with Sens. Bill Hagerty and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Marco Rubio of Florida. Rubio was selected by Trump to serve as secretary of state but could vote on Hegseth's nomination if he is still in the Senate should it takes place.",
      "Blackburn said she had a \"great meeting\" with Hegseth, noting that he is a Tennessean whom \"we look forward to supporting.\"",
      "Hagerty likened the allegations against Hegseth to those made against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018. Kavanaugh was accused of sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford when he was in high school in the 1980s. He vehemently denied the claims, and none of the people who attended the gathering where the alleged incident happened could corroborate Ford's allegations.",
      "\"It's a disgrace that those allegations are nothing but what you said, allegations that are he-said she-said,\" he told reporters. \"This is a case that has been dismissed. This is just dredging up something, try to smear and discredit a candidate. It reminds me of what happened to Brett Kavanaugh. It's a disgrace.\"",
      "The Monterey Police Department forwarded its report about the alleged assault to the Monterey County District Attorney's Office for review back in 2017. Monterey County District Attorney Jeannine M. Pacioni said Thursday that in January 2018 her office \"declined to file charges\" as none were \"supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\"",
      "Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the Republican conference chair, praised Hegseth as a \"strong\" candidate to lead the Pentagon. Barrasso will become the second highest-ranking Senate Republican in the next Congress after he was selected to serve as majority whip.",
      "\"We had an excellent discussion about the need for America's military to remain the best in the world. That means taking care of our service members, equipping them with the latest technology, and focusing on making our military the most lethal force on the planet,\" he said in a statement. \"Pete pledged that the Pentagon will focus on strength and hard power \u2014 not the current administration's woke political agenda.\"",
      "The allegations against Hegseth were revealed last week when officials in Monterey, California, released a public statement disclosing an incident that occurred the night of Oct. 7, 2017, and into the morning of Oct. 8, 2017, at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel. An incident report was filed with the Monterey Police Department five days later.",
      "That police report, which was released Wednesday to CBS News and other outlets in response to public records requests, provided more details about the incident between Hegseth and the unidentified woman. The alleged victim told police that Hegseth sexually assaulted her after a Republican women's event at the hotel. She said he took her phone, blocked the door to a hotel room and refused to let her leave, according to the investigative report.",
      "The report said law enforcement was first notified of the alleged assault by a nurse informing police that a patient requested a sexual assault exam. Police also spoke with a hotel staffer and another woman who was at the event with Hegseth.",
      "The alleged victim told the nurse that she had been drinking with coworkers but thinks something may have been slipped into her drink because she could not remember many of the night's events. She recalled being in a coworker's hotel room, laying on either a couch or bed, and a bare-chested Hegseth hovering over her with his dog tags hanging over her face. According to the report, she said that Hegseth ejaculated on her stomach and then asked, \"Are you OK?\"",
      "The unidentified woman said her last memory was of walking into her hotel room, though she told police she did not remember how she got back to it, the report states.",
      "Hegseth also spoke with police and claimed the alleged victim led him to his room. He said the interaction was consensual and he checked multiple times to make sure the woman was comfortable with what was happening, according to the report.",
      "Timothy Parlatore, Hegseth's lawyer, said \"This police report confirms what I've said all along. That the incident was fully investigated and the police found the allegations to be false, which is why no charges were filed.\"",
      "While no charges were filed, neither Monterey police nor city officials have publicly said the allegations were found to be false.",
      "Parlatore had told CBS News on Monday that his client paid a confidential financial settlement to a woman who accused him of sexual assault because he was concerned Fox News would fire him because of the allegation.",
      "In addition to the allegations against Hegseth, his selection has drawn criticism due to his lack of high-level national security experience. The Defense Department is the largest federal agency, with more than 3 million civilian and military employees and a budget of more than $800 billion. He's also drawn criticism for his stance that women should not be in combat roles in the U.S. military.",
      "The meetings come a day after former Rep. Matt Gaetz also met with GOP senators before withdrawing his name from consideration for attorney general. Gaetz said in a post on social media that it had become clear that his candidacy \"was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.\"",

    "story": [
      "NEW YORK --\u00a0 New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge was a unanimous pick to win his second American League Most Valuable Player Award in three seasons on Thursday, easily outdistancing Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt Jr.",
      "Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani won the National League honor Thursday as well, his third MVP and first in the NL.",
      "Judge received all 30 first-place votes in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Witt got all 30 second-place votes for 270 points, and Yankees outfielder Juan Soto was third with 21 third-place votes and 229 points.",
      "\"I want to congratulate Aaron on earning this distinguished honor, and I couldn't be happier for such an amazing person and leader,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said in a statement. \"After having a front row seat for his 2022 MVP performance, I really couldn't envision a player having a better and more complete baseball season. But that's exactly what he accomplished in 2024. I'm beyond fortunate to be able to manage Aaron, and I look forward to watching him further cement his legacy as one of this generation's greatest players.\"",
      "Judge led the major leagues with 58 homers, 144 RBIs and 133 walks while hitting .322. Witt topped the big leagues with a .332 average, hitting 32 homers with 109 RBIs. Soto batted .288 with 41 homers and 109 RBIs.",
      "When Judge won his first MVP award in 2022, he received 28 first-place votes while Ohtani, then on the Los Angeles Angels, got the other two.",
      "Judge had discussed the MVP award with Philadelphia's Bryce Harper, the NL winner in 2015 and '21.",
      "\"I was telling him, `Man, I'm going to try to catch up to you with these MVPs here, man,'\" Judge recalled. \"He'd say, hopefully, he could stay a couple ahead of me, which I think he'll do.\"",
      "Judge was hitting .207 with six homers and 18 RBIs through April, then batted .352 with 52 homers and 126 RBIs in 127 games.",
      "\"March and April were not my friend this year.\" Judge said. \"Just keep putting in the work and things are going to change. You can't mope. You can't feel sorry for yourself. Especially in New York, nobody's going to feel sorry for you. So you just got to go out there and put up the numbers?\"",
      "Ohtani was unanimously voted the AL MVP in 2021 and 2023 as a two-way star. He signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers last December, but didn't pitch in 2024 following elbow surgery.",
      "Ohtani hit .310, stole 59 bases and led the NL with 54 homers and 130 RBIs exclusively as a designated hitter, becoming the first player with 50 or more homers and 50 or more stolen bases in a season. He helped the Dodgers to the World Series title, playing the final three games with a torn labrum in his left shoulder.",
      "Ohtani would become the first primary DH to win an MVP. He would join Frank Robinson for Cincinnati in 1961 and Baltimore in 1966 as the only players to win the MVP award in both leagues.",
      "Ohtani would become the 12th player with three or more MVPs, joining Barry Bonds (seven) and Jimmie Foxx, Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Mike Schmidt, Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols and Mike Trout (three each).",
      "New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor and Arizona second baseman Ketel Marte also were among the top three finishers in the NL. Lindor batted .273 with 33 homers, 91 RBIs and 29 steals, while Marte hit .292 with 36 homers and 95 RBIs.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump announced Gaetz as his nominee to be attorney general last week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz announced Thursday that he is withdrawing his nomination for attorney general. His decision came amid an investigation by the\u00a0House Ethics Committee\u00a0for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "Gaetz denied any wrongdoing and called the investigation a \"smear.\" He blamed the probe on former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whose\u00a0ouster\u00a0Gaetz helped lead last year.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump was calling Republican senators and associates as recently as Thursday morning to gauge Gaetz's chances that he could be confirmed, a person familiar with his calls told CBS News. Trump did not want to risk not having an attorney general on the first day of his second term given an anticipated wave of executive orders that would face legal challenges, according to another source familiar with the situation.",
      "Gaetz concluded on his own that he lacked enough support from Republican senators, according to two people familiar with the situation. Ultimately, given the controversy surrounding Gaetz, at least 15 GOP senators might have opposed the pick, according to one of the sources. One GOP senator told CBS News that there werea at least eight hard \"no\" votes on Gaetz, a total that never budged.",
      "Trump had\u00a0tapped Gaetz to lead the Justice Department as the nation's top law enforcement officer last week. Gaetz swiftly resigned his seat in the House and was on Capitol Hill\u00a0on Wednesday with Vice President-elect JD Vance, an Ohio senator, meeting with Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee who would oversee his confirmation hearings.",
      "He said in a social media post that while he had \"excellent meetings\" with senators, his confirmation battle was taking away from the work of the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,\" he wrote on social media. \"There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump's DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.\"",
      "In response to Gaetz's decision, Trump wrote on social media, \"I greatly appreciate the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General. He was doing very well but, at the same time, did not want to be a distraction for the Administration, for which he has much respect.\" A few hours later, Trump announced a new pick for the job,\u00a0former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi.",
      "Gaetz called both Trump and Vance separately to inform them of his decision, CBS News confirmed.",
      "The Justice Department also conducted an investigation into Gaetz involving allegations of sex trafficking and obstruction. Prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz last year.",
      "Gaetz's withdrawal came amid reporting of new details about testimony to the Ethics Committee given by a woman who said she had two encounters with the Florida Republican at a party in July 2017, when she was a minor, and months after he was sworn in to the House. According to two sources familiar with the matter, the woman said the second encounter was a threesome. However, the person she identified as the other woman in the threesome has repeatedly denied under oath to the committee this happened.",
      "\"My client denies witnessing and/or participating in any sexual activities between Congressman Matt Gaetz and the 17-year-old minor in Orlando, Florida, in 2017,\" a lawyer for the third participant said.",
      "CNN was first to report the second encounter between Gaetz and the then 17-year-old.",
      "Several senators had expressed concerns about installing Gaetz as attorney general, raising doubts that he would win confirmation even with Republicans in control of the upper chamber in the next Congress, which begins in January. Some then indicated that his decision to remove himself as the attorney general candidate was the right one.",
      "\"I think the decision to withdraw the nomination is the right decision to make,\" Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, said. He continued: \"I thought from the beginning, as I shared earlier, I thought it was problematic. And I think you know, as some of our members have expressed, as they've learned more about it, there was perhaps some information out there that the president was not aware of when he made the original recommendation.\"",
      "GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer, of North Dakota, said he is \"grateful\" Gaetz withdrew, while Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said \"there were a lot of red flags.\"",
      "\"I think that he has put country first, and I'm pleased with his decision,\" she said.",
      "It is the first major blow to Trump's efforts to fill his Cabinet and key administration posts for his second term in office. The president-elect's pick for secretary of defense, former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, is also under scrutiny after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2017. A police report provided details of the incident, which Hegseth said at the time was consensual. He has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Trump's announcement of Gaetz as his pick for attorney general came just two days before the Ethics Committee was set to meet to discuss whether to release a report detailing its years-long investigation into the Florida Republican. Because he stepped down from his position in the House upon his selection to lead the Justice Department, the committee's jurisdiction over Gaetz ended, raising questions about whether the panel's report would be released.",
      "The Ethics Committee did convene Wednesday and considered the report's release. But lawmakers said the panel, divided evenly between Democrats and Republicans, did not reach agreement. The committee planned to reconvene on Dec. 5 \"to further consider this matter,\" Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the committee, told reporters after the initial meeting.",
      "The Ethics Committee said in June that it was looking into allegations against Gaetz of sexual misconduct and drug use, accepting improper gifts and giving \"special privileges and favors,\" and obstructing the investigations into his conduct. House investigators interviewed more than a dozen witnesses and issued 25 subpoenas, the committee said in a rare statement.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News at the time that four women told the committee that they had been paid to go to parties attended by Gaetz that included sex and drugs. A lawyer for two women who spoke with the panel told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the Ethics Committee.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs. One of Leppard's clients\u00a0testified before the Ethics Committee\u00a0that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old against a game table during a July 2017 party, months after he was sworn in as a House member.",
      "Leppard said following Gaetz's withdrawal that his \"clients are relieved to have this chapter behind them and eager to move forward with their lives. We're hopeful this brings final closure for all parties involved.\"",
      "Confirmation hearings for Gaetz before the Judiciary Committee would not have taken place until early next year, but Republican and Democratic senators have been pushing to see the Ethics Committee's report as they considered his nomination.",
      "On Wednesday, 10 Democrats on the Judiciary Committee asked the FBI to turn over the full evidentiary file in the now-closed federal sex trafficking probe involving Gaetz.",
      "GOP Rep. Michael Guest, chairman of the Ethics Committee, said Gaetz's decision to pull himself from consideration ends his panel's involvement.",
      "\"I think that this should end the discussion of whether or not the Ethics Committee should continue to move forward in this matter,\" he told reporters. \"He has withdrawn his nomination. He is no longer a member of Congress, and so I think that this settles any involvement that the Ethics Committee should have in any matters involving Mr. Gaetz.\"",

      "After former Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew himself from consideration for attorney general, President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday evening that he was selecting Pam Bondi, Florida's former attorney general, as his replacement.",
      "\"I am proud to announce former Attorney General of the Great State of Florida, Pam Bondi, as our next Attorney General of the United States,\" Trump said in a statement, adding that she was \"smart and tough\" and \"will do a terrific job.\"",
      "Bondi was the first woman elected to serve as Florida's attorney general, spending eight years in the role after working as assistant state attorney for Hillsborough County. According to Mr. Trump's social media post, Bondi focused on curbing immigration and combating the opioid epidemic during her tenure.",
      "Bondi, a Trump loyalist, then turned her attention to national politics, working in the White House as both a legal adviser and defense attorney for Mr. Trump during the Senate's 2020 impeachment trial. She also spoke at a Pennsylvania press conference following the 2020 presidential election alongside\u00a0 Eric Trump and Rudy Giuliani \u2014 falsely claiming Trump had won the state before President Biden was declared its winner. She was also a surrogate for Trump's most recent campaign.",
      "Gaetz reacted to the pick, posting to social media that Bondi was a \"stellar selection\" and a \"proven litigator, inspiring leader and a champion for all Americans.\"",
      "If confirmed, Bondi would be in charge of the Justice Department's 100,000 employees and oversee investigative components like the FBI and DEA. And she would assume the top job in a department that has investigated and prosecuted Mr. Trump for years.",
      "Special counsel Jack Smith has filed two indictments against Trump, one over his alleged illegal retention of classified records, and another over allegations that he resisted the peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election. Trump pleaded not guilty to all counts and a federal judge earlier this year dismissed the classified documents case against him.",
      "Smith is now actively working to end the election-related case\u00a0against the president-elect because of department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. Smith is likely to leave his post at the Justice Department before Trump's inauguration, according to two sources familiar with the plans.",
      "In June 2023, after he was indicted on federal charges related to classified documents, Mr. Trump vowed to, \"appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of America, Joe Biden, and go after the Biden crime family.\" Since then, he and his allies have railed against the Justice Department, alleging political interference and abuse of power.",
      "\"For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans - Not anymore,\" Trump said in his statement Thursday.",
      "Gaetz announced on Thursday that he would withdraw his nomination for attorney general, just over a week after Trump tapped him for the post. The selection was widely considered to be the most controversial the president-elect had made, with Gaetz having been the subject of multiple investigations into alleged conduct related to sex trafficking, obstruction, sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Gaetz promptly resigned from Congress following Trump's announcement, which came days before the House Ethics Committee was set to meet to consider releasing a report into its investigation into the Florida Republican's conduct. When the panel met days later, after its jurisdiction over Gaetz had ended with his decision to leave Congress, members said they did not reach agreement on whether to release the report. The next day, after meeting with Senate Republicans, Gaetz announced he would withdraw.",
      "Even Senate Republicans were skeptical of Gaetz' chances of being confirmed next year, despite being slated to hold a narrow majority in the chamber.",
      "Bondi will be the first woman to serve as U.S. attorney general since Loretta Lynch ascended to the top job during the Obama administration. Bondi's top deputy would be Todd Blanche, who has spent the last several months serving as Trump's defense attorney, and previously worked as a corporate defense attorney and federal prosecutor.",
      "Other Trump defense attorneys are also set to be nominated to Justice Department leadership positions, including Emil Bove, who will be Trump's principal deputy attorney general, and D. John Sauer, who Trump said he will nominate as solicitor general.",
      "Much of Bondi's initiatives will also depend on who Trump appoints to lead other Justice Department divisions, like those that handle national security and criminal matters. Trump's pick to oversee the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel will also be key to the agenda as it will issue decisions on presidential power, including potentially about which federal employees the president can fire.",
      "FBI Director Christopher Wray reports directly to the attorney general.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 \u00a0Rep.-elect\u00a0Sarah McBride, a Delaware Democrat who is set to become the first transgender member of Congress, characterized a GOP effort to restrict bathroom use as an attempt \"to get headlines.\"",
      "\"Everything was fine until some members of the small Republican conference majority decided to get headlines and to manufacture a crisis,\" McBride told CBS News' Scott MacFarlane.",
      "The Delaware Democrat told CBS News that she anticipated an effort to \"politicize my use of a restroom,\" and she indicated she had not intended to use multi-stall women's restrooms in the Capitol. But she also said \"that is my choice here.\"",
      "\"If anyone had thought to ask me about what I was planning on doing, I would've been happy to tell them,\" McBride said. \"But again, this is not an issue. And this has never been an issue in this complex.\"",
      "Weeks after McBride became the first transgender person elected to Congress, a Republican-led effort to restrict restroom use in the Capitol got underway this week. Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, introduced legislation Monday to change House rules to limit use of single-sex bathrooms in the Capitol complex to those corresponding to users' \"biological sex.\"",
      "McBride, who also made history as the first trans person ever elected to a state senate seat, has tended to stay above the fray, stressing that her priority is to work for Delawareans in the House. She told CBS News that she wants people to see her \"competence in governing contrast with their chaos.\"",
      "\"I would like my grace to contrast with the grandstanding that we're seeing right now.\" McBride said. \"I would like my approach of respecting everyone to contrast with the disrespect that we are seeing right now.\"",
      "Mace's two-page resolution alleges that \"allowing biological males\" into the facilities \"jeopardizes the safety and dignity of Members, officers, and employees of the House who are female\" and would task the sergeant-at-arms with enforcing the measure.",

      "Life expectancy in the United States varies by more than 20 years depending on your race and ethnicity and where you live, according to new research. The authors call the level of health disparities \"truly alarming.\"",
      "In the study, published Thursday in The Lancet, researchers analyzed death records from the National Vital Statistics System and population estimates from the National Center for Health Statistics from 2000 to 2021.",
      "Large disparities in life expectancy were apparent throughout the study period but grew more substantial over time, particularly during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors noted.",
      "\"The extent and magnitude of health disparities in American society are truly alarming in a country with the wealth and resources of the USA,\" senior author Christopher J.L. Murray said in a news release. \"These disparities reflect the unequal and unjust distribution of resources and opportunities that have profound consequences on well-being and longevity, especially in marginalized populations.\"",
      "In 2000, life expectancy ranged from an average of 70.5 years for Americans at the lowest end to 83.1 years for those in the highest group \u2014 a difference of 12.6 years. The gap widened to 13.9 years in 2010, jumped to 18.9 years in 2020, and now in the latest data, 20.4 years in 2021.",
      "During those two decades, the study says, \"US life expectancy has shifted in the wrong direction, falling further behind that of most other peer wealthy nations.\"",
      "In 2000, the groups with the lowest average life expectancy included Black Americans in non-metropolitan and low-income counties in the South, as well as in highly segregated metropolitan areas; and American Indian or Alaska Native individuals in the West. The group with the highest average life expectancy was Asian Americans.",
      "Between 2000 and 2010, life expectancy increased for all groups except for American Indian or Alaska Native individuals in the West, who saw a about a 1-year decline. For White and Latino populations, outcomes varied depending on the locations where they lived. For example, White Americans in low-income counties in Appalachia and the Lower Mississippi Valley had lower life expectancies than those in other areas.",
      "By 2021, after the impacts of the pandemic, the gaps grew substantially wider, with Asian American life expectancy averaging 84 years while American Indian or Alaska Native people in the West averaged 63.6 years. Life expectancy among non-Hispanic Black Americans\u00a0fell to 71.0 years, from 74.8 just two years earlier, with significant variations depending on where they lived.",
      "\"During the COVID-19 pandemic, historically marginalised populations experienced the highest mortality rates and horrific losses in life expectancy,\" the authors wrote.",
      "To help address these disparities, Murray said, \"Policymakers must take collective action to invest in equitable health care, education, and employment opportunities and challenge the systemic barriers that create and perpetuate these inequities so that all Americans can live long, healthy lives regardless of where they live and their race, ethnicity, or income.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:09:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could raise costs for U.S. consumers, economists say. Here's how much grocery bills could rise.",
    "story": [
      "Americans say they continue to feel the aftereffects of the highest inflation in four decades, especially at the grocery store, where prices remain 26% higher than before the pandemic. President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could cause even more financial strain in the nation's food aisles by reigniting price hikes, according to a recent study.",
      "Although it remains to be seen what he does as president, ahead of the Nov. 5 election Trump proposed a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports, as well as a 60% tariff on products from China. Manufacturers and retailers typically pass on at least some of those costs to customers.",
      "As a result, hefty new tariffs could cause prices for a range of consumer goods, from everyday items such as groceries to less frequent purchases like furniture, to rise, according to the\u00a0analysis\u00a0from Third Way, a left-leaning think tank. Trump's tariffs could cause a typical family's annual grocery budget in 2025 to swell by almost $200 next year, which would amount to an increase of more than 3%, according to Third Way.",
      "\"Prices are absolutely going to rise, because the added costs from increased tariffs will be paid by the consumer,\" Gabe Horwitz, senior vice president for the economic program at Third Way, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And those price increases are going to be a lot harder for folks lower down on the income scale.\"",
      "Third Way has been supportive of President Joe Biden's economic policies and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the election.",
      "Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, who is set to be his White House Press secretary, \u00a0disputed the claim that President-elect Trump's policies will boost inflation.",
      "\"In his first term, President Trump instituted tariffs against China that created jobs, spurred investment and resulted in no inflation. President Trump will work quickly to fix and restore an economy that puts American workers by re-shoring American jobs, lowering inflation, raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations and unshackling American energy,\" she said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "To be sure, the timing and magnitude of any new tariffs imposed once Trump takes office is unclear. Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool for negotiating leverage in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "Tariffs are considered a regressive form of taxation, meaning they hit the lowest-income consumers the hardest. That's because low-income families spend a larger share of their budgets on essentials like groceries, versus higher-income earners.",
      "Horwitz and a team of economists put together an approximation of what an average family of four might buy each week at the supermarket, noting that there can be a lot of variation from one family to another. Researchers\u00a0 compared current average prices of\u00a0 groceries with their potential costs if Trump follows through with his proposal for adding tariffs to all imports.",
      "\"We wanted to look specifically at what the tariffs could mean for family budgets,\" Horwitz said.",
      "How much more could groceries cost?",
      "Researchers assumed a weekly trip to the grocery store would include buying coffee, beer, shrimp, beef, bananas, avocados, jam and olive oil.",
      "While these might not be typical purchases for all families, researchers focused on regularly consumed goods for which the U.S. relies heavily on imports, or does not produce domestically at all.",
      "Trump's tariffs would likely cause families to spend at least $3.57 more on such groceries each week, adding up to an additional $185 per year, or an increase of 3.3%, according to the Third Way analysis. The price hikes would apply to each of the eight items on the sample grocery list.",
      "Big-box store prices",
      "Consumers could also end up paying more for items bought less frequently at big-box retail stores like Walmart and Target, Third Way found.",
      "One U.S. company is already responding to the proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden says it plans to import fewer goods made in China to the U.S., and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "\"We have been planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly,\" CEO Edward Rosenfeld told analysts on a recent earnings call. \"We've worked hard over a multiyear period to develop our factory base and our sourcing capability in alternative countries, like Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, etc.\"",
      "Families could end up paying an additional $551 per year at big-box stores, with their spending rising 14% from $3,754 to $4,305, according to Third Way's research.",
      "Big-box store purchases would rise more dramatically in cost because more goods sold at these types of stores are imported from China.",
      "\"If you take Trump at his word, the sheer cost of tariffs for low-income families is astronomical,\" Horwitz said.",
      "Imposing steep new tariffs on other countries could raise economic costs in another way \u2014 by inviting tit-for-tat levies on U.S. exports. Oxford Economics on Thursday forecast that the Trump administration would impose blanket tariffs of 30% on all Chinese imports and that Beijing would retaliate.",
      "\"Tariffs are a two-way street, and the more aggressive tariffs on China will lead to a larger retaliation,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"We assume China will impose 25% tariffs on all U.S. exports, though with exemptions for electronic products.\"",
      "Oxford also expects the U.S. to hit Japan with 10% on metals and cars, leading to reciprocal tariffs on the same U.S. exports.",

The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",

They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",

    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy say the Department of Government Efficiency has targets in mind for cost cutting.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are sharing details about how their newly created Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 which isn't an official government department \u2014 plans to take aim at paring federal spending, with the two writing in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Wednesday that they are aiming to cut $500 billion in annual spending.",
      "The announcement of DOGE has raised a host of questions, from whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal spending, typically controlled by Congress, as well as the group's powers and how it will operate. Musk and Ramaswamy provided answers to some of those questions in their opinion piece, arguing that President-elect Donald Trump has the authority to cut spending authorized by Congress.",
      "While Musk and Ramaswamy said they \"expect to prevail\" in cutting costs, there have been plenty of examples throughout the decades of efforts aimed at reining in federal spending, which have had only limited results. For instance, President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s tapped businessman J. Peter Grace to recommend reforms, resulting in about 2,500 recommendations for cutting spending, most of which were never implemented.",
      "Musk has suggested slicing $2 trillion in annual federal spending, an amount experts say is unrealistic given that most of the nation's $6.7 trillion in yearly outlays is spent on Social Security, Medicare and the military.",
      "But in the Wednesday opinion piece, Musk and Ramaswamy wrote that their initial aim will be to cut \"the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Where will Musk's DOGE aim to cut federal spending?",
      "Two-thirds of federal spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "But as mentioned above, Musk and Ramaswamy said they'll target $500 billion in spending that is unauthorized by Congress, as well as programs they believe aren't in line with lawmakers' intentions.",
      "The biggest source of expired authorizations sits with health care for veterans, which cost $119 billion in fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "However, Musk and Ramaswamy didn't single out veterans' health care as a place where they'd seek to cut. Instead, they listed the following areas:",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which receives $535 million a year\u00a0International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grantsPlanned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",

      "International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grants",
      "Planned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",
      "Which federal programs don't have authorization?",
      "The programs mentioned by Musk and Ramaswamy are relatively tiny compared with other areas that are unauthorized, such as veterans' health care.",
      "The next biggest sources of expired authorizations, after veterans' health care, include programs that invest in opioid treatment, the State Department and housing assistance. Some smaller programs with expired funding include Head Start, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. The latter provides weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring, among other tasks.",
      "According to Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that was developed by the Heritage Foundation to guide the next conservative White House, the NOAA \"should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated.\"",
      "DOGE wants to cut federal workers. Here's how.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy also underscored that they'll push to cut the ranks of federal employees, saying their efforts could lead to \"mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.\" The pair didn't enumerate the number of workers they'll seek to push out of the federal workforce.",
      "In 2023, there were more than 2 million federal employees, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group focused on the federal government. Most of those workers are within Veterans Affairs, due to a large number of health care providers for the VA, followed by people enlisted in the armed services, its data shows.",
      "While civil service workers have job protections, Musk and Ramaswamy argued that the president would be legally allowed to enact \"reductions in force\" that don't target specific workers, as well as to make decisions including \"large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area.\"",
      "The DOGE would help federal employees \"transition into the private sector,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote. \"The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit.\"",
      "The pair also said they want to require federal workers to be in the office five days a week, a policy change that they predict would \"result in a wave of voluntary terminations.\"",
      "In a Thursday post on X, the social media service owned by Elon Musk, the DOGE wrote, \"Federal government agencies are using, on average, just 12% of the space in their DC headquarters.  The Department of Agriculture, with space for more than 7,400 people, averaged 456 workers each day (6% occupancy).\"",
      "It added, \"Why are American taxpayer dollars being spent to maintain empty buildings?\"",
      "How much do federal workers earn?",
      "Pay varies by department and seniority, with the federal government publishing a General Schedule of basic pay grades for most federal employees. For 2024, the lowest pay grade was about $22,000 in annual earnings, while the highest was about $160,000. Some agencies offer competitive salaries to compete with the private sector. Pay may also vary by location.",
      "Federal employees are located in every state, with 80% located outside the Washington, D.C. area, according to the Partnership for Public Service.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 16:56:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Kennedy's team is weighing a significant rewrite of the FDA's rules.",
    "story": [
      "Advisers to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are weighing a significant rewrite to the Food and Drug Administration's rules governing food additives, to fulfill Kennedy and President-elect Donald Trump's \"Make America Healthy Again\" pledge to get toxic chemicals out of the food supply.",
      "The proposed crackdown, which is still in its early stages and will need to get a sign-off from Trump and his transition team, targets a provision in the FDA's regulations on which food additives are considered by the agency to be \"generally recognized as safe,\" or GRAS.",
      "Advisers to Kennedy, Trump's pick for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, have also floated other approaches to curbing the use of food additives, including working with agricultural producers to change the subsidies and incentives offered by the government for certain kinds of foods Kennedy argues are unhealthy.",
      "\"I think the overall posture of the FDA should be actually a lot of deregulation. I think we should have a golden age of innovation and drug development. Nobody's standing in the way of that,\" Calley Means, a top adviser to Kennedy's transition team, said this month on \"The Liz Wheeler Show.\"",
      "Means said \"corrupt regulatory interpretations\" had broken the regulation of additives under the GRAS process, saying it had become a \"totally rigged system.\"",
      "\"But when it comes to food, when it comes to 'generally recognized as safe,' complete self-policing from this industry, allowing them to put chemicals in our food that are banned in every other country and have hundreds of studies saying are harmful, there needs to be a review,\" Means said.",
      "\"This is a bananas system\"",
      "Advocacy groups and experts have long denounced the FDA's \"loophole\" in its regulation of these food additives, which allows companies to quietly decide which chemicals they deem safe enough to add to their products without going through the agency's oversight.",
      "\"This is a bananas system. This is not the way that new food chemicals should be approved and come into our food supply,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.",
      "While companies with new chemicals can choose to go through a \"voluntary\" process to earn a spot on the agency's list of substances that are \"generally recognized as safe,\" making it easier to market foods with the additives, officials acknowledge companies often bypass it.",
      "\"It does undermine the overall credibility of the system when it is possible to get a chemical on the market without prior review by the FDA,\" the agency's top food official, Jim Jones, said at an event hosted by the Alliance for a Stronger FDA earlier this year.",
      "Bill Freese, science director for the Center for Food Safety, cited times companies have decided to go ahead and \"self-certify\" that their food additives were safe, even after failing to earn the sign-off of the FDA's reviewers during the voluntary process.",
      "That has strayed far from the original intent of the provision, Freese said, which was supposed to narrowly \"grandfather in\" foods with a long history of safe use like salt and vinegar.",
      "\"These GRAS exemptions should be limited. The FDA just expanded the loophole until it just literally swallowed the entire statute,\" he said.",
      "Obstacles in Congress and the courts",
      "Making it mandatory for companies to go through the GRAS notification process before using any new food ingredients will likely face hurdles.",
      "Cracking down on food additives would dramatically broaden the FDA's workload. The agency would have to both screen new notifications as well as look back at previously greenlighted chemicals.",
      "FDA officials have long called for Congress to step up funding for oversight of food additives, warning that resources were stretched thin even with the current duties.",
      "One idea to broaden FDA's funding \u2014 attaching fees to applications submitted by food manufacturers, similar to the \"user fees\" programs for medical products \u2014 has also failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill. Kennedy has also been critical of the \"user fees\" approach for drugs, and has called to undo it.",
      "Another obstacle could come through the courts, especially in light of a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that curtailed agency power.",
      "Advocacy groups lost a previous federal lawsuit against the FDA trying to require the notifications back in 2021. In that case, the judge found that \"it remains unclear under the statute whether FDA even has the authority to make GRAS notifications mandatory.\"",
      "\"I think there are certainly things within FDA's power to narrow the loophole, to make it harder for companies to take advantage of the GRAS process. But there is some legal precedence saying that this is Congress' problem to fix, so we'll just have to see,\" said Benesh.",
      "While Kennedy's team acknowledges the issue may end up needing to be hashed out through legislation on Capitol Hill, changing the procedure solely through the executive branch is on the table, an adviser said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said he is asking Trump to \"declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease\" as another way to supercharge his authorities amid blowback they expect from the food industry.",
      "\"This is not a monolithic, this is not an all-powerful industry. They can be disrupted. So that's what gives me hope. The voters and President Trump's microphone are on our side,\" Means said.",

      "Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX founder who is helping lead a Trump-sanctioned effort to get the new Department of Government Efficiency off the ground, claimed on his social media platform Thursday that he had \"just learned tonight at Mar-a-Lago that Jeff Bezos was telling everyone that @realDonaldTrump would lose for sure, so they should sell all their Tesla and SpaceX stock.\"",

      "In late October, the Bezos-owned Washington Post \u2014 which had been set to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for president \u2014 controversially broke from tradition by deciding that its opinion editors would\u00a0not support\u00a0a candidate.",
      "Although the Amazon founder defended the decision as a \"principled\" one, critics decried the move as an effort to avoid antagonizing Trump should he get elected. Famed former Washington Post editor Marty Baron blasted the decision as \"cowardice,\" while several prominent journalists at the paper quit. National Public Radio later reported that more than 200,000 WaPo readers had canceled their subscriptions.",
      "Since then, Trump's win has thrust Musk even more into the spotlight, with the technology entrepreneur working alongside businessman Vivek Ramaswamy to create a temporary agency charged with chopping wasteful federal spending.",

      "Time also presented a checklist of what the publication described as Musk's career goals, from becoming the world's richest man and designing a brain chip implant to getting Trump elected. But Musk took issue with that framing.",

      "The attorney general also has the power to appoint special counsels, lawyers who investigate \u2014 and prosecute \u2014 cases in which the Justice Department may have conflicts of interest. Trump has raged against the special counsels who investigated him during and after his first term in office.",
      "Agriculture secretary",

    "summary": "Colin Gray and his son, Colt Gray, were both indicted in the Sept. 4 shooting that killed two students and two teachers and injured others.",
    "story": [
      "The father of a 14-year-old boy accused of carrying out a deadly mass shooting at Apalachee High School in Georgia pleaded not guilty on Thursday to the charges against him.",
      "Colin Gray was not in court, but his lawyers told the judge during a brief hearing that their client pleads not guilty and waived formal arraignment. It's common in Georgia for defendants to enter a plea and waive arraignment.",
      "Gray and his son, Colt Gray, were both indicted in the Sept. 4 shooting that killed two students and two teachers and injured others. Colt Gray is charged as an adult and was indicted on 55 counts, including murder and 25 counts of aggravated assault at the high school. His father was indicted on 29 counts, including two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of involuntary manslaughter. Both also face multiple counts of cruelty to children.",
      "Colt Gray entered a not guilty plea last month and also waived arraignment.",
      "Colt Gray is being held in a juvenile detention center in Gainesville, while Colin Gray, 54, is being held in the Barrow County jail. Neither has sought to be released on bail.",
      "The shooting killed teachers Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Cristina Irimie, 53, and students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14. Another teacher and eight more students were wounded, seven of them hit by gunfire.",
      "Colin Gray is the first adult known to be charged in a school shooting in Georgia. His indictment is the latest example of prosecutors holding parents responsible for their children's actions in school shootings. Michigan parents Jennifer and James Crumbley, the first to be convicted in a U.S. mass school shooting, were sentenced to at least 10 years in prison for not securing a firearm at home and acting indifferently to signs of their son's deteriorating mental health before he killed four students in 2021.",
      "Investigators have said Colt Gray carried a semiautomatic assault-style rifle onto a school bus, with the barrel sticking out of his book bag, wrapped up in a poster board. They say the boy carefully plotted the shooting at the 1,900-student high school northeast of Atlanta, drawing diagrams and listing potential body counts in a notebook. He left his second-period class and emerged from a bathroom with the rifle before shooting people in a classroom and hallways.",
      "Last month, authorities\u00a0revealed details from the alleged shooter's notebooks\u00a0that included detailed plans of the attack as well as violent drawings. Witnesses testified Colin Gray knew of his son's struggles with his mental health but purchased a laser sight, tactical vest and ammunition for him in the months leading up to the shooting.",
      "Investigators also said that the alleged shooter made a \"shrine\" to school shooters in his room, and hung a picture of the Parkland shooter, who killed 17 people at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018. Their testimony revealed his father was aware of his obsession with school shooters, and that the teenager had even discussed the Parkland shooting with his grandmother around a week before the shooting.",

      "That's sure to mean plenty of Thanksgiving treats going through airport scanners, whether it's dishes getting transported to a family gathering or leftovers being ferried home.",
      "Most foods can be brought through a security checkpoint, the TSA said in a news release, but there are some items that can only be transported in a checked bag. To make holiday planning easier on everyone, the TSA released a list of which Thanksgiving foods can be brought in a carry-on, and what needs to go in a checked bag.",
      "Here's what the TSA says about flying with Thanksgiving food.",
      "What Thanksgiving food can you bring through TSA?",
      "The TSA says that many prepared Thanksgiving foods can be brought through a security checkpoint. This includes baked goods, whether homemade or store-bought; frozen, cooked or uncooked meats, and classic sides like mac and cheese and cooked or uncooked stuffing.",
      "Casseroles, including \"traditional green beans and onion straws or something more exotic\" can also be brought through security, the TSA said. Spices and candy can be brought through. Many fresh fruits and vegetables can also go through security, including seasonal treats like yams, Brussels sprouts, beets, squash, pears, cranberries and more.",
      "Ice packs can go through security, but they must be frozen solid and not melted when they go through the screening.",
      "Even though these food items can be brought through security, they may need extra screening, the TSA said. Make sure they are in an easily accessible location in a carry-on bag, and remove them from the bag and place them in a bin for screening when at the security checkpoint.",
      "What Thanksgiving food isn't allowed through airport security?",
      "Liquids and sauces should be carefully packed in checked baggage, the TSA said. This includes homemade or canned cranberry sauce, homemade or jarred gravy, canned fruits or vegetables in liquid, and preserves, jams, jellies and maple syrup.",
      "Wine, champagne and sparkling apple cider must also be checked.",
      "\"Here's some food for thought. If it's a solid item, then it can go through a checkpoint,\" the TSA said. \"However, if you can spill it, spread it, spray it, pump it or pour it, and it's larger than 3.4 ounces, then it should go in a checked bag.\"",
      "The myTSA app's \"What can I bring?\" feature allows travelers to type in an item to find out more about how it can be transported. Travelers can also reach out to the TSA on social media or by texting AskTSA (275-872).",

    "story": [
      "Authorities have seen a surge of guns and ammunition flowing from the United States to Latin America and the Caribbean, fueling conflict in regions already struggling with violence and unrest.",
      "Last week, U.S.-based airlines were struck by gunfire while flying over Haiti's airspace. While the origin of the firearms remains uncertain, Haiti has no domestic firearms manufacturing capacity, and aside from a small artisanal market, the majority of weapons fueling the violence are likely sourced from the U.S.",
      "A new report from research organization Small Arms Survey reveals a staggering nearly 120% surge in firearm shipments seized en route from the U.S. to the Caribbean and Latin America since 2016.",
      "\"Available evidence indicates that traffickers in the U.S. are a major source of illicit weapons in the Caribbean and Latin America,\" said Matt Schroeder, senior researcher at Small Arms Survey and author of the report. \"The illicit acquisition and use of firearms in the Caribbean and Latin America ranks among the most pressing security threats in the hemisphere.\"",
      "Their analysis, based on previously unpublished border seizure data obtained through public records requests, highlights a growing problem. These figures represent only the weapons actually seized, leaving out the vast number of guns trafficked across the U.S. or uncovered through criminal investigations. While it's unclear if these increases reflect more thorough screening, a rise in trafficking or improved data collection, the trend unmistakably points to a consistent demand for illicit firearms.",
      "The black market of American guns and ammunition has been well-established by U.S. and international law enforcement as a key source of weapons fueling humanitarian crises and violence in places like Mexico, Haiti and beyond. A 2023 CBS Reports investigation found up to a million firearms are smuggled across the border annually, including military-grade weapons like grenade launchers and belt-fed Gatling-style miniguns.",
      "The illicit flow of firearms is now a major concern across the Caribbean as well. A recent report by the Government Accountability Office shows that U.S.-sourced firearms account for the vast majority of the violence in Caribbean nations. The report states that 73% of the firearms recovered in the Caribbean between 2018 and 2023 were traced back to the U.S., with a significant portion of these weapons sold in Florida, Georgia and Texas. These firearms are responsible for 90% of homicides in some of the region's most vulnerable nations.",
      "The Small Arms Survey's latest findings reflect these broader trends, with a troubling shift in the types of firearms being seized in shipments bound for the Caribbean. While shipments to Latin America, particularly Mexico, still account for the majority of firearm seizures, the Caribbean has seen a notable increase in the interception of AK- and AR-style rifles, as well as high-capacity magazines.",
      "Of the seized rifles headed for the Caribbean, 77% were AK- and AR-style rifles, compared with 48% in shipments to Mexico and 61% to other Latin American countries \u2014 though the total number of rifles seized while heading to the Caribbean remains lower than the quantities seized in shipments to Latin America. In the Caribbean-bound shipments, 93% of the magazines that were identifiable by capacity were capable of holding more than 10 rounds, making them high-capacity magazines.",

    "summary": "Dnipro bears the brunt of Moscow's first retaliatory strike after Ukraine fires U.S.-made missiles into Russia, and Ukraine claims Moscow may have used an ICBM.",
    "story": [
      "Russia launched a barrage of missiles at Ukraine Thursday in its first major retaliation for Ukraine's attack earlier in the week on a military facility in the Russian region of Bryansk. That strike saw the Ukrainians use American-made and supplied long-range missiles known as ATACMS, which President Biden had given the Ukrainian forces permission to fire deeper into Russian territory only two days earlier.",
      "Moscow had warned the U.S. and its NATO allies for months against granting Ukraine permission to fire Western missiles into Russia, and Mr. Biden's weekend decision to permit such strikes drew stark new warnings from lawmakers and Russian media close to President Vladimir Putin that the U.S. was escalating the nearly three-year conflict at the risk of sparking a new world war.",
      "The U.S. and its allies have argued that it's Putin escalating the war he started by ordering the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, including by deploying more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers to bolster his own forces in recent weeks. But there was little doubt that Moscow would respond to the Ukrainians' first use of the American ATACMS to strike inside Russia somehow, and air raid sirens blared across the country Wednesday as the U.S. closed its embassy in Kyiv and warned of a possible imminent \"significant air attack.\"",
      "The attack didn't come on Wednesday, but rather overnight, with Russian missiles targeting several cities but hitting central-eastern Dnipro the hardest. The Ukrainian Air Force claimed that Russia's assault on the city included its first use during the war of an intercontinental ballistic missile, though a Western official told CBS News on Thursday that an ICBM was not used in the strike.",
      "Two U.S. officials also told CBS News that Russia had fired a ballistic missile, not an ICBM on Thursday, with one saying it appeared to have been an intermediate range ballistic missile launched from just east of Volgograd, Russia, to target Dnipro. If accurate, that would be a flight path of about 500 miles.",
      "Despite the denials from U.S. officials, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on social media that \"all the characteristics\" of a Russian missile used in the strike on Dnipro \"corresponds to an intercontinental ballistic missile,\" though he said an investigation was underway to confirm exactly what had been fired at the city.",
      "Zelenskyy accused \"our crazy neighbor\" Russia of using his country \"as a testing ground\" for its new weapons.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News later Thursday that Russia was believed to have launched an experimental intermediate range ballistic missile based on the country's RS-26 Rubezh missile.",
      "The U.S. was notified prior to the launch through nuclear risk reduction channels, the official said, adding that the U.S. had briefed Ukraine and close allies and partners in recent days about the possibility that Russia could use such a weapon in order to help them prepare.",
      "Russia is likely to only possess a handful of the experimental weapons, the official said, noting that Ukraine has withstood countless Russian attacks with missiles that had significantly larger warheads that this experimental IRBM.",
      "The official also added that President Biden earlier this year said the U.S. was providing Ukraine with hundreds of additional Patriot and AMRAAM missiles to strengthen its air defenses, many of which have already been delivered.",
      "During a live televised news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova received a phone call and a man identified only as \"Masha\" could be heard ordering her not to make any comment on the \"ballistic missile strike that the Westerners have started talking about\" in Dnipro.",

      "\"The Israeli government doesn't want it to happen. They want to punish the Palestinians, because the basic premise is that all of the Palestinians in Gaza support the terrorists and therefore they all should be punished,\" Olmert told CBS News, adding that if the Israeli army is able to build roads in Gaza, it should be \"capable of making the necessary logistical arrangements\" to provide humanitarian support for the people that live there.",

    "summary": "A volcano erupted in southern Iceland, near the town of Grindav\u00edk and the Blue Lagoon spa, marking the region's seventh eruption in a year.",
    "story": [
      "A volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula in Iceland flared again late Wednesday night, marking the region's seventh eruption in just one year.",
      "Lava burst from a crack in the ground before midnight local time, originating in a spot where there has been a resurgence of volcanic activity. It happened quickly and sent a molten stream traveling toward the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's most famous tourist attraction. It's a geothermal spa set in a lava field just outside the town of Grindav\u00edk that draws nearly a million visitors each year.",
      "Tourists were evacuated from the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's national broadcaster R\u00daV\u00a0reported. Some can be seen venturing startlingly close to the magma, in an apparent effort to capture the eruption on their phones, in a video published by the broadcaster. Response crews ushered them to safety before the magma roiled farther over the area, covering a section of the parking lot adjacent to the Blue Lagoon as well as a critical pipeline that funnels hot water from a geothermal power station, called Svartsengi, into the spa and around the peninsula.",
      "Striking aerial footage of the situation also published by R\u00daV showed the expanse of the eruption. Fiery magma blankets the ground in the video, and thick smoke rises from it into the air.",
      "People were evacuated from about 50 homes Wednesday in Grindav\u00edk, a small fishing town on Iceland's southern peninsula, according to the country's Civil Protection Agency. The agency said it was unclear exactly which volcano was erupting, but noted the lava came from the same area experiencing volcanic activity.\u00a0Grindav\u00edk is some 30 miles south of Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland's capital city. Icelandic officials have not reported issues in the capital caused by the eruption.",
      "Officials said Thursday that volcanic activity was ongoing, with seismic monitors indicating the magma had spread over at least 7 square kilometers of land, slightly less than 4 1/2 square miles. The Njar\u00f0v\u00edk pipeline could still function Thursday beneath the magma, said the Icelandic Meteorological Office. Magma had crossed the road into Grindav\u00edk when the office shared its most recent update, but the eruption's peak had seemingly passed by then and the fissure from which it originated had shortened, according to measurements taken by the National Police Commissioner's special forces unit.",
      "Earthquakes in the area caused the ground to split and triggered the volcano, the office said. Iceland is situated on top of a rift between two tectonic plates, which makes the island nation vulnerable to\u00a0earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which have rocked portions of the country and displaced residents in recent years.",
      "It was the seventh time Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula experienced a volcanic eruption since December 2023, with multiple previous flares breaking out over the summer. Officials said the latest eruption was less severe than the last one, which happened in August and resulted in multiple ground fissures as well as a subsequent 4.1-magnitude earthquake. The August incident came just two months after an eruption continued spewing lava for more than three weeks.",
      "At the time, a regional police chief told Icelandic media that most of Grindav\u00edk's 4,000 residents had evacuated from their homes the prior November when the spell of volcanic activity started to kick up. While some had returned part-time to the town, few were comfortable staying overnight, the police chief said. Those who had returned were successfully evacuated.",
      "Before the Mount Fagradalsfjall eruption in March 2021, the Reykjanes peninsula had not seen volcanic activity in roughly 800 years. Since then, seismologists have carefully observed the reawakening of a long-dormant fault line running under the landscape.",

      "Brazil's federal police said Thursday they indicted former President Jair Bolsonaro and 36 other people for allegedly attempting a coup to keep him in office after his defeat in the 2022 elections.",

      "The former right-wing president has denied all claims he tried to stay in office after his narrow electoral defeat in 2022 to his rival, leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro has faced a series of legal threats since then.",
      "Police said in a brief statement that the Supreme Court had agreed to reveal the names of all 37 people who were indicted \"to avoid the dissemination of incorrect news.\" The 700-page police document likely will take several days for the court to review, Supreme Court justice Alexandre de Moraes said.",
      "Dozens of former and current Bolsonaro aides also were indicted, including Gen. Walter Braga Netto, who was his running mate in the 2022 campaign; former Army commander Gen. Paulo S\u00e9rgio Nogueira de Oliveira; Valdemar Costa Neto, the chairman of Bolsonaro's Liberal Party; and his veteran former adviser, Gen. Augusto Heleno.",
      "The investigation started last year. On Tuesday, four military men and one federal police agent were arrested as part of the same probe.",

      "\"Bolsonaro is already barred from running in the 2026 elections,\" Melo told the The Associated Press.",
      "\"And if he is convicted he could also be jailed by then. To avoid being behind bars, he will have to convince Supreme Court justices that he has nothing to do with a plot that involves dozens of his aides. That's a very tall order,\" Melo said.",

    "story": [
      "The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, along with Hamas leader Mohammed Deif, whom Israel has\u00a0said was killed in an airstrike in July.",
      "Judges found there were \"reasonable grounds to believe that\" both Netanyahu and Gallant \"intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity, from at least 8 October 2023 to 20 May 2024,\" when the ICC prosecutor filed applications for the arrest warrants, the ICC said in a statement Thursday.",
      "\"This finding is based on the role of Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant in impeding humanitarian aid in violation of international humanitarian law and their failure to facilitate relief by all means at its disposal,\" the ICC said.",
      "Judges at the United Nations court \"found that their conduct led to the disruption of the ability of humanitarian organizations to provide food and other essential goods to the population in need in Gaza. The aforementioned restrictions together with cutting off electricity and reducing fuel supply also had a severe impact on the availability of water in Gaza and the ability of hospitals to provide medical care.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas respond to ICC arrest warrants",
      "Israeli officials condemned the ICC prosecutor's decision to seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant in May, and they were quick to lambast the issuing of the warrants on Thursday.",
      "Netanyahu's office issued a scathing statement dismissing the ICC as antisemitic and claiming its chief prosecutor had only sought the warrants in the first place to distract from sexual misconduct allegations.",
      "\"Israel rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions and charges against it by the International Criminal Court, which is a biased and discriminatory political body,\" Netanyahu's office said. \"There is nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza... after the terrorist organization Hamas launched a murderous attack against it, committing the greatest massacre committed against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.\"",
      "\"No anti-Israeli decision will prevent the State of Israel from protecting its citizens,\" the statement said, adding that Netanyahu himself would \"not give in to pressure, will not back down, and will not retreat until all the war goals that Israel set at the start of the campaign are achieved.\"",
      "Gallant, in a statement, said the court's decision had put Israel and \"the murderous leaders of Hamas in the same row and thus legitimizes the murder of babies, the rape of women and the abduction of the elderly from their beds. The decision sets a dangerous precedent against the right to self-defense and moral warfare and encourages murderous terrorism.\"",
      "Deif, the commander of Hamas' military wing whom Israel says it killed over the summer, was accused by the ICC judges of being \"responsible for the crimes against humanity of murder; extermination; torture; and rape and other forms of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture; taking hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and rape and other form of sexual violence,\" in connection to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the ongoing war.",
      "About 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed in that attack and some 250 others taken hostage.",
      "Hamas has not confirmed or denied Deif's killing in a July Israeli airstrike.",
      "In a statement, Hamas called the ICC decision an \"important step towards justice for the Palestinian cause.\"",
      "Making no mention of the warrant for Deif's arrest, Hamas said \"a message must be sent to every war criminal that he will not escape punishment regardless [of] how long it will take and no matter how much he tries to mislead people or distort the narrative, truth with prevail.\"",
      "What do the ICC arrest warrants mean practically?",
      "Theoretically, the arrest warrants could limit the movements of Netanyahu and Gallant, as any of the 124 member states where the court has jurisdiction would be obligated to arrest them. Deif, if he's still alive, would already have his movements restricted inside Gaza as Israel's military operations there continue.",
      "The ICC does not have a police force, so any arrest would be at the discretion of local law enforcement in member states. Israel and the United States are not signatories, so they do not fall under the jurisdiction of the court.",
      "The foreign minister of the Netherlands said the country was preparing to act on the warrants, the Reuters news agency reported.",

      "The U.S. sought commitments from the Ukrainians on their use to further limit the risk to civilians, the official said, noting that Ukrainians are committed to not employing the mines in areas populated with their own civilians.",
      "The U.S.-provided APLs are different than the thousands of landmines being employed by Russia in eastern Ukraine in that they are \"non-persistent,\" meaning they become inert over a preset period of time, usually between four hours and two weeks, the official said. They are electrically fused and require battery power to detonate. Once the battery runs out, they will not detonate.",
      "Tuesday marked 1,000 days since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. CBS News learned Sunday that President Biden had lifted restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S. weapons to conduct strikes deep inside Russia.",
      "U.S.-supplied ATACMS were used Tuesday on targets inside Russia, U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Ukraine has been one of the most mined countries in the world since Russia's invasion in 2022, and Ukraine is inundated with APLs. They are known by deceptively innocent names such as \"butterfly\" or \"petal\" mines because they scatter like flower petals when they drop from the sky.",
      "\"Typically, several hundred of these at a time will just be liberally and indiscriminately spread across the territory,\" Pete Smith, the Ukraine program manager for the HALO Trust, a nonprofit organization focused on ridding warzones of landmines, told \"60 Minutes\" in August. \"They can rest on the roofs. They can sit in guttering. They can take years before they come back into society and into view.\"",
      "To date, 164 nations, including Ukraine, have signed onto the Mine Ban Treaty which prohibits the use of APLs. However, three dozen countries have not agreed to it, including Russia and the U.S.",
      "In January 2020, then-President Donald Trump reversed an Obama-era policy which banned the use of APLs anywhere except on the Korean Peninsula. However, in June 2022, Mr. Biden reinstated the ban, except for APLs \"required for the defense of the Republic of Korea.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 19:33:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Gautam Adani, one of the world's richest people, is accused of concealing that a solar energy project was being facilitated by an alleged $265 million bribery scheme.",
    "story": [
      "An Indian businessman who is one of the world's richest people has been indicted in the U.S. on charges he duped investors by concealing that his company's huge solar energy project on the subcontinent was being facilitated by an alleged $265 million bribery scheme.",
      "Gautam Adani, 62, was charged in an indictment unsealed Wednesday with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud. The case involves a lucrative arrangement for Adani Green Energy Ltd. and another firm to sell 12 gigawatts of solar power to the Indian government \u2014 enough to light millions of homes and businesses.",
      "The indictment portrays Adani and his co-defendants of playing two sides of the deal.",
      "It accuses them of portraying it as rosy and above-board to Wall Street investors who poured several billion dollars into the project while, back in India, they were paying or planning to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials in exchange for billions of dollars' worth of contracts and financing.",
      "Adani and his co-defendants allegedly sought to \"obtain and finance massive state energy supply contracts through corruption and fraud at the expense of U.S. investors,\" Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller said.",
      "In a parallel civil action, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Adani and two co-defendants of violating antifraud provisions of U.S. securities laws. The regulator is seeking monetary penalties and other sanctions.",
      "Both cases were filed in federal court in Brooklyn. Adani's co-defendants include his nephew Sagar Adani, the executive director of Adani Green Energy's board, and Vneet Jaain, who was the company's chief executive from 2020 to 2023 and remains managing director of its board.",
      "Online court records did not list a lawyer who could speak on Adani's behalf. An email message seeking comment was left with an arm of his conglomerate, the Adani Group. Emails were also sent to lawyers representing his co-defendants. Sagar Adani's lawyer, Sean Hecker, declined the comment. The others did not immediately respond.",
      "Sanjay Wadhwa, acting director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said Gautam and Sagar Adani are accused of persuading investors to buy their company's bonds by misrepresenting \"not only that Adani Green had a robust anti-bribery compliance program but also that the company's senior management had not and would not pay or promise to pay bribes.\"",
      "According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Adani is the 19th richest person in the world with an estimated total net worth of about $85.5 billion. However, that is down significantly from 2022, when he briefly overtook Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as No. 2 on the list with a net worth of more than $146 billion.",
      "He is a power player in the world's most populous nation. He built his fortune in the coal business in the 1990s. The Adani Group grew to involve many aspects of Indian life, from making defense equipment to building roads to selling cooking oil.",
      "In recent years, Adani has made big moves into renewable energy, embracing a philosophy of sustainable growth reflected in its slogan: \"Growth with Goodness.\"",
      "Last year, a U.S.-based financial research firm accused Adani and his company of \"brazen stock manipulation\" and \"accounting fraud.\" The Adani Group called the claims \"a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations.\"",
      "The firm in question is known as a short-seller, a Wall Street term for traders that essentially bet on the prices of certain stocks to fall, and it had made such investments in relation to the Adani Group.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed new protections for giraffes, saying their populations are threatened by poaching, habitat loss and climate change.",
    "story": [
      "Giraffe populations are in trouble \u2014 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday proposed listing three subspecies of the tall animals as endangered and two species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their populations have been declining because of poaching, habitat loss and climate change, officials said. While giraffes are not native to the U.S., listing them under the act would still provide protections to giraffe populations.",
      "The Endangered Species Act, enacted in 1973, establishes protections for fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Under the act, federal agencies are required to ensure their actions are unlikely to jeopardize listed species, according to the agency.",
      "\"Federal protections for giraffes will help protect a vulnerable species, foster biodiversity, support ecosystem health, combat wildlife trafficking, and promote sustainable economic practices,\" USFWS Director Martha Williams said in a press release. \"This action supports giraffe conservation while ensuring the United States does not contribute further to their decline.\"",
      "Specifically, officials said the listing would help giraffes by reducing the illegal hunting and trade of giraffes by requiring permits for import into the U.S. Trade is not the primary factor behind population decline, but it is playing a role, USFWS said. Their hair and tails have long been used in traditional medicine, the agency added, and in recent years giraffes have also been targeted by hunters for bushmeat.",
      "Listing them under the Endangered Species Act would also increase funding for species conservation in range countries and for research efforts to address conservation. It would also provide some limited financial support for developing and managing programs to conserve giraffes, the USFWS said.",
      "Giraffe subspecies from across Africa are at risk, according to the agency. The service proposed listing West African, Kordofan and Nubian giraffes as endangered. It also proposed listing Masai and reticulated giraffes as threatened.",
      "The West African, Kordofan and Nubian \u2014 all subspecies of the northern giraffe \u2014 have seen their population fall around 77% since 1985, according to federal officials. There are around 5,900 left, including only about 690 West African giraffes remain.",
      "The vast majority of reticulated giraffes live in Kenya, and their population is estimated at 15,985, according to USFWS. There are around 45,400 Masai giraffes \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to 67% of their population in the 1970s.",
      "Giraffes feed on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits, so human population growth and habitat loss can hurt the species. Instances of drought have also led to increased human-wildlife conflicts.",
      "The proposed rule to list the giraffe species has a 90-day comment period.",

In those years, drug cartel gunmen massacred 72 migrants, many from Central America, and killed about 122 bus passengers. Those victims were pulled off passing buses and forced to fight each other to the death with sledgehammers.",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin approved changes to his country's nuclear doctrine this week, formally amending the conditions \u2014 and lowering the threshold \u2014 under which Russia would consider using its nuclear weapons. Moscow announced Tuesday that Putin had signed off on the changes to the doctrine, formally known as \"The basics of state policy in the field of nuclear deterrence,\"  as Ukraine launched its first strike deeper into Russia using U.S.-supplied missiles.",
      "The updated doctrine states that Russia will treat an attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a country with nuclear capabilities as a joint attack by both. That means any attack on Russia by a country that's part of a coalition could be seen as an attack by the entire group.",
      "Under the doctrine, Russia could theoretically consider any major attack on its territory, even with conventional weapons, by non-nuclear-armed Ukraine sufficient to trigger a nuclear response, because Ukraine is backed by the nuclear-armed United States.",
      "Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine multiple times since he ordered the full-scale invasion of the country on Feb. 24, 2022, and Russia has repeatedly warned the West that if Washington allowed Ukraine to fire Western-made missiles deep into its territory, it would consider the U.S. and its NATO allies to be directly involved in the war.",
      "U.S. officials said Ukraine fired eight U.S.-made ATACMS missiles into Russia's Bryansk region early Tuesday, just a couple days after President Biden gave Ukraine permission to fire the weapons deeper into Russian territory. ATACMS are powerful weapons with a maximum range of almost 190 miles.",
      "\"This is the latest instance of a long string of nuclear rhetoric and signaling that has been coming out of Moscow since the beginning of this full scale invasion,\" Mariana Budjeryn, Senior Research Associate at Harvard's Belfer Center, told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle when the change to Russia's nuclear doctrine was first proposed last month.",
      "\"The previous version of the Russian doctrine adopted in 2020 allowed also a nuclear response to a large-scale conventional attack, but only in extreme circumstances where the very survival of the state was at stake,\" Budjeryn noted. \"This formulation has changed to say, well, extreme circumstances that jeopardize the sovereignty of Russia. Well, what does that really mean and who defines what serious threats to sovereignty might constitute?\"",

      "\"Russia has been using a number of delivery systems of missiles that [can] also come with a nuclear warhead. So these are dual capable systems. For example, Iskander M short range ballistic missiles. Those have been used extensively in this war by Russia. So when we have an incoming from Russia to Ukraine and we see that it's an Iskander missile, we don't know if it's nuclear tipped or conventionally tipped,\" Budjeryn said.",

In the city's biggest national security case to date, they were accused of agreeing to veto government-proposed budgets after potentially securing a legislative majority to force a dissolution of the legislature and the ouster of the city's leader.",

Wong said Australia has expressed strong objections to authorities in China and Hong Kong over the continuing broad application of national security legislation.",

      "Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.",
      "Sydney Sweeney has become the next big movie star.",
      "The 27-year-old blonde bombshell gained commercial success after starring in TV shows such as \"Sharp Objects\" and \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" However, Sweeney's big break came after she was cast as Cassie in \"Euphoria\" and then Olivia in \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "Sweeney's tenure of supporting roles in some of HBO's biggest hits led to a multimillion-dollar payout in the form of blockbuster movie roles as she has moved from supporting star to Hollywood's \"it girl.\"",

      "\"To her credit, for all the 'it girls' who had their 15 minutes of fame, few used that platform to fortify their fan base while working to diversify their portfolio, both vertically and laterally,\" branding expert Doug Eldridge told Fox News Digital. \"Sweeney understands how the 'scaffolding model' works and is utilizing it to great effect.\"",
      "\"Sweeney also has a unique sense of relatability. She attracts male viewers but doesn't turn off female fans,\" he added. \"This is a more tenuous high-wire balancing act than you might imagine. Over the last 30 years, Julia Roberts and Jennifer Aniston made their entire career by playing a singular role ('Pretty Woman' and \u2018Friends,\u2019 respectively). They can do no wrong in the minds of female fans, but they don't necessarily garner that same fervor among male fans.\"",
      "Sydney Sweeney \"has a unique sense of relatability,\" according to branding expert Doug Eldridge. (Earl Gibson III/Penske Media via Getty Images)",
      "He continued, \"By contrast, Angelina Jolie drew a massive male audience but was largely vilified and rejected by female viewers. I draw that parallel to put Sweeney's rise in context: She has taken a brick-by-brick approach, navigating and balancing between her looks, her likability and her raw theatrical talent. She is becoming a Swiss army knife of ability, a versatile tool in Hollywood, that doesn't come around very often. There's also a sense of humility and self-depreciation that is endearing to both male and female fans, and that's an increasingly rare trait these days.\"",
      "\"Sweeney also has a unique sense of relatability. She attracts male viewers but doesn't turn off female fans. This is a more tenuous high-wire balancing act than you might imagine.\"",
      "Sweeney earned $2 million for her role in \"Anyone But You\" alongside Glen Powell, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The film, which premiered in December 2023, earned $220 million at the box office using a $25 million budget, the outlet reported. Sweeney also reportedly made $250,000 in an executive producing fee.",
      "Less than a year later, multiple sources told THR that Sweeney signed a $7.5 million deal to star in \"The Housemaid\" alongside Amanda Seyfried.",

      "Sydney Sweeney starred alongside Glen Powell in \"Anyone But You.\" (Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)",
      "Sweeney's rise to Hollywood \"it girl\" came from \"strategic career planning,\" Gary Frayter, celebrity brand and social media director with Kronus Communications, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"By choosing diverse and challenging roles early on, she built credibility and a loyal fan base,\" he said. \"Beyond acting, she leveraged her momentum by founding her own production company, Fifty-Fifty Films, which allowed her to take control of her career trajectory and explore behind-the-scenes opportunities. This strategic approach, paired with brand partnerships and a strong social media presence, has positioned her as both a Hollywood star and a savvy entrepreneur.\"",
      "\"Sydney's journey exemplifies the power of blending artistic talent with entrepreneurial foresight to achieve sustained success in the entertainment industry,\" Frayter added.",
      "Sydney Sweeney starred as Cassie Howard on the HBO show \"Euphoria\" in one of her earlier roles. (Jeff Kravitz)",
      "One strategic move Sweeney made was to take the supporting role in \"Madame Web,\" for which she was reportedly paid $750,000. The actress took the role in the Spider-Man universe film for Sony Pictures to pick up \"Anyone But You.\"",
      "\"She wanted them to know she was a team player,\" a source told THR.",
      "Sweeney's ability to showcase her \"versatility\" has definitely helped the rising star, but isn't her \"most significant move,\" according to Eldridge.",
      "\"'Madame Web' was a box-office bomb, but it was another feather in the cap for Sweeney,\" he said. \"It's not so much a case of 'failing upward' as it is consistently expanding her base and showcasing her versatility. By contrast, she played to her core base with the rom-com 'Anyone But You' and literally laughed all the way to the bank as the film raked in more than $230 million at the global box office. The real significance of that haul is that it didn't come on the heels of a glitzy marketing campaign, it was driven almost entirely by fan support. That's a testament both to her fan base and her emerging star power.\"",

      "\"In the bigger picture, I think the most significant move she has made hasn't been the roles she's taken but the companies she's building,\" Eldridge added. \"She formed her own production company and is now vetting incoming projects as well as developing her own content. This is significant as it will determine which direction her career heads from here. But like I always tell clients, 'Kites rise against the wind, not with it.' I think Sweeney will likely heed this strategy and continue to selectively tack against the winds of Hollywood. If she does, the sky is the limit.\"",

      "\"They don\u2019t pay actors like they used to, and with streamers, you no longer get residuals,\" Sweeney added. \"The established stars still get paid, but I have to give 5% to my lawyer, 10% to my agents, 3% or something like that to my business manager.

That hasn't happened at any unit that we've seen so far. So, I don't know where he's coming up with these notions.\"",
      "Beyond not harming units, Haring went on to say that women have helped to improve the professionalism of units, especially infantry units.",
      "\"Infantry units had a culture of hazing and kind of abuse of each other,\" she said. \"Their presence there has turned a spotlight on that kind of behavior and has actually eliminated a lot of it across the force.

      "\"Why would you water down the effectiveness of our infantry units?

But the issue isn't women in combat. The issue is women in combat units, small groups of individuals where everybody needs to be essentially interchangeable and equally proficient at certain combat skills.\"",
      "\"The whole point of combat is to wield violence and to be able to absorb violence,\" she said. \"So there has to be a sameness or similarity to people so that they become easily interchangeable when it comes to fundamental skills, shoot, move and communicate skills.\"",
      "\"Everybody needs a baseline of that, and you want the baseline to be as high as possible,\" she concluded. \"That means that people need to be less similar rather than more diverse in their capabilities.\"",

    "summary": "Porch pirates are on the prowl this holiday season. Tech guru Kurt &quot;CyberGuy&quot; Knutsson has a number of tips to prevent holiday package thefts.",
    "story": [
      "The busy holiday shopping season is just around the corner and most of us will be targeted by an AI scam.",
      "As the holiday season approaches, the excitement of gift-giving can quickly turn into anxiety over package theft. With porch pirates on the prowl, your carefully delivered gifts can vanish right from your doorstep. In 2023 alone, a staggering\u00a0119 million packages were reported stolen, meaning one in every 180 deliveries disappeared into thin air.",
      "Cities like Seattle, Memphis and San Diego have become hot spots for these unfortunate heists.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever found yourself racing home to rescue a package, asking neighbors to keep an eye out or, worst of all, falling victim to these sneaky thieves, you\u2019re not alone. But don\u2019t worry! We\u2019ve got some tips that could save you from the holiday headache of package theft. Let\u2019s dive in.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "Alleged porch pirate taking packages from property (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 1: Get security cameras",
      "First things first, consider installing security cameras around your home. Having a good camera system can really make a difference when it comes to deterring those sneaky thieves. Depending upon how well your police department responds to porch pirate package theft, position your\u00a0video doorbell to capture the face of the pirate and your package deliveries. A Video Doorbell can push notifications to get a phone alert whenever anyone or anything approaches your door, even if they don't ring the doorbell.",
      "Also, you might want to consider adding a couple of nearly invisible\u00a0wireless cameras on tree limbs near the street at your house. We did it in hopes of being able to record a license plate if ever needed for police. I can set them to send a notification when the camera detects a person or car.",
      "When you\u2019re shopping for cameras, look for high-resolution video so you can see everything clearly, even at night, with night vision capabilities. Motion detection is a must. It\u2019ll alert you if someone gets too close to your front door. Plus, two-way audio lets you talk to anyone at your door, whether it\u2019s a delivery person or someone who shouldn\u2019t be there. And don\u2019t forget about cloud storage. This way, you can easily access footage whenever you need it. Check out my top picks for the\u00a0six best outdoor security cameras.",
      "Pro tip: If your camera has the feature, set your video camera to notify you when it identifies packages within view.",
      "GET MORE OF MY TOP PICKS TO AMP UP YOUR HOME SECURITY",
      "Image of a doorbell camera (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 2: Use tracking apps",
      "Next up, make sure you're using tracking apps for your deliveries. Most shipping companies offer tracking services that let you follow your package from the moment it leaves the warehouse until it arrives at your home.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "If you sign up for\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery, you\u2019ll get digital previews of what\u2019s coming to your mailbox, which is super handy. You can set up email or text alerts for delivery updates so you\u2019re always in the loop about when your packages are arriving. Some retailers even send you photos once your package has been delivered, giving you extra reassurance that it made it safely.",

      "BEST BLACK FRIDAY LAPTOP DEALS",
      "Tip 3: Make sure someone is home",
      "Now, let\u2019s talk about timing. It\u2019s important to have someone around to receive packages as soon as they arrive. This can be tricky since many deliveries happen during work hours. If you can swing it, try working from home on days when important packages are expected. If that\u2019s not possible, coordinate with friends, family members or roommates so someone is always there to grab\u00a0the delivery right away.",

      "Tip 4: Coordinate with your neighbors",
      "Don\u2019t underestimate the power of community. Teaming up with your neighbors can be a game-changer in preventing package theft. Sign up for neighborhood porch pirate alerts from popular local networks like\u00a0Neighbors and\u00a0Nextdoor apps. This is where people often post when they've had a package stolen and sometimes upload videos or images of the suspected porch pirates. Plus, making an agreement with trusted neighbors to watch each other\u2019s packages can really enhance security; there's strength in numbers.",

      "BEST BLACK FRIDAY PRINTER DEALS",
      "Tip 5: Have the package delivered somewhere else",
      "If home delivery feels too risky, consider alternative delivery options that offer more security. Many people choose to have their packages sent to their workplace if allowed; this way, they\u2019re less likely to be stolen than sitting on a porch all day. Retailers often provide secure pickup points where you can collect your packages at your convenience. Renting a P.O. Box or using services that hold packages for pickup at local shipping facilities are also great options for those valuable items.",
      "KURT\u2019S UNBEATABLE BEST BLACK FRIDAY DEALS",
      "A woman receiving packages at her workplace (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 6: Request a signature confirmation",
      "Another way to prevent package theft is to request a signature confirmation for your deliveries. This means that the delivery person will not leave the package at your door unless someone signs for it. You can request a signature confirmation from most delivery services, such as FedEx, UPS, USPS and DHL. This option may cost extra, but it can give you peace of mind that your package will not be stolen.",
      "Tip 7: Send to remote pick-up locations",
      "Did you know that most delivery services now offer remote pick-up locations? These can be secure lockers, post offices or retail counters. Amazon has hundreds of Amazon Lockers and pick-up counters across the country, which are free for Prime members.\u00a0See how\u00a0far away the nearest Amazon Locker is located from your home.",
      "When you're checking out, just click on\u00a0Change next to your shipping address, then select\u00a0Find a pickup location near you to see your options. Once your package is delivered, you'll get a notification or email with a code to retrieve it from the locker or pick-up point. Some items can even be returned at these locations.",
      "A person picking up a package from a locker (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 8: Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery",
      "We added a strong deadbolt to the door leading into the house from the garage before signing up. Now, when we are not home, an Amazon delivery can be placed securely inside our garage using the free service called Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery. The addition of a\u00a0smart garage controller is the first step. Once you've signed up for Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery, pick Key Delivery when checking out on Amazon to have your packages securely put in the garage. I really like that you can block access to your garage any time you want. The driver never needs your garage code, and access only works for their one-time delivery.",
      "A delivery being made using Amazon Key-In-Garage Delivery (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 9: Provide a delivery box",
      "Another great option is to invest in a\u00a0delivery box that allows packages to be securely dropped off and stored discreetly. Just remember that you'll need to inform delivery personnel about using the box and how it works.",
      "Package being placed in a delivery box (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 10: Sign up for delivery notifications",
      "You can get an alert each time a package arrives at your doorstep.\u00a0Both FedEx and UPS will send a text when you've just received a delivery.\u00a0Amazon will also send you a shipment text letting you know a package has just been delivered.",

      "A browser is one of the most popular apps we use. It's the gateway between the internet and its users, translating raw code into something we perceive as a web page and allowing us to interact with the web. It's safe to say that anyone who uses the internet uses a web browser.",

      "First off, most browsers collect data about your searches, browsing habits and even your location. This data isn't just stored to \"improve your experience,\" it's used to create a detailed profile of you, which is then shared with advertisers who target you with personalized ads.",
      "Google Chrome, for example, is notorious for tracking your activity. As you browse, it feeds data to Google\u2019s advertising engine, allowing it to serve highly targeted ads based on your behavior. This includes everything from your search history to the websites you visit, even down to the smallest detail, like how long you stay on a page\u200b.",
      "\"Google may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties,\" Google boldly\u00a0mentions on its privacy policy page.",
      "Browsers also use cookies to keep tabs on you. These cookies track your activity across different sites, even after you've left a site. This means that ads you saw on one website might follow you across others, creating a persistent digital footprint.

Google then used that data to track web traffic and sell ads.",

Tools like Incognito mode or cookie-blocking can help a bit, but they\u2019re not enough to truly protect you. If you\u2019re serious about staying private and secure, you need to up your game.

If you're like most people, privacy is a top priority, especially when it comes to sensitive data such as banking information, health details and your location.",
      "When Apple Intelligence is enabled, it starts \"learning\" from your interactions with certain apps, creating a digital profile that can theoretically tailor your experience. This is a double-edged sword; while personalization might sound appealing, it\u2019s crucial to consider what data Apple\u2019s AI is learning and why you might want to limit its reach.",

Banking, health and location apps contain some of your most sensitive data, and allowing Apple Intelligence to learn from them might open up unintended risks. By turning off \"Learn from this App\" in settings, you\u2019re taking a proactive step to control your personal information.

Just two days later, a threat actor using the alias \"Satanic\" claimed responsibility.",

The company hasn\u2019t notified those affected, leaving many unprepared for potential cybersecurity threats. Hackers could use this gap to target victims with scams, leading to financial losses. This situation is a strong reminder of the importance of maintaining good cybersecurity hygiene, whether you\u2019re impacted by a breach or not.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says the National Security Agency advises weekly phone reboots to protect against cyberattacks and enhance mobile security.",
      "The telecom industry is one of cybercriminals' favorite targets, likely because of the sensitive data it stores. Your carrier knows who you call and what you text. This type of information is valuable not only to hackers but also to governments. That\u2019s probably why U.S. phone giant T-Mobile was hacked as part of a broad cyberattack on domestic and international phone and internet companies in recent months.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYSEnter by\u00a0signing up for my free newsletter!",
      "T-Mobile booth (T-Mobile) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "There was unauthorized access to a limited number of T-Mobile routers using methods indicative of a major Chinese cyber-espionage operation, but T-Mobile\u2019s layered defenses and security monitoring enabled T-Mobile to quickly identify and shut down the threat.",
      "The report revealed that hackers connected to a Chinese intelligence agency breached T-Mobile as part of a monthslong effort to spy on the cellphone communications of high-value intelligence targets. The report did not specify when the attack occurred, but T-Mobile says no customer calls or communication records were stolen.",
      "The U.S. government also\u00a0confirmed this month that Chinese hackers breached multiple U.S. telecommunications service providers to access wiretap systems used by law enforcement for surveillance of Americans. Wiretap systems allow law enforcement agencies to monitor phone calls, text messages and internet communications as part of investigations, typically with a warrant.",
      "CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) and the FBI issued a joint statement revealing \"a broad and significant\" cyber-espionage campaign. The statement disclosed that PRC-affiliated hackers had breached networks at \"multiple telecommunications companies\" across the United States. While CISA and the FBI did not name the organizations affected, multiple reports suggest that T-Mobile, AT&T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink) and Verizon are likely on the list.",
      "WSJ reported in October that Chinese hackers had access to the networks \"for months or longer,\" enabling them to collect \"internet traffic from internet service providers that count businesses large and small and millions of Americans as their customers.\"",

      "T-Mobile\u2019s many data breaches",
      "T-Mobile has faced several hacks in recent years. In 2021, a malicious actor breached T-Mobile\u2019s lab environment by posing as a legitimate connection to an unidentified piece of equipment. The hacker guessed passwords for multiple servers and moved laterally through the network, ultimately stealing personal data, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license IDs, from tens of millions of customers.",
      "In 2022, T-Mobile experienced another breach when a malicious actor used SIM-swapping, phishing and other tactics to infiltrate the company\u2019s internal platform for managing mobile resellers who serve T-Mobile customers.",
      "The troubles continued into 2023. Early in the year, hackers used phished credentials from dozens of T-Mobile retail employees to access a sales application originally set up during the COVID-19 pandemic for remote viewing of customer data. Then, in January 2023, a misconfigured application programming interface exposed personal data for 37 million current customers, marking yet another significant security lapse.",

Due to our security controls, network structure and diligent monitoring and response we have seen no significant impacts to T-Mobile systems or data. We have no evidence of access or exfiltration of any customer or other sensitive information as other companies may have experienced. We will continue to monitor this closely, working with industry peers and the relevant authorities.\"",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "5 ways to stay safe amid the rise in telecom data breaches",
      "1) Change your passwords regularly: Make it a habit to update your passwords every few months, especially for your telecom accounts and related services. Use strong, unique passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.\u00a0Password managers can help you generate and store these securely.",
      "2) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your telecom accounts with\u00a02FA. This requires a second form of verification, like a text code or an app-based prompt, making it harder for hackers to access your accounts even if they have your password.",
      "5) Guard against phishing scams with strong antivirus software: Be cautious about unsolicited calls, texts or emails that ask for personal information or account access. Legitimate companies won't ask for sensitive details this way. If something seems off, contact your telecom provider directly through official channels. Whatever you do, don't click on links, as they can lead to scams or malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Telecom providers like T-Mobile and AT&T are frequent targets for hackers. Over the last two years, millions of Americans have had their data stolen, things like call records, text messages and even personal details. The issue got so bad that the FCC stepped in, warning T-Mobile to step up its cybersecurity efforts. The company was fined about $30 million, split between a $15 million penalty and a mandatory $15 million investment in better security. Unfortunately, if the companies handling your data keep getting breached, there's only so much you can do.",

      "It's generally safe to use, even though the search results aren\u2019t quite hitting the mark these days. That\u2019s a discussion for another time.",

Those who Google \"Are Bengal Cats legal in Australia?\" have reportedly had their personal information stolen after clicking on fraudulent links that appear near the top of the page.",
      "It\u2019s unclear why hackers have launched this unusually specific campaign. The only reason I can think of is that they are targeting the Australian demographic, and the phrase \"Are Bengal Cats legal in Australia?\" is easy to rank for on the Google search engine results page.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "People who search about whether bengal cats are legal in Australia (they are, if you\u2019re curious) are at risk of being targeted by GootLoader malware. This malware is spread through SEO tactics, where hackers make infected links show up high in search results. When people search for terms like legal documents or agreements, they might click on these dangerous links that lead to websites hosting a ZIP file with harmful code.",

      "5 ways to stay safe when searching something on Google",
      "1. Avoid clicking on ads and suspicious links: Be cautious of ads or unfamiliar links at the top of search results. Hackers often use SEO poisoning to place dangerous links in prominent positions. So, try to stick with trusted websites and known sources.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Use a VPN: A virtual private network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers, ISPs or other third parties to track your online activity and searches. Many sites can read your IP address and, depending on their privacy settings, may display the city from which you are corresponding. A VPN will disguise your IP address to show an alternate location.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",
      "3. Enable SafeSearch: Google\u2019s SafeSearch filters help to block explicit or potentially harmful content. It\u2019s especially useful for filtering out unsafe links and improving search safety.",
      "4. Limit personal data on Google: Adjust your Google account\u2019s privacy settings to minimize data collection, including search history, location tracking and ad personalization. You can access these settings in the \"My Activity\" section of your Google account.",
      "5. Use private browsing or clear your history: Using Incognito Mode or clearing your browsing history regularly can help reduce tracking of your searches. While it doesn\u2019t hide your activity from ISPs or law enforcement, it limits the data Google can store on your device.",
      "THE \u2018UNSUBSCRIBE\u2019 EMAIL SCAM IS TARGETING AMERICANS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Bad actors are always trying to exploit any digital medium you use, whether it\u2019s social media or a Google search. It\u2019s concerning how malicious websites that put users at risk are readily available on the first page of Google. Although the search giant has claimed to prioritize helpful content this year, the ease with which hackers manipulate search results suggests Google is doing quite the opposite. I\u2019m not holding out much hope for Google to improve its platform, but you can stay safe by avoiding suspicious links and being extra careful.",

    "summary": "Kurt &quot;CyberGuy&quot; Knutsson explains how a VPN \u2014 virtual private network \u2014 works and how running it can slow down the operation of your device.",
    "story": [
      "A VPN could be your secret weapon to protect your identity and finances.",
      "Many people turn to VPNs \u2014 virtual private networks \u2014 for added privacy and security online, only to find that their internet speeds suddenly slow to a crawl. But what exactly does a VPN do, and why might it cause this slowdown?",
      "A VPN works by creating a secure, encrypted pathway between your device and the internet, keeping your data private from hackers, advertisers and anyone else trying to monitor your activity. This encryption process also allows you to browse as if you\u2019re in a different location, which can help access content that may be restricted where you are.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "Just ask Terry from Reno, who recently reached out with this frustration:",
      "\"My VPN slows down my phone to the point where I can't open the apps! Help!\"",
      "You\u2019re not alone, Terry. VPNs are fantastic tools for safeguarding data and unlocking restricted content, but that extra layer of protection and location masking can sometimes slow things down. The good news? There are several ways to keep your VPN running smoothly without sacrificing security.\u00a0 Let's dive in.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Make sure it's actually the VPN",
      "Before we blame the VPN, let's make sure it's really the culprit. Here's a quick test:",
      "1. Disconnect from your VPN: Close your VPN application completely or turn off the VPN connection in your device settings.",
      "2. Run a speed test at Speedtest.net and note the results: Click the \"Go\" button and wait for the test to complete. Write down your download and upload speeds, as well as the ping.",
      "3. Connect to your VPN: Open your VPN application and connect to your preferred server. Wait until the connection is fully established.",
      "4. Run the speed test again: Refresh the Speedtest.net page to ensure it detects your new location, then run the test again. Note down the new results.",
      "If your VPN-connected speeds are less than about 60% of your normal speeds, then Houston, we have a VPN problem. If the difference is minimal, you may just need to optimize your base internet connection first.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "TOP 6 HIDDEN WAYS A VPN CAN SAVE YOU MONEY NOW",
      "Fixing VPN speed issues",
      "When encountering slow speeds while using a VPN, it's crucial to approach the problem systematically. Assuming the VPN is indeed the bottleneck in your connection, there are several steps you can employ to potentially boost your speeds and improve your overall experience.",
      "The physical distance between you and the VPN server location plays a significant role in connection speeds. Opting for a server closer to your geographical location can often result in a noticeable improvement. If you need to connect to a specific country for content access or other reasons, experiment with different cities within that country. Many VPN providers offer multiple server options in popular locations. Additionally, some VPNs display server load information, which can be incredibly useful. Connecting to a less crowded server typically yields faster speeds, as you're sharing fewer resources with other users.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE U.S. NEWS",
      "Various server locations available on VPN. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Adjusting your VPN settings can lead to performance enhancements. If your VPN service allows for customization, consider lowering the encryption level from 256-bit to 128-bit AES. While 256-bit encryption is incredibly secure, it can sometimes impact speed. The 128-bit AES encryption is still considered very secure for most purposes and may offer a speed boost. Another setting to look for is the WireGuard protocol. If your VPN provider offers this newer protocol, enabling it could significantly improve your connection speed, as it's designed to be both faster and more efficient than older protocols. For those using the OpenVPN protocol, switching from TCP to UDP can often result in faster speeds. However, approach these changes cautiously, especially if you're not entirely sure about their implications. Avoid disabling critical security features in your quest for speed.",
      "Different protocols offer varying levels of speed and security. Generally, protocols like PPTP, L2TP and IKEv2 are known for their speed but may not provide the highest level of security. OpenVPN is often the default choice as it strikes a good balance between speed and security. If you decide to stick with OpenVPN, which is recommended for most users, try switching from TCP to UDP. This simple change can potentially provide a noticeable speed boost without compromising security.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Keeping your VPN application up to date is essential for ensuring optimal performance and security. VPN providers frequently release updates that not only enhance the overall functionality of their software but also address any bugs or vulnerabilities that may have been discovered. An outdated VPN app can lead to compatibility issues with your operating system, which can hinder performance and reduce connection speeds. Therefore, it is advisable to regularly check for updates within your VPN app's settings or visit the provider's official website to download the latest version. Additionally, many VPN services offer an automatic update feature, which you should enable to ensure that you are always using the most current version of the software without having to remember to do it manually.",
      "To improve your VPN speed, it is important to minimize the load on your device by closing unnecessary applications running in the background. Many applications consume bandwidth and processing power, which can significantly affect your VPN's performance. For instance, streaming services, file-sharing programs or even software that automatically updates can slow down your connection. Before connecting to your VPN, take a moment to close these apps and consider disabling any auto-sync features temporarily.\u00a0Also, restarting your device before initiating a VPN connection is also a good practice, as it clears temporary files and frees up memory, allowing for a smoother experience.",
      "If you have tried various troubleshooting methods and your current VPN service still fails to deliver satisfactory speeds, it may be time to explore other options. The market is filled with numerous VPN providers that emphasize speed and reliability, so conducting thorough research is essential. Look for services that boast a large network of servers strategically located around the world, as this can significantly enhance connection speeds. Many top-tier VPN providers offer free trials or money-back guarantees, allowing you to test their performance without any financial risk. When evaluating potential new services, consider not only their speed but also their security features, privacy policies and customer support options. By making an informed choice, you can find a VPN that meets both your speed requirements and security needs effectively.",
      "Remember, while these strategies can help optimize your VPN speed, it's important to have realistic expectations. Your base internet speed, provided by your internet service provider (ISP), will always be the ultimate limiting factor. No VPN can make your connection faster than the maximum speed your ISP provides. However, by implementing these techniques, you can ensure that you're getting the most out of your VPN connection and minimizing any unnecessary slowdowns.",

And Terry, I hope these tips help get your phone apps running smoothly again. Remember, a good VPN might slow things down a tad, but it shouldn't make your device unusable.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "An Alabama inmate convicted in the 1994 killing of a female hitchhiker cursed at the prison warden and made obscene gestures with his hands shortly before he was put to death Thursday evening in the nation\u2019s third execution using nitrogen gas.",
      "Carey Dale Grayson, 50, was executed at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in southern Alabama. He was one of four teens at the time convicted of killing Vickie Deblieux, 37, as she was hitchhiking through Alabama on the way to her mother\u2019s home in Louisiana. The woman was attacked, beaten and thrown off a cliff.",
      "ALABAMA DEATH ROW INMATE EXECUTED WITH NITROGEN GAS, NATION'S FIRST BY A NEW METHOD IN 42 YEARS",
      "Strapped to a gurney with a blue-rimmed gas mask strapped to his face, Grayson raised both of his middle fingers and cursed at the prison warden. When the prison warden asked for his final statement, Grayson responded with an obscenity. The warden turned off the microphone. Grayson appeared to address the witness room with state officials.",
      "Abe Bonowitz of Death Penalty Action leads a protest outside the Capitol in Montgomery, Ala., on Monday, against a scheduled execution in Alabama using nitrogen gas.\u00a0 (Kim Chandler/Associated Press)",
      "It was unclear when the gas began flowing. Grayson shook and pulled against the gurney restraints. His sheet-wrapped legs at one point lifted off the gurney in the air. He then clenched his fist and appeared to struggle to try to gesture again, then took a series of gasping breaths for several minutes before becoming still.",
      "Grayson was pronounced dead at 6:33 p.m.",
      "Alabama began using nitrogen gas earlier this year to carry out some executions. The method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the person\u2019s face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.",
      "The execution was carried out hours after the U.S. Supreme Court turned down Grayson\u2019s request for a stay. His attorneys had argued that the method needed more scrutiny before being used again.",
      "Deblieux\u2019s mutilated body was found at the bottom of a bluff near Odenville, Alabama, on Feb. 26, 1994. She was hitchhiking from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to her mother\u2019s home in West Monroe, Louisiana, when the four teens offered her a ride. Prosecutors said the teens took her to a wooded area and attacked and beat her. They threw her off a cliff and later returned to mutilate her body.",
      "A medical examiner testified that Deblieux\u2019s face was so fractured that she was identified by an earlier X-ray of her spine. Investigators said the teens were identified as suspects after one of them showed a friend one of Deblieux\u2019s severed fingers and boasted about the killing.",
      "Gov. Kay Ivey issued a statement minutes after Thursday's execution saying she was praying for the murder victim's loved ones to find closure and healing still decades after the crime.",
      "Carey Dale Grayson (Alabama Department of Corrections via AP)",
      "\"Some thirty years ago, Vicki DeBlieux\u2019s journey to her mother\u2019s house and ultimately, her life, were horrifically cut short because of Carey Grayson and three other men. She sensed something was wrong, attempted to escape, but instead, was brutally tortured and murdered,\" Ivey said in the statement.",
      "Grayson's crimes \"were heinous, unimaginable, without an ounce of regard for human life and just unexplainably mean. An execution by nitrogen hypoxia (bears) no comparison to the death and dismemberment Ms. DeBlieux experienced,\" she added.",
      "Grayson was the only one of the four teens who faced a death sentence since the other teens were under 18 at the time of the killing. Grayson was 19. Two of the teens were initially sentenced to death but those sentences were set aside when the Supreme Court banned the execution of offenders who were younger than 18 at the time of their crimes. Another teen involved in Deblieux\u2019s killing was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Grayson\u2019s final appeals had focused on a call for more scrutiny of the nitrogen gas method. His lawyers argued that the person experiences \"conscious suffocation\" and that the first two nitrogen executions did not result in swift unconsciousness and death as the state had promised. Lawyers for the Alabama attorney general\u2019s office asked the justices to let the execution proceed, saying a lower court found Grayson\u2019s claims speculative.",
      "Alabama maintains the method is constitutional. But critics \u2014 citing how the first two people executed shook for several minutes \u2014 say the method needs more scrutiny, particularly if other states follow Alabama\u2019s path.",
      "\"The normalization of gas suffocation as an execution method is deeply troubling,\" said Abraham Bonowitz, executive director of Death Penalty Action, a group seeking to abolish the death penalty.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "No state other than Alabama has used nitrogen hypoxia to carry out a death sentence. In 2018, Alabama became the third state \u2014 along with Oklahoma and Mississippi \u2014 to authorize the use of nitrogen gas to execute prisoners.",
      "Some states are looking for new ways to execute inmates because the drugs used in lethal injections, the most common execution method in the United States, are increasingly difficult to find."

      "The move by the Biden administration marked a significant shift in U.S. policy, which has for years rejected calls that Ukraine should be able to use U.S.-supplied weaponry to target the Kremlin\u2019s military depots inside Russia, fearing it would escalate the war beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump and his allies disavowed Project 2025 during the campaign. But now transition officials are utilizing its extensive personnel database for potential hires.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump and his allies disavowed the conservative Project 2025 during the election, seeing the conservative transition plan and policy blueprint as a liability after Democrats used it to attack his campaign. Some close to Trump even suggested those tied to the effort would be shut out of a potential administration.",
      "\u201cThey made themselves nuclear,\u201d Howard Lutnick, the co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition and his nominee to serve as Commerce Secretary, told CNBC in September.",
      "But with the campaign over, Trump\u2019s transition team is turning to Project 2025 to help staff the next administration.",
      "Already, transition officials are taking suggestions for potential hires from the extensive personnel database created by Project 2025, a person familiar with the situation told NBC News.",
      "While Project 2025\u2019s massive book of conservative policy recommendations received most of the attention from Democrats, a central part of the effort was putting together a database that officials had framed as a conservative LinkedIn to help staff an incoming Republican administration.",
      "The person familiar with the transition said officials overseeing plans for some departments and agencies have started to reach out to potential hires whose names and contact information were part of that database.",
      "Individuals helping fill out the personnel teams for the Trump transition operation have sought and used information from the Project 2025 database because of the enormity of the task of filling out the more than 4,000 political appointee jobs that will become vacant in 2025, this person said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of positions to fill and we continue to send names over, including ones from the database as they are conservative, qualified and vetted,\u201d the person, who worked on Project 2025, said. \u201cHard to find 4,000 solid people so we are happy to help.\u201d",
      "The receptiveness to using the Project 2025 database for potential hires comes as the transition has already shown it is open to tapping contributors to the effort for administration jobs, including Tom Homan as border czar, Brendan Carr as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and John Ratcliffe as CIA director. Both Homan and Ratcliffe were listed as contributors to Project 2025, while Carr authored a chapter on the FCC.",
      "Additionally, former Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, a Project 2025 author who also served as the Republican National Committee\u2019s platform policy director, is thought of as a potential administration pick too.",
      "But not everyone is being welcomed aboard. Politico reported Thursday that the transition rejected a push for former Trump administration official Roger Severino, who authored Project 2025\u2019s chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services, to serve as deputy secretary of the agency, over concerns about the anti-abortion policies he laid out in the policy blueprint.",
      "The personnel database was a cornerstone of Project 2025. Under Paul Dans, a former Trump administration official who led Project 2025, the group built a database of more than 10,000 candidates vetted for their MAGA credentials who sought to build out the administration in the event Trump won, as ProPublica reported in August. The idea behind the effort was to ensure that a future Trump administration would have the foot soldiers necessary to rapidly enact his agenda upon taking office.",
      "But as tensions grew between the Trump campaign and Project 2025 \u2014 which culminated with Trump repeatedly lambasting and disavowing the effort \u2014 officials said they would not consult the database for potential hires. In his September interview with CNBC, Lutnick said he \u201cwon\u2019t take a list from\u201d Project 2025.",
      "\u201cThe transition team of Donald Trump has not touched it, has not gone near it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd anybody who says it\u2019s got anything to do with us is just not telling the truth on purpose. Because I am clear, clear, clear. Zero.\u201d",
      "Lutnick reiterated his point to the New York Post before last month\u2019s vice presidential debate, calling Project 2025 \u201cradioactive.\u201d",
      "That wasn\u2019t the first time team Trump took aim at the Project 2025 personnel database. In July, a top Trump campaign adviser told Semafor: \u201cIf you\u2019re an organization that is purporting to be pushing \u2018Trump policies,\u2019 it\u2019s probably the last organization that we\u2019ll take references from for personnel.\u201d",
      "But a Republican operative who spoke with NBC News shortly after Trump\u2019s electoral victory said \u201cit\u2019s kind of bulls---\u00a0 if they really try to keep all those dudes out.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it would be a big mistake,\u201d this person said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people with their name in Project 2025. That\u2019s going to be a tough one to really stick by. I think they\u2019ll make an example of a few people. Hopefully some of them will be able to make it through.\u201d",
      "Asked about the transition using the Project 2025 database, a Trump transition official said: \u201cThe transition is working to ensure great people are in position to deliver the promises made through President Trump\u2019s common sense agenda and overwhelming victory on Election Day.\u201d",
      "Project 2025 played a huge role in Democratic campaign advertising and in the party\u2019s anti-Trump message during both President Joe Biden\u2019s and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 bids, sparking Trump and his allies to ratchet up their condemnations and claim the policy agenda was not Trump\u2019s.",
      "There was plenty of overlap between the Trump agenda and Project 2025 \u2014 which featured contributions from dozens of officials from Trump\u2019s first administration. For instance, the Project 2025 policy blueprint and Trump\u2019s \u201cAgenda 47\u201d featured similar ideas on mass deportations and slashing the federal bureaucracy.",
      "There were some differences, though, as Project 2025 included calls for banning pornography and dismantling the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It also featured stringent anti-abortion rights policies that clashed with Trump\u2019s abortion message during the campaign.",
      "At a July campaign event in Grand Rapids, Trump said people on \u201cthe severe right came up with this Project 2025.\u201d",
      "\u201cVery, very conservative,\u201d he said. \u201cSort of the opposite of the radical left. You have the radical left and the radical right. They came up with this. I don\u2019t know what it is. \u2026 Then you read some of these things and they are seriously extreme. But I don\u2019t know anything about it. I don\u2019t want to know anything about it.\u201d",
      "A September NBC News poll found that 57% of registered voters viewed Project 2025 negatively while just 4% said they viewed the effort positively.",
      "But even over the summer, Project 2025 insiders weren\u2019t sweating Trump and his campaign\u2019s disavowals, viewing them as an effort to boost his electoral chances, not to flatly reject the ideas and people tied to the effort.",
      "Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, who railed against Project 2025 with a very large copy of the policy book at the Democratic National Convention in August, said Democrats need to focus on their policy response to the elevation of Project 2025\u2019s officials and ideas. She shared an Instagram post in which she promoted new legislation tightening restrictions around the collection and management of reproductive health data.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say \u2018we told you so,\u2019 but more importantly, we now know what they\u2019re going to do, so it\u2019s on Democrats to decide how to fight back,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cWhich is exactly what I\u2019m doing.\u201d"

    "summary": "Senate Republicans offered mixed responses to President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of Pete Hegseth, a Fox News personality accused of sexual assault, to lead the Defense Department following the release of a police report concerning sexual assault allegations against him.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Republicans offered mixed responses Thursday to President-elect Donald Trump's announcement that he will nominate Pete Hegseth, a Fox News personality accused of sexual assault, to lead the Defense Department following the release of a police report concerning sexual assault allegations against him.",
      "Some senators defended Trump's pick, while others voiced some trepidation, and a senator told NBC News \"I don't care\" when approached about a police report released Wednesday tied to an allegation of sexual assault against Hegseth in 2017.",
      "Asked whether the sexual assault report gave him any pause about the possibility of Hegseth's serving in Trump's Cabinet, Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., who is a member of the Armed Services Committee, said, \"It\u2019s a pretty big problem, given that we have, you know, we have a sexual assault problem in our military.\"",
      "Cramer would not comment on whether the allegation would affect his vote, noting a long process ahead.",
      "\"You know, this is why you have background checks. This is why you have hearings. This is why you have to go through the scrutiny. I\u2019m not going to prejudge him, but yeah, it\u2019s a pretty concerning accusation,\" Cramer said.",
      "Trump last week named Hegseth, a longtime ally, as his choice to lead the Pentagon, describing him as\u00a0\u201ctough, smart and a true believer in America First.\u201d",
      "An unidentified woman told police in 2017 that Hegseth took her phone and prevented her from leaving a hotel room before he sexually assaulted her after a Republican women\u2019s convention in California, according to a police report released Wednesday night.",
      "Hegseth was not charged and has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, a transition spokeswoman for Trump and his pick to be White House press secretary, said in a statement that the report \"corroborates what Mr. Hegseth\u2019s attorneys have said all along: the incident was fully investigated and no charges were filed because police found the allegations to be false.\"",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., also defended Trump's pick, saying he had reviewed the report and would push for Hegseth's confirmation.",
      "Asked by NBC News asked about Hegseth's qualifications to lead the Pentagon, Mullin called him a \"solid individual\" and \"the right man for the job.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s not like he has no experience inside the military. I think he is perfect for the position,\" Mullin said. \u201cI think he\u2019s very talented. And there\u2019s a reason why President Trump trusts him.\u201d",
      "Mullin also rebuffed the sexual misconduct allegations detailed in the 2017 report, calling them \"an unfortunate situation that took place\" and adding that Hegseth \"was accused of doing something that I don\u2019t believe he did.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., also called Hegseth a \"great choice by @realDonaldTrump, to change Washington,\" on X, noting his plans to support Hegseth's confirmation.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tried to draw a connection between his response to the allegations against Hegseth and how he had responded to an allegation of rape against President Joe Biden dating to 1993 that surfaced during his 2020 presidential campaign.",
      "\"When Biden was accused of rape, I said, 'That\u2019s not Biden I know,'\" Graham said, adding that lawmakers would not \"try\" Hegseth based on \"press statements,\" apparently incorrectly referring to the police report.",
      "When NBC News told him that the allegations against Hegseth were contained in a police report and not detailed in a media statement, Graham said: \"I don't care.\"",
      "Two other picks to serve in top jobs in Trump's Cabinet have also faced potentially damaging allegations of sexual misconduct.",
      "Vanity Fair reported in July on claims by a woman who was hired in the late 1990s to work as a babysitter for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to oversee the Health and Human Services Department, and said he groped her while she was working for Kennedy and his wife.",
      "Kennedy responded to the allegation over the summer\u00a0by saying: \u201cI said in my announcement speech that I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.\u201d",
      "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida withdrew his name from consideration for attorney general Thursday amid\u00a0allegations that he had sex with a minor and paid\u00a0two other women\u00a0for sex in 2017.\u00a0He has long denied the allegations.",
      "After Gaetz withdrew his name, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told NBC News that there were \u201csimilar, challenging allegations\u201d with Hegseth.",
      "\u201cI look forward to seeing how those are answered,\u201d Coons said.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., urged for the Senate's vetting process to go forward in spite of the allegations plaguing Trump's nominees, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go through the committee process here.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow, obviously, Gaetz ultimately decided he didn\u2019t want to go through the process,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cBut you know, if you have a nominee who wants to, I would say let him. Let him testify, and let\u2019s not make judgments and reach conclusions until they\u2019ve had a chance to testify and address these concerns.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Democrats just suffered a bruising defeat at the presidential level in Nevada for the first time in 20 years, fueled by a swing toward Republicans among working-class voters.",
      "The outcome has prompted a reckoning with how they failed. In interviews, top Democrats and their allies cited \u201cmessaging\u201d problems, the late switch to nominating Kamala Harris, and Donald Trump\u2019s unique ability to capitalize on the pain of post-pandemic rising costs, which hit hard for many voters.",
      "Yet they remain upbeat about their prospects in Nevada, noting that the red wave ended with Trump and failed to translate to other Republicans in the state. The peculiar outcome is helping them map out the strategy to paint Nevada blue again in 2028.",
      "\u201cI certainly believe he is, I\u2019m going to say, very gifted at targeting certain groups of society and telling them what they want to know,\u201d said Rep. Susie Lee, D-Nev., who said she won a district that backed Trump. \u201cAnd I think the proof will be in the pudding \u2014 if he can deliver on those promises.\u201d",
      "If Republicans fail to improve their lives, Lee said, \u201cit\u2019s going to come back to haunt them in two years and then again in four years.\u201d",
      "While Democrats\u2019 presidential nominee lost, Sen. Jacky Rosen won re-election, and Democrats in all three closely divided Las Vegas-area House districts won. Democrats also held their ground in the state Legislature, falling just shy of supermajorities.",
      "Ticket-splitting and partial nonvoting in Nevada\u2019s \u201cnone of the above\u201d ballot option had impacts.",
      "Harris lost Nevada despite winning about 4,000 more votes than Rosen did. The key difference? Many Trump backers refused to check the box for Rosen's opponent, Republican Senate candidate Sam Brown. Brown won nearly 75,000 fewer votes than Trump.",
      "A working-class message",
      "\u201cTrump is a phenomenon. He\u2019s a brand. And he\u2019s been at it for 30 years with 'The Apprentice,' appearing on WWF, et cetera,\u201d said Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer of the influential Culinary Union in Las Vegas. \u201cWhen you lose the top of the ticket, you normally have damage. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
      "With its large population of Latinos and voters without college degrees, Nevada was ground zero for the two demographics that helped Trump sweep all seven battleground states.",
      "According to NBC News exit polls of Nevada, Trump lost Latinos by 26 percentage points in 2020, but he won them by 2 points this year. Among Nevada voters without college degrees, Trump extended his lead from 2 points in 2020 to 10 points this year.",
      "Pappageorge, whose union represents the blue-collar workers who staff the glamorous hotels and casinos of Sin City, said Democrats were hurt by \u201cmessaging issues\u201d that let Trump appeal to working-class voters by running against \u201celitism.\u201d",
      "\u201cDemocrats have to get back to the basics of fighting for working-class issues and values,\u201d he said, including \u201cworking-class white, Black and Latino workers,\u201d both men and women. \u201cWorking-class voters don\u2019t pay attention to politics. They\u2019re not watching CNN and Fox or all that. They\u2019re worried about taking care of their families,\" he said.",
      "Even as Trump carried Nevada Latinos by 2 points, they voted for Rosen by 7 points, according to NBC News exit polls.",
      "Republican hopes for the future",
      "Republicans say Nevada\u2019s vote for Trump marks the beginning of a shift toward their party that the GOP can build on.",
      "\"It\u2019s a really big deal. We\u2019ve seen Republicans have success at the state level since 2004, but the presidential had eluded us,\" said Jeremy Hughes, a GOP strategist who has worked on Nevada races. \"When you look at 2020, 2022 and 2024, you see a trend that would be foolish for anyone to ignore.\"",
      "Asked about the GOP\u2019s failure to convert down the ballot, Hughes said: \"It\u2019s still a work in progress. Beating incumbents is hard. But success will build on success if we continue executing in 2026 and beyond.\"",
      "He added that Republicans can start proving Democrats wrong by re-electing GOP Gov. Joe Lombardo in 2026.",
      "Other Republicans said resources were a problem down the ballot.",
      "\u201cBrown was badly outspent. He closed the gap, but the cavalry probably arrived about a week too late,\u201d said a national Republican strategist working on Senate races, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly about his party.",
      "The strategist said the House GOP machine \u201cdidn\u2019t spend a penny\u201d in Nevada this year but added: \u201cRepublicans should be optimistic for Nevada down the road. The voter registration trends tell the story.\"",
      "The Democrats' road map",

And so we have to know who they are,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to focus your message on those voters at the end of the day and talk about the issues that they care about. That\u2019s why Jacky won.\u201d",
      "\u201cNevada\u2019s races are always competitive and close. That\u2019s not going to change. We\u2019ve always had close presidential races,\u201d Cortez Masto said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, do I have confidence in the Democratic ground game and the infrastructure and the knocking on the doors and talking to our voters? I do have confidence in that. And that is part of why we are so successful.\u201d",
      "Rosen said she won because she delivered results for tourism, wildfire mitigation, infrastructure, a new Veterans Affairs hospital in Reno and solar, wind and geothermal jobs.",
      "Harris, she said, was hamstrung by bad luck.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of larger questions, of course. I\u2019ll say this as a woman: Are people ready for a woman president?\u201d Rosen said. \u201cThis was a unique election cycle because of the way that President Biden stepped back 100 days before the election.\u201d",
      "Josh Marcus-Blank, a Democratic operative who worked for Cortez Masto in 2022 and on Harris\u2019 2024 campaign, said his party retains \u201cthe road map to win in Nevada\u201d with a diverse coalition of voters and an agenda focused on economics, housing and the cost of living.",
      "\u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s a state where voters have consistently stood up for reproductive freedom, and, whether it\u2019s on the ballot or not, abortion rights will continue to be a big piece of Democratic campaigns going forward,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "Trump's Cabinet selection process is off to a rocky start, with Matt Gaetz withdrawing from AG consideration and several other picks facing controversies.",
    "story": [
      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, we report on the fallout from Matt Gaetz withdrawing from consideration to be the next attorney general. Plus, senior politics reporter Jonathan Allen puts the former Florida congressman's fall in historical context.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u2018retribution\u2019 campaign hits the harsh reality of governing in Washington",
      "Matt Gaetz\u2019s withdrawal Thursday as a candidate for attorney general illustrates the roadblocks President-elect Donald Trump could face as he attempts to convert his campaign of \u201cretribution\u201d into a governing coalition capable of working within the realities of Washington.",
      "Gaetz, until recently a Florida congressman, embodies Trump\u2019s grievance- and vendetta-driven agenda like few others can. He has been one of Trump\u2019s most pugilistic defenders and the bleeding edge of MAGA resistance in Congress, even against his own Republican leadership.",
      "But it was a tough sell from the moment Trump announced Gaetz as his choice eight days ago \u2014 in a pick that shocked much of Washington.",
      "The Justice Department that Trump wanted him to lead had once investigated Gaetz in a sex-trafficking case it closed without charging him. Meanwhile, an unreleased report from a separate House Ethics Committee investigation also hung over Gaetz\u2019s head, and details of what two women who allege he paid them for sex told the committee were beginning to trickle out.",
      "Gaetz\u2019s hasty retreat is also emblematic of how the president-elect and his team often reject the conventions of Capitol Hill. Although Gaetz\u2019s liabilities and legal troubles were well documented, deeper vetting by Trump\u2019s team might have unearthed details of the ethics probe sooner. And there was little, if any, effort to take the temperature of senators before Trump surprised the political world with his announcement last week.",
      "At least five Senate Republicans were planning to vote against Gaetz and had communicated to other senators and those close to Trump that they were unlikely to be swayed, according to multiple people with direct knowledge. The \u201cno\u201d votes included Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, as well as Sen.-elect John Curtis of Utah.",
      "And at least 20 \u2014 and perhaps as many as 30 \u2014 Senate Republicans were very uncomfortable about having to vote for Gaetz on the Senate floor, one source said.",
      "Read more \u2192",
      "Putting Gaetz\u2019s withdrawal in historical context",
      "It\u2019s rare for a newly elected president to lose a pick for any Cabinet post, much less attorney general. The last time the Senate actually voted down a nominee: George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1989 appointment of longtime Texas Sen. John Tower to run the Pentagon.",
      "But it\u2019s not even Thanksgiving, and Donald Trump is already looking for a backup top law enforcement officer after Matt Gaetz withdrew his AG bid Thursday. Republican senators apparently found his recent charm offensive less influential than his long campaign to discredit them and the allegations of sexual misconduct against him, which Gaetz has denied.",
      "Gaetz had not been formally nominated \u2014 Trump doesn\u2019t take office until January \u2014 but he is the first attorney general pick to fall since 1993, when two of Bill Clinton\u2019s selections, Zo\u00eb Baird and Kimba Wood, withdrew from consideration following revelations they had hired undocumented immigrants.",
      "New presidents typically compile Cabinet rosters with at least one eye on their chances of winning confirmation. Gaetz did not fit that mold.",
      "On a broader level, Trump has picked more fights with the Senate than most presidents. And he may find that the Republican majority there is less pliant than he would like.",
      "Former Fox News personality Pete Hegseth, his choice for defense secretary, has run into some early resistance. So, too, have Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his picks for director of national intelligence and secretary of health and human services, respectively. Their fates remain to be determined.",
      "But Trump isn\u2019t off to a good start. He will have to put more thought into nominating people who can win confirmation on their own, or whom he can push across the finish line with senators. Otherwise, he risks a repeat \u2014 or worse \u2014 of Barack Obama\u2019s Cabinet failures. In 2009, Tom Daschle (Health and Human Services), Bill Richardson (Commerce) and Judd Gregg (Commerce) all withdrew for different reasons.",
      "The last time around, Trump lost just one of his initial Cabinet picks, when Andrew Puzder withdrew as the labor secretary nominee in February 2017.",
      "\u27a1\ufe0f More on the Trump transition",
      "Aside from Gaetz, two of Trump\u2019s other Cabinet picks, Hegseth and Kennedy, have also faced serious allegations of sexual impropriety, which they have both denied. A newly released police report details the allegations facing Hegseth.Trump plans to roll out a flurry of executive actions within hours of taking office, imposing more socially conservative health care policies on the U.S. military and setting in motion the large-scale deportation of people living in the country illegally.Dr. Mehmet Oz, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has had some evolving views on Obamacare and Medicare over the years, including advocating for a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d plan.",

    "summary": "Europe is home to some of the U.S.' closest and allies. But as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, their priorities may be diverging.",
    "story": [
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Shifting tectonic plates are triggering tremors of uncertainty from Beijing to Brussels as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, and the effects could see U.S. priorities diverge from those of its closest European allies in ways unseen in decades.",
      "The incoming administration is likely to pressure European leaders to take a harder line on China, which it sees as America\u2019s main enemy, but their countries are economically intertwined with both powers and their interests don\u2019t always align with Washington\u2019s, several European officials and diplomats told NBC News. Were Trump to follow through on his vow to impose tariffs on imports on Europe as well as from China, they would likely deviate further.",
      "There is also uncertainty across the continent about what the new White House will mean for the war in Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly said he could end the conflict in one day, and despite Russia\u2019s claims to the contrary, that boast has prompted fears he will push for massive concessions that favor Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cThe impact of Trump is panic,\u201d one European Union official told NBC News on Sunday. \u201cThey are going to have to make a decision and take a stand.\u201d",
      "But unity appears elusive.",
      "Several European leaders criticized German Chancellor Olaf Scholz after he called Putin to try and persuade him to negotiate last week, becoming the first sitting leader of a major Western country to speak with him since late 2022.",
      "Among them is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said it was \u201cexactly what Putin has long wanted\u201d as he tries to ease his international isolation.",
      "\u201cEurope is freaked out by all this,\u201d the E.U. official added. \u201cPeople had been saying privately, \u2018We\u2019ll see what we do about Ukraine, we\u2019ll see what we do about China.\u2019 But now the world is upside down and they don\u2019t yet know what to do.\u201d",
      "Eyes on Beijing",
      "There are signs that European countries may decide the answer is to move closer to China, potentially opening a rift with the U.S.",
      "During his first administration, Trump was hyperfocused on China, and since then he has maintained his hard-line stance against the country, which both the U.S. and Europe view as an economic competitor and systemic rival, even as they count it among their biggest trading partners.",
      "Days before the U.S. presidential election, Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., wrote in The Economist that the next president should quickly end the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and \u201cfinally focus strategic attention where it should be: countering the greater threat from the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d",
      "Relations between Europe and China have deteriorated in recent years over trade, human rights, Chinese aggression in the South China Sea and the status of Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "They soured further after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with some European leaders suggesting Beijing should lean harder on Moscow to end the conflict.",
      "Still, four European diplomats and officials from key Western capitals, who asked not to be named to be able to speak freely, said their countries are not seeking full-on confrontation with China.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be dragged into the foreign policy toward China which the new American administration will be engaged in,\u201d said one of the senior European officials. \u201cAmerica is our friend and ally. But we have our own foreign policy and our own economic position toward China.\u201d",
      "At the Group of 20 summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro on Monday, Keir Starmer became the first British prime minister since 2018 to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in person.",
      "Starmer called for \u201cconsistent, durable\u201d ties between the two countries, while Xi said they have \u201cvast potential for cooperation.\u201d Though Starmer told reporters he had had a \u201cfrank\u201d discussion with Xi about issues where China and Britain disagree, he was criticized by British lawmakers for not publicly condemning the prison sentences handed down this week to\u00a045 pro-democracy figures\u00a0in the Chinese territory of\u00a0Hong Kong, as well as the ongoing trial of pro-democracy media tycoon\u00a0Jimmy Lai, a British national.",
      "Xi also discussed the war in Ukraine as well as E.U. tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles in meetings with Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of the G20 summit.",
      "In some ways, a second Trump term might be \u201cgood news\u201d for Europe, because unlike President Joe Biden, he \u201cwouldn\u2019t care that much\u201d about rallying U.S. allies against China, said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.",
      "\u201cThat will give Europeans more leeway in managing their relations with China,\u201d Wu said Monday at an event hosted by the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Centre on Contemporary China and the World.",
      "He also noted that a series of European leaders and other political figures have already been visiting Beijing in recent months in an effort to strengthen ties.",
      "Chinese officials have also suggested that this could be an opportunity for improved relations with Europe.",
      "\u201cChina supports Europe in playing a greater role in international affairs, but does not wish to see it pick a side and provoke bloc confrontation,\u201d Cao Lei, the Chinese Foreign Ministry\u2019s deputy head in charge of European affairs, was quoted as saying by the South China Morning Post this month.",
      "Russian threat",
      "For many Europeans, it is Moscow, not Beijing, that poses an immediate threat. In their view, China could help to pressure Russia over Ukraine as Xi loses patience with a war he did not expect would drag on for almost three years.",
      "One senior European diplomat said that while China has never explicitly condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it has helped in other ways to rein in Moscow.",
      "\u201cThey have been firm with Russia about not using nuclear weapons with Ukraine,\u201d the diplomat said.",
      "China is also concerned about the growing security ties between Russia and North Korea after the two countries signed a comprehensive strategic partnership in June, the diplomat added.",
      "The U.S. and others say that the secretive communist state\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un, has sent thousands of troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine in exchange for technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "\u201cChina doesn\u2019t want a more capable North Korean military,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cSo I would expect this to be one of those issues that we could talk to the Chinese about seriously.\u201d",
      "Another European diplomat said Moscow will be the wild card in international efforts to end the Ukraine war.",
      "\u201cYou can see the need for it from the Ukrainians, you can see the Europeans saying we aren\u2019t going to finance this huge and endless fight,\u201d they said. \u201cIt\u2019s trickier to understand what\u2019s in it for Putin.\u201d",
      "Though Moscow has signaled that it is open to talks, Russia\u2019s upper hand on the battlefield may convince Putin that he can achieve more from fighting than settling. But the cost is wearing on European governments, which have provided Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in military and other assistance.",
      "\u201cThe pay, pay, pay strategy wasn\u2019t working,\u201d the E.U. official said. \u201cEurope now just wants to stop the war.\u201d",
      "But it is also desperate to avoid any whiff of surrender.",
      "\u201cThe E.U. continues to say that Ukraine will negotiate when Ukraine wants to negotiate,\u201d another European official said, \u201cand that the E.U. will stand by Ukraine to the end.\u201d",

    "summary": "Transgender people told NBC News they have a variety of concerns about Donald Trump's second term but said they're better prepared than they were eight years ago.",
    "story": [
      "West Virginia advocate Ash Orr said he\u2019s rushing to legally change his name and update the gender marker on his passport. North Carolina lawyer Katie Jenifer is trying to prepare one year\u2019s worth of estrogen for her transgender daughter. Oregon comedian and writer Mx. Dahlia Belle is focused on advocating for immigrants and people with disabilities.",
      "This trio is among nearly a dozen transgender Americans, plus the parent of a trans teen, who talked to NBC News about how they\u2019re readying themselves for the second administration of a president-elect who has promised to restrict their ability to modify identity documents, receive transition-related health care, enlist in the military and participate on sports teams, among other things.",
      "Though trans people told NBC News they have a variety of concerns about President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promises regarding trans people, nearly all shared a similar message: They are better prepared than they were eight years ago.",
      "Heron Greenesmith, the deputy director of policy at the Transgender Law Center, who uses they/them pronouns, said they felt \u201cclear-eyed\u201d the day after the election, whereas in 2016 they were crying and felt devastated by the election results and the effect that Trump\u2019s policies would have on marginalized communities, including trans people.",
      "\u201cThis time around is not going to be any different,\u201d Greenesmith said, \u201cbut this time around, I know what to do.\u201d",
      "Even though trans people had their rights targeted under the first Trump administration, Greenesmith added, \u201cwe also thrived.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe provided safety for ourselves and mutual aid, we defended ourselves from criminalization and got ourselves out of jail when we needed to \u2014 and provided health care for folks who needed it.\u201d said Greenesmith, who is based in Massachusetts. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the same thing again. We got us.\u201d",
      "Day 1 promises",
      "During his campaign, Trump and his supporters spent nearly $60 million on eight anti-trans network-TV ads, one of them in Spanish, between Sept. 19 and Nov. 1, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political ad spending.",
      "He has supported a number of policies targeting transgender people, who make up less than 1% of adults in the U.S. At campaign rallies over the summer, he promised to take at least two actions regarding the trans community on his first day in office: undo Biden administration Title IX protections that allowed trans students to use the school bathrooms that align with their gender identities, and cut federal funding for schools \u201cpushing critical race theory, transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content onto the lives of our children.\u201d",
      "Trump also promised to reinstate a policy enacted during his first term that barred trans people from enlisting in the military and to institute a new policy barring transition-related care for minors nationwide. The agenda on his website says he would declare that any hospital or clinician that provides transgender care to minors would \u201cno longer meet federal health and safety standards for Medicaid and Medicare \u2014 and will be terminated from the program immediately.\u201d",
      "The president-elect\u2019s agenda also includes issuing guidance to federal agencies to define sex only as one\u2019s sex assigned at birth, which would make it harder for trans people to change the gender markers on federal documents such as passports.",
      "Plans for IDs, moving and medical care",
      "The State Department began offering the gender-neutral \u201cX\u201d marker on passports, in addition to the standard \u201cM\u201d or \u201cF,\u201d in April 2022, but a new federal definition of sex could end that policy, legal experts say. If the Trump administration still allows trans people to change the gender marker on their passport, Greenesmith said, it might require them to provide proof of gender-reassignment surgery, putting gender-marker changes out of reach for the majority of trans people.",
      "As for those who already have a passport with an \u201cX\u201d gender marker, if the Trump administration discontinues issuing new \u201cX\u201d passports, the future of those existing identity documents is unclear, according to both Greenesmith and Sasha Buchert, the director of the nonbinary and transgender rights project at Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ legal advocacy organization. There is no existing policy that would allow the government to require people to turn in \u201cX\u201d passports, for example.",
      "\u201cIn response to what needs to be done in this moment, now is always a good time to update any identity documents that you need to update,\u201d Buchert said.",
      "The average processing time for a U.S. passport is four to six weeks, and the expedited processing time, which is $60 more, is two to three weeks.",
      "Ash Orr, who lives in Morgantown, West Virginia, and is the press relations manager for Advocates for Trans Equality, the nation\u2019s largest trans rights organization, said the election prompted him to legally change his name. His name-change hearing is scheduled for Jan. 15, and he plans to apply to update his passport as soon as his name change is complete.",
      "He also plans to leave his home state by the spring as a result of the election, and because West Virginia\u2019s state politics have become increasingly conservative in recent years. He declined to share the state he and his partner are moving to due to safety concerns, noting he has received an increasing number of threats over the past two years.",
      "\u201cWest Virginia is my home, and it has always been my home, and I\u2019ve had to come to the realization that your home isn\u2019t always a place where you can thrive,\u201d Orr said, adding that he\u2019s struggled with the feeling that he\u2019s abandoning his community and the trans people in the state who can\u2019t afford to leave.",
      "Finn Franklin, a 20-year-old who is finishing his associate\u2019s degree at Rogue Community College in Grants Pass, Oregon, said the election has affected where he plans to apply to finish a four-year degree.",
      "\u201cI was looking at some rural schools because I like the smaller school size,\u201d Franklin said. But after the election, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be applying to schools outside of the West Coast because I don\u2019t want to live somewhere that is not Washington, Oregon or California for the next four years. I think I want to be in a metro area because of the typical politics difference between urban and rural areas, and access to health care.\u201d",
      "Franklin said he receives his testosterone through telehealth offered by Oregon Health & Science University\u00a0 Hospital, which is in Portland, about five hours north. He\u2019s worried about how the incoming administration could affect that treatment, as well as a top-surgery consultation he has scheduled in October 2026, because he receives health care through the Oregon Health Plan, the state\u2019s Medicaid program. OHSU Hospital, which has a program that provides gender-affirming services to children and teens, could be affected if Trump follows through on his promise to cut Medicaid funding for hospitals that provide transition-related care to minors.",
      "\u201cIf the funding for those kinds of things goes away, then it kind of becomes utterly inaccessible, and that\u2019s definitely very scary,\u201d Franklin said.",
      "North Carolina lawyer Katie Jenifer said she is trying to secure a year\u2019s worth of estrogen for her 17-year-old daughter, Maddie, in case Trump does issue federal restrictions that could curtail access to transition-related care for minors nationwide. Her daughter\u2019s doctor prescribed her enough medication for a year, but their insurance will only cover one month at a time. Out of pocket, the medication costs $109 a month, but Jenifer received a coupon from the pharmacy that brings the cost down to $49 per month.",
      "Jenifer previously told NBC News that she had plans to move with Maddie out of the state or out of the country depending on the election outcome.",
      "\u201cIf I can get enough medication on hand to get Maddie to 18, then we will try to stay through high school graduation in June and continue to monitor and make plans to exit soon after or before if necessary,\u201d Jenifer said Tuesday. \u201cIf we cannot get the needed meds, then we will probably try to leave mid- to late January. Where we go will depend on my job search.\u201d",
      "Advocates say the election is already having an effect on LGBTQ young people, in particular. The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ youth suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization, saw a 700% increase in crisis contacts in the 24 hours after the election compared to weeks prior. About one-third (30%) of the contacts identified as LGBTQ young people who are Black, Indigenous or people of color, and more than 40% were trans or nonbinary young people, a spokesperson told NBC News.",
      "Organizing within community",
      "Some trans people told NBC News that after the election, they immediately started organizing with local community groups.",
      "Orr, for example, said he planned to volunteer with Holler Health Justice, a reproductive health organization led by queer people of color, to deliver emergency contraception and other reproductive health supplies across West Virginia.",
      "Bennett Kaspar-Williams, an entertainment lawyer based in Los Angeles who is skilled in martial arts, said he is working with other local activists to organize self-defense classes for LGBTQ people and women in response to increased fears of violence given Trump\u2019s rhetoric about trans people.",
      "Ahead of the 2020 election, he said, he volunteered for Democrats because at the time he was pregnant, and, as a trans man, he was afraid of what the future would look like for his child if Trump were re-elected.",
      "\u201cIf you had told me that in four years he\u2019s going to win again, I definitely would not have believed you,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel really scared for the generation of people who were waiting until they were old enough to be able to start a medical transition, who are now facing the possibility of never being able to do that at all, and what that means for them.\u201d",
      "Many trans people also mentioned giving directly to mutual aid groups, specifically those that support trans people of color.",
      "Aldita Gallardo is the the director of the Action for Transformation Fund, a partnership between the Transgender Law Center and the Emergent Fund, a national rapid response fund that supports groups led by LGBTQ people of color. The $1 million Action for Transformation Fund was a pilot effort to move funds directly to trans activists working within their local communities. Gallardo noted that foundations that provide money to LGBTQ communities allocated less than 4 cents per $100 of their total giving to U.S. trans communities and issues, according to a 2021 report by Funders for LGBTQ Issues.",
      "Gallardo, who is based in Oakland, California, said the Action for Transformation Fund, which launched in September and just made its first round of grants, wasn\u2019t previously thinking about long-term fundraising, but that changed after the election.",
      "\u201cNow we see it as an opportunity to bring more dollars for the increasing amount of need,\u201d Gallardo said. \u201cWe know that things will escalate in the four years of the administration.\u201d",
      "Some of the groups that were supported by the fund\u2019s first round of grants include House of Tulip, which provides housing to trans people of color in Louisiana; Transgender Advocates Knowledgeable Empowering, or TAKE, which provides services to trans people of color in Birmingham, Alabama; and the Unspoken Treasure Society, a Black, trans-led organization in Jacksonville, Florida.",
      "Mx. Dahlia Belle, a comedian and writer based in Portland, Oregon, who also works as a peer support operator for a trans nonprofit, encouraged trans people to support those outside of their immediate community as a second Trump administration begins. She fears her job with the trans nonprofit could \u201ccease to exist\u201d if Congress passes a bill that would allow Trump to target nonprofits\u2019 tax-exempt status. If that were to happen, she could lose access to health care. Still, she said she still feels comparatively safe and privileged.",
      "\u201cWe as a community are facing a very real existential threat,\u201d Belle said. However, she added, \u201cin the grand scheme of things, the threat we are facing pales in comparison to the immediacy and severity that will be faced by immigrants and people with disabilities and people who may be in need of reproductive care.\u201d",
      "She acknowledged that trans people and LGBTQ people more broadly fit into all of these categories and said it\u2019s \u201cthose intersections of identity where I feel our advocacy is most needed and needs to be focused.\u201d"

    "summary": "Environmental groups are gearing up to fight the incoming Trump administration, which they expect to make quick and sweeping changes to policies on energy, protected land and more.",
    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "Environmental organizations are preparing to push back against the incoming Trump administration.They expect Trump to attempt to expand oil and gas drilling and repeal or pare back some Biden-era legislation.Environmental groups are already gearing up for legal fights and soliciting donations accordingly.",
      "Environmental organizations are preparing to push back against the incoming Trump administration.",
      "They expect Trump to attempt to expand oil and gas drilling and repeal or pare back some Biden-era legislation.",
      "Environmental groups are already gearing up for legal fights and soliciting donations accordingly.",
      "Environmental groups are gearing up to push back against the incoming Trump administration, which they expect to make sweeping policy changes more quickly than was seen when Donald Trump took office in 2017.",
      "Based on Trump\u2019s previous actions as president and statements made during the recent campaign, experts, lawyers and advocates offered several predictions for his agenda in office. They expect him to focus on expanding oil and gas drilling, reducing the acreage of preserved federal land and repealing or paring back two of President Joe Biden\u2019s signature legislative accomplishments: the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Environmentalists see the Cabinet picks Trump has announced so far as early steps toward that agenda \u2014\u00a0people who agree with the goal to \u201cdrill, drill, drill\u201d on day one, as Trump put it to Fox News host Sean Hannity in December. Already, Trump has named North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has called for increases to domestic oil production, as his choice for secretary of the interior, and oil industry CEO Chris Wright as his desired energy secretary.",
      "The first Trump administration took at least 74 actions seen as weakening environmental policy, according to a tracker from the nonpartisan Brookings Institution. The number could be higher in the upcoming term, given Trump\u2019s promises to vastly change the regulatory landscape.",
      "\u201cI think the thing that we\u2019re preparing for more is sort of the potential aggressiveness and disregard for the rule of law,\u201d said Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity. He added that his group will also watch for changes or processes \u201cthat are just simply, plainly illegal.\u201d",
      "The center and other environmental organizations, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, anticipate a high volume of legal fights ahead and are already soliciting donations to fund those efforts. Pop-up ads on each site ask for support to counter expected changes to environmental protections.",
      "Trump\u2019s transition team did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The NRDC and Center for Biological Diversity both have a record of successfully challenging Trump\u2019s agenda in court. While Trump was in office, the center filed 266 lawsuits against government actions that it saw as threats to the environment and won 87% of them, by its own count. Some of the group\u2019s biggest victories included striking down an offshore drilling project in the Alaskan Arctic and reversing the removal of grizzly bears from the endangered species list. The NRDC, meanwhile, says it filed 163 lawsuits in that time period and won in nearly 90% of those resolved.",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s disavowal of Project 2025 during his campaign, several environmental groups said they nonetheless expect the incoming administration to follow that conservative policy road map, which was put together by the Heritage Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. They are preparing accordingly.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing people involved in Project 2025 being appointed to the administration,\u201d said Andrew Wetzler, who heads the NRDC\u2019s nature program. \u201cAnd when you look at that, it\u2019s really quite alarming from the broadest climate perspective.\u201d",
      "The plan calls for achieving \u201cAmerican Energy Dominance\u201d by, in part, stopping what it calls a \u201cwar on oil and natural gas.\u201d It recommends discontinuing federal climate research and favors repealing policies passed under Biden that provided billions of dollars in funding for renewable energy.",
      "Jillian Blanchard, who leads the climate change and environmental justice program at Lawyers for Good Government, a nonprofit legal advocacy group, said the group is working to make sure dollars earmarked for clean energy projects under the Inflation Reduction Act can\u2019t be easily clawed back by a new administration.",
      "\u201cWe worked with a lot of the federal grantees who either have gotten the money or are announced to receive money,\u201d Blanchard said, describing her group\u2019s efforts to help those clients expedite the payment process and navigate any regulatory compliance issues that arise.",
      "\u201cWe intend to continue that work to make sure that that money goes out the door to those intended grantees, whether it\u2019s for climate justice, tackling the climate crisis, environmental justice, transit, etc.,\u201d she added.",
      "Conservation groups also expect a renewed fight over protected federal land, particularly in the Southwest. After President Barack Obama created the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah in 2016, Trump reduced its size by more than 1 million acres after he took office the following year. A cadre of environmental groups filed suit, and the monument was fully restored by Biden in 2021.",
      "Many expect Bears Ears to be targeted again, as well as Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, which is also in Utah.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re expecting on day one that these national monuments could be dismantled,\u201d said Ethan Aumack, executive director for the Grand Canyon Trust.",
      "He said the group has done scenario planning to be able to respond swiftly to any such attempt.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll just say this: We\u2019re not working from a blank slate. We saw what happened under President Trump in his first term,\u201d Aumack said. \u201cWe believe that it\u2019s unlawful for any president to dismantle national monuments, and we\u2019re ready to take that question to the courts if he tries the same thing again.\u201d",
      "Although he expects fierce fights ahead, Wetzler also pointed to a few types of environmental policies that may be hard for the new Trump administration to dismantle.",
      "Pointing to the Biden administration\u2019s infrastructure and clean-energy investments, he said many elected Republicans may not want to lose the money going to their districts, including leaders in the swing states of Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of the funds going towards clean energy \u2014 new battery technologies, electric vehicle manufacturing plants, solar manufacturers \u2014\u00a0are being located in Republican districts around the country and in red states,\u201d Wetzler said. \u201cI think there\u2019s gonna be a lot of pressure on Congress, by the Republican Party, by their own constituents, not to disrupt those investments.\u201d",
      "Secondly, he said, clean water has emerged as an area of relative bipartisan consensus.",
      "\u201cSome of the most avid conservationists are in fact Republicans and are in fact people who live close to the land,\u201d added Wetzler. \u201cMy experience tells me that when it comes to preserving access to water, fishable, swimmable lakes, places where people can hike and camp and hunt and fish, there\u2019d be a lot of resistance to that no matter what political party is in charge in Washington.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The biggest surprise of \u201cGladiator II\u201d is not that Denzel Washington is great. Instead, it\u2019s how pivotal his character Macrinus is to the long-awaited sequel starring Paul Mescal as the heir of Russell Crowe\u2019s iconic character Maximus.",
      "The sequel revolves around Mescal\u2019s character stepping into his destiny as Lucius, the son of a great warrior and grandson of an emperor. But it\u2019s Washington\u2019s Macrinus who moves \u201cGladiator II\u201d forward.",
      "Far more than a mere villain, Macrinus is a saboteur and opportunist in this Roman Empire epic, where those taken as slaves are forced to fight in an arena before an audience with a grim outcome: kill or be killed.",
      "\u201cHis grand purpose,\u201d Washington told NBC News, \u201cis to take over the world.\u201d",
      "To select his gladiators, Macrinus leans into their rage. Not only does Macrinus look for that rage in the potential gladiators he purchases, but the former gladiator also stokes it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a way to touch and connect with the young gladiators so that he can get him to do what he wants him to do,\u201d Washington explained. \u201cI think it\u2019s purely manipulative.\u201d",
      "Crowe\u2019s \u201cGladiator,\u201d which was released in 2000 \u2014 the same year as Washington\u2019s box office hit \u201cRemember the Titans\u201d \u2014 was not without ambitious men. They, however, did not look like Washington\u2019s Macrinus. A former slave himself, Macrinus has won his freedom as a gladiator and transformed himself into a worldly statesman and power broker whom Washington infuses with both charm and cunning in \u201cGladiator II.\u201d",
      "The famed actor\u2019s involvement in the second film began as a friendly conversation with his \u201cAmerican Gangster\u201d director Ridley Scott, who is also known for \u201cAlien,\u201d \u201cBlade Runner\u201d and \u201cThelma & Louise.\u201d",
      "Scott \u201csaid it took him 20-some-odd years to get the script to where he was comfortable with it,\u201d Washington said. Ultimately, it was his relationship with Scott and his respect for him as a director that swayed him to take the role.",
      "\u201cWe had great success together with \u2018American Gangster,\u2019\u201d Washington said. \u201cHe\u2019s, in my opinion, one of the top directors of all time. He asked me to do the film, and I said \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d",
      "Macrinus\u2019 vast wealth manifests through opulent robes, expensive rings, stacks of bracelets and eye-catching earrings. He also has a stylish salt-and-pepper goatee and a well-coiffed Caesar haircut. But Macrinus\u2019 style is an element of the character in which Washington insists he played no role.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know nothing about clothes,\u201d he said with a chuckle, crediting costume designer Janty Yates. \u201cI was given a lot of tools in the toolbox with the rings and the chains and the earrings, all that stuff they brought to me. And I wanted more and more and more and more.\u201d",
      "Outside of the wardrobe, there were few action elements in \u201cGladiator II\u201d that he had not previously encountered in his many roles that include \u201cOthello\u201d and the \u201cEqualizer\u201d franchise.",
      "\u201cAlmost everything that is done in the film, I\u2019ve done before: fight scenes, swords, riding horses,\u201d he said, noting one exception. \u201cBattling in the water \u2014 that was new, but I\u2019ve done a lot of different fights and all things like that.\u201d",
      "Roles like Macrinus, he said, have been the norm for him throughout his career. \u201cThe first leading role I ever read for, I got,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing leads right from the beginning. I\u2019ve been blessed beyond measure. I haven\u2019t been cheated; I\u2019ve been overlooked. But, so what?\u201d",
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d officially hits the big screen Friday as \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d begins streaming on Netflix. The latter film is the latest in Washington\u2019s commitment as a producer to adapt August Wilson\u2019s group of 10 plays known as the \u201cPittsburgh Cycle\u201d or \u201cCentury Cycle.\u201d It\u2019s directed by son Malcolm, produced by daughter Katia, and stars son John David.",
      "\u201cAs parents,\u201d he said, including his wife, Pauletta, \u201cwe\u2019re pleased with the work our children are doing. We have four highly intelligent children.\u201d Now as his children have gone through college and forge career paths of their own, he said, \u201cI\u2019m heading toward the back of the bus and letting them drive.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have very few things left to do as an actor,\u201d he continued. \u201cI just want to go down by the ocean and feel the breeze and enjoy my family and hopefully some grandchildren one day. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at. I just want to do God\u2019s will, and I just want to go home when he calls me. I don\u2019t want anything else. I got everything.\u201d"

      "The Kremlin said Friday that its attack using a new ballistic missile was a warning to Ukraine's \"reckless\" Western allies, the culmination of a week of escalating threats from President Vladimir Putin.",
      "The United States and its European partners vowed not to be deterred in their support for Kyiv despite Moscow\u2019s deployment of the new weapon, which carried multiple warheads.",
      "As new details also emerged about the deepening alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued his own nuclear threat to his southern U.S.-backed neighbor and accused Washington of fueling tensions.",
      "The latest round of saber rattling from Putin and Kim has come during a week in which the war in Ukraine passed 1,000 days and with Washington preparing for a change in leadership.",
      "Still, Western officials and analysts have sought to play down what they said was a clear effort to intimidate Kyiv and its backers.",

      "\"Reckless actions by the West which supply missiles to Ukraine and later take part in strikes against Russia can\u2019t be left without a Russian response,\" Peskov told a daily news briefing. \"Russia has shown its capabilities and the nature of our future possible responses is also rather clear.\"",
      "The U.S. said the \u201cOreshnik\u201d \u2014 or \"Hazel tree\" \u2014 was a new, experimental type of missile based on the design of the existing RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile.",

      "The Kim-Putin alliance was likely one factor behind the decision of Washington and its allies to relax restrictions on Kyiv. And NATO, the Western military alliance bracing for a second Donald Trump presidency, said it would not stop that support in the face of Putin's threats.",

      "His co-defendants' death sentences were eventually amended to life sentences after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that executing juveniles is unconstitutional.",
      "In his final statement, Grayson spoke about how he committed a horrible crime and how sorry he was \u2014 and how he has been sorry for 30 years. He said he has repented and he hopes everyone can forgive him, his lawyer, Kacey Keeton, said.",
      "Grayson also spoke about his disappointment in the prison system and accused prison authorities of committing murder, calling them serial killers, according to Keeton.",
      "Witnesses were unable to hear Grayson's last words as jail officials cut the microphone after he said an expletive to the warden.",
      "Protesters had sent petitions asking Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey to halt Grayson's execution. Her office did not respond to a request for comment, but she was not expected to intercede, telling the Montgomery Advertiser this month when she was asked about the state's carrying out an execution a week before Thanksgiving: \"Did Carey Grayson give any consideration to the fact that he robbed Vickie Deblieux and her family of now 30 Thanksgivings?\"",
      "A statement from the governor's office released following the execution said Ivey \"told Corrections Commissioner John Hamm that she would not exercise her clemency powers in this case and directed him to proceed with Mr. Grayson\u2019s lawfully imposed death sentence.\"",
      "\"Even after her death, Mr. Grayson\u2019s crimes against Ms. DeBlieux were heinous, unimaginable, without an ounce of regard for human life and just unexplainably mean,\" Ivey said in the statement. \"An execution by nitrogen hypoxia bares no comparison to the death and dismemberment Ms. DeBlieux experienced.\"",
      "Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said in a statement \"justice has been served\" Thursday, adding \"My prayer for Vickie\u2019s family is that they can find solace in the State of Alabama finally serving justice for their heartbreaking loss.\"",
      "Grayson's lawyers appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, writing that his case \"raises issues of national importance\" among death penalty states about \"whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits suffocating a conscious prisoner and whether a state's refusal to prevent conscious suffocation via a novel method of execution superadds terror and pain in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\"",
      "The high court has typically declined to intervene in last-minute requests to halt executions. It refused to do so when Alabama executed Kenneth Smith, the first person in the U.S. to die in a nitrogen gas execution, in January and again in September, when the state executed Alan Miller in a second nitrogen gas execution.",
      "Eyewitness reports of both executions mentioned that the men appeared to struggle while they were strapped to gurneys and being fed nitrogen. Smith, 58, did not become unconscious as quickly as expected, and he appeared to shake and writhe for two minutes, while Miller, 59, pulled against his restraints and periodically gasped for about six minutes, according to reports.",
      "In both cases, Alabama initially tried to execute the men by lethal injection, but the attempts were abandoned when prison staff members could not successfully establish intravenous lines.",
      "The series of problematic executions using lethal injection led Alabama officials to\u00a0pause the practice in 2022\u00a0and re-evaluate before they restarted it last year. Since then, Alabama has become the first state to develop a nitrogen hypoxia execution protocol in addition to lethal injection.",
      "Lethal injection remains the default method in the state, although condemned inmates can choose nitrogen hypoxia or, in some cases, electrocution.",
      "Grayson had chosen nitrogen hypoxia before a protocol for it was in place.",
      "\u201cThe State of Alabama\u2019s nitrogen protocol has been used twice and has not worked as they swore it would. Instead of taking the sensible approach and fixing the problem, they are pushing forward using the same method on Thursday,\" Grayson\u2019s lawyer John Palombi said.",
      "\"Mr. Grayson\u2019s execution should be stopped and a full, independent, and transparent examination of the protocol conducted,\u201d he added.",
      "The use of nitrogen has raised concerns among human rights groups as states have looked for viable alternatives to lethal injection,\u00a0a method that has become increasingly difficult because of a shortage of the necessary drugs.",
      "If nitrogen, a naturally occurring, colorless and odorless gas, is not mixed with enough oxygen, it can cause physical side effects, such as impaired respiration, vomiting and even death, medical experts say.",
      "During an execution, a small amount of oxygen's getting into an inmate's mask as the inmate breathes nitrogen could lead to slow asphyxiation and prolong the time it would take to die, according to the experts.",
      "In his arguments in front of the appeals court panel this week, Palombi mentioned concerns about how long Smith and Miller were conscious as their bodies reacted to the procedure.",
      "\"I would submit to the court that being conscious and being suffocated for a period of time constitutes terror that is superadded to this protocol that does not have to be there, as acknowledged by the fact that the state is willing to, if he requests it, give Mr. Grayson a sedative,\" said Palombi, who is with the Federal Defenders Program.",
      "Robert Overing, Alabama's deputy solicitor general, disagreed with Palombi's assessment and countered that nitrogen hypoxia is not akin to suffocation \"like drowning or smothering with a plastic bag or paralyzing the lungs.\"",
      "\"This is really apples and oranges trying to use the term 'suffocation' to evoke a sense of fear and pain that doesn't exist with this method,\" Overing told the court.",
      "Grayson was become the sixth person executed in Alabama this year.",
      "In February 1994, prosecutors say, he and three teenage friends \u2014 Kenny Loggins, Trace Duncan and Louis Mangione \u2014 were using alcohol and drugs when they encountered Deblieux, 37, who was hitchhiking through Alabama to see her mother in Louisiana.",
      "They beat Deblieux, threw her off a cliff and mutilated her body, including cutting off her fingers, according to court records. They were linked to the crime after Mangione showed Deblieux's finger to friends, prosecutors say.",
      "Grayson, who was 19 at the time of killing, was sentenced to death, while Mangione, then 16, was given a life sentence. Death sentences for Loggins and Duncan, then both 17, were later commuted to life in prison."

    "story": [
      "Jordan Neely died from the \u201ccombined effects\u201d of a number of a factors, not a chokehold, a forensic pathologist hired by Daniel Penny\u2019s attorneys testified Thursday.",
      "Penny is charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Neely on a New York City subway train in May 2023.",
      "Dr. Satish Chundru took the stand as the second expert witness for the defense team, which is trying to refute testimony from a New York City medical examiner who ruled that Neely died from compression to his neck as a result of a chokehold.",
      "Chundru, a forensic pathologist and consultant who said he has worked as a medical examiner for counties in Florida and Texas, said he has conducted more than 9,000 autopsies. He said the defense retained him a little over two weeks after Neely\u2019s killing.",
      "Neely, 30, who had a history of mental illness, shouted, threw his jacket to the ground and made distressing comments about being hungry and thirsty and wanting to return to jail when he boarded an uptown F train on May 1, 2023. Penny, 26, who was a passenger on the train, put Neely in a chokehold and took him to the ground. His attorneys have said that he did not intend to kill Neely and that he acted to protect the people around him.",
      "Prosecutors have said Penny held Neely in the chokehold for six minutes, letting him go only after he had become unconscious and gone limp. Two other people helped him restrain Neely for some of that time. A bystander video of Penny choking Neely on the floor of the subway car, which was widely shared online, divided people in New York and beyond. Some viewed his actions as praiseworthy, while others condemned them and labeled him a vigilante.",
      "Chundru\u2019s testimony contradicted that of Dr. Cynthia Harris, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Neely and ruled that he died of the chokehold. Chundru said he did not believe that Neely died of a chokehold or that Penny had applied consistent and sufficient pressure to render him unconscious.",
      "Chundru said he believed Neely died from \u201cthe combined effects of sickle cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint and the synthetic marijuana\u201d that was in his system. He said he had reviewed Neely\u2019s autopsy report, two toxicology reports, genetic studies, photographs from the autopsy, \u201ca couple of videos of the incident,\u201d psychiatric records, witness statements and transcripts of police body camera video, among other things.",
      "Neely\u2019s father, Andre Zachary, hung his head as parts of the bystander video were shown Thursday, and he left the courtroom multiple times during Chundru\u2019s testimony, including after he said Neely had not died of a chokehold.",
      "Chundru criticized Harris, who told jurors Neely suffered \u201can asphyxial death,\u201d for issuing a ruling about his cause of death before toxicology and other tests were complete.",
      "Harris, a prosecution witness, testified over three days and said she based her decision on the autopsy findings coupled with the video and the investigative information about it, as well as with knowledge of Neely\u2019s use of synthetic cannabinoids. She was in the courtroom Thursday during Chundru\u2019s testimony.",
      "One of Penny\u2019s attorneys, Steven Raiser, spent hours trying to poke holes in her findings and testimony. He questioned how she came to her conclusion without full toxicology results.",
      "\u201cNo toxicological result imaginable was going to change my opinion,\u201d she said.",
      "Harris walked jurors through Penny\u2019s final moments, explaining down to the minute when he made his last purposeful movement. She also testified that within the medical examiner\u2019s office, the \u201cconsensus was unanimous\u201d about Neely\u2019s cause of death.",
      "Cross-examining Chundru, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran appeared to raise questions about the quality of his work, suggesting through a series of questions that he performed more autopsies a year than is recommended by the National Association of Medical Examiners, of which he is a member. Yoran will continue her cross-examination Friday.",
      "The defense this week called six people to testify as character witnesses, including Penny\u2019s sister and mother. His sister, Jacqueline Penny, 27, an accountant, testified about their suburban upbringing in West Islip on Long Island, a small town that she described as neighborly and beachy.",
      "She said Penny had always been \u201cpatriotic,\u201d so she was not too surprised when he enlisted in the Marines after he graduated from high school because other men in their family had also served in the military.",
      "Their mother, Gina Flaim-Penny, a teacher\u2019s assistant who lives in Queens, testified that she taught Penny to \u201ctreat others equally as you would like to be treated\u201d and that she believed he did so. She said that when she and Penny\u2019s father divorced, it was difficult on all four of her children but that they stayed close and leaned on one another. She said that they went to family counseling and that her children also went to a counselor. She testified that she knew her son to be an empathetic, compassionate and peaceful person.",
      "Along with Penny\u2019s sister and mother, four other character witnesses were called by the defense to testify to Penny\u2019s empathy, honesty and integrity. Their testimony followed evidence submitted by prosecutors that suggested Penny had lied during an interview with police.",
      "Hours after Neely was killed, according to a video shown to jurors, Penny told two detectives in an interview at a precinct that he did not put pressure on Neely\u2019s neck and that he had released his chokehold as soon as he received confirmation from the two men who helped him restrain Neely that they were holding Neely. But last week, one of those men, Eric Gonzalez, testified that Penny continued his chokehold after Gonzalez told him, \u201cI will grab his hands so you can let go.\u201d"

      "\u201cIt\u2019s so exciting to be part of the bird\u2019s journey \u2014 right from the rescue, right to the release,\u201d Biddulph said shortly before the penguin was freed. \u201cIt\u2019s really something so special.\u201d",
      "Given the malnourishment, Biddulph first fed the penguin fluids and then slurry until it was able to eat whole fish. The bird was also given a mirror to compensate for its lack of companions.",
      "\u201cGood luck, Gus,\u201d Biddulph shouted with a smile after the penguin dived into the water and swam away from the vessel. \u201cJust keep going south, Gus. Don\u2019t stop for anyone.\u201d",
      "It remains unknown how the bird ended up arriving in Australia from its icy Antarctic home.",
      "Emperors are the largest of all penguins, with an average height of 3 feet 7 inches. They are known to travel up to almost 1,000 miles on foraging trips that can last up to a month."

      "The final police report caps nearly two years of speculation about Bolsonaro\u2019s role in the election-denying movement that culminated in\u00a0riots by his supporters\u00a0who swept the capital, Brasilia, in January 2023, just a week after his rival, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, took office.

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:54:23 GMT",
    "summary": "December usually brings travelers into Haiti, but a ban on flights has halted plans for holiday gatherings and for anyone trying to deliver food, medicine and other aid.",
    "story": [
      "All travel between the U.S. and Haiti, including much-needed aid operations, continues to be affected by a 30-day ban imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration last week, after gunfire struck a Spirit Airlines plane as it attempted to land in Port-au-Prince.",
      "Linda Thelemaque regularly travels to the southern city of Les Cayes in her role as chief program officer of Hope for Haiti, a nonprofit organization that helps combat poverty. She said the inability to fly in supplies has created a logistical nightmare in the Caribbean nation, where gang violence already makes ground transportation between cities nearly impossible.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been dealing with severe challenges due to gang violence, which has essentially cut off ground transportation,\u201d Thelemaque said. \u201cNow, with flights canceled, we\u2019re facing increased costs and delays in delivering essential supplies, including $10 million worth of medication.\u201d",
      "Thelemaque had planned to travel to Haiti for work on Nov. 19, but her flight was canceled. \u201cAlthough the FAA says the ban will lift on Dec. 12, most airlines are rescheduling flights for February,\u201d she said.",
      "The FAA ban has also complicated humanitarian aid efforts. \u201cWe rely on Sunrise Airways to transport supplies from Port-au-Prince to the south, but with flights grounded, we\u2019re forced to explore expensive alternatives, like chartering flights or seeking humanitarian exemptions,\u201d she said.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, American Airlines said it had suspended its daily flights between Miami and Port-au-Prince until Feb. 12, 2025, after a separate incident involving flight 819 from Port-au-Prince to Miami last week. While the flight landed safely in Miami with no reported injuries, a post-flight inspection revealed that a bullet had struck the aircraft\u2019s exterior.",
      "Before the FAA\u2019s ban announcement, the U.S. State Department had issued an advisory to avoid traveling to Haiti due to \u201ckidnapping, crime, civil unrest, and limited health care.\u201d The department noted that airports and people traveling by car had become targets for violence.",
      "In March, escalating gang violence and unrest reached a boiling point as the Caribbean nation\u2019s government fell apart. Armed groups took over the streets, disrupting life for many residents across Port-au-Prince and driving up the cost of fuel and basic goods. \u201cPrices are being passed on to consumers, making daily survival increasingly unaffordable,\u201d Thelemaque said.",
      "Yolette Williams, CEO of the Haitian American Alliance of New York, said the country\u2019s ongoing crisis has taken an emotional toll on Haitians living in the United States.",
      "\u201cWe may be physically far from Haiti, but we remain deeply connected,\u201d she said. \u201cFamilies are consumed by the news of worsening violence and are mourning senseless killings.\u201d",
      "The flight ban is also disrupting long-standing holiday traditions in this mostly Catholic and Christian country. Jan. 1 also holds special significance beyond New Year\u2019s Day, as it is also Haitian Independence Day and celebrated with parades, fireworks and dancing.",
      "\u201cMany Haitians save their vacations for December to reconnect with loved ones,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNow, that opportunity has been taken away.\u201d",
      "Williams noted that the ban extends beyond Port-au-Prince to airports throughout the country, further isolating Haitians. \u201cEven during ongoing crises, people could travel to Cap-Ha\u00eftien or Les Cayes. Now the whole country feels shut down,\u201d she said.",
      "Another way to enter Haiti is by crossing through the Dominican Republic, with whom it shares the island. Haitian passport-holders with U.S. permanent residency often traveled through the DR but the country has closed its borders with Haiti due to the violence.",
      "\u201cEven if a flight diverts to the Dominican Republic, Haitian passport-holders are denied entry,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSome passengers have had to return to Europe or elsewhere.\u201d",
      "The U.N. reported that more than 20,000 people fled their homes in Port-au-Prince in a four-day span in November and settled in smaller cities. This has strained resources in cities like Les Cayes.",
      "\u201cThe influx of displaced residents is overwhelming clinics and creating mistrust between locals and newcomers,\u201d Thelemaque said.",
      "Williams emphasized the growing mental health crisis in Haiti, citing a recent survey by Haitian-led organizations. \u201cThe constant trauma of gang violence is taking a toll on people\u2019s emotional well-being,\u201d she said.",
      "Even those in less-affected areas remain under stress, she said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re in Cap-Ha\u00eftien or Les Cayes, you worry about being next,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe trauma is pervasive, and the travel ban only adds to that stress.\u201d",
      "Both Thelemaque and Williams agree that the FAA ban, while necessary for safety, underscores the urgent need to address Haiti\u2019s escalating crisis.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to adapt,\u201d Thelemaque said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s securing humanitarian exemptions or finding new supply routes, the people we serve rely on us.\u201d",
      "Williams called for continued advocacy. \u201cThe diaspora wants to help, but the barriers are immense,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must address not only the immediate needs but also the root causes of this violence.\u201d"

    "summary": "Wicked fans and TikTokers are recapping their experiences reading the book as kids or now, and detailing the differences between the book and musical.",
    "story": [
      "It didn\u2019t take long for BookToker Asia Lin to understand that \u201cWicked,\u201d the book by Gregory Maguire, would be nothing like the musical she had first seen months earlier.",
      "\u201cIt was the first page,\u201d Lin tells TODAY.com, recalling a scene in which Dorothy and her companions discuss a rumor that Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, is intersex. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wait. Hold on. This was not in the musical at all.\u2019\u201d",
      "Content creator Sara Ribeiro, who grew up listening to \u201cWicked\u201d in a musical theater-loving family, experienced a visceral shock while reading the book this year.",
      "\u201c(The book) ended up being a lot darker than I thought. I would say within the first 10 to 20%, my jaw was on the floor multiple times. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be so \u2026 graphic,\u201d she says.",
      "With the first part of \u201cWicked\u201d debuting in theaters Nov. 22 (and the second and final part coming in 2025), TikTokers like Lin and Ribeiro are discovering the novel and sharing their experiences \u2014 from surprise to admiration \u2014 in real time. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone warn me?\u201d Lin asks in a TikTok, echoing many other fans.",
      "Maguire\u2019s \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West\u201d\u2014 a revisionist take on L. Frank Baum\u2019s \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\u201d \u2014 originally published in 1995 and was followed by multiple other books to make a series. \u201cWicked\u201d the musical made its Broadway debut in 2003.",
      "The book and musical could be distilled to the same plot summary: Behold, the unexpected backstory of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda the Good. But the ways the book and musical convey its themes \u2014 like injustice, identity and friendship \u2014 is what distinguishes the two.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re both about a young woman named Elphaba \u2014\u00a0but very different. The best way I can explain is like when your parents would hide vegetables in your food, and you wouldn\u2019t notice it. That\u2019s kind of what they did with the musical,\u201d Meredith Ammons, a content creator, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Whereas the musical hides its political message behind \u201cfluff,\u201d Ammons says, the book \u201chits you over the head with it.\u201d She continues, \u201cIt\u2019s like reading a children\u2019s Bible for the first time versus reading the actual Bible for the first time, and how differently the tones are.\u201d",
      "The plight of Animals \u2014 conscious animals \u2014 takes center stage in the book, as does Elphaba\u2019s activism. Not so much a side character, the Wizard is rather a full-fledged dictatorial force committing massacres on the hinterlands of Oz and amassing power. While political allegory is the B-plot to \u201cWicked\u201d the musical, which centers on Glinda and Elphaba\u2019s friendship, it\u2019s the main storyline of Maguire\u2019s book.",
      "Maguire\u2019s \u201cWicked\u201d doesn\u2019t contain hallmarks from the musical, like a \u201cPopular\u201d-esque union between Glinda and Elphaba. But it takes detours the musical never would have space for \u2014 long explanations of religious sects, descriptions of terrain never mentioned in the musical and, well, quite a bit of R-rated content.",
      "For example: Elphaba bites off a midwife\u2019s finger as an newborn; her parents are involved in what is essentially a loving throuple with a Quadling man named Turtle Heart; Fiyero is a child groom married off at 7. Plus, there is inclusion of sexual assault, bestiality, murder, racism and politics.",
      "\u201cTrigger warning for everything. If you can think of it, it\u2019s in here,\u201d Eryn Kieffer, whose multipart read-along of \u201cWicked\u201d has amassed millions of views on TikTok, said in a video.",
      "Kieffer\u2019s series goes into all the graphic scenes she wasn\u2019t expecting \u2014 like the Clock of the Time Dragon\u2019s puppet show or the Philosophy Club scenes, which have become shorthand for the book\u2019s surprising sexual detours.",
      "Among \u201cWicked\u201d fans, the book\u2019s content is divisive. Kieffer, on her end, said that the sexual content \u201cmuddles the plot.\u201d",
      "Ribeiro says she loves the \u201cshock value\u201d in the books and that the unexpected parts were her favorite to read \u2014 but ultimately took away from what she considered the \u201cpoint\u201d of the book.",
      "\u201cI think I was so distracted by all of the weird stuff that was going on that the political aspect of it was overshadowed,\u201d she says.",
      "Meanwhile, TikToker Aynsley Broom worries the focus on salaciousness takes attention from the book\u2019s more powerful parts about the rise of authoritarianism, which she sees as a \u201cmirror\u201d to the news. In the book, the Wizard of Oz is a despot who ostracizes and marginalizes entire classes of Ozians, not to mention Animals.",
      "\u201cI saw a video that was like, \u2018(The book) explicitly describes (Elphaba\u2019s) pubic hair.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Not really. The book just said it was purple and then moved on,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cTo me, the stuff people are focusing on is completely missing the message. The message needs to be talked more about than the shocking parts, which to me, weren\u2019t that shocking. Granted, I also read a lot of romance novels.\u201d",
      "In the book, she sees a more substantial offering than the musical \u2014 calling the former \u201ca great dinner\u201d and the latter \u201ccotton candy.\u201d",
      "Broom is among the readers who want a more faithful adaptation of Maguire\u2019s \u201cWicked\u201d than another retelling of the more saccharine musical.\u00a0\u201cI think people want fluff, and we don\u2019t need more fluff,\u201d she says.",
      "Maguire, on his end, seems at peace with the adaptation. During a 2020 interview pegged to the book\u2019s anniversary, he said the musical\u2019s composer, Stephen Schwartz, presented his vision during a walk in Connecticut, and that he felt they were aligned \u2014 that Schwartz understood his book and the moral universe it\u2019s set in.",
      "\u201cI came home and I said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to let this happen, I don\u2019t care about the money. This is far more in line with why I wrote the book than the movie scripts I\u2019ve read so far,\u2019\u201d he told Broadway World.",
      "Maguire said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the way Schwartz and book writer Winnie Holzman told the story.",
      "\u201cIt made efficient, economic and narrative sense for them to make the story choices that they chose to do, and I applaud it completely. The play is a little less subtle than the novel in some ways. And I wanted the novel to be more ambiguous because that\u2019s the nature of how I was trying to tell my story,\u201d he said.",
      "What TikTokers generally agree on, though, is that \u201cWicked\u201d the book is certainly not as kid-friendly as \u201cWicked\u201d the musical.",
      "Creators like TikToker Sal Currie are remarking on their experiences reading the books as kids, and giving a heads up to parents who might be persuaded by the newly rebranded cover.",
      "\u201cMy main thing is \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s not for kids. It\u2019s really, truly not for children. The musical is completely fine for kids. I would not say this book is at all,\u201d Kieffer tells TODAY.com.",
      "Ammons says her mom bought the book when she was a young child. She asked if she could read it.",
      "\u201cShe said, \u2018Absolutely not.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Why not?\u2019 And she said, \u2018You\u2019ll understand when you\u2019re older,\u2019\u201d she says. Ammons ultimately waited until she was 22 to read Maguire\u2019s novel. \u201cMy first reaction was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m glad I waited to read this, because my mom was right on this one,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Others think reading, and being bewildered by, \u201cWicked\u201d is a rite of passage: \u201cIt\u2019s a canon event for most \u2018Wicked\u2019 fans,\u201d one comment on Currie\u2019s post reads. \u201cWe must not interfere.\u201d"

      "What happens in \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019?",
      "In the 1939 movie, Dorothy Gale (Garland) is a orphaned young woman growing up on her aunt and uncle\u2019s farm during the Dust Bowl, and dreams of escaping \u201cover the rainbow\u201d someday.",
      "She runs away when a local woman\u2019s complaint that Dorothy\u2019s dog Toto bit her means the dog must be put down. Convinced to return home by a traveling fortune-teller called Professor Marvel, Dorothy arrives mid-tornado and is hit in the head. The house appears to lift into the storm\u2019s funnel \u2014 depositing her in a new world.",
      "Dorothy is delighted by the local Munchkins of Munchkinland but enveloped in a tragedy: Her house has killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and her sister the Wicked Witch of the West vows vengeance. The Wicked Witch of the West also wants the pair of shoes the Good Witch of the North has gifted Dorothy from the dead witch.",
      "Desiring only to get home, Dorothy sets off down the Yellow Brick Road to visit Emerald City and the Wizard, who she hears holds the key to her return home.",
      "Along the way, she makes friends with The Scarecrow (who wants a brain); the Tin Man (who wants a heart); and the Cowardly Lion (who wants courage).",
      "After several adventures, they meet the Wizard (or at least, a giant floating green head with a booming voice that scares them) who says he\u2019ll give them all what they want if they bring them the Witch\u2019s broomstick, proving she\u2019s dead.",
      "How does \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 end?",
      "Dorothy and Toto are first captured by the Witch\u2019s flying monkeys, but freed by their companions, only to be chased by the Witch and her guards. When the Witch sets the Scarecrow\u2019s arm on fire, Dorothy splashes him with water \u2014 that also lands on the Witch, melting her.",
      "They bring the broomstick to the Wizard, who tries to dodge their requests, until Toto reveals a man behind a curtain who\u2019s operating all the special effects. He offers to take her home in the hot air balloon that brought him to Oz, but Dorothy misses her flight while chasing Toto and seems stuck in Oz.",
      "Then, Glinda reveals an even easier way back to Kansas: Dorothy can click her heels together and wish to be home. After some fond farewells, Dorothy invokes the shoe spell and she and Toto go home.",
      "But did they ever leave? Dorothy wakes in her own bed, surrounded by farmhands who look like the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion. Everyone insists she had a vivid dream. Dorothy is just happy to be home and discovers the film\u2019s true meaning: That home is the best place of all.",
      "How does \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 connect to \u2018Wicked\u2019?",
      "Throughout \u201cWicked,\u201d characters and scenes often contain touchstones from the 1939 movie, starting with that hat on the water and the Witch\u2019s killers marching off to Emerald City.",
      "But not everything connects \u2026 yet. Elphaba doesn\u2019t start off so wicked in \u201cWicked: Part One,\u201d for example. She\u2019s actually tormented for her green skin (sure, Oz is a magic world but there are some things the locals really don\u2019t tolerate).",
      "Galinda doesn\u2019t start out particularly good, either; she\u2019s self-absorbed and self-assured to the point of annoyance. But colors are significant here: Just like in \u201cOz,\u201d Elphaba is green, and Galinda/Glinda is as pink as Barbie (and travels in her own literal bubble).",
      "In \u201cWicked: Part One,\u201d Elphaba does have a sister, but we never see anything of that sister in \u201cOz\u201d except for her legs sticking out from under the house. Nessarose's shoes (Marissa Bode) in \u201cWicked: Part One\u201d aren't ruby \u2014 they\u2019re bedazzled and silvery (much like in Baum's \u201cWonderful Wizard of Oz\u201d and Maguire's \u201cWicked\u201d).",
      "There are other shout-outs to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d in the film.",
      "In \u201cWicked: Part One\u201d The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) enlists Elphaba and Galinda to help him decide on a color for a super-sidewalk that will thread throughout Oz that he\u2019s building (yellow, naturally, wins).",
      "Prince Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) joins Elphaba and Galinda at school and helps Elphaba rescue a lion cub \u2014 it\u2019s not directly stated in the film, but there\u2019s a good chance that cub\u2019s going to have a connection to being cowardly someday.",
      "Then there are some confusing moments. For a woman who should have discovered by now that water can hurt her, Elphaba is quite unbothered by it in \u201cPart One,\u201d going so far as to dance on flagstones that cross a stream at the school. Surely there\u2019s more to learn about this seeming inconsistency in \u201cPart Two.\u201d",
      "\u201cPart One\u201d also underscores the poppy as a significant flower: They\u2019re the favorites of a professor at Shiz University who Elphaba takes a shine to. At one point, she releases a spell that causes the flowers\u2019 scent to knock out nearly everyone in the classroom. This is a direct reference to a scene in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d where Wicked Elphaba creates a field of poppies to slow down Dorothy and her friends on their way to Emerald City.",
      "Of course, there are still more reveals to come in \u201cPart Two,\u201d currently slated for theaters on Nov. 26, 2025. Until then, keep following the yellow brick road!"

      "She opened up to friend and former NBC News correspondent Harry Smith Nov. 20 during a conversation about her new book, \u201cCher: The Memoir, Part One,\u201d about her dyslexia and its impact on her life.",
      "\u201cI want to tell you something that\u2019s really embarrassing, though,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know my address, and I don\u2019t know my phone number.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t care!\u201d she added. \u201cIf people want to find me, they will.\u201d",
      "Throughout the course of her memoir, Cher explains she always knew something was wrong with her, and she especially struggled in school as a child.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until later in life that she got some answers about herself when her first kid, Chaz Bono, was diagnosed as dyslexic by specialists during childhood.",
      "\u201cWhen I read some of the literature they sent me about dyslexia, I thought, Oh s---. That\u2019s me,\u201d Cher writes in her book about the moment she found out about her child\u2019s diagnosis.",
      "She says she had \u201cnever even heard the word\u201d until Chaz\u2019s diagnosis. \u201cBut it explained so much.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like an old mystery had finally been solved, left over from my childhood,\u201d she adds, noting that \u201cthe difference was that there were systems in place to help\u201d her child that \u201cwere never available\u201d to her.",
      "Cher told Smith she does have a creative solution in the event she ever needs to look up her phone number.",
      "\u201cI have my mobile. If I want to know what my phone number is, I just click to \u2018Lucille Ball.\u2019 That\u2019s what my name is,\u201d she revealed.",
      "Ball has a special history with Cher. Cher recalls in her memoir attending an election results party, hosted by Jack Benny, in 1972 with the TV star.",
      "Cher explains she didn\u2019t want to be at the party and writes that \u201cLucille was clearly bored too, because as the votes started coming in she began making wisecracks about the \u2018windbags\u2019 giving commentary on what each update meant.\u201d",
      "She was taken by Ball\u2019s antics.",
      "\u201cI had known her since I was little, but this night she got me in trouble. I couldn\u2019t help but giggle at her commentary,\u201d she writes.",
      "\u201cShe was being so funny and irreverent. If you knew Lucy, she was a balls-to-the-wall kick-ass chick, not taking anything from anybody,\u201d she adds.",
      "Eventually, her giggles annoyed her then-husband, Sonny Bono, and party guest Johnny Carson.",
      "Cher says that Carson \u201ccomplained to Jack Benny\u2019s wife about the disturbance,\u201d and she was confident Ball would get in trouble.",
      "\u201cThen I realized that nobody was going to say a word to her because she\u2019d have neutered them. Everyone was terrified of Lucy,\u201d Cher writes. \u201cI, however, was a different thing altogether. Like a naughty child, I was banished to the den.\u201d",
      "Not long after, Cher looked to Ball when she needed advice about how to leave Bono. She decided to give Ball a call since the \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d star had been in a similar situation and eventually divorced her TV co-star, Desi Arnaz.",
      "\u201cI told her, \u2018Lucy, I want to leave Sonny and you\u2019re the only one I know that\u2019s ever been in this same situation. What should I do?\u2019 Lucy and her husband had also become famous working together as stars on TV. And he was a huge womanizer too. Then Lucy had left him. She told me, \u2018F--- him, you\u2019re the one with the talent,\u2019\u201d she writes.",
      "Cher and Bono did eventually divorce in 1975, and she went on to marry Gregg Allman shortly thereafter. She and Allman welcomed a son together, Elijah Blue, in 1976 and divorced a few years later."

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:01:05 GMT",
    "summary": "How does the Gladiator sequel connect to the first Gladiator? Here's what to remember from the first Gladiator including how Lucius is related to Maximus.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s been nearly 25 years, but the Oscar-winning \u201cGladiator\u201d is back! Or, at least, a sequel is!",
      "True, \"Gladiator\" star Russell Crowe can\u2019t return as Maximus (for obvious reasons), but \u201cGladiator II\u201d \u00a0is packed full of nostalgia, familiar characters and callbacks to the 2000 film.",
      "It\u2019s also stuffed with much of the spectacle that made the first film such a success: brutal fights with animals and humans in the Coliseum, political intrigue, class warfare and a hero who fights with determined purpose.",
      "So what do we need to know about this sword-and-sandals epic before it opens wide on Nov. 22? Here's what to know.",
      "Note: Light spoilers are included regarding both films.",
      "Do you need to watch \u2018Gladiator\u2019 to follow along with \u2018Gladiator II\u2019?",
      "Not necessarily, but it helps. The key fact of the film: That Maximus had a son who ends up in the arena, and leading a revolt is already part of the early trailers.",
      "But it\u2019s not critical, because the film makes liberal use of flashbacks to the previous film to help fill in the blanks.",
      "What is Lucius\u2019 connection to the first \u2018Gladiator\u2019?",
      "In \u201cGladiator,\u201d Lucius is an incidental character.",
      "Played by Spencer Treat Clark, the boy is the son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), and it\u2019s stated that his father is Lucilla\u2019s late husband, Lucius Verus (Lucius\u2019 namesake).",
      "Lucilla, by the way, is the sister of the leader in the first film, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).",
      "But we also learn in that film that Lucilla had an on-again, off-again relationship with Maximus, so it\u2019s not a huge surprise to discover that the script for \u201cII\u201d has retconned Lucius (Paul Mescal) into being a more significant player: that is, Maximus\u2019 son.",
      "For his safety, the boy Lucius is shown to being spirited away and raised elsewhere \u2014 when he finally meets Lucilla in \u201cII,\u201d he claims to barely remember her.",
      "Who from the original \u2018Gladiator\u2019 appears?",
      "Aside from the actors in the flashbacks, there are two key performers who show up in \u201cII\u201d \u2014 Nielsen, who has remarried the man Lucius blames for murdering his family, Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal) \u2014 and Derek Jacobi, who plays Senator Graccus. In \u201cGladiator,\u201d he was part of the plot with Maximus and Lucilla to overthrow Commodus.",
      "And technically, Ridley Scott is also a return from the original \u201cGladiator\u201d \u2014 as the director of both films. He was nominated for best director in 2001, so maybe he\u2019s hoping to win that Oscar this time around.",
      "How does Maximus play a part in the new film?",
      "In a way, he\u2019s everywhere. Adult Lucius doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s Maximus\u2019 son, and he\u2019s worshiped the warrior all these years.",
      "There are several callbacks that suggest their connection before it\u2019s stated explicitly: The image of Maximus running his hand through wheat field grasses shows up early on, and when Lucius is in the arena he sticks his sword in the ground, leans down and runs sand through his hands \u2014 just like his father did.",
      "Then, during \u201cGladiator,\u201d Maximus has a maxim he loves to share: \u201cWhat we do in life echoes in eternity.\" The aphorism makes an appearance in \u201cII\u201d to lend it depth and scope.",
      "But the biggest contribution Maximus makes to the film (Lucius aside) comes when his son visits a tomb beneath the arena and is given his father\u2019s armor and sword for a big challenge.",
      "Who\u2019s been maintaining that all these years? How does it look so shiny and spiffy? Why does it naturally fit Lucius perfectly? These things can all be answered by whispering the name of a distant, future land far from Rome \u2026 Hollywood."

      "But is \"Wicked\" \u2014 which follows the origin story of the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good \u2014 also family-friendly?",
      "\"Wicked\" was rated PG, meaning parental guidance is suggested, and some material may not be suitable for young children.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the kid-friendliness of \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "Is 'Wicked' for kids?",
      "Yes, \"Wicked\" is for kids, director Jon M. Chu tells TODAY.com.",
      "Chu says two of his five children, age 7 and 5, have seen \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy 3-year-old did not see it yet, but I\u2019m going to bring her,\u201d he adds.",
      "\"Wicked\" is rated PG for \"some scary action, thematic material and brief suggestive material.\"",
      "For parents of young kids, Chu notes: Beware the flying monkeys.",
      "Toward the end of \"Wicked,\" viewers learn the backstory of the Wicked Witch of the West's famous henchman, her flying monkeys. Instead of costumed actors like in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"Wicked\" uses computer-generated imagery for the monkeys (and all the other animals in the film, including a lion cub, bear and goat).",
      "Chu says the monkeys are \"definitely not as creepy\" as they were in \"The Wizard of Oz.\" However, a Washington Post review of the film argues the flying monkeys are more terrifying with CGI, warning parents, \"this is not a movie for very young children.\"",
      "As for thematic and brief suggestive material, the film does feature some romance. There's an onscreen kiss and an implied sexual encounter in one of the film's first scenes.",
      "What age is 'Wicked' appropriate for?",
      "Common Sense Media rates the film as appropriate for kids aged 10 and up, citing \"(light) jump-scares\" involving the flying monkeys, the Wizard of Oz's giant avatar head and the bullying Cynthia Erivo's character Elphaba experiences.",
      "The film is also long, clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes in the theater, not including any previews.",
      "The original Broadway musical that the film is based on is recommended for children age 8 and up, and children under 5 years old are not admitted, according to the \"Wicked\" musical's website. The 1995 book that inspired the musical, Gregory Maguire's  \"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch,\" is not for children and includes swearing, sex, violence and more mature themes.",
      "Chu overall describes his 2024 \u201cWicked\u201d film as \u201caccessible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about a relationship, and that relationship is nuanced \u2014 we\u2019ll see if kids pick that up,\u201d Chu says, referring to the complex friendship between Elphaba (Erivo) and Glinda (Ariana Grande).",
      "\u201cI think they will fall in love with this friendship and this world. And there\u2019s a lot of things to look at and be enamored by,\u201d Chu says. \u201cBut in the end, I think they will love these two friends. And I think as a young person, when you\u2019re meeting new friends, I think that all connects with them, too.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 15:27:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Cher, who was previously married to Sonny Bono and Gregg Allman, reveals during a book talk about her memoir she should've dated singer Michael McDonald.",
    "story": [
      "Cher\u2019s famous relationships are nearly as iconic as her career in the entertainment industry, and both topics are extensively covered in her just-released book, \u201cCher: The Memoir, Part One.\u201d But there\u2019s one man she \u201cwould\u2019ve, could\u2019ve, should\u2019ve\u201d taken a chance on and didn\u2019t.",
      "During a conversation about her new book with friend and former NBC News correspondent Harry Smith Nov. 20 at New York City\u2019s Temple Emanu-El, Cher answered a question that Smith threw out there \u201cjust for fun.\u201d",
      "\u201cAre there men in your life,\u201d Smith began, \u201cwas there ever a man, and this is not in the book \u2014 this is just for fun \u2014 a man that you said, \u2018Would\u2019ve, could\u2019ve, should\u2019ve\u2019?\u201d",
      "The crowd ooohed, and the singer responded, \u201cMichael McDonald.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would have gone out with him for his voice,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf he just would sing to me, I would just love it.\u201d",
      "Cher also recalled the Doobie Brothers musician was once on the road with her and that she did background vocals just to be on the same stage with him.",
      "\u201cWhy is it, you think, that men always fall in love with you?\u201d Smith asked.",
      "\u201cHow can you not?\u201d someone in the audience said.",
      "\u201cLook at her!\u201d another screamed.",
      "Cher was married to Sonny Bono until the two divorced in 1975, and she tied the knot with Gregg Allman days after her first divorce was finalized. The two also had their fair share of issues, including Allman's battle with addiction, and divorced a few years after their wedding. She also dated music executive David Geffen and Kiss rocker Gene Simmons. She reflects on all of the relationships in her memoir.",
      "More recently, she\u2019s been linked to music executive Alexander \u201cAE\u201d Edwards.",
      "In response to Smith\u2019s question, Cher was a little shy.",
      "\u201cShould I just say all this stuff? It sounds so \u2014\u201d she started, \u201cbecause I\u2019m a really good girlfriend, and I learned how to do this.\u201d",
      "The 78-year-old also described herself as \u201creally funny\u201d and \u201csweet-ish.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m monogamous,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I know that if I look at a man while I\u2019m with my boyfriend, it\u2019s over, because I don\u2019t look at men. I don\u2019t see men. If I\u2019m with someone that I love, the moment I see a boy it\u2019s like, \u2018OK, goodbye!\u2019 But no, I\u2019m a really good girlfriend.\u201d",
      "That habit is one that was instilled in Cher early on, as detailed in her memoir, when she writes multiple times about Bono not allowing her to interact with other men. In one instance, she recalled when he burned her tennis clothes after finding out from a friend she went to a party after one of her tennis lessons and was seen talking to some men.",
      "\u201cI was so pissed off at that,\u201d Cher said while telling the story to Smith.",
      "While grappling with the decision to leave Bono, Cher called friend Lucille Ball, who divorced her famous husband and TV partner, Desi Arnaz, for advice.",
      "In her book, Cher wrote, \u201cI told her, \u2018Lucy, I want to leave Sonny and you\u2019re the only one I know that\u2019s ever been in this same situation. What should I do?\u2019\u201d",
      "The singer said Ball responded, \u201cF--- him, you\u2019re the one with the talent.\u201d",
      "Cher also shared another fun tidbit with fans during her book talk about Ball.",
      "\u201cI want to tell you something that\u2019s really embarrassing, though,\u201d the \u201cBelieve\u201d singer said to Smith.",
      "She explained that because she has dyslexia, she doesn\u2019t know her address or phone number.",
      "\u201cIf people want to find me, they will,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI have my mobile. If I want to know what my phone number is, I just click to \u2018Lucille Ball.\u2019 That\u2019s what my name is,\u201d she revealed.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not in the book,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s good stuff.\u201d"

      "\u201cHe\u2019s just afraid to confront anything, and he just takes Nancy\u2019s point of view as his own. So, he was in denial,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n explains. \u201cIt\u2019s true that we don\u2019t want to think those things of our children, but when it comes to Stephen, he is completely submissive to his wife\u2019s version of reality.\u201d",
      "As for whether or not Nancy knew about Jonathan\u2019s violent nature? Cuar\u00f3n says, \u201cI would almost be certain of that.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn many ways, Nancy\u2019s impulse to write \u2018The Perfect Stranger\u2019 was a way for her to protect her son and change the narrative of her son,\u201d he explained. \u201cThanks to the book, she could turn her son into this naive, heroic, romantic figure, which is very different from the reality.\u201d",
      "Does Nicholas die?",
      "At the beginning of \u201cDisclaimer,\u201d Stephen makes it clear that he published his wife\u2019s book, \u201cThe Perfect Stranger,\u201d simply to torture Catherine. He wants her closest friends and family members to know the part that she played in Jonathan\u2019s death.",
      "Stephen creates a complicated catfishing scheme to tell Nicholas his role in the story. Distraught by his mother\u2019s representation in the novel, Nicholas overdoses and ends up unconscious in the hospital.",
      "Once in the hospital, Stephen tries to kill Nicholas by injecting him with an unknown substance. However, Catherine stops him just in time.",
      "He then tries again once he spikes Catherine\u2019s tea, which puts her into a deep slumber. At the hospital, Stephen tries to give Nicholas the deadly injection, but he stops once he sympathizes with a confused Nicholas, who is calling out for his mom.",
      "What does Stephen see in the photograph?",
      "After the truth comes out about Jonathan, Stephen then decides to burn all the explicit photos that his son took of Catherine on the night he raped her.",
      "As he places the photos into the fire, Stephen sees a small but important detail he missed \u2014 Nicholas was there in the room when Catherine got assaulted.",
      "A photograph shows a young Nicholas looking on at his mother from the reflection in the mirror. It\u2019s at that moment that Stephen realizes his journey for retribution hurt more people than he realized.",
      "\u201cRevenge and retribution are just going to end up in the same way because it\u2019s just like the saying \u2014 \u2018He who seeks revenge should dig two graves,\u2019\u201d Cuar\u00f3n says.",
      "At the end of the show, Catherine opens up to Nicholas about what happened to her in Italy. Nicholas starts crying and says he doesn\u2019t remember the trip or that she was raped. While feeling remorseful, he hugs his mother and they both take the opportunity to get to know one another better on a clean slate.",
      "\u201cVery often, we don\u2019t remember traumatic episodes that we witness. But the fact that we don\u2019t remember them doesn\u2019t mean that they are not stored inside us and come out in different behaviors. This is shown with Nicholas and his addictive behaviors,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n says.",
      "\u201cDisclaimer\u201d ends with Catherine rebuilding her bond with her son. After putting her career first for many years, she decides to focus on Nicholas and mending their once strained relationship."

    "summary": "Who is Charles Manson and what comes out in the Peacock documentary Making Manson? Does he confess to new murders? What to know.",
    "story": [
      "Fifty years after the\u00a0Manson\u00a0Family killings, the name Charles\u00a0Manson\u00a0still evokes a strong image \u2014 that of a shaggy-haired cult leader who spoke provocatively about mass murder.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to feel guilty. I haven\u2019t done anything I\u2019m ashamed of. Maybe I haven\u2019t done enough,\u201d\u00a0Manson said in a\u00a01987 interview with TODAY\u00a0at California\u2019s San Quentin prison. \u201cMaybe I should have killed four, five hundred people, then I would have felt better. Then I would have felt like I really offered society something.\u201d",
      "Manson, whose followers committed a series of brutal killings in the late 1960s, is known for his infamous crimes. What\u2019s less known is who\u00a0Manson\u00a0was behind the scenes, when he was not being interviewed or making erratic outbursts in the courtroom.",
      "A new Peacock docuseries, \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson,\u201d out Nov. 19, features 20 years of never-before-heard recordings of\u00a0Manson\u2019s private phone conversations from prison. Peacock is owned by TODAY\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.",
      "More than 100 hours of audio recordings were provided by John Michael Jones, a man who says he first wrote to\u00a0Manson\u00a0in an effort to get his signature, then struck up a decadeslong relationship with him,\u00a0according to his interview in the documentary.\u00a0They stayed in touch until\u00a0Manson\u2019s death in 2017.",
      "These recordings \u201cgave us a candid conversation that we\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019ve never seen\u00a0Manson\u00a0without the mask before,\u201d the documentary\u2019s director, Billie Mintz, tells\u00a0TODAY.com.",
      "Mintz says the documentary, which also features several interviews with former members of\u00a0Manson\u2019s circle, is not meant to exonerate\u00a0Manson, but to add dimension and context to the widely accepted narrative about him. The documentary also includes the perspective of a forensic psychologist who analyzes\u00a0Manson\u2019s tapes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that I have sympathy for\u00a0Manson,\u201d Mintz says, \u201cbut by humanizing him, we understand a lot more of what led to these tragic events, and we learned a lot more about ourselves.\u201d",
      "Read on to learn more about Charles\u00a0Manson, and what is revealed in \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson.\u201d",
      "Who was Charles Manson?",
      "Charles\u00a0Manson\u00a0was a cult leader who was convicted in murder in 1971\u00a0after his\u00a0supporters committed a series of violent murders under his influence.",
      "Manson\u2019s followers, many of whom were teenage girls drawn to communal living and other 1960s counterculture ideals, have opened up about how he exerted power over them.",
      "\u201cHe was always needing to be in control, and that came from having all control taken from him at a very young age, and being helpless,\u201d former follower Catherine Share says in the documentary.",
      "Share was not involved in the Tate-LaBianca murders but served five years for involvement in a\u00a0Manson\u00a0Family robbery and later served a sentence for participating in a credit card scheme,\u00a0per AP.",
      "\u201cAnd a man does not want to be helpless, and he\u2019ll do anything not to feel that way again. He tried love for a while. He said, \u2018Oh, that worked.\u2019 And he said, \u2018But fear is stronger.\u2019\u201d",
      "Manson\u00a0had a troubled upbringing full of trauma and abandonment, per\u00a0NBC News, and he had frequent run-ins with the law from a young age. By the time he was 32 and released from a 10-year prison term in 1967, he had spent half his life in prison, Vincent Bugliosi \u2014 a true crime author and the prosecutor at\u00a0Manson\u2019s trial for the Tate-LaBianca Murder \u2014 estimates in \u201cHelter Skelter,\u201d a definitive book about\u00a0Manson. After his release, he moved to San Francisco and began attracting members of a group he called the Family. Members of the Family would go on to commit murders at\u00a0Manson\u2019s ordering.",
      "In April 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, as well as one count of conspiracy to commit murder, for the deaths of seven people in what is often referred to as the Tate-LaBianca murders.",
      "Members of\u00a0Manson\u2019s followers killed five people during the Tate murders, which took place on Aug. 9, 1969.",
      "Actor Sharon Tate Polanski, the wife of director Roman Polanski, was one of the people killed during a gathering at her home. She had been 8 months pregnant. Also murdered were hair stylist Jay Sebring, Folger coffee heiress Abigail Folger and her boyfriend, writer Wojciech Frykowski and Steven Parent, who was visiting the caretaker of the Polanskis\u2019 guest house.",
      "The next day on Aug. 10,\u00a0Manson\u2019s followers murdered two more people, Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary LaBianca, at their home in Los Angeles, per the Associated Press.",
      "While\u00a0Manson\u00a0was not physically present for any of these murders, prosecutors argued he held responsibility for the killings because he had known about the planned violence and had been closely involved in directing his followers to commit murder.",
      "\u201cThe prosecution\u2019s thesis was that\u00a0Manson\u00a0was vicariously liable for the acts of all the co-indictees,\u201d according to a\u00a01976 opinion\u00a0issued in the Court of Appeals of California. \u201cIf the jury believed\u00a0Manson\u00a0to be a conspirator, aider or abettor he was culpable for all of the homicides regardless of who held the knife.\u201d",
      "Manson\u00a0spoke to his role in the murders in the documentary. \u201cI never said I was innocent. I said I didn\u2019t break the law,\u201d he said.",
      "In March 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0and three of his followers, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, were sentenced to death for their roles in the Tate-LaBianca killings,\u00a0NBC News reported in his obit. Van Houten was charged in conspiracy for all the killings but for murder only in the LaBianca killings. Tex Watson was also sentenced to death later that year, the\u00a0New York Times reported\u00a0in 1971.",
      "In December 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0received two further first-degree murder convictions for the July 1969 death of musician Gary Hinman, per\u00a0NBC News, and the August 1969 death of stuntman and actor Donald Shea, per\u00a0NBC News.",
      "Bobby Beausoleil was convicted in the killing of Hinman in 1970 and remains in prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "In 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0devotee Bruce Davis was convicted in the killing of Hinman and Shea, and he remains in prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Steve Grogan was also convicted in Shea\u2019s killing and was released on parole in 1985 after revealing the location of Shea\u2019s body, per\u00a0the L.A. Times.",
      "The following year,\u00a0Manson\u00a0and his followers\u2019 sentences were commuted to life in prison after California abolished the death penalty in 1972.",
      "Manson\u00a0remained incarcerated for the rest of his life. He died at 83 from natural causes on Nov. 19, 2017, at a hospital in Kern County, California, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "Atkins, convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, died in prison of cancer in 2009,\u00a0NBC News reported. Watson and Krenwinkel, both convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, remain in prison, per the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Van Houten, convicted on two counts of first-degree murder, was freed on parole in 2023,\u00a0NBC News reported.",
      "What is revealed in the Peacock documentary about\u00a0Manson?",
      "The \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson\u201d docuseries features never-before-heard audio recordings of\u00a0Manson\u00a0discussing his childhood, his followers and his criminal convictions.",
      "In one recording,\u00a0Manson\u00a0claims that he murdered multiple people in Mexico.",
      "\u201cSee, there\u2019s a whole part of my life that nobody knows about,\u201d he tells Jones in the tape. \u201cI lived in Mexico for a while. I went to Acapulco, stole some cars. I just got involved in stuff over my head, man \u2026 got involved in a couple of killings. I left my .357 Magnum in Mexico City, and I left some dead people on the beach.\u201d",
      "He also argues that he was not responsible for the murders his followers committed and accuses the media of twisting his story.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the media. The media that starts selling that. They didn\u2019t want to hear the truth. They wanted that hippie cult leader thing, man,\u201d he says in one recording. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give a f--- whether I did it or whether I didn\u2019t do it. They wanted that vicarious thrill.\u201d",
      "Jones says in the documentary that he resonated with\u00a0Manson\u2019s difficult childhood experiences and describes building up a trusting relationship with\u00a0Manson\u00a0over the years.",
      "\u201cHe found somebody he could be vulnerable to. I think that\u2019s why Charlie gave me a lot of what we have on these tapes. And I think the longer I spent getting to know him, slowly that mask began to peel off,\u201d he says.",
      "Director Billie Mintz says it\u2019s possible that\u00a0Manson\u00a0was lying at times on the tapes and attempting to manipulate Jones.",
      "\u201cI think that for sure,\u00a0Manson\u00a0wanted (Jones) to like him, and (Jones) wanted to like\u00a0Manson,\u201d Mintz says. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s manipulation, but from listening to these stories, (Manson) didn\u2019t have any reason to. He didn\u2019t want to get out of prison. He wasn\u2019t trying to exonerate himself. He literally says, \u2018I\u2019m a bad guy. I should be in prison, but I shouldn\u2019t be in prison for this.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mintz says the documentary places the tapes in context by interviewing a wide range of\u00a0Manson\u00a0experts and former followers to create \u201cdiscourse where there was no discourse before.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t say we know the truth, but maybe we give you a more nuanced, closer version of the story to the truth than you might\u2019ve had before,\u201d he says.",
      "\u200b\u200bThe documentary features interviews with multiple former members of the Family, including Dianne Lake, who was 14 when she met\u00a0Manson.\u00a0She wrote in her memoir \u201cMember of the Family\u201d\u00a0that\u00a0she did not participate in the Tate-LaBianca murders, and in fact testified against\u00a0Manson\u00a0and other members of the Family during the murder trial.",
      "Lake, who was known by the nickname \u201cSnake\u201d in the Family, describes how\u00a0Manson\u00a0allegedly treated his female followers.",
      "\u201cHe definitely used us and he definitely abused us,\u201d she says. \u201cI got hit and beat and raped, once, and I think the other girls probably did, too, but they kept it a secret.\u201d",
      "Share, another former\u00a0Manson\u00a0associate, recalls\u00a0Manson\u00a0turning \u201cabsolutely dark and electrified and menacing.\u201d",
      "The documentary also features interviews with\u00a0Manson\u2019s former cellmate and family members of the Family\u2019s victims, as well as interviews with an investigative reporter, a forensic psychologist and a former FBI special agent and criminologist.",
      "Near the end of the documentary, Jones defends his relationship with\u00a0Manson.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a fanboy. I\u2019m a f------ human being with a heart who happened to befriend somebody that I didn\u2019t expect to,\u201d he says.",

      "The Kremlin said Friday that its attack using a new ballistic missile was a warning to Ukraine's \"reckless\" Western allies, the culmination of a week of escalating threats from President Vladimir Putin.",
      "The United States and its European partners vowed not to be deterred in their support for Kyiv despite Moscow\u2019s deployment of the new weapon, which carried multiple warheads.",
      "As new details also emerged about the deepening alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued his own nuclear threat to his southern U.S.-backed neighbor and accused Washington of fueling tensions.",
      "The latest round of saber rattling from Putin and Kim has come during a week in which the war in Ukraine passed 1,000 days and with Washington preparing for a change in leadership.",
      "Still, Western officials and analysts have sought to play down what they said was a clear effort to intimidate Kyiv and its backers.",
      "In a televised address Thursday, Putin said he had ordered the strike with a new intermediate-range ballistic missile in response to Ukraine's use of long-range Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia for the first time.",
      "Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Friday that the message sent by this should be clear.",
      "\"Reckless actions by the West which supply missiles to Ukraine and later take part in strikes against Russia can\u2019t be left without a Russian response,\" Peskov told a daily news briefing. \"Russia has shown its capabilities and the nature of our future possible responses is also rather clear.\"",
      "The U.S. said the \u201cOreshnik\u201d \u2014 or \"Hazel tree\" \u2014 was a new, experimental type of missile based on the design of the existing RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile.",
      "Kyiv initially claimed that Russia had fired an ICBM. It said Friday that the missile flew for 15 minutes and reached a maximum speed of beyond Mach 11. \u201cThe missile was equipped with six warheads, each carrying six submunitions,\u201d Kyiv\u2019s main intelligence directorate said.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried the use of the new missile on the eastern city of Dnipro as a \"severe escalation in the scale and brutality of this war\" in his nightly address Thursday. He said it was a second major step toward escalation following the Kremlin's deployment of thousands of North Korean troops.",
      "On Friday Kim warned that due to U.S. hostility his region had never faced a greater risk of \"the most destructive thermonuclear war,\" according to the KCNA state news agency.",
      "And a top official in U.S. ally South Korea shone new light on what Kim may be getting out of his Putin partnership. Russia has supplied air defense missiles and equipment to North Korea in exchange for the thousands of troops, National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik said in an interview on local TV.",
      "The Kim-Putin alliance was likely one factor behind the decision of Washington and its allies to relax restrictions on Kyiv. And NATO, the Western military alliance bracing for a second Donald Trump presidency, said it would not stop that support in the face of Putin's threats.",
      "\u201cDeploying this capability will neither change the course of the conflict nor deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine,\u201d said spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah,",

      "Ukraine's use of the long-range Western weapons to strike Russian soil followed months of pleading during which it came under intensifying Russian attacks in the air and on the battlefield.",

Were Trump to follow through on his vow to impose tariffs on imports on Europe as well as from China, they would likely deviate further.",

      "One senior European diplomat said that while China has never explicitly condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it has helped in other ways to rein in Moscow.",
      "\u201cThey have been firm with Russia about not using nuclear weapons with Ukraine,\u201d the diplomat said.",
      "China is also concerned about the growing security ties between Russia and North Korea after the two countries signed a comprehensive strategic partnership in June, the diplomat added.",
      "The U.S. and others say that the secretive communist state\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un, has sent thousands of troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine in exchange for technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "\u201cChina doesn\u2019t want a more capable North Korean military,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cSo I would expect this to be one of those issues that we could talk to the Chinese about seriously.\u201d",
      "Another European diplomat said Moscow will be the wild card in international efforts to end the Ukraine war.",
      "\u201cYou can see the need for it from the Ukrainians, you can see the Europeans saying we aren\u2019t going to finance this huge and endless fight,\u201d they said. \u201cIt\u2019s trickier to understand what\u2019s in it for Putin.\u201d",
      "Though Moscow has signaled that it is open to talks, Russia\u2019s upper hand on the battlefield may convince Putin that he can achieve more from fighting than settling. But the cost is wearing on European governments, which have provided Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in military and other assistance.",

      "The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, over alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes.",
      "The ICC accused Netanyahu and Gallant of a string of human rights abuses in the Gaza Strip, where local health officials said the death toll from the Israeli military's yearlong assault on the Palestinian enclave had now passed 44,000.",
      "Israel responded furiously to the warrants, with Netanyahu's office branding the decision \"antisemitic,\" rejecting the charges as \"absurd and false\" and condemning the ICC as a \"biased and discriminatory political body.\"",
      "Hamas welcomed the warrants as an \"important step towards justice\" but senior political official Basem Naim said the court's decision \"remains limited and symbolic if it is not supported by all means by all countries around the world to implement it.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the National Security Council said that the U.S. \u201cfundamentally rejects the Court\u2019s decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials\" and that it was \"deeply concerned by the prosecutor\u2019s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.\"",
      "Both Israel and the U.S. do not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC, which has no police to enforce its warrants. But the warrants do put the Israeli officials at risk of arrest in other countries, including much of Europe.",
      "In its announcement Thursday the ICC rejected challenges from Israel to its jurisdiction. It said the warrants issued for Netanyahu and Gallant were related to \"crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October, 2023 until at least 20 May, 2024,\" including \"the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.\"",
      "It also said reasonable grounds were found to believe they bore criminal responsibility as \"civilian superiors\" for the war crime of \"intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population.\"",
      "Netanyahu and Gallant were accused of having \"intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity.\"",
      "The ICC said it further found that their conduct had hampered the ability of humanitarian organizations to provide food and other essential items to those in desperate need in the enclave.",

    "summary": "Israeli prosecutors have accused one of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s aides of illegally leaking classified intelligence in an attempt to blunt criticism.",
    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Israeli prosecutors have accused one of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s aides of illegally leaking classified intelligence in an attempt to blunt widespread criticism of the prime minister\u2019s handling of the Gaza hostage crisis.",
      "The allegations, detailed in newly released court filings, are part of a sprawling criminal probe that has rocked Israel\u2019s government and led to the aide\u2019s arrest and detention in prison. Four military personnel have also been arrested in connection with the case.",
      "Investigators discovered that a low-level Israeli soldier had illegally removed Hamas documents from a military database and passed them to Eli Feldstein, a communications consultant working for Netanyahu, prosecutors said.",
      "Feldstein, 32, then tried to get the documents published in the media with the goal of showing that the hostage families' protests were playing into Hamas\u2019 hands, according to the prosecutors' filings, which were published Sunday.",
      "Feldstein acted \u201cwith the intention of influencing public opinion in Israel on the negotiations regarding the hostages and in particular the issue of the contribution of the demonstrations to the strengthening of Hamas,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "Their filings came after Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff was questioned as part of a separate investigation into allegations that he tried to tamper with official phone logs from the day of Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack, a police official told NBC News.",
      "Netanyahu has not been personally accused of wrongdoing in either case and his office denies the allegations, saying it is being targeted by politically motivated security officials attempting to undermine the government.",
      "The leak investigation, referred to in Israeli media as \u201cBibiLeaks,\u201d from the prime minister\u2019s nickname \u201cBibi,\u201d was launched after the German tabloid Bild published an article in early September based on leaked Hamas documents.",
      "The newspaper claimed it had obtained documents from the personal computer of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, who was subsequently killed by Israeli forces in October.",
      "The documents, according to the Bild report, showed Hamas was not interested in a quick cease-fire and believed that the protests by hostage families would weaken Israel\u2019s negotiating position.",
      "The story was published at a time of intense public anger toward Netanyahu in Israel following the murder of six hostages, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg Polin, by Hamas in late August.",
      "Days after it was published, Netanyahu cited the article as evidence of Hamas\u2019 intent \u201cto use psychological warfare on the hostage families\u201d and to put pressure on the Israeli government.",
      "But inside the Israeli military, the story\u2019s publication set off alarm bells. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that the document cited by Bild was several months old and was not written by Sinwar, but instead a mid-level Hamas operative.",
      "Military leaders ordered an investigation into the leak of the document \u2014 which was classified as \u201ctop secret\u201d \u2014 and called in the police and the Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic security agency.",
      "In Sunday\u2019s filings, prosecutors said that when Israeli media declined to publish the document because of military censorship rules, Feldstein went around the domestic censor by giving the document to the Bild newspaper in Germany. A Bild spokesman told NBC News that the newspaper does not comment on its sourcing.",
      "Feldstein was arrested in late October. The Israeli soldier accused of leaking the document to him has also been arrested, along with three other military personnel, prosecutors said.",
      "On Monday, Israeli prison authorities said Feldstein had been placed on suicide watch.",
      "Asked to comment on Sunday\u2019s court filings, Netanyahu's office referred NBC News to a statement from Nov. 12 that said police had invoked special powers reserved for national security cases to hold Feldstein in isolation and deny him access to a lawyer.",
      "\u201cIt hurts us very much that the lives of young people are being destroyed with idle claims to harm the Right-wing government,\u201d his office said. \u201cIn a democratic country people are not arrested because of a leak for 20 days in the basements \u2014 while preventing a meeting with a lawyer for many days \u2014 just to extract from them false statements against the Prime Minister.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu has a history of railing against Israeli law enforcement. In 2019, he became the first sitting prime minister in the country\u2019s history to be charged with a crime.",
      "He denies the litany of bribery, fraud and breach of trust allegations and has said the prosecution is politically motivated. His lawyers have repeatedly tried to delay trial proceedings, citing his wartime leadership responsibilities.",
      "The Hostage Family Forum said in a statement Monday that it was \u201cappalled by the ongoing efforts of individuals close to the prime minister to sabotage a potential hostage deal.\u201d",
      "The advocacy group, which represents hostages and their families has repeatedly\u00a0 criticized Netanyahu and his government over the negotiations to free those taken captive by Hamas during the Oct. 7 terror attacks. Around 100 people remain in captivity, although around a third are believed to be dead.",
      "Police are also investigating allegations against Tzachi Braverman, Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff. Braverman was questioned for several hours last week but has not been arrested or charged, according to an Israeli police official briefed on the investigation.",
      "Police are looking into claims that Braverman falsified phone records from the morning of Oct. 7, the official said. The alleged alterations appear intended to make it look like Netanyahu sprung into action more quickly than he did.",
      "Braverman allegedly asked an aide to change phone records to make it look like a conversation that was logged as having occurred at 6.40 a.m. instead took place 11 minutes earlier, at 6.29 a.m., the official said. Braverman then changed the log himself in a handwritten note.",
      "The police investigation is completed and prosecutors will now make a decision on whether any charges are merited.",
      "Jack Chen, an attorney for Braverman, told NBC News that the situation was the result of a misunderstanding about the order of the phone calls during the chaotic early hours of the Hamas attack. He said Braverman had explained the misunderstanding to police, and they released him without any restrictive conditions.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s office would not comment specifically on Braverman\u2019s questioning but pointed to an earlier statement made by the prime minister on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cFor the past few days, my office has been under a wild and unrestrained attack,\u201d Netanyahu said at the time. \u201cThe goal is not to protect the security of the state. The goal is to promote an agenda of weakness and concessions during the war.\u201d"

      "On Monday, a crowd of people waited outside a shuttered bakery in the central city of Deir al-Balah. A woman who had been displaced from Gaza City, identifying herself as Umm Shadi, said the price of flour had climbed to 400 shekels (over $100) a bag, if it can even be found.",
      "Nora Muhanna, another woman displaced from Gaza City, said she was leaving empty-handed after waiting five hours for a bag of bread for her children. \u201cFrom the beginning, there are no goods, and even if they are available, there is no money,\u201d she said.",
      "The United Nations said armed men stole food and other aid from 98 trucks over the weekend, the largest single incident of its kind since the start of the war. It did not say who was behind the theft.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the convoy of 109 trucks was instructed by the Israeli military to take an \u201calternative, unfamiliar route\u201d after the aid was brought in through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and that the trucks were stolen near the crossing itself.",
      "Israel has long accused Hamas of stealing aid, allegations denied by the militant group.",
      "Al-Aqsa TV, a media outlet operated by the militants, said Hamas-run security forces in Gaza had launched an operation against looters, killing 20 of them.",
      "Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official based in Qatar, said the looters were young men from Bedouin tribes in the area, emphasizing that they do not necessarily represent the tribes. He said they operate east of Rafah near Israeli military positions.",
      "The Hamas-run government had a police force of tens of thousands that maintained a high degree of public security before the war, but they have vanished from the streets in many areas after being targeted by Israeli strikes. Hamas says it has taken measures to prevent both looting and price-gouging in local markets.",
      "Hamas ignited the war in Gaza when its fighters stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their toll. The war has left much of the territory in ruins and forced around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million to flee, often multiple times."

      "Crucially for Ukraine, the decision comes after months of pleading and just as Russia has intensified a wave of aerial attacks that forced widespread blackouts and killed more than a dozen people, according to local officials.",
      "\"It is excellent news for us and a significant move,\" Kyiv resident  Maryna Vlasenko, 39, told NBC News.",
      "She also bemoaned the lengthy process and the continued limits on Ukraine's use of the long-range weapons, however. \u201cSometimes I just have a feeling that we are receiving the bare minimum in order not to die, and with such an attitude, Ukraine will bleed to death,\u201d  Vlasenko said in an interview Monday.",
      "\u201cBut it is better to have such a decision now than not having it at all.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has for months rebuffed Kyiv's pleas to lift the restrictions on its usage of the Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, in the Kursk border region of Russia.

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s\u00a0King Richard III\u00a0was immortalized with the Shakespeare line \u201cA horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.\u201d",
      "Now state-of-the-art technology has revealed what it may have sounded like if he did indeed utter those words just before his death in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth.",
      "Unlike the upper-class tones of his modern successors, the re-created king's voice has a more common and earthy twang as he recites a medieval manuscript in a display that opened Sunday at the Theatre Royal in the U.K\u2019s ancient city of York.",
      "The project, which is 10 years in the making, was the brainchild of British vocal coach Yvonne Morley-Chisholm, who approached a team based at Face Lab at the U.K.'s Liverpool John Moores University and has since enlisted the help of leading specialists across a number of fields to create the avatar.",
      "\u201cThat involved dentistry, physiotherapy, the craniofacial reconstruction, the original pronunciation, forensic psychology, all sorts,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview Monday, adding that it took them \u201c10 long years\u201d to put \u201cthe pieces together in the puzzle, because we wanted this to be based on evidence.\u201d",
      "It is the latest episode in the history of the doomed monarch, who was king of England for just two years from 1483 until his death two years later at age 32.",
      "Just over 100 years later in 1592, Shakespeare vilified him as a hunchback, giving him the famous cry of despair about a horse as his last line. His body was later discovered beneath a parking lot in 2012.",
      "To help work out how Richard and his contemporaries might have sounded, Morley-Chisholm enlisted the help of professor David Crystal, a leading linguist and expert in 15th-century pronunciation.",
      "\u201cNothing like this has ever happened before,\u201d Crystal said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cThis is as close as we can get. It\u2019s 90% or so accuracy.\u201d",
      "Crystal added that he created \u201cthe sound system\u201d of the era by looking at the spelling of the words, the rhymes that were around in the poetry of the time and what Richard\u2019s contemporaries wrote about the spelling and pronunciation of English.",
      "The result, he said, \u201cis not like any modern accent at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has distinctive echoes of some modern accents, and the\u00a0predominant echo was definitely Yorkshire,\u201d he said, referring to the county in northern England known for its distinctive dialect.",
      "Richard made global headlines 12 years ago when his skeletal remains were found by British historian Philippa Langley in a parking lot in Leicester, a city around 100 miles north of the U.K.'s capital, London.",
      "CT scans of the skeleton have since helped scientists reconstruct his face and body, revealing that while he did have curvature of the spine, he was not the hunchback that Shakespeare portrayed.",
      "\u201cThe skeleton has ruled out all the myths,\u201d Morley-Chisholm said. \u201cHe did not have a limp, a withered arm, a hunchback. He was able to speak in public.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout the discovery of his mortal remains, this project would not have been possible,\u201d she added.",
      "The skeleton also helped Morley-Chisholm find the actor that would eventually play the king\u2019s avatar.",
      "After 10 years of searching, she said she chose British actor Thomas Dennis because his face was such a good physical match. She then coached Dennis into the king\u2019s accent and personality.",
      "Langley was also involved in the project from the start, advising on Richard's character and personality by studying letters, diaries and public descriptions of the king, and looking at how that might affect the way he speaks.",
      "\u201cWhat we could then get was a probability, almost verging on certainty, of the recognized character of Richard III during his lifetime,\u201d she said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cYou are seeing the most accurate portrayal of Richard III.\u201d",
      "Mathew Morris, a project officer at the University of Leicester's Archaeological Services, who was involved in the dig 12 years ago but not part of the avatar project, said the project was \u201ca brilliant step.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is only so much you can learn from a skeleton,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cIt is creating a resource that is allowing people to then explore less tangible facets of his life in new and innovative ways. You just don\u2019t know what it\u2019s then going to inspire.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Crystal said he was already imagining other famous faces and voices from the past being re-created.",
      "\u201cI think when people see it and hear it, then, you know, forget Richard.\u00a0Who else can we do?\u201d he said."

      "The\u00a0IAEA\u00a0and\u00a0Iran\u00a0have long been locked in standoffs on a\u00a0range of issues\u00a0including\u00a0Tehran\u2019s failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites, its barring last year of most of the agency\u2019s top uranium-enrichment experts on the\u00a0Iran\u00a0inspection team, and its refusal to expand\u00a0IAEA\u00a0monitoring.",
      "The\u00a0resolution\u00a0seen by Reuters repeated wording from a November 2022\u00a0resolution\u00a0that it was \u201cessential and urgent\u201d for\u00a0Iran\u00a0to explain the uranium traces and let the\u00a0IAEA\u00a0take samples as necessary. The\u00a0resolution\u00a0in June of this year did the same.",

      "With\u00a0Trump\u00a0due to return to office in January and\u00a0Iran\u00a0having taken its uranium enrichment far beyond the deal\u2019s limits, it is far from clear whether Trump would back negotiations aimed at setting new limits before the 2015 deal\u2019s ones are lifted on \u201ctermination day\u201d in October of next year.",
      "If no new limits are agreed before then, the report could be used to strengthen the case for so-called \u201csnapback\u201d, a process under the 2015 deal where the issue is sent to the U.N. Security Council and sanctions lifted under the deal can be re-imposed.",
      "Last week\u00a0IAEA\u00a0chief Rafael Grossi\u00a0visited\u00a0Tehran, hoping to convince new\u00a0Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as relatively moderate, to improve\u00a0Iran\u2019s cooperation with the agency.",

      "Iran\u00a0already has enough material enriched to that level, close to the roughly 90% purity that is weapons grade, for four nuclear weapons if enriched further, according to an\u00a0IAEA\u00a0yardstick. It has enough material enriched to lower levels for more bombs, but\u00a0Iran\u00a0denies seeking nuclear weapons.",
      "Grossi said on Wednesday he had asked\u00a0Iran\u00a0to cap that stock of 60% material and\u00a0Iran\u00a0had accepted his request.",

    "summary": "Russia did not fire an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) at Ukraine on Thursday, a U.S. official and a military officer with knowledge of the matter told NBC News, disputing a claim by Kyiv.",
    "story": [
      "In a stark warning to Western countries arming Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday he ordered an attack on Ukraine with a new intermediate-range ballistic missile in response to Ukraine\u2019s firing U.S.- and British-supplied longer-range weapons to hit targets inside Russia.",
      "Putin said in a televised address that the strike was a \u201ctest\u201d of a new weapon and that Russia reserved the right to strike at countries that provide weapons to Ukraine for attacks on Russian territory.",
      "Deputy Defense Department press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters that the missile was a new, experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile based on the design of the RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile.",
      "\u201cThis was a new type of lethal capability that was deployed on the battlefield, so that was certainly of concern,\u201d Singh said.",
      "Russia notified U.S. officials about the imminent attack, using nuclear risk reduction communication channels, she said. The missile can carry a conventional or a nuclear warhead.",
      "In his speech, Putin warned countries sending weapons to Ukraine that Russia could target them, too.",
      "\u201cWe believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of the countries that allow to use their weapons against our facilities,\u201d Putin said, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Russia has plenty of other less-sophisticated weapons that could have hit targets in eastern Ukraine without drawing on its strategic arsenal. By using an intermediate-range missile, a weapon able to strike far beyond Ukraine and can carry a nuclear warhead,\u00a0Moscow was sending a warning signal to Ukraine, Washington and other NATO states, analysts said.",
      "Intermediate-range ballistic missiles have a range of less than 3,500 miles. Intercontinental ballistic missiles, which have a larger range of over 3,500 miles, were developed during the Cold War by both the Soviet Union and the U.S. as part of each side\u2019s nuclear arsenal.",
      "Biden administration officials briefed Ukraine and other allies in recent days about Russia\u2019s possibly using the new weapon to help them prepare, according to a U.S. official.",
      "But the U.S. official said Russia would not be able to bully Ukraine, the U.S. or other countries helping Kyiv fend off invading Russian forces.",
      "\u201cRussia may be seeking to use this capability to try to intimidate Ukraine and its supporters or generate attention in the information space, but it will not be a game changer in this conflict,\u201d the U.S. official said.",
      "The administration will continue to send air defense systems, ammunition and other military hardware to Ukraine through the end of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, officials said.",
      "The news comes as Ukrainian forces used their first long-range U.S. and British missiles to strike Russian soil after Washington and its allies lifted restrictions on Kyiv \u2014 a move that Moscow had long warned would be met with a significant response.",
      "Putin this week lowered the bar for his country\u2019s use of a nuclear weapon, a move that Western officials dismissed as the latest instance of Russian saber rattling in the war, which has lasted more than 1,000 days.",
      "'Using Ukraine as a training ground'",
      "Earlier Thursday, Ukraine accused Moscow of launching an ICBM at the eastern city of Dnipro in an overnight attack, which would have been the first recorded use of an ICBM in\u00a0an active conflict\u00a0and the latest escalation by the Kremlin.",
      "But a U.S. official disputed that account, and then Putin himself came out and identified the weapon as an intermediate-range ballistic missile.",
      "Serhii Lysak, the head of the Dnipro regional authority, said on Telegram that two people were injured. Meanwhile, 15 people were injured in a separate attack on the eastern city of Kryvyi Rih, local authorities said.",
      "Putin on Tuesday formally revised his country\u2019s nuclear doctrine \u2014 a document detailing the conditions under which Moscow would consider using nuclear weapons \u2014 with the change justifying a nuclear strike by Russia if it were attacked by a nonnuclear country that was supported by a nuclear state.",
      "Ultimately, analysts say, the likelihood of the Kremlin\u2019s opting to use nuclear weapons in its war with Ukraine is very slim \u2014 particularly now, when its military is advancing and its opponent is worn down.",
      "Russian forces have seized the momentum in recent months and eked out a succession of territorial gains, particularly on the eastern front lines. They have also been bolstered by thousands of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's troops in their quest to retake occupied land in Russia's Kursk border region.",
      "The West\u2019s relaxing restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range weapons may boost Kyiv, but it is likely do little to transform the battlefield situation, analysts said, despite the dire nature of the Kremlin's rhetorical reaction.",
      "\u201cAt this stage in the war, the risk of Russian nuclear use is lower than before. Political and battlefield developments favor Russia, so there is little to gain by escalating the conflict to the nuclear level,\u201d said Alexander Bollfrass, head of strategy, technology and arms control at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank.",
      "In addition to the unclear military benefits of deploying those weapons, there would also be diplomatic drawbacks.",
      "\u201cNuclear weapons use would risk alienating China and other non-Western countries whose support or neutrality is key to maintaining the Russian war economy,\u201d Bollfrass said in an email Wednesday. \u201cIt would also get the relationship with the incoming Trump administration off to a very dangerous start.\u201d"

      "All travel between the U.S. and Haiti, including much-needed aid operations, continues to be affected by a 30-day ban imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration last week, after gunfire struck a Spirit Airlines plane as it attempted to land in Port-au-Prince.",
      "Linda Thelemaque regularly travels to the southern city of Les Cayes in her role as chief program officer of Hope for Haiti, a nonprofit organization that helps combat poverty. She said the inability to fly in supplies has created a logistical nightmare in the Caribbean nation, where gang violence already makes ground transportation between cities nearly impossible.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been dealing with severe challenges due to gang violence, which has essentially cut off ground transportation,\u201d Thelemaque said. \u201cNow, with flights canceled, we\u2019re facing increased costs and delays in delivering essential supplies, including $10 million worth of medication.\u201d",
      "Thelemaque had planned to travel to Haiti for work on Nov. 19, but her flight was canceled. \u201cAlthough the FAA says the ban will lift on Dec. 12, most airlines are rescheduling flights for February,\u201d she said.",
      "The FAA ban has also complicated humanitarian aid efforts. \u201cWe rely on Sunrise Airways to transport supplies from Port-au-Prince to the south, but with flights grounded, we\u2019re forced to explore expensive alternatives, like chartering flights or seeking humanitarian exemptions,\u201d she said.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, American Airlines said it had suspended its daily flights between Miami and Port-au-Prince until Feb. 12, 2025, after a separate incident involving flight 819 from Port-au-Prince to Miami last week. While the flight landed safely in Miami with no reported injuries, a post-flight inspection revealed that a bullet had struck the aircraft\u2019s exterior.",
      "Before the FAA\u2019s ban announcement, the U.S. State Department had issued an advisory to avoid traveling to Haiti due to \u201ckidnapping, crime, civil unrest, and limited health care.\u201d The department noted that airports and people traveling by car had become targets for violence.",
      "In March, escalating gang violence and unrest reached a boiling point as the Caribbean nation\u2019s government fell apart. Armed groups took over the streets, disrupting life for many residents across Port-au-Prince and driving up the cost of fuel and basic goods. \u201cPrices are being passed on to consumers, making daily survival increasingly unaffordable,\u201d Thelemaque said.",
      "Yolette Williams, CEO of the Haitian American Alliance of New York, said the country\u2019s ongoing crisis has taken an emotional toll on Haitians living in the United States.",
      "\u201cWe may be physically far from Haiti, but we remain deeply connected,\u201d she said. \u201cFamilies are consumed by the news of worsening violence and are mourning senseless killings.\u201d",
      "The flight ban is also disrupting long-standing holiday traditions in this mostly Catholic and Christian country. Jan. 1 also holds special significance beyond New Year\u2019s Day, as it is also Haitian Independence Day and celebrated with parades, fireworks and dancing.",
      "\u201cMany Haitians save their vacations for December to reconnect with loved ones,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNow, that opportunity has been taken away.\u201d",
      "Williams noted that the ban extends beyond Port-au-Prince to airports throughout the country, further isolating Haitians. \u201cEven during ongoing crises, people could travel to Cap-Ha\u00eftien or Les Cayes. Now the whole country feels shut down,\u201d she said.",
      "Another way to enter Haiti is by crossing through the Dominican Republic, with whom it shares the island. Haitian passport-holders with U.S. permanent residency often traveled through the DR but the country has closed its borders with Haiti due to the violence.",
      "\u201cEven if a flight diverts to the Dominican Republic, Haitian passport-holders are denied entry,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSome passengers have had to return to Europe or elsewhere.\u201d",
      "The U.N. reported that more than 20,000 people fled their homes in Port-au-Prince in a four-day span in November and settled in smaller cities. This has strained resources in cities like Les Cayes.",
      "\u201cThe influx of displaced residents is overwhelming clinics and creating mistrust between locals and newcomers,\u201d Thelemaque said.",
      "Williams emphasized the growing mental health crisis in Haiti, citing a recent survey by Haitian-led organizations. \u201cThe constant trauma of gang violence is taking a toll on people\u2019s emotional well-being,\u201d she said.",
      "Even those in less-affected areas remain under stress, she said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re in Cap-Ha\u00eftien or Les Cayes, you worry about being next,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe trauma is pervasive, and the travel ban only adds to that stress.\u201d",
      "Both Thelemaque and Williams agree that the FAA ban, while necessary for safety, underscores the urgent need to address Haiti\u2019s escalating crisis.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to adapt,\u201d Thelemaque said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s securing humanitarian exemptions or finding new supply routes, the people we serve rely on us.\u201d",
      "Williams called for continued advocacy. \u201cThe diaspora wants to help, but the barriers are immense,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must address not only the immediate needs but also the root causes of this violence.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A volcano near Iceland\u2019s capital erupted late Wednesday for the seventh time in a year, spewing fountains of lava and smoke, the country\u2019s meteorological office said, but there were no disruptions to air traffic or infrastructure.",
      "The eruption started with little warning at 11:14 p.m. local time Wednesday and created a fissure just under two miles long. The activity is estimated to be considerably smaller than the previous eruption in August, Iceland\u2019s meteorological office that monitors seismic activity said.",
      "Social media livestreams from the area showed glowing hot lava in bright yellow and orange shades shooting up into the night sky.",
      "The first signs of an eruption were recorded just 45 minutes before a massive ground fissure was opened by magma forcing its way through the earth\u2019s crust, Iceland\u2019s meteorological office said.",
      "Authorities had previously warned of volcanic activity as magma accumulated beneath the Reykjanes peninsula, some 20 miles southwest of the capital, Reykjavik, where the most recent eruption ended only on Sept. 6. However, there had been no noticeable increase in seismic activity in recent weeks, the meteorological office said.",
      "\u201cIn the big picture, this is a bit smaller than the last eruption, and the eruption that occurred in May,\u201d Magn\u00fas Tumi Gu\u00f0mundsson, a professor of geophysics who flew over the scene with the Civil Protection agency to monitor the event, told the national RUV broadcaster.",
      "The outbreaks on the Reykjanes peninsula, known as fissure eruptions, have not directly affected the capital city and do not cause significant dispersals of ash into the stratosphere, avoiding air traffic disruption.",
      "Reykjavik\u2019s Keflavik Airport said on its website that flights were unaffected and no crucial infrastructure was in danger, but the Blue Lagoon, a luxury geothermal spa resort, had shut down and evacuated its guests, RUV said.",
      "The nearby fishing town of\u00a0Grindav\u00edk, home to nearly 4,000 residents before an evacuation order in December last year, remains mostly deserted due to the periodic threat from lava flows.",
      "There was no indication that lava was flowing towards the town, but some 50 houses occupied by people who have returned were evacuated, the civil protection agency said in a statement.",
      "\u201cGrindav\u00edk is not in danger as it looks and it is unlikely that this crack will get any longer, although nothing can be ruled out,\u201d Magn\u00fas Tumi said.",
      "Iceland, with its 400,000 inhabitants, sits above a\u00a0volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic and averages one eruption every four to five years. The most disruptive in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted trans-Atlantic air travel for months.",
      "Lying dormant for 800 years, the geological systems in the area reactivated in 2021 and have since erupted at rising frequency, with the latest outbreak being\u00a0the sixth\u00a0so far in 2024.",
      "Experts have warned that Reykjanes is likely to experience repeated volcanic outbreaks for decades, possibly even centuries."
