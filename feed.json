      "Lisa Simpson once said during an episode of \u201cThe Simpsons:\u201d What could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football",
      "Lisa Simpson once said during an episode of \u201cThe Simpsons:\u201d What could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?",
      "On Monday night, the entire Simpsons universe gets to experience it in a way not many could have imagined.",
      "The prime-time matchup between the Cincinnati Bengals and Dallas Cowboys will also take place at Springfield\u2019s Atoms Stadium as part of \u201cThe Simpsons Funday Football\u201d alternate broadcast.",
      "The altcast will be streamed on ESPN+, Disney+, and NFL+ (on mobile devices). ESPN and ABC have the main broadcast, while ESPN2 will carry the final \u201cManningCast\u201d of the regular season.",
      "The replay will be available on Disney+ for 30 days. Globally, more than 145 countries will have access to either live or on replay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re such huge football fans, and the Simpsons audience and the football audience, I feel, are like the same audience of just American families and football. And the Simpsons are so much a part of the DNA of the American family and culture that for us to, like, mush them together in this crazy video game, it\u2019s so fun,\u201d said Matt Selman, executive producer of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d",
      "While the game is the focal point, the alternate broadcast, in some ways, will resemble a three-hour episode of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d It starts with Homer eating too many hot dogs and having a dream while watching football.",
      "Homer joins the Cowboys in the dream while Bart teams up with the Bengals. Lisa and Marge will be sideline reporters.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the beginning of the story, and the story continues through the entire game until Homer wakes up from his dream at the end of the game. It is like a complete story, and the NFL game will happen in between. It\u2019s just going to be an amazing presentation with tons of surprises,\u201d said Michael \u201cSpike\u201d Szykowny, ESPN\u2019s VP of edit and animation.",
      "This is the second year ESPN has done an alternate broadcast for an NFL game. It used the characters from \u201cToy Story\u201d for last year\u2019s Sunday morning game from London between the Atlanta Falcons and Jacksonville Jaguars.",
      "\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d has featured many sports-themed episodes during its 35 seasons. Even though \u201cHomer at the Bat\u201d remains the consensus favorite sports episode for many Simpsons fans, there have been football ones such as \u201cBart Star\u201d and \u201cLisa The Greek.\u201d There also was a Super Bowl-themed one after Fox\u2019s broadcast of Super Bowl 33 between Denver and Atlanta in 1999.",
      "Even though \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d remains a staple on Fox\u2019s prime-time schedule, it is part of the Disney family after their acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2019. All 35 seasons are on Disney+.",
      "The show\u2019s creators have worked with ESPN and the NFL to make sure the look and sound is definitely Simpsonsesque.",
      "The theme song is a mash-up of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d opening and \u201cMonday Night Football\u2019s\u201d iconic \u201cHeavy Action.\u201d",
      "There have also been pre-recorded skits and bits to use during the broadcast featuring Simpson\u2019s legendary voices Hank Azaria, Nancy Cartwright, Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, and Yeardley Smith.",
      "The telecast will be entirely animated, with the players\u2019 movements in sync with what is happening in real-time on the field. That is done through player-tracking data enabled by the NFL\u2019s Next Gen Stats system and Sony\u2019s Beyond Sports Technology.",
      "While Next Gen Stats tracks where players are on the field with a tracking chip in the shoulder pads, there is skeletal data tracking and limb tracking data \u2014 which uses 29 points per player \u2014 to get closer to the player\u2019s movements.",
      "The other data tracking will allow Beyond Sports and Disney to add special characters to the game. For example, there might be a play where Lisa catches the ball and goes 30 yards instead of Cincinnati\u2019s Tee Higgins.",
      "\u201cLisa is much smaller than the rest of the players. So, in real life, the ball would go over her head, but now, with data processing, we can take the ball and make it go exactly into her hands. So for the viewer, it still looks believable, and it all makes sense,\u201d said Beyond Sports co-founder Nicolaas Westerhof.",
      "The other major challenge is making \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d two-dimensional cartoon characters into 3-D simulations. Szykowny and his team worked to make that a reality over the past couple of months.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a big leap of faith for them to say, hey, we trust you to make our characters 3-D and work with it. Our ESPN creative studio team has done a wonderful job,\u201d Szykowny said.",
      "Lisa, Krusty, Nelson, Milhouse and Ralph will be with Bart and the Bengals; while Carl, Barney, Lenny and Moe join up with with Homer and the Cowboys.",
      "The broadcast will also feature ESPN personalities Stephen A. Smith, Peyton Manning and Eli Manning.",
      "ESPN\u2019s Drew Carter, Mina Kimes and Dan Orlovsky will call the game from Bristol, Connecticut, and also be animated. They will wear Meta Quest Pro headsets to experience the game from Springfield using VR technology.",
      "For Kimes, being part of the broadcast and being an animated Simpsons character is a dream come true. She is a massive fan of the show and has a framed photo of Lisa Simpson \u2014 who she said is a personal hero and icon \u2014 as part of her backdrop when she makes appearances on ESPN NFL shows from her home in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have any input, and I didn\u2019t see anything beforehand, so I wasn\u2019t sure if it would look like me, but it kind of does, which is very funny,\u201d said Kimes, who drew Simpsons characters when she was a kid. \u201cTo see the actual staff turn me into one was a dream.\u201d",
      "Even though the Bengals (4-8) and Cowboys (5-7) have struggled this season, Selman thinks both teams have personalities that appeal to \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d universe.",
      "\u201cWe were just so lucky also that the Cowboys are sort of like a Homer Simpson-type team, American team, and Mike McCarthy might be a Homer-type guy, one might imagine,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd then you have Joe Burrow on the other side who is a cool young, spiky-haired, blonde bad boy -- he\u2019s like Bart. And that fits our character archetypes so perfectly.",
      "\u201cIf Homer is mad at Bart and has a hot dog dream while watching \u2019Monday Night Football\u2019, and then it\u2019s basically McCarthy versus Burrow, Homer versus Bart, and that\u2019s the simple father versus son strangling \u2014 Homer strangling Bart dynamic that has been part of the show for 35 years. I don\u2019t know if that would have worked as well if it was like Titans versus Jacksonville. We would have found something. We would have made it work.\u201d",

      "SAN DIEGO -- When Aaron Pierre was cast as Mufasa, the weight of following in the late James Earl Jones' legendary footsteps was enough to rattle any actor. But instead of letting the pressure roar too loudly, he harnessed his nerves to breathe fresh life into his young lion character.",
      "\u201cI had a lot of nerves and I actually think those nerves served me because that is what the adolescent version of that lion is,\u201d Pierre said in an interview Friday at the San Diego Safari Park about his leading role in \u201cMufasa: The Lion King.\u201d He took the reins as the new voice of Mufasa after Jones played the iconic King Mufasa in both the 1994 and 2019 versions of Disney's \u201cThe Lion King.\u201d",

She was awesome.\u201d",

      "\u201cBut there\u2019s also the Broadway musical and there\u2019s also Beyonc\u00e9\u2018s album \u2018The Lion King: The Gift,' which I think expanded the musical vocabulary of what can be a \u2018Lion King\u2019 song. So I felt a lot of space to create because I felt like \u2018Lion King\u2019 is practically a genre of music and there was room to play and find new stuff within it.\u201d",
      "Miranda said his \u201csecret ingredient\u201d was Lebo M, who's known for his opening vocals on the classic melody \u201cCircle of Life.\u201d He said his lyrics were inspired by the script.",
      "\u201cHis harmonies, the choral arrangements he created for the Broadway musical and for the show, I think were so important to the success of the music of these movies,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cI think it was exciting for him to work on new songs.\u201d"

      "Online bidding, which opened last month, had stood at $1.55 million before live bidding began late Saturday afternoon.",
      "The sparkly red heels were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum\u2019s door and display case.",
      "Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota, wasn't publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023. He pleaded guilty in October 2023. He was in a wheelchair and on supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",
      "His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin, who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was attempting to pull off \u201cone last score\u201d after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence \u2014 a person who buys stolen goods \u2014 later told him the rubies were just glass, DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn't specify how.",
      "The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He's scheduled to go on trial in January and hasn't entered a plea, though his attorney has said he's not guilty.",
      "The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael Shaw, who had loaned them to the museum. They were one of several pairs that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to click her heels three times and repeat, \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home.\u201d",
      "As Rhys Thomas, author of \u201cThe Ruby Slippers of Oz,\u201d put it, the sequined shoes from the beloved 1939 musical have seen \u201cmore twists and turns than the Yellow Brick Road.\u201d",
      "Over 800 people had been tracking the slippers, and the company\u2019s webpage for the auction had hit nearly 43,000 page views by Thursday, said Robert Wilonsky, a vice president with the auction house.",
      "Among those bidding to bring the slippers home was the Judy Garland Museum, which posted on Facebook shortly after that it did not place the winning bid. The museum had campaigned for donations to supplement money raised by the city of Grand Rapids at its annual Judy Garland festival and the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to help the museum purchase the slippers.",
      "After the slippers sold, the auctioneer told bidders and spectators in the room and watching online that the previous record for a piece of entertainment memorabilia was $5.52 million, for the white dress Marilyn Monroe famously wore atop a windy subway grate.",
      "The auction also included other memorabilia from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d such as a hat worn by Margaret Hamilton, who played the original Wicked Witch of the West. That item went for $2.4 million, or a total final cost to the buyer of $2.93 million.",
      "\u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d story has gained new attention in recent weeks with the release of the movie \u201cWicked,\u201d an adaptation of the megahit Broadway musical, a prequel of sorts that reimagines the character of the Wicked Witch of the West.",

      "NEW YORK -- A prolonged and closely watched copyright case involving an online library's unauthorized offering of free e-books has ended after the defendant, Internet Archive, decided not to challenge an appeal's court's ruling against it.",
      "In September, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a Manhattan federal court's decision that found the Archive in violation of copyright law and granted a permanent injunction. The Archive had until this week to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but declined to do so.",

Salinger. The Archive had contended that its program of scanning and sharing books, \u201ccontrolled digital lending,\u201d was protected by fair use law.",
      "\u201cAfter five years of litigation, we are thrilled to see this important case rest with the decisive opinion of the Second Circuit, which leaves no room for arguments that \u2018controlled digital lending\u2019 is anything more than infringement,\" Maria A. Pallante, president and CEO of the Association of American Publishers, said in a statement.",
      "The Archive\u2019s director of library services, Chris Freeland, posted a brief statement on the Archive's web site saying that \u201cWhile we are deeply disappointed with the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion,\u201d they would \u201ccontinue to honor\u201d an agreement to \u201cremove books from lending at their member publishers\u2019 requests.\u201d"

      "A trial for Young Thug, whose given name is Jeffery Williams, and five others began in November 2023 after it took nearly 10 months to seat a jury. The rapper and three other defendants pleaded guilty in October. Young Thug was freed on probation with a variety of conditions, including an order to stay away from the Atlanta area for a decade.",
      "A jury on Tuesday found the two remaining defendants in the trial not guilty of racketeering, murder and gang-related charges, though one of them was convicted on a gun charge.",
      "Nine of the defendants, including the rapper Gunna, had accepted plea deals before the trial began, and prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case.",
      "That left a dozen defendants still facing charges after the trial. One pleaded guilty Wednesday after reaching a deal with prosecutors and prosecutors said the same day that they were dropping the charges against six others."

      "\u201cFlow\u201d is quite easily the best animated movie of the year and one of the most poetic ecological parables in recent memory, writes AP Film Writer Jake Coyle in his review",
      "Of all the post-apocalyptic landscapes we've been treated to over the years, none is as beautiful nor peaceful as that of \u201cFlow.\u201d",
      "In Gints Zilbalodis' wondrously shimmering animated fable, a solitary black cat, after escaping a cataclysmic flood, navigates a water world. What brought things to this point is never explained. We're left to look upon this strange, verdant and overgrown landscape through the amber eyes of our unnamed feline protagonist. Humans are completely absent, and it's part of this beguilingly meditative film to wonder not just about what role we played in the flood, but to ponder the grace of the animal life left to inherit the Earth.",
      "As much as I didn't have a wordless Latvian animated movie on my 2024 bingo card, \u201cFlow\u201d \u2014 an expected Oscar contender currently in theaters \u2014 is quite easily the best animated movie of the year and one of the most poetic ecological parables in recent memory. It's an all-audiences movies, and by that, I'm tempted to include not just young and old, but cats and dogs, too.",
      "When the waters rise, the cat encounters a friendly Labrador, a long-legged secretary bird, a dozing capybara and a bauble-hoarding ring-tailed lemur. Cute as they are, they aren't quite your typical animated animals. Part of the allure of \u201cFlow\u201d is seeing animal characters that would normally be anthropomorphized and voiced by celebrity actors \u2014 the lemur, in particularly, has until now been ruled by Sacha Baron Cohen's King Julian of \u201cMadagascar\" \u2014 move and sound authentically.",
      "Well, mostly. Circumstances bring these five together aboard a small sailboat, an ark sans Noah. And while \u201cFlow\u201d doesn't exactly go for realism \u2014 the secretary bird, for instance, proves an especially adept captain in steering the rudder \u2014 it is most decidedly drawn in closer harmony to the natural world than your average animation. Together they sail through mountain tops-turned-islands and an abandoned city with rivers for streets.",
      "That \u201cFlow\u201d is made with computer generated animation adds to its dreamy, curiously real surrealism. Zilbalodis created \u201cFlow\u201d with Blender, the free, open-source graphics software tool. His camera moves less with the prescribed, storyboarded form of traditional animation than as a nimble, roving perspective within a virtual world. That such a natural and sensory movie is made possible by cutting-edge technology is one reason why the dystopic world of \u201cFlow\u201d always feels more hopeful than it ought to.",
      "Another reason is the animals. Though they come from different species and have little means of communication, they together form an odd partnership. The cat is initially wary of each, but they slowly form an evident bond. Their survival hinges on their cooperation, which is occasionally threatened by the self-interest of others (there's a pack of less community-minded dogs) or the cat's own timid reluctance. Staying to face a problem or trust another animal, rather than scampering away, goes against its nature.",
      "In that way, these two- and four-legged creatures, digitally rendered in a human-less future, are both worthy heirs to the planet and furry figures of inspiration for today. Reflections run through \u201cFlow\u201d \u2014 in a mirror clutched by the lemur, in the water the cat peers into \u2014 but none more so than the image of ourselves gazing back at it.",
      "\u201cFlow,\u201d a Sideshow and Janus Films release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for peril and thematic elements. Running time: 84 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "The musical first premiered on Broadway in 1977 and was revived in 1997 and 2012. The 1977 original show won the Tony Award as best musical and ran for 2,300 performances, inspiring tours and revivals that never went out of style. It last played New York on Broadway in 2012-14.",

      "A new documentary chronicles Sudan's 2019 revolution and the period of time immediately after the ouster of military dictator Omar Al-Bashir",
      "MARRAKECH, Morocco -- In the early days of Sudan's 2019 revolution, Shajane Suliman brought sandwiches, coffee and mint tea to demonstrations in closed-off sections of Khartoum. But as hope made way for despair, she decided more than food was needed to nourish the movement.",
      "Public outcry had sprung up against Sudan's longtime military dictator and his mismanagement of the country's economy. Throughout months of demonstrations, hundreds were killed or injured by security forces suppressing protests.",
      "So Suliman donned a gas mask and headed to the streets carrying posters adorned with lines like, \u201cSouls cannot be killed, let alone ideas.\u201d",
      "A continent away, filmmaker Hind Meddeb was finishing \u201cParis Stalingrad,\u201d a documentary about the plight of refugees living in encampments near the edge of the French capital. Sudanese refugees encouraged her to go to Khartoum and film their nascent revolution.",
      "Such is the origin story of \u201cSudan, Remember Us,\" Meddeb's 75-minute documentary being shown in competition at the Marrakech Film Festival this week after screening at festivals in Venice and Toronto.",
      "Sudan, a predominantly Arab country on the edge of sub-Saharan Africa, descended into civil war in 2023, as fighting erupted between the military and a paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces that grew out of Darfur\u2019s notorious Janjaweed militia.",
      "Though estimates are difficult to come by, at least 24,000 people have been killed and millions displaced in a conflict that has largely been eclipsed in the world\u2019s attention by wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.",
      "To Suliman, who ended up as one of its protagonists, the documentary\u2019s purpose is similar to what she wrote on a poster five years ago: an effort to motivate a despairing public years after revolution failed to cement civilian rule.",
      "The revolution, she said, felt like \u201ca piece of heaven\u201d despite the violence, full of music, poetry and optimism about Sudan's future.",
      "\u201cEveryone forgot or lost hope,\u201d Suliman said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s different for us now than when the revolution started. We were together so it was easy. Now we need to change how we want to continue.\"",
      "\u201cSudan, Remember Us\u201d begins with a series of voice messages to Meddeb from April 2023, the month that civil war broke out. Activists describe their feelings of shock and disbelief about how what U.N. officials have called a \u201cforgotten war\" has ruined life and made their country unrecognizable.",
      "Mostly, it brings viewers to 2019, the year that Sudan's military ousted President Omar al-Bashir, paving the way for power-sharing and a short-lived transitional government led by generals and civilians.",
      "Largely shot on a handheld camera in a country that has at times blocked the internet, banned foreign news channels and arrested its own journalists, the movie is both a story of collective hope and a feat of reportage.",
      "Meddeb\u2019s observational approach and lingering on poems differs from gripping streaming-friendly protest documentaries such as Jehane Noujaim\u2019s \u201cThe Square\u201d (2013), Evgeny Afineevsky\u2019s \u201cWinter on Fire\u201d (2015) or Kiwi Chow\u2019s \u201cRevolution of Our Times\u201d (2021). She captures a revolution documentary\u2019s requisite images \u2014 the chaos and terror as well as solidarity and joy of demonstrators facing off against security forces.",
      "But the movie aims for a different kind of storytelling.",
      "A former France 24 journalist, Meddeb gravitated toward documentary for the breathing room it offered to let stories unfold in an unpredictable way, she said in an interview.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very spontaneous film. I was diving into what was happening and and filming what was inspiring me,\" she said at the Marrakech Film Festival.",

So she yelled and the police was just outside,\u201d Bychkov said, adding he quickly was released. \u201cWhat would they do with me in the end? It wasn\u2019t political. I was not an agent of foreign influence.\u201d",

I said, this is my Ulm, because that was the place that he started, and he laughed like crazy. He said, `You\u2019re so right. A few years of that and you\u2019re ready for anything.\u2018\u201d",

      "\u201cIt's definitely one of the things that every artist dreams about,\u2019\u2019 Jagde said. \u201cI think it is about the artist and meeting the moment at the right time. I think that is more of what it's about than necessarily where they are from.\u201d",
      "Jagde said singers are drawn to La Scala's \u201crich tradition.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery artist wants to not just perform there, but have great success there,\u201d Jagde said. \u201cThe public is known to be a very devoted fanship \u2014 and they can love you or they can hate you. You really want to be embraced by that audience specifically.\u201d",
      "So far, the reviews from La Scala\u2019s upper balconies of exacting opera fans have been positive on his previous two outings, Jagde said, adding that artists should accept all feedback.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our job as artists to embrace the fact that we are making people feel something. Whatever they feel is appropriate to them,\" he said.",
      "Jagde, 45, grew up outside of New York City, and started singing in musicals in high schools and choirs in college, but never gave a thought to the opera. He started studying computer science and business upstate but then a classical music program at Purchase College closer to home grabbed his attention, thinking it might lead him to Broadway.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know at the time that classical voice meant opera,\" he said laughing. He got accepted off the waiting list, and quickly fell in love with opera as the purest expression of the unadulterated voice.",
      "\u201cI remember being on stage and experiencing something I had never experienced on stage before, which was a completely acoustic, magical sound,\" Jagde said. \u201cThis was completely natural, hearing an orchestra underneath me, and my voice carrying over that. I remember committing full-heartedly (to opera) on stage at the moment.\u201d",
      "His college teachers pegged him as a baritone, and he spent eight years doing auditions and artists programs in that range until he realized that \u201cI was still warming up to high Cs and still had no low notes.\u201d",
      "Once he started auditioning as a tenor, the offers started rolling in. He made his principal role debut at the Metropolitan opera in 2021 in the role of Cavaradossi in \u201cTosca,\" and has sung on such renowned stages as the Paris Opera, the Vienna Staatsoper and Naples' Teatro di San Carlo.",
      "During the 2023/24 season, he warmed up his Don Alvaro at the Metropolitan Opera House and London's Royal Opera House. His La Scala debut last spring was as Turiddu in \u201cCavalleria rusticana.\u201d",
      "La Scala general manager Dominique Meyer said his only consideration in casting an opera is whether a singer \u201cis up to the role.\u201d Jagde, he said, is among five or six tenors who could sing the Don Alvaro role, \u201cand he was available.\u201d",
      "Jagde finished his Barcelona performances on Nov. 18, and showed up for rehearsals at La Scala the next day. Don Alvaro, he said, is a role, \"that has kind of grown with me, as I have grown as an artist.\u201d",
      "Jagde said singing alongside an international opera star like Netrebko for the second time this year will help take some of the jitters out of the gala premiere.",
      "\u201cShe is a wonderful colleague. She is a good person to work with, always available to you. She is nothing but smiles and fun,\" he said."

      "LOS ANGELES -- Although the friendly competition is fierce each day among the four talented young pass rushers on the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 defensive front, this week was a whole new tune.",
      "Defensive tackle Braden Fiske won the NFL's defensive rookie of the month award Thursday \u2014 but he had to share the spotlight with nose tackle Kobie Turner, who was revealed Wednesday night as one of the final four costumed performers on \u201cThe Masked Singer,\u201d Fox's celebrity musical competition show.",
      "Fiske, Turner and edge rushers Jared Verse and Byron Young inspire and challenge each other as they build the new core of the Rams' defense together. They regularly compare everything from their sack totals \u2014 they've combined for a whopping 21 1/2 this season \u2014 to their pickup basketball skills, always attempting to outdo each other with a smile.",
      "But when Turner pulled off his mask on television following his elimination after a season of impressive vocal performances, the rest of the Rams' defensive front knew Turner had won this round.",
      "\u201cIt really caught me by surprise,\u201d Fiske said with a laugh. \u201cWe saw it in the group chat last night, and it was all over social media. But knowing Kobie, knowing who he is, that's pretty cool. I know it was pretty special to him and his family with how his upbringing was with music and how much he appreciates that. I'm glad to see he had that opportunity. That's definitely not my forte, to be out there singing in front of people.\u201d",
      "Fiske got plenty of congratulations for his own performance after a five-sack November in which the second-round draft pick established himself alongside Turner as two of the league's top young interior pass rushers. Fiske is the third member of the Rams' young group to get the defensive rookie of the month honor in the past two years, joining Verse (September 2024) and Turner (December 2023).",
      "Meanwhile, Turner wowed another segment of the entertainment world with his powerful voice.",
      "The second-year pro has indulged his musical talent in several venues, even singing the national anthem before Lakers and Kings games. Turner conducts a few notes of an imaginary orchestra during his signature celebration after each sack.",
      "He balanced choral classes and weightlifting classes during high school and college, maintaining both of his passions. But the challenge of singing and dancing in the heavy costumes on \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d was a whole new experience.",
      "\u201cTo be up under that mask and be the silly, goofy version of myself that I always have been wasn\u2019t something I was really expecting,\u201d Turner said, adding that he fell asleep onstage during one break in filming while wearing his costume, which was extra bulky because of his athletic strength.",
      "Turner said his marketing agent got him onto the show. Turner taped his first episode way back during the Rams' organized team activities last summer, but he had to keep his participation secret until this week.",
      "\u201cOnce the recording was done, it was like, \u2018OK, let\u2019s get back to ball,\u2019\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd then when the show started coming on (this fall), I got really excited.\u201d",
      "Turner admits he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d not to advance to the show's finale, saying he maintains a competitive fire even in his musical side. He still doesn't forget to have fun, however.",
      "\u201cSometimes there are expectations on how you handle yourself on a football field, and with my personality, I've pushed those limits,\u201d Turner said. \u201cLast year, AD (Aaron Donald) used to always pick on me about doing crazy dance moves in walkthrough. But when it's time to go, I was completely locked in.\u201d",
      "NOTES: Verse was limited in practice Thursday by an ankle injury. ... LT Alaric Jackson (foot) returned to practice on a limited basis after sitting out Wednesday. ... WR Demarcus Robinson (hand) was a full participant after being limited Wednesday, while QB Matthew Stafford (ankle) had his second straight full day of work.",

      "NEW YORK -- The gunman who killed the CEO of the largest U.S. health insurer likely left New York City on a bus soon after the brazen ambush that has shaken corporate America, police officials said. But he left something behind: a backpack that was discovered in Central Park.",
      "Nearly four days after the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, police still did not know the gunman\u2019s name or whereabouts or have a motive for the killing. Investigators were looking at whether the shooter may have been a disgruntled employee or client of the insurer, Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters.",
      "The FBI announced Friday night it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Video of the gunman fleeing Wednesday\u2019s shooting showed him riding a bicycle into Central Park and later taking a taxi to a bus terminal that offers commuter service to New Jersey and Greyhound routes to Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C, according to Kenny.",
      "Police have video of the man entering the bus station but no video of him exiting, leading them to believe he left the city, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators on Friday found a backpack in the park that had been worn by the gunman during the shooting, police said, following a massive sweep to find it in a vast area with lakes and ponds, meadows, playgrounds and woods.",
      "Police didn\u2019t immediately reveal what, if anything, it contained but said it would be analyzed for clues.",
      "The gunman made sure to conceal his identity with a mask during almost all of his time in the city, including during the attack and while he ate, yet left a trail of evidence in view of the nation\u2019s biggest city and its network of security cameras.",
      "The gunman arrived in New York City on Nov. 24 and shot Thompson 10 days later outside his company\u2019s annual investor conference at a hotel just blocks from Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center.",
      "The gunman got off a bus that originated in Atlanta and made several stops along the way, Kenny said. Police have not determined where he got on the bus. Investigators have a list of passengers, but none of them would have had to provide an ID when they climbed aboard, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators believe the suspect used a fake identification card and paid cash, Kenny said, when he checked in at the hostel, which has a caf\u00e9 along with shared and private rooms and is blocks from Columbia University.",
      "Investigators have tested a discarded water bottle and protein bar wrapper in a hunt for his DNA. They also were trying to obtain additional information from a cellphone found along the gunman\u2019s escape route.",
      "Photos of the suspected shooter that were taken in the lobby of a hostel on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side appear to from the only time he removed his mask, Kenny said. The images, showing a man smiling in the lobby of the HI New York City hostel. They are among a collection of photos and video circulated since the shooting \u2014 including footage of the attack, as well as images of the suspected gunman at a Starbucks beforehand.",
      "\u201cFrom every indication we have from witnesses, from the Starbucks, from the hostel, he kept his mask on at all times except for the one instance where we have him photographed with the mask off,\u201d Kenny said.",
      "His roommates at the hostel also said he didn\u2019t speak to them. Nothing of investigative value was found in a search of the suspected shooter\u2019s hotel room.",
      "Asked how close he felt police were to making an arrest, Kenny said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Blue Bloods.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to solve this in 60 minutes. We\u2019re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across. Eventually, when an apprehension is made, we will have to present all of these facts to a judge and jury, so we\u2019re taking our time, doing it right and making sure we\u2019re going to get justice for this victim and closure for his family.\u201d",
      "Security video of the shooting shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind, firing several shots with a gun equipped with a silencer, barely pausing to clear a jam while the executive fell to the sidewalk.",
      "Police were looking into the possibility that the weapon was a veterinary pistol, which is a weapon commonly used on farms and ranches if an animal has to be euthanized quietly, Kenny said \u2014 though he stressed that hadn\u2019t been confirmed.",
      "The words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, one word on each of three bullets, Kenny said. A law enforcement official previously told The Associated Press the words were \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose.\u201d The messages mirror the phrase \u201cdelay, deny, defend,\u201d which is commonly used by lawyers and critics about insurers that delay payments, deny claims and defend their actions.",
      "Thompson, a father of two sons who lived in a Minneapolis suburb, had been with Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and served as CEO for more than three years.",
      "The insurer\u2019s parent company, UnitedHealth Group Inc., was holding its annual meeting in New York for investors. The company abruptly ended the conference after Thompson\u2019s death.",
      "UnitedHealth Group said it was focused on supporting Thompson\u2019s family, ensuring the safety of employees and assisting investigators. \u201cWhile our hearts are broken, we have been touched by the huge outpouring,\u201d the company said.",
      "UnitedHealthcare provides coverage for more than 49 million Americans. It manages health insurance coverage for employers and state and federally funded Medicaid programs.",

      "The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare's CEO has opened the door for many people to vent their frustrations and anger over the insurance industry",
      "For years, patients in the U.S. health care system have grown frustrated with a bureaucracy they don\u2019t understand.",
      "Doctors are included in an insurer\u2019s network one year but not the next. Getting someone on the phone to help can be next to impossible. Coverage of care and prescriptions is often unceremoniously denied.",
      "This week\u2019s fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has unleashed a wave of public feeling \u2014 exasperation, anger, resentment, helplessness \u2014 from Americans sharing personal stories of interactions with insurance companies, often seen as faceless corporate giants.",
      "In particular, the words written on ammunition found at the shooting scene \u2014 \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d echoing a phrase used to describe how insurers dodge claim payouts \u2014 amplified voices that have long been critical of the industry.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden, I am fired up again,\u201d said Tim Anderson, describing how his wife, Mary, had to deal with UnitedHealthcare coverage denials before she died from Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in 2022.",
      "Anderson said they couldn\u2019t get coverage for machines to help his wife breathe or talk \u2014 toward the end, she communicated by blinking when he showed her pictures. The family had to rely on donations from a local ALS group, he said.",
      "\u201cThe business model for insurance is don\u2019t pay,\u201d said Anderson, 67, of Centerville, Ohio.",
      "\u201cWhen Mary could still talk, she said to me to keep fighting this,\u201d he added. \u201cIt needs to be exposed.\u201d",
      "For Anderson and others, Thompson's death and the message left at the scene have created an opportunity to vent their frustrations. Conversations at dinner tables, office water coolers, social gatherings and on social media have pivoted to the topic, as police efforts to find the gunman keep the case in the news.",
      "Hans Maristela said he understands why the chatter is bubbling up. The 54-year-old caregiver in California was moved to comment on Facebook about UnitedHealthcare's reputation of denying coverage. As a Catholic, he said, he grieves Thompson's death and feels for his family, especially with the holidays around the corner.",
      "But he sees frustration with insurers even among his clients, most of them wealthy older people who've not been shielded from high out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\u201cAnd then you know the CEO of this company you pay a lot of money to gets $10 million dollars a year, you won\u2019t have a lot of sympathy for the guy,\" Maristela said, citing Thompson's compensation package that included base pay and stock options. \u201cHealth care is a business, I understand, but the obsession with share price, with profit, has to be reevaluated.\u201d",
      "University of Pennsylvania researcher Michael Anne Kyle said she's not surprised by the growth of conversation around insurers.",
      "\u201cPeople are often struggling with this by themselves, and when you see someone else talk about it, that may prompt you to join the conversation,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle studies how patients access care and said she's seen frustration with the system build for years. Costs are rising, and insurers are using more controls such as prior authorizations and doctor networks to manage them. Patients are often stuck in the middle of disputes between doctors and insurers.",
      "\u201cPatients are already spending a lot of money on health care, and then they\u2019re still facing problems with the service,\u201d she said.",
      "Insurers often note that most of the money they bring in goes back out the door to pay claims, and that they try to corral soaring costs and the overuse of some care.",
      "In Ohio, Anderson said his initial reaction to the CEO shooting was to question whether it was connected to a coverage denial, like the ones he'd experienced with his wife.",
      "\u201cI definitely do not condone killing people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I read it and said, 'I wonder if somebody had a spouse whose coverage was denied.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s zero sympathy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lesson to take away from that is not, \u2018Let\u2019s shame people for celebrating a murder.\u2019 No, it\u2019s: \u2018Look at the amount of anger that people have toward this system that\u2019s taken advantage of people and do something to try to fix that.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m always talking about how powerful social media can be with advocacy,\" he said, \"because it really is the only way to put a significant amount of pressure on these corporations who are doing bad things for patients.\u201d",

      "Some residents of seven Louisiana nursing homes who were sent to ride out 2021's Hurricane Ida in a warehouse are being offered shares of a nearly $9 million settlement",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Some of the elderly residents of seven Louisiana nursing homes who were sent in 2021 to ride out Hurricane Ida in a crowded, ill-equipped warehouse are being offered shares of a nearly $9 million settlement after they sued.",
      "Retired state judge William \u201cRusty\u201d Knight told The Times-Picayune of New Orleans that all the 427 former residents who filed legal claims are being sent letters outlining the proposed settlement. Knight said amounts differ based on patients' individual circumstances.",
      "People who don't contest the amount offered can expect to receive money within a few weeks. A hearing for those who want to fight the settlement will be held in January.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a longer road getting here than we wanted it to be,\u201d Knight said. \u201cNobody\u2019s getting what they should. quite frankly, because there\u2019s not enough money.\u201d",
      "Bob Dean Jr., 70, owned seven nursing homes in New Orleans and southeast Louisiana. As Ida approached, Dean moved hundreds of residents into a building in the town of Independence, roughly 70 miles (110 kilometers) northwest of New Orleans.",
      "Authorities said conditions at the warehouse deteriorated rapidly after the powerful storm hit on Aug. 29, 2021. They found ill and elderly bedridden people on mattresses on the wet floor, some crying for help, some lying in their own waste. Civil suits against Dean\u2019s corporation said the ceiling leaked and toilets overflowed at the sweltering warehouse, and there was too little food and water.",
      "Within days after the storm hit, the state reported the deaths of seven of the evacuees, five of them classified as storm-related.",
      "By the time Dean was arrested on state charges in June 2022, he had lost state licenses and federal funding for his nursing homes. Dean pleaded no contest to 15 criminal counts in July and was sentenced to three years of probation, paying $258,000 in restitution and more than $1 million as a penalty.",
      "Last month, Dean agreed to pay $8.2 million to the federal government to settle allegations that he misused assets and income from four nursing homes whose loans were insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Prosecutors say he funneled nursing home money to his personal bank accounts, using the money to buy antiques, guns and cars.",
      "But Dean also faced civil lawsuits or legal claims from 427 of the 843 patients who were taken to Independence, or their surviving relatives. Many of the plaintiffs and their lawyers have suggested Dean was hiding other assets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no true justice after what my clients endured,\u201d attorney Matthew Hemmer, who represents hundreds of nursing home victims, told WVUE-TV.",
      "Knight said he knows of 165 of Dean's former residents who have died since the evacuation, and he said he expects to learn more people have died as responses to the settlement offer are returned."

Its faded unassuming yellow facade, characteristic of the middle of the last century, obscures the medical center within founded 500 years ago by Spanish conqueror Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.",
      "Entering between street-level shoe stores, visitors find the oldest continuously operating hospital in the Americas. Stone arches lead to expansive patios filled with lush vegetation.",
      "The hospital was founded to treat the conquering Spanish, then later opened to the local Indigenous inhabitants to ensure a healthy workforce. Today it provides 24/7 emergency care, as well as affordable access to medical specialists for current residents of what was at the time of its founding the center of the Aztec empire.",
      "\u201cYou can feel the Mexican heritage here,\u201d said Dr. Pedro \u00c1lvarez S\u00e1nchez. \u201cFor 500 years, the hospital has never closed its doors.\u201d",

If you go somewhere else it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d Her consultation was just 400 pesos or under $20.",
      "Escamilla was accompanied by her daughter Myriam Rafael Sanchez, 26, who was fascinated by the medical center. \u201cI\u2019ve seen (the hospital) a lot in movies and TV shows,\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cWe have all of Mexico\u2019s history around us.\u201d",
      "The hospital didn\u2019t always serve the entire public, according to Sandra Elena Guevara Flores, an anthropologist focusing on medicine at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
      "Guevara said the hospital was not open to the Indigenous population initially, but only to the Spanish who had recently arrived in the Americas.",
      "However, as epidemics began to spread, the hospital opened its doors to more patients. \u201cIt was a strategy by the Spanish governors in the new Spain to treat the whole population,\u201d said Guevara. \u201cIt (was) so the servants and the whole labor system wouldn\u2019t die.\u201d",
      "Early Spanish doctors at the hospital often used native Mexican herbs to cure their patients. \u201cIt\u2019s said that traditional Galenic Hippocratic medicine was used in the hospital, but really it was Indigenous medicine,\u201d said Guevara. \u201cThey (Indigenous peoples) would share their knowledge.\u201d",
      "The Spanish imprint can be seen in the hospital\u2019s architecture, said Hugo Antonio Arciniega \u00c1vila, a historian and archaeological expert from the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
      "The hospital, like some other colonial structures in Mexico City, is \u2018encapsulated\u2019 inside a newer building from the 1950s.",
      "Because the Spanish built low stone structures on huge lots with massive stone walls, people who wanted to build newer facilities a century or two later would often just build over, around or among the colonial-era structures. Sometimes they would incorporate the old masonry walls into the new building, either for preservation reasons or because it was cheaper to use them than to tear them down. So from the street, there is often no sign that behind a Victorian or functionalist facade, there is a partially preserved Spanish structure within.",
      "The hospital was built in the form of a T, with two large patios and a grand staircase devised by Spanish architect Claudio de Arciniega in the 16th century. The design provided constant ventilation and sunshine to patients. The architect also included a chapel on each of the two original floors.",
      "\u201cThe architecture of this hospital is fascinating,\u201d said Arciniega about the intentional layout of religious spaces and access to open air. \u201cIf you cure the soul, you can cure the body \u2013 it\u2019s the same way the doctors thought.\u201d",
      "For the 67-year-old \u00c1lvarez, who has worked at the hospital for nearly 50 years and also serves as the board of trustees\u2019 treasurer, the center has been a constant in his life. He began working at the hospital as a lab assistant at age 18.",
      "\u201cA lot of people ask me, why do you keep working at the Hospital de Jesus?\u201d he said. \u201cI tell them because I love it.\u201d",

      "Three days after the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, police still did not know the gunman's name or whereabouts or have a motive for the killing, Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters. Investigators were looking at whether the shooter may have been a disgruntled employee or client of the insurer, he said.",

We\u2019re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across. Eventually, when an apprehension is made, we will have to present all of these facts to a judge and jury, so we\u2019re taking our time, doing it right and making sure we\u2019re going to get justice for this victim and closure for his family.\u201d",
      "Security video of the shooting shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind, firing several shots with a gun equipped with a silencer, barely pausing to clear a jam while the executive fell to the sidewalk.",

      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield says it won't tie payments to the length of time a patient went under anesthesia",
      "One of the country\u2019s largest health insurers reversed a change in policy Thursday after widespread outcry, saying it would not tie payments in some states to the length of time a patient went under anesthesia.",
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said in a statement that its decision to backpedal resulted from \u201csignificant widespread misinformation\u201d about the policy.",
      "\u201cTo be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\u201d",
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield would have used \"physician work time values,\" which is published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as the metric for anesthesia limits; maternity patients and patients under the age of 22 were exempt. But Dr. Jonathan Gal, economics committee chair of the American Society for Anesthesiologists, said it's unclear how CMS derives those values.",
      "In mid-November, the American Society for Anesthesiologists called on Anthem to \u201creverse the proposal immediately,\u201d saying in a news release that the policy would have taken effect in February in New York, Connecticut and Missouri. It's not clear how many states in total would have been affected, as notices also were posted in Virginia and Colorado.",
      "People across the country registered their concerns and complaints on social media, and encouraged people in affected states to call their legislators. Some people noted that the policy could prevent patients from getting overcharged.",
      "Gal said the policy change would have been unprecedented, ignored the \u201cnuanced, unpredictable human element\u201d of surgery and was a clear \u201cmoney grab.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incomprehensible how a health insurance company could so blatantly continue to prioritize their profits over safe patient care,\u201d he said. \"If Anthem is, in fact, rescinding the policy, we\u2019re delighted that they came to their senses.\u201d",
      "Prior to Anthem's announcement Thursday, Connecticut comptroller Sean Scanlon said the \u201cconcerning\u201d policy wouldn't affect the state after conversations with the insurance company. And New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in an emailed statement Thursday that her office had also successfully intervened.",

      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat",
      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat. Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50.",
      "For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, such as the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (around 30 degrees Celsius) and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older.",
      "The study in Friday's journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: People between 18 and 35. That age group alone had nine times as many temperature-related deaths as those older than 50.",
      "Study authors and outside experts are scrambling to figure out why. Demographics alone don't explain why more young adult Mexicans are dying in high heat than their elders. Two theories: Outdoor workers who can't escape the heat, and young people who don't know their limits.",
      "The trend is likely to widen as the world warms from human-caused climate change, according to computer simulations run by the study team.",
      "\u201cWe found that younger people are especially vulnerable to humid heat,\u201d study co-author Jeffrey Shrader, a climate economist at Columbia University, said. \u201cAs the climate warms, we're really going to be shifting the burden of temperature-related mortality towards younger individuals and away from older individuals who tend to be more vulnerable to cold temperatures.\u201d",
      "Data from cold weather shows more than 300 deaths of Mexican residents 50 and older for every young person dying from cold temperatures, according to the study.",
      "\u201cPeople of all ages are increasingly at risk from the rising temperatures, and this study shows that those that we might have considered relatively safe from heat-related adverse health outcomes might not be so much so,\u201d said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown that monitors health effects of climate change. She was not part of the study team.",
      "\u201cHeat is a much more dangerous silent killer than most people acknowledge it to be, and that heat is increasingly putting our health and survival at risk,\" Romanello said in an email.",
      "Study authors decided to examine weather-related deaths in Mexico because that country not only has detailed mortality data, but it has a variety of different climates making it an ideal place to study in depth, Shrader said.",
      "Researchers also want to figure out whether this is just a situation in Mexico or other warmer sections of the globe have similar spikes in young adult deaths in high heat and humidity.",
      "Initially the team just wanted to look at deaths and what scientists call wet-bulb globe temperatures, but when they looked at age differences, they were surprised and looked in more detail, Shrader said. Wet-bulb temperature, which is intended to mirror how the body cools itself, is derived using a complicated measurement system that factors in humidity and solar radiation. A wet-bulb globe temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is thought to be the limit for human survivability. Most places don\u2019t reach that level.",
      "Researchers determined temperature-related mortality by complex statistical analysis that compares numerous factors in the number of deaths and removes everything they can except temperature fluctuations, said study co-author Andrew Wilson, a Columbia climate economics researcher.",
      "Researchers also calculated the ideal temperature for when there are the fewest excess deaths at each age group. Younger adults' sweet temperature spot is about nine degrees Fahrenheit (five degrees Celsius) cooler than it is for older people, Shrader and Wilson said.",
      "Some outside health and climate experts were initially puzzled at the higher youth mortality seen in the study. Co-author Patrick Kinney, a professor of urban health and sustainability at Boston University, said it was likely the study included a higher proportion of outdoor workers exposed to heat than prior studies did.",
      "Study co-author Tereza Cavazos, a climate scientist at the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Mexico, said she remembers her father's generations taking siestas in the high heat of the day and that was healthy. That doesn't happen so much now, she said.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of population that is vulnerable in the future. Not even in the future, right now,\u201d Cavazos said. She mentioned three Mexican heat waves this year that hit in the middle of the country and kept the deadly heat going overnight so people had little relief. Usually cool nights allow a body to recover.",
      "Younger people often have a sense of invulnerability to weather extremes and do things that increase their risk, such as play sports in high heat, Cavazos said.",
      "\u201cHigh humidity makes it a lot harder for the body to cool itself through sweating \u2013 which is how our body primarily stays cool,\" said Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and climate change expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. She was not part of the study team. \"So someone young and healthy working outside in heat and high humidity can reach a point where the body can no longer cool itself safely \u2013 causing a deadly form of heat injury called heat stroke.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- An alternative healer who advocated \u201cslapping therapy\u201d to treat a range of maladies was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for the death of a 71-year-old diabetic woman who stopped taking insulin during one of his workshops.",
      "Hongchi Xiao, 61, was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence for failing to get medical help for Danielle Carr-Gomm as she howled in pain and frothed at the mouth during the fourth day of a workshop in October 2016.",
      "Xiao, of Cloudbreak, California, promoted paida lajin therapy, getting patients to slap themselves repeatedly to release \u201cpoisonous waste\u201d from the body. The technique has its roots in Chinese medicine, but critics say it has no scientific basis and patients often end up with bruises, bleeding \u2014 or worse.",
      "Carr-Gomm was one of two of Xiao\u2019s patients who died.",
      "He was extradited from Australia, where he had been convicted of manslaughter after a 6-year-old boy died when his parents withdrew his insulin medication after attending one of his workshops in Sydney.",
      "\u201cI consider you dangerous even though you do not share the characteristics of most other dangerous offenders,\u201d Justice Robert Bright said during sentencing at Winchester Crown Court.",
      "\u201cYou knew from late in the afternoon of day one of the fact that Danielle Carr-Gomm had stopped taking her insulin,\u201d the judge said. \"Furthermore, you made it clear to her you supported this.\u201d",
      "Bright said Xiao only made a \u201ctoken effort\u201d to get Carr-Gomm to take her insulin once it was too late and had shown no sign of remorse as he continued to promote paida lajin in prison.",
      "Carr-Gomm was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1999 and was desperate to find a cure that didn't involve injecting herself with needles, her son, Matthew, said.",
      "She sought out alternative treatments and had attended a previous workshop by Xiao in Bulgaria a few months before her death in which she also became seriously ill after ceasing her medication.",
      "However, she recorded a video testimonial, calling Xiao a \u201cmessenger sent by God\u201d who was \u201cstarting a revolution to put the power back in the hands of the people to cure themselves and to change the whole system of healthcare.\"",
      "Xiao had congratulated Carr-Gomm when she told other participants at the English retreat that she had stopped taking her insulin.",
      "By day three, Carr-Gomm was \"vomiting, tired and weak, and by the evening she was howling in pain and unable to respond to questions,\u201d prosecutor Duncan Atkinson said.",
      "A chef who wanted to call an ambulance said she deferred to those with holistic healing experience.",
      "\u201cThose who had received and accepted the defendant\u2019s teachings misinterpreted Mrs. Carr-Gomm\u2019s condition as a healing crisis,\u201d Atkinson said."

      "\u201cThese tools are really valuable,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cI just want to make sure that the guardrails are there when indications from the incoming federal administration is they would potentially weaponize the data in a way that is very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Federal law bars medical providers from sharing health data without a patient\u2019s consent but doesn\u2019t prevent digital tech companies from tracking menstrual cycles or an individual\u2019s location and selling it to data brokers. Legislation for federal bans have never gained momentum, largely because of opposition from the tech industry.",
      "How the legislation works varies from state to state. Washington state has digital privacy law that broadly covers all health-related data while Virginia has a law that explicitly prohibits the issuance of search warrants, subpoenas or court orders for electronic or digital menstrual health data.",
      "Michigan\u2019s proposal would require businesses or organizations to use reproductive health data only for the services it provides, and consumers must be informed of how the data is being used. In order to sell that data, an entity would need explicit, signed consent from the consumer. Consumers would also have the option to opt out from their data being sold at any time.",
      "It would also regulate retailers, who often compile data to target consumers with advertisements, and the use of geofencing, which allows marketers to target consumers with ads based on their location.",
      "The bill would prohibit identifying who is receiving reproductive health care by using location information and targeting them with advertisements. This would apply to people visiting fertility or abortion clinics.",
      "The geofencing provision of the bill has drawn objection from anti-abortion advocates. Genevieve Marnon, legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan, said in committee testimony Tuesday that the bill would prevent women visiting an abortion clinic from being reached by anti-abortion ads.",

    "story": [
      "Planned Parenthood wanted to resume offering abortions in several Missouri clinics on Friday, immediately after the state's new constitutional amendment rolling back a near total ban took effect",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Planned Parenthood wanted to resume offering abortions in several Missouri clinics on Friday, immediately after a newly passed constitutional amendment rolling back the state\u2019s near-total ban took effect, but they remain on hold as a complicated court battle drags on.",
      "The issue is that the amendment does not specifically override any state laws. And even before the end of Roe v. Wade enabled Missouri's Republican-led legislature to approve a near-total ban, the state's numerous restrictions left it with just one abortion clinic, in St. Louis.",
      "Missouri\u2019s Republican attorney general says many of those old laws \u2014 like a 72-hour waiting period \u2014 should still be enforced despite the amendment; Planned Parenthood says they shouldn't.",
      "Prosecutors are caught in the middle. They want a preliminary injunction halting enforcement of the old laws while attorneys argue about what to do.",
      "But so far, Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang hasn't acted on that request.",
      "\u201cAs of today, Missourians have an unrealized constitutional right,\u201d said Emily Wales, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Great Plains in a written statement. \"They are entitled to access abortion under the state\u2019s constitution, and every day they cannot get that care here at home, their rights are being violated.\u201d",
      "Here is what to know about the complicated legal battle and the state of abortion access:",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in November adding the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Ultimately approved by almost 52% of voters, it guarantees people\u2019s right to make decisions about their reproductive health, such as whether to get an abortion, take birth control or get in vitro fertilization.",
      "While the amendment is widely understood to prevent the state from restricting abortions up to the point of viability, abortion-rights advocates must persuade judges to prevent old regulations from being enforced.",
      "\u201cThere were certainly people who thought the issue was decided after the vote \u2014 that we would have access,\" Wales said Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had patients calling for weeks now saying, \u2018Can I get in? Can I stay close to home?\u2019 Of course, that\u2019s not true.\u201d",
      "Reproductive rights activists are also suing to dismantle Arizona's 15-week abortion ban that conflicts with the fundamental right to abortion voters approved.",
      "Maryland's new abortion rights amendment won't make an immediate difference, since the state already allows access to abortion. It's a similar situation in Montana, where abortion is already legal until viability. Colorado's measure enshrined already-existing access and undoes an earlier amendment that prohibited state and local government funding for abortion, opening the possibility of state Medicaid and government employee insurance plans covering care.",
      "The day after voters approved Missouri's amendment, the two Planned Parenthood branches asked a judge to find the state\u2019s near-total ban and most of its other abortion regulations unenforceable.",
      "Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey has already conceded that most abortions are now legal. He issued an opinion last month, stating that he will not enforce Missouri\u2019s ban on abortions before viability.",
      "But his office is still fighting to keep a 72-hour waiting period before an abortion can be performed; bans on abortions based on race, sex or a possible Down syndrome diagnosis; and a requirement that medical facilities that provide abortions be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers, among other regulations.",
      "This patchwork of old laws is a big problem for abortion providers. They say those restrictions had effectively blocked abortions across most of the state even before Missouri enacted a law banning all abortions except in cases of medical emergency, minutes after Roe was toppled.",
      "\u201cWe have already been living in a post-Roe world,\u201d Dr. Iman Alsaden, the medical director of the Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said at the time.",
      "But Missouri Solicitor General Josh Divine has defended these laws, arguing that most women regret their abortions and that the requirements are designed to give them the time to think through their decisions.",
      "\"What we are trying to do is create a situation where women can in fact make the choice they want to do \u2014 and we know that most of the time that is childbirth,\u201d Divine said after a court hearing Wednesday.",
      "Wales, of Planned Parenthood, said Missourians showed at the ballot box that they value reproductive rights. And she expressed frustration with what she described as \"an Attorney General\u2019s office that has made clear it will fight tooth and nail to prevent Missourians from accessing their new constitutional right to reproductive freedom.\u201d",

      "The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded slightly different numbers, with 376 cases and 79 deaths. The discrepancy was caused by problems with surveillance and case definition, the head of the Africa CDC, Jean Kaseya, said.",

The team, which includes epidemiologists and clinicians, will deliver medicines and sample kits to help identify the cause of the disease. It will also collaborate with community leaders to enhance surveillance and promote infection prevention.",
      "Since late November, a local WHO team has been helping Kwango\u2019s health authorities with disease surveillance, the organization's statement said.",
      "While Kamba said he was not aware of any reports of the disease in health zones other than Panzi, the WHO said in its statement Friday that the disease has been reported in seven of the 30 health zones in Kwango province."

      "The federal Health Department ordered doctors across the country not to use IV nutrition bags made by the company Productos Hospitalarios S.A de C.V., though the exact source of the infections is still under investigation. Phone calls to numbers listed for the company and emails seeking comment went unanswered.",
      "The outbreak appeared to be Klebsiella oxytoca, a multidrug-resistant bacteria. It was first detected in November at three government hospitals and one private one in the State of Mexico, on the outskirts of Mexico City.",
      "The department said the children appeared to have died from a blood infection.",
      "So far, of 20 possible cases, the bacteria was ruled out in one case, suspected in four and confirmed in 15 cases. Of the 19 patients, 13 died and the six others are being treated at hospitals.",
      "Asked about the cluster of cases, President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday that health officials \"told me about a case yesterday, but let's say, it's under control.\u201d",
      "It was the latest public blow to Mexico\u2019s tottering, underfunded health care system. Last week, the director of the country\u2019s flagship national cardiology institute said the hospital didn\u2019t have money to buy essential supplies, calling the situation \u201ccritical.\u201d",
      "Dr. Jorge Gaspar, the hospital's director, wrote an internal letter saying that budget cuts \u201chave affected the acquisition of supplies necessary for the institution's functioning.\u201d In a subsequent public letter the next day, he clarified that the initial message was intended for an \u201cinternal\u201d audience and assured the public that \u201cwe are working to solve the situation.\u201d",

      "The drug may not have been stored properly. Some smaller hospitals or maternity clinics in Mexico don\u2019t have their own dispensing pharmacies or are not authorized to handle controlled medications like opiates, and thus long relied on anesthesiologists to bring their own.",

      "Weighted blankets are a popular choice to warm up in cold weather, but research on their effectiveness is limited",
      "NEW YORK -- Rhonda James was skeptical when her husband ordered a weighted blanket for her online. But five minutes after she wrapped it around her body, she zonked out.",
      "\u201cIt felt like a really big hug,\u201d said James, a banker in Charleston, South Carolina.",
      "As outside temperatures grow chilly, weighted blankets can be a popular choice to warm up. Some people say the added pressure helps them soothe the worries of the day and get to sleep faster.",
      "But research on the effectiveness of weighted blankets is limited. Here's what to know.",
      "Weighted blankets come with extra heft in the form of glass beads, pellets, cotton or another filling. Scientists haven\u2019t studied exactly how the blankets work, but they have a few ideas.",
      "The blankets\u2019 firm touch may calm the brain's fight-or-flight response, said Dr. Neal Walia, a sleep medicine expert at UCLA Health.",
      "\u201cThe evenly distributed weight on you tells your body, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re in a calm environment,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "The extra pressure also may signal the brain to release what\u2019s called the love hormone, also known as oxytocin. It\u2019s produced during bonding and cuddling, and can also lower anxiety, Walia said.",
      "For most healthy adults, experts say to choose a blanket that is about 10% of their body weight. So a 150-pound person may opt for a 15-pound blanket.",
      "Weighted blankets are not recommended for babies or toddlers since they can hinder movement and breathing.",
      "People with sleep apnea, sleep-related disorders or respiratory problems should check with a doctor before using a weighted blanket.",
      "The blankets aren't for everyone and each person gets the best out of their blanket differently. For example, some may find them too hot to use during warmer months.",
      "And the extra swaddling comes at a cost: quality weighted blankets can range from $50 to over $300 depending on the size, weight and material.",
      "James takes hers out of the closet to unwind when she\u2019s watching TV or sipping a glass of wine.",

      "\u201cIf my body\u2019s relaxed, my mind follows suit,\u201d she said.",
      "There isn't a ton of research on whether weighted blankets actually work, and the studies that do exist are on small groups. Most studies don't focus on the average sleeper. Instead, they investigate whether weighted blankets can help people with chronic sleep problems, mental health conditions or developmental disorders.",
      "There are some hints that weighted blankets can help with anxiety, chronic pain and sleep. But the research isn't conclusive.",
      "A study on 120 people with insomnia found that the weighted blankets helped them sleep better compared to a light blanket. Another study on 67 children with autism found the weighted blanket didn\u2019t affect their sleep at all \u2013 but the children and their parents preferred it to a regular blanket.",
      "And a third study on 94 adults with chronic pain found that a heavier weighted blanket didn\u2019t affect sleep, but was better at reducing pain compared to a lighter one.",

      "Efforts to reduce the nation's persistently high maternal mortality rates involve state panels of experts that investigate and learn from each mother's death.",
      "The panels \u2014 called maternal mortality review committees \u2014 usually do their work quietly and out of the public eye. But that's not been the case recently in three states with strict abortion laws.",
      "Georgia dismissed all members of its committee in November after information about deaths being reviewed leaked to the news organization ProPublica. Days later, The Washington Post reported that Texas' committee won\u2019t review cases from 2022 and 2023, the first two years after the state banned nearly all abortions. In Idaho, the state let its panel disband in 2023 only to reinstate it earlier this year.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve become more of a lightning rod than they were before,\u201d said epidemiologist Michael Kramer, director of the Center for Rural Health and Health Disparities at Mercer University in Georgia.",
      "Here\u2019s what maternal mortality review committees across the nation do and what might happen next:",
      "\u201cMaternal mortality review committees are important because they are the most comprehensive source of information about maternal mortality that we have,\u201d said David Goodman, who leads the maternal mortality prevention team at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The panels review deaths that occur during pregnancy or within a year after it ends, whether directly related to the pregnancy or not. Causes of death can range from hemorrhage during childbirth to drug overdoses to traffic accidents.",
      "The goal, Kramer said, is to examine maternal deaths and help \"decide what we can do about them.\u201d",
      "All states, a few cities and Puerto Rico have these committees. Their membership varies and may include OB-GYNs, maternal-fetal medicine doctors, nurses, midwives, mental and public health experts and members of patient advocacy groups. Most have representatives from several areas of expertise, which the CDC recommends.",
      "How members are selected also varies; people may apply, submit letters of interest or be invited to serve.",
      "The selection shouldn\u2019t be politically motivated, Kramer said, because \u201cif there\u2019s a systematic exclusion of certain data or certain perspectives\u201d it\u2019s difficult to truly understand what\u2019s happening.",
      "First, the panels work with state vital statistics offices and epidemiologists to identify deaths associated with pregnancy by examining death certificates and looking for a pregnancy checkbox or a related cause of death. They may also search for links to birth and fetal death records, or delve into hospital discharge data, media reports and obituaries.",
      "Once they identify cases, they collect as much information as possible, such as prenatal care records, hospital and social service records, autopsy reports and interviews with family members. Professional \u201cabstractors\u201d distill all this into case narratives, which committee members pore over. Most use a standardized review process developed by the CDC \u2014 and all panels can get help and guidance from the agency.",
      "They consider questions such as: Was the death pregnancy-related? What was the underlying cause? Was it preventable? What factors contributed?",
      "States generally have privacy rules that protect committee members and people who provide information on the deaths.",
      "The groups then issue public reports that don\u2019t name moms or hospitals but include overall findings, trends and recommendations. Some come out a couple of years or more after the deaths.",
      "Across the nation in 2023, Goodman said, 151 recommendations from those reports were implemented by communities, hospitals, medical professionals and policymakers.",
      "Georgia will rebuild its committee through a new application process, the state public health commissioner said.",
      "Texas' committee has been reviewing 2021 deaths and will start on 2024 cases at its next meeting, Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson Lara Anton said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cReviewing cases is a lengthy process and legislators have asked for more recent data. Starting the next review cycle with 2024 cases will allow us to provide that in the next report,\u201d Anton said, adding that maternal and child health epidemiologists will continue to analyze and publish data for 2022 and 2023.",
      "In Idaho, the reconstituted review committee now falls under the state board of medicine, which licenses doctors, instead of the state's health and welfare department. It will operate like it always has, said Bob McLaughlin, spokesperson for the medical board. Members met for the first time in November and plan to issue a report by Jan. 31. Because the legislature wanted the most up-to-date information, McLaughlin said the first report will cover only 2023 cases, and the group will review 2022 deaths next.",
      "Goodman said he\u2019s encouraged that every state has a review committee now \u2014 only 20 had them in 2015.",

      "The 2014 Ebola outbreak \u2013 the deadliest in history \u2013 was primarily in West Africa but affected Sierra Leone the most, with nearly 4,000 deaths out of the more than 11,000 recorded globally. The country also lost 7% of its healthcare workforce to the outbreak.",
      "The nationwide vaccine campaign, implemented by the government in partnership with the global vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization and the United Nations children\u2019s agency, will target 20,000 frontline workers across the country, officials said.",
      "\u201cThis is an investment in the safety of our people and a healthier Sierra Leone,\u201d Health Minister Dr. Austin Demby said.",
      "There had been no approved vaccine at the time of the 2014 outbreak that recorded up to 28,000 cases, starting in Guinea before spreading across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia, the other two countries affected the most.",
      "Three years have passed since the last case was recorded in Guinea, although officials have spoken of remaining threats in endemic regions.",
      "Among those killed by the disease during the 2014 outbreak were nine relatives of Hassan Kamara, a resident of Freetown. Of the 11 people he was living with at the time, only he and his baby daughter survived.",

      "Congo\u2019s health minister says the government is on alert over a mystery flu-like disease that in recent weeks killed dozens of people",
      "KINSHASA, Congo -- Public health officials in Africa urged caution Thursday as Congo\u2019s health minister said the government was on alert over a mystery flu-like disease that in recent weeks killed dozens of people.",
      "Jean Kaseya, the head of Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters that more details about the disease should be known in the next 48 hours as experts receive results from laboratory samples of infected people.",
      "\u201cFirst diagnostics are leading us to think it is a respiratory disease,\u201d Kaseya said. \u201cBut we need to wait for the laboratory results.\u201d He added that there are many things that are still unknown about the disease \u2014 including whether it is infectious and how it is transmitted.",
      "Authorities in Congo have so far confirmed 71 deaths, including 27 people who died in hospitals and 44 in the community in the southern Kwango province, health minister Roger Kamba said.",
      "\u201cThe Congolese government is on general alert regarding this disease,\" Kamba said, without providing more details.",
      "Of the victims at the hospitals, 10 died due to lack of blood transfusion and 17 as a result of respiratory problems, he said.",
      "The deaths were recorded between Nov. 10 and Nov. 25 in the Panzi health zone of Kwango province. There were around 380 cases, almost half of which were children under the age of five, according to the minister.",
      "The Africa CDC recorded slightly different numbers, with 376 cases and 79 deaths. The discrepancy was caused by problems with surveillance and case definition, Kaseya said.",
      "Authorities have said that symptoms include fever, headache, cough and anemia. Epidemiological experts are in the region to take samples and investigate the disease, the minister said.",
      "The Panzi health zone, located around 435 miles (700 kilometers) from the capital Kinshasa, is a remote area of the Kwango province, making it hard to access.",
      "The epidemiological experts took two days to arrive there, the minister said. Because of the lack of testing capacity, samples had to be taken to Kikwit, more than 500 km away, said Dieudonne Mwamba, the head of the National Institute for Public Health.",
      "\u201cThe health system is quite weak in our rural areas, but for certain types of care, the ministry has all the provisions, and we are waiting for the first results of the sample analysis to properly calibrate things,\u201d Kaseya said.",
      "Mwamba said that Panzi was already a \u201cfragile\u201d zone, with 40% of its residents experiencing malnutrition. It was also hit by an epidemic of typhoid fever two years ago, and there is currently a resurgence of seasonal flu across the country.",
      "\u201cWe need to take into account all this as context,\" Mwamba said.",
      "A Panzi resident, Claude Niongo, said his wife and seven-year-old daughter died from the disease.",
      "\u201cWe do not know the cause but I only noticed high fevers, vomiting... and then death,\u201d Niongo told The Associated Press over the phone. \"Now, the authorities are talking to us about an epidemic but in the meantime, there is a problem of care (and) people are dying,\u201d he added.",
      "Lucien Lufutu, president of the civil society consultation framework of Kwango province, who is in Panzi, said the local hospital where patients are treated is underequipped.",
      "\u201cThere is a lack of medicines and medical supplies, since the disease is not yet known, most of the population is treated by traditional practitioners,\u201d Lufutu told the AP.",
      "He also said the disease affected Katenda, another nearby health zone.",
      "When asked about a potential outbreak in other health zones, the minister said he could not tell if that was the case but that nothing was reported.",
      "Congo is already plagued by the mpox epidemic, with more than 47,000 suspected cases and over 1,000 suspected deaths from the disease in the Central African country, according to the World Health Organization.",

      "The U.S. government on Friday ordered testing of the nation's milk supply for bird flu to better monitor the spread of the virus in dairy cows.",
      "Raw or unpasteurized milk from dairy farms and processors nationwide must be tested on request starting Dec. 16, the Agriculture Department said. Testing will begin in six states \u2014 California, Colorado, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon and Pennsylvania.",
      "Officials said the move is aimed at \u201ccontaining and ultimately eliminating the virus,\" known as Type A H5N1, which was detected for the first time in March in U.S. dairy cows. Since then, more than 700 herds have been confirmed to be infected in 15 states.",
      "\u201cThis will give farms and farmworkers better confidence in the safety of their animals and ability to protect themselves, and it will put us on a path to quickly controlling and stopping the virus\u2019 spread nationwide,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.",
      "The risk to people from bird flu remains low, health officials said. Pasteurization, or heat treatment, kills the virus in milk, leaving it safe to drink.",
      "Veterinarians, farmers, scientists and academics have been calling for nationwide milk testing for months, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, who led the efforts.",
      "\u201cIt's another step in the right direction,\u201d Poulsen said. \u201cThey're coming around that we need a better handle on it.\u201d",
      "Dairy farmers and processors across the U.S. have been reluctant to test animals or milk for the virus, fearing economic or other repercussions. Jamie Jonker, chief science officer of the National Milk Producers Federation, said the industry supports USDA efforts to eliminate the virus.",
      "Under the federal order, dairy farmers and those who handle raw milk intended for pasteurization must provide samples of the milk on request for testing for bird flu. It requires reporting of positive tests to the USDA and it requires herd owners to provide basic information to allow tracing of the disease in cattle.",
      "The move follows an April 24 federal order that mandated testing of certain dairy cattle before they could move between states and required reporting of any positive tests. Despite that order, the virus has continued to spread, Poulsen noted.",
      "Raw milk from infected cows contains high loads of live virus, testing has shown.",
      "At least 58 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, mostly farm workers who became mildly ill after close contact with infected cows, including their milk, or infected poultry.",
      "Bird flu has also been spreading among wild birds and a number of other animals.",
      "Federal officials continue to warn against drinking raw milk, which can contain a host of germs that make people sick. In California, officials quarantined a farm and halted distribution of milk after bird flu virus was detected in raw milk sold in stores. Raw Farm of Fresno issued a voluntary recall of raw milk and cream produced after Nov. 9.",

      "South Korea\u2019s embattled President Yoon Suk Yeol has avoided an opposition-led attempt to impeach him over his short-lived imposition of martial law",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's embattled President Yoon Suk Yeol avoided an opposition-led attempt to impeach him over his short-lived imposition of martial law, as most ruling party lawmakers boycotted a parliamentary vote Saturday to deny a two-thirds majority needed to suspend his presidential powers.",
      "The scrapping of the motion is expected to intensify protests calling for Yoon\u2019s ouster and deepen political chaos in South Korea, with a survey suggesting a majority of South Koreans support the president\u2019s impeachment. Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration drew criticism from his own ruling conservative People Power Party, but the party is also determined to oppose Yoon\u2019s impeachment apparently because it fears losing the presidency to liberals.",
      "After the motion fell through, members of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party rallied inside the National Assembly, chanting slogans calling for Yoon's impeachment or resignation.",
      "The party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said it will soon prepare for a new impeachment motion. Opposition parties could submit a new impeachment motion after a new parliamentary session opens next Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe'll surely impeach Yoon Suk Yeol, who is the greatest risk to Republic of Korea,\u201d party leader Lee Jae-myung said. \u201cWe'll surely bring back this country to normal before Christmas Day or year's end.\u201d",
      "Many experts worry Yoon won\u2019t be able to serve out his remaining 2 \u00bd years in office. They say some PPP lawmakers could eventually join opposition parties\u2019 efforts to impeach Yoon if public demands for it grow further.",
      "The ruling party risks \"further public outrage and national confusion if they don\u2019t find a formula fast for Yoon\u2019s departure,\u201d said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington.",
      "PPP chair Han Dong-hun said his party will seek Yoon\u2019s \u201corderly\u201d early exit but didn\u2019t say when he can resign.",
      "On Saturday, tens of thousands of people packed several blocks of roads leading to the National Assembly, waving banners, shouting slogans and dancing. Protesters also gathered in front of PPP\u2019s headquarters near the Assembly, shouting for its lawmakers to vote to impeach Yoon. A smaller crowd of Yoon\u2019s supporters, which still seemed to be in the thousands, rallied elsewhere in Seoul, calling the impeachment attempt unconstitutional.",
      "Impeaching Yoon required support from 200 of the National Assembly's 300 members. The Democratic Party and five other small opposition parties, which filed the motion, have 192 seats combined. But only three lawmakers from PPP participated in the vote. The motion was scrapped without ballot counting because the number of votes didn\u2019t reach 200.",
      "National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik called the result \u201cvery regrettable\u201d and an embarrassing moment for the country\u2019s democracy.",
      "If Yoon is impeached, his powers will be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to remove him from office. If he is removed, an election to replace him must take place within 60 days.",
      "Earlier Saturday, Yoon issued an apology over the martial law decree, saying he won\u2019t shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration and promising not to make another attempt to impose it. He said would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country\u2019s political turmoil, \u201cincluding matters related to my term in office.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe declaration of this martial law was made out of my desperation. But in the course of its implementation, it caused anxiety and inconveniences to the public. I feel very sorry over that and truly apologize to the people who must have been shocked a lot,\u201d Yoon said.",
      "Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has struggled to push his agenda through an opposition-controlled parliament and grappled with low approval ratings amid scandals involving himself and his wife. In his martial law announcement on Tuesday night, Yoon called parliament a \u201cden of criminals\u201d bogging down state affairs and vowed to eliminate \u201cshameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.\u201d",
      "The declaration of martial law was the first of its kind in more than 40 years in South Korea. The turmoil has paralyzed South Korean politics and sparked alarm among key diplomatic partners like the U.S. and Japan.",
      "\u201cYoon\u2019s credibility overseas has been undermined by declaring martial law, so he won\u2019t be able to exercise leadership in his foreign policies especially when his days are numbered,\u201d Kim, the analyst, said. \u201cIts government bureaucracy will need to continue business as usual for existing alliance and foreign policy initiatives as best it can because there is a lot of important work to do globally.\u201d",
      "Tuesday night saw special forces troops encircling the parliament building and army helicopters hovering over it, but the military withdrew after the National Assembly unanimously voted to overturn the decree, forcing Yoon to lift it before daybreak Wednesday. Eighteen lawmakers from the ruling party voted to reject Yoon\u2019s martial law decree along with opposition lawmakers. PPP later decided to oppose Yoon's impeachment motion.",
      "Yoon\u2019s speech fueled speculation that he and his party may push for a constitutional amendment to shorten his term, instead of accepting impeachment, as a way to ease public anger over the marital law and facilitate Yoon\u2019s early exit from office.",
      "Lee told reporters that Yoon\u2019s speech was \u201cgreatly disappointing\u201d and that the only way forward is his immediate resignation or impeachment. His party called Yoon\u2019s martial law \u201cunconstitutional, illegal rebellion or coup.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers on Saturday first voted on a bill appointing a special prosecutor to investigate stock price manipulation allegations surrounding Yoon\u2019s wife.",
      "On Friday, Han, who criticized Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration, said he had received intelligence that during the brief period of martial law Yoon ordered the country\u2019s defense counterintelligence commander to arrest unspecified key politicians based on accusations of \u201canti-state activities.\u201d",
      "Hong Jang-won, first deputy director of South Korea\u2019s spy agency, told lawmakers Friday that Yoon had ordered him to help the defense counterintelligence unit to detain key politicians including Han, Lee and Woo.",

      "Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho has told parliament that Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun ordered the deployment of troops to the National Assembly. Opposition parties accused Kim of recommending to Yoon to enforce martial law.",

      "MANAMA, Bahrain -- At glittering ballrooms in the Mideast this weekend, discussions of the wars and chaos gripping the region gave way to one central question: What's going to happen when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month?",
      "Summits in both Bahrain and Qatar, neighboring Persian Gulf autocracies with a long history of a brothers' rivalry, saw Trump discussed in open sessions, hushed chatter and pull-aside meetings among politicians, diplomats and uniformed military officers.",
      "The reasons for the conversations are many. Chief among them is the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, with over 44,000 Palestinians killed, and the tenuous ceasefire holding in Lebanon. Israel's conduct in the wars, sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage, enraged the wider Arab world.",
      "President Joe Biden's tight embrace of Israel in the time since has alienated many. Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal, a prominent royal who led the kingdom's intelligence service for more than two decades and served as ambassador to the U.S. and Britain, referred directly to Trump's own online messages about the wars.",
      "\u201cFriendly countries in the region are hoping that Mr. Trump pursues what he started before \u2014 to bring PEACE with capital letters to the Middle East,\u201d the prince told the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Manama Dialogue in Bahrain.",
      "\u201cThe Gulf countries, including my country, Saudi Arabia, are willing to walk with you, Mr. President, to achieve this noble order. It is time for America under your presidency to change the course of this troubled region.\u201d",
      "Prince Turki underlined the standard Saudi call for a peace that requires a two-state solution for the decadeslong Israeli-Palestinian crisis to end, with a Palestinian capital in east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip and the West Bank based on 1967 borders fully under Palestinian control. But Trump in 2020 in his first term unveiled a peace plan that sided heavily with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s hard-line nationalist vision for the region and pushed aside many of the Palestinians\u2019 core demands.",
      "Biden's administration, meanwhile, made no headway on the conflict prior to the Hamas attack. Barbara A. Leaf, the top Mideast official at the U.S. State Department, described the Hamas assault as having \u201cplunged the region into renewed conflict\u201d in brief remarks at a side event in Bahrain.",
      "At the Doha Forum in Qatar, Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide referred to the Mideast before the Oct. 7 attack as \u201cnot a stable, lasting situation \u2014 it was like a minefield.\u201d Despite that, Trump's experience reaching diplomatic recognition deals for Israel with both Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates might make a larger Mideast peace deal possible, Barth Eide said.",
      "\"I think the message now from this region is that that is perfectly doable. There might actually be a major deal, but it has to happen with Palestine,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not one conflict, but there is a root conflict that connects to all of them, which is the absence of a solution to the Palestinian question.\u201d",
      "That extends all the way to Yemen, where the Houthi rebels who have held the country's capital for over a decade now have gained acclaim in the Arab world for their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over the wars. Trump listed the Houthis as a foreign terrorist group, something rescinded by the Biden administration over their assessment it halted needed aid from getting into Yemen.",
      "\u201cI think in Yemen the upcoming Trump administration is most likely going to implement heavy sanctions,\u201d said analyst Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert. \u201cThat may push the Houthis to retaliate. ... The idea that (sanctions) alone will pressure the Houthis to commit to peace and cease fire in the Red Sea \u2014 I don't think that will happen.\u201d",
      "Then there's Iran's nuclear program, which the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned Friday in Bahrain was poised to \u201cquite dramatically\u201d increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium.",
      "Yet Iranian officials and the public have been openly musing whether Trump might strike a deal with Iran \u2014 even as he was the one who unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that saw it get sanctions relief in exchange for greatly limiting its program.",
      "And finally, there's the Gulf states themselves. Some attendees at the two summits discussed their flight plans for trying to attend both. That would have been impossible during the yearslong Qatar crisis, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE cut ties and boycott Qatar from 2017 until January 2021.",
      "The crisis began after Trump's first foreign trip as president to Saudi Arabia.",

      "Israeli officials could not be immediately reached for comment on Prince Turki\u2019s remarks. The Saudis spoke at the International Institute for Security Studies\u2019 Manama Dialogue in Bahrain."

      "Romanian prosecutors have conducted raids linked to an man suspected of illegally financing a campaign to promote Calin Georgescu\u2019s presidential run",
      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian prosecutors conducted raids on Saturday linked to a man suspected of illegally financing a campaign to promote Calin Georgescu\u2019s presidential run, a day after the country\u2019s top court annulled the elections in which the far-right candidate had won the first round.",
      "The raids at three properties in the central city of Brasov were based on suspicions of voter corruption, money laundering and cyber fraud, prosecutors said, and that the funds are suspected of originating from criminal activities.",
      "The searches come after the Constitutional Court made the unprecedented decision on Friday to cancel the presidential elections, after a trove of declassified intelligence on Wednesday alleged Russia organized a sprawling campaign across platforms such as TikTok and Telegram to promote Calin Georgescu.",
      "An official in the prosecutor\u2019s office, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the case is ongoing, told The Associated Press that the searches on Saturday were conducted at properties linked to Bogdan Peschir. Intelligence alleged Peschir was a key player behind a massive TikTok campaign that promoted Georgescu.",
      "The secret services alleged that Peschir paid $381,000 (361,000 euros) to TikTok users to promote Georgescu content on the Chinese-owned platform. Intelligence authorities said information they obtained \u201crevealed an aggressive promotion campaign\u201d to increase and accelerate Georgescu\u2019s popularity.",
      "\u201cThe charge is money laundering in connection with Georgescu\u2019s financing,\u201d the official said. He added Peschir will be brought to the capital Bucharest for questioning.",
      "There is no clear link between Peschir and alleged Russian interference. Russia denies it meddling in Romania.",
      "The court\u2019s published decision to annul the elections cited the illegal use of digital technologies including artificial intelligence, as well as the use of \u201cundeclared sources of funding.\u201d",
      "Without naming Georgescu, the court said one of the 13 candidates in the Nov. 24 first round had improperly received \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d on social media, which distorted the outcome of the vote.",
      "Georgescu also denounced the court\u2019s Friday verdict as an \u201cofficialized coup\u201d and an attack on democracy.",
      "Despite being an outsider who declared zero campaign spending, Georgescu emerged as the frontrunner on Nov. 24. He was due to face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party in a runoff on Sunday.",
      "Thirteen candidates ran in the first round presidential vote in this European Union and NATO member country, and has been gripped by myriad controversies since the first round. New dates will be set to rerun the presidential vote from scratch.",
      "In a televised statement Friday, President Klaus Iohannis said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the contents of the intelligence reports, which indicated one candidate\u2019s campaign was \u201cunlawfully supported from outside Romania\u201d and was a matter of national security.",
      "\u201cThe same candidate declared zero campaign expenditures, despite running a highly sophisticated campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cIntelligence reports revealed that this candidate\u2019s campaign was supported by a foreign state with interests contrary to Romania\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Lasconi strongly condemned the court\u2019s decision, saying it was \u201cillegal, immoral, and crushes the very essence of democracy\u201d and that the second round should have gone forward.",
      "After Georgescu topped the polls in the first round, his success left many political observers wondering how most local surveys had placed him behind at least five other candidates before the vote.",
      "Many observers attributed his success to his TikTok account, which now has 6 million likes and 541,000 followers. But some experts suspected Georgescu\u2019s online following was artificially inflated while Romania\u2019s top security body alleged he was given preferential treatment by TikTok over other candidates.",
      "In a separate case on Saturday, prosecutors raided nine other properties in six counties investigating alleged extremists groups accused of \u201cpromoting violence or hatred against individuals based on their ethnicity, sexual orientation, or political opinions\u201d related to the elections.",
      "Prosecutors said they were investigating messages inciting violence against a presidential election candidate or their supporters, and the promotion of fascist, racist, or xenophobic ideologies."

      "Trump said it was a \u201cvery great honor\u201d to be there, while hinting at challenges ahead. \u201cIt certainly seems like the world is going a little crazy right now. And we\u2019ll be talking about that.\"",
      "An actual red carpet was rolled out for Trump as Macron bestowed the kind of full diplomatic welcome that France offers sitting American presidents, complete with trumpets blaring and members of the Republican Guard in full uniform. It was a clear sign that even though Trump doesn\u2019t take office until Jan. 20, 2025, Macron and other European leaders are already working to win his favor and treating him as America\u2019s representative on the world stage.",
      "President Joe Biden declined an invitation to attend the Notre Dame ceremony, marking five years after a devastating fire, and first lady Jill Biden was the official U.S. representative. The White House cited a scheduling conflict.",

      "Archbishop Laurent Ulrich roused it from its long sleep, intoning the words \u201cwake up, organ, sacred instrument.\u201d To which the gargantuan organ, perched high above the congregation, responded with a low rumble, like a dragon clearing its throat. Then, the four organists who took turns formulating improvised responses to the archbishop\u2019s prompts literally pulled out the stops and let rip.",
      "Eight times, the archbishop addressed the instrument. Eight times, it responded with a symphony of notes and sounds \u2014 as though rediscovering and relearning the joy and power from its nearly 8,000 pipes.",
      "Macron praised the bravery of fire fighters and recalled how, at 10:47 p.m. on the night of April 15, 2019, the first message came through saying that the inferno was being beaten.",
      "\u201cNotre Dame of Paris was saved. Disfigured but saved,\u201d he said. Moving onto the rebuilding effort, he detailed the toil of the more than 2,000 workers and artisans who worked to a 5-year reconstruction deadline set by Macron. \u201cWe decided to rebuild Notre Dame of Paris even more beautiful than before.\u201d",
      "Macron delivered the entire speech in French despite the multinational mix of VIP guests. At the end, Trump and Macron shook hands.",

They included world leaders like President-elect Donald Trump, U.S. first lady Jill Biden, Britain\u2019s Prince William and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Notre Dame echoed to the sound of a sustained standing ovation after the showing of a short movie that documented the gargantuan rebuilding effort by thousands of workers who labored \u2014 and ultimately met \u2014 a 5-year deadline set by French President Emmanuel Macron in the aftermath of the blaze. Outside, the word \u201cMERCI\u201d \u2014 thank you \u2014 was projected against the cathedral\u2019s iconic western facade in multiple languages.",
      "The movie showed the terrible wounds left by the inferno \u2014 the gaping holes torn into its vaulted ceilings and the burned roof. But that was followed by images of all types of artisans, many using traditional hand-craft techniques, who collectively restored Notre Dame to look better now than ever.",
      "\u201cWe went from night to light,\u201d said one of the workers in the movie.",
      "The congregation inside the huge cathedral was ghostly quiet as its largest bell, the 13-ton Emmanuel, rang out into the Paris night, signaling the start of the ceremony.",
      "Inside, Elon Musk gazed up at the renovated vaulted ceilings. Jill Biden was the last VIP welcomed outside by President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, before Archbishop Laurent Ulrich then took over.",
      "\u201cBrothers and sisters, let us enter now into Notre Dame,\u201d he said as he stood outside, before its closed doors. \u201cIt is she who accompanies us on our path to peace.\u201d",
      "He then banged on the door three times with the base of his crosier, or bishop\u2019s cross. Inside, the choir erupted into song, the crystalline voices filing what \u2014 until recently \u2014 had been a building site. Three times, Ulrich appealed to the cathedral to open its doors. Three times, the choir responded in song. He then pushed open the heavy door: Notre Dame\u2019s rebirth was underway.",
      "With three resounding knocks on its doors by Paris Archbishop Laurent Ulrich, wielding a staff carved from fire-scorched beams, the cathedral roared back to life Saturday evening.",
      "For the first time since a devastating 2019 blaze, the towering Gothic masterpiece reopened for worship, its rebirth marked by song, prayer, and awe beneath its soaring arches.",
      "While the ceremony was initially planned to begin on the forecourt, unusually fierce December winds whipping across the central Paris island, flanked by the River Seine, forced all events inside. Yet the occasion lost none of its splendor. Inside the luminous nave, choirs are singing psalms, and the cathedral\u2019s mighty organ, silent for nearly five years, is thundering to life in a triumphant interplay of melodies.",
      "The evening\u2019s celebration, being attended by more than 2,500 guests and dignitaries, including President-elect Donald Trump, U.S. First Lady Jill Biden, Britain\u2019s Prince William, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, underscores Notre Dame\u2019s enduring role as both a spiritual and cultural beacon.",
      "A small group of American expats gathered near Notre Dame Cathedral on Saturday to protest the presence of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at the reopening ceremony. Organized under the banner \u201cParis Against Trump,\u201d the group criticized French President Emmanuel Macron for inviting Trump but chose not to organize a large demonstration to avoid disrupting the event.",
      "\u201cWe find this a bit shameful and sad that Trump is invited here, especially since he has gone against everything the Church stands for,\u201d said Ehlyr O\u2019Rourke, 34, a spokesperson for the association. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand why a criminal, a sex offender, a felon can actually be invited in here.\u201d",
      "Later in the day, thousands marched through Paris, denouncing Trump\u2019s visit and expressing support for Palestine. Organized by left-wing parties, unions, and pro-Palestinian groups, the demonstration featured Palestinian flags, keffiyehs, and chants calling for Palestinian resistance, President Macron\u2019s impeachment, and criticizing Trump\u2019s alleged complicity in Middle East conflicts.",
      "\u201cWe are protesting every week to support Palestine, but what\u2019s special today is the arrival of Donald Trump,\u201d said Nadia Messai, one of the protesters in the crowd. \u201cTrump has been supporting Israel, much like the United States has been since the beginning of the creation of this rogue state that is occupying Palestine illegally.\u201d",
      "Philippe Jost, Notre Dame cathedral renovation chief, said the reopening is an opportunity for unity as so many divisions remain in the world.",
      "\u201cWe hope it will be a great moment of unity for the French people, for guests from all over the world and for spectators from all over the world,\" he said. \"Notre Dame de Paris unites. There are so many divisive factors. An event like this must unite, must help concord and peace to grow throughout the world.\u201d",
      "rector of Notre Dame and chief of the reconstruction project: (credit to Mark Carlson)",
      "Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, the Notre Dame rector called the reopening an important moment that has been awaited a long time.",
      "\u201cNotre Dame de Paris is the very sign of the presence of a soul in the heart of our city. It\u2019s important for Parisians, it\u2019s important for Catholics, it\u2019s important for the French and for the whole world,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIn general, the sphere of politics doesn\u2019t enter the sphere of the religious, and shouldn\u2019t. In the same way, the religious sphere doesn\u2019t enter politics,\u201d he added. \"The Archbishop of Paris invited the President of the Republic to speak inside the cathedral as a sign of the unity that could be seen in the reconstruction. The archbishop allowed him to speak inside because the weather conditions did not allow him to speak outside.\u201d",
      "Guests gradually filing the cathedral for the evening reopening ceremonies are reveling at the renovated interiors, with many whipping out cell phones to take souvenir photos.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sense of perfection,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Le Page, who works for the Notre Dame foundation that raised nearly half of the nearly 900 million euros of donations. He last set foot in the cathedral in 2021, on a visit",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s night and day,\u201d said Rev. Andriy Morkvas, a Ukrainian pastor who leads the The Cathedral of Saint Volodymyr the Great church in Paris\u2019 St. Germain des Pres said it had been 10 years since he last stepped foot inside Notre Dame. \u201cGod is very powerful, he can change things.\"",
      "He expressed hope that the cathedral could help bring peace to his country and he drew heart from the expected attendance of Ukraine\u2019s president.",
      "\u201cI hope Notre Dame and Mary will help us resolve this conflict,\u201d he said.",
      "Outside the Elysee Palace, the official residence of the French president, dozens of members of the French Republican Guard stood by awaiting Donald Trump\u2019s arrival.",
      "Trump was in Paris on Saturday for his first international trip as president-elect, ready to join world leaders celebrating the renovation of Notre Dame Cathedral and meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and Britain\u2019s Prince William.",
      "More than 20 French government security agents have been helping ensure Trump\u2019s safety alongside the Secret Service, according to French national police. A special French police van was providing anti-drone protection for Trump\u2019s convoy.",
      "Security was tighter than usual outside the U.S. Embassy and other sites around Paris for the Notre Dame reopening, where dozens of international VIPs were expected.",
      "Macron, who has had an up-and-down relationship with Trump, has made a point of cultivating a relationship since the Republican defeated Democrat Kamala Harris last month. But Macron\u2019s office nonetheless played down the significance of the invitation, saying other politicians not now in office had been invited as well.",
      "Trump was invited as president-elect of a \u201cfriendly nation,\u201d Macron\u2019s office said, adding, \u201cThis is in no way exceptional, we\u2019ve done it before.\u201d",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly for such a big cathedral, some of the numbers that help tell the story of Notre Dame\u2019s reopening are on the very big side, too. The bell that will sound to signal the start of the service weighs 13 tons, making it the cathedral\u2019s largest. It has a name - Emmanuel \u2013 given to it by King Louis XIV after it was cast in 1683. It rings in F sharp.",
      "Inside, 42,000 square meters of stonework were cleaned during the renovation \u2014 an area equivalent to roughly six soccer pitches. The first stone of Notre Dame was laid in 1163. The thunderous great organ of Notre Dame that will be heard in public at Saturday\u2019s service for the first time since April 15, 2019, has 7,952 pipes \u2014 the largest as broad as a human torso; the smallest no larger than a pen. The renovated giant console that controls the instrument has five keyboards of 56 notes each, foot pedals for 30 notes, and 115 stops.",
      "Unseen, above the congregation and the repaired vaulted ceilings, is a framework of beams holding up the roof and spire \u2013 so dense and intricate that it\u2019s nicknamed \u201cthe forest.\u201d Some 2,000 oak trees were felled to rebuild it.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump is to meet Saturday with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee presidential palace ahead of the reopening ceremony for Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. This is Trump\u2019s first foreign trip since the election.",
      "Macron\u2019s office said both leaders will discuss global crisis, including wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine as well as French-American bilateral relations.",
      "Macron is scheduled to have a meeting with Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy right after his meeting with Trump.",
      "Notre Dame celebrations comes as Macron\u2019s presidency now faces its gravest crisis after the government\u2019s collapse this week in a historic no-confidence vote that toppled Prime Minister Michel Barnier.",
      "For devout Catholics Patricia and Cyrille Brenner, waiting in the cold outside Notre Dame for its reopening service that they weren\u2019t invited to was the place to be. The couple traveled by night train from Cannes on the French Riviera \u2013 famous for its movie festival \u2013 to be among the onlookers Saturday hoping for some of the 40,000 spots set aside for the public on the banks of the River Seine facing the cathedral. They bought their train tickets six months ago.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m from Cannes. It\u2019s a bit like the festival. You have to be there to experience it,\u201d said Patricia, 65. \u201cIt\u2019s a pilgrimage for us.\u201d",
      "Cyrille, 66, said they were the only members of their parish to make the long trip. \u201cWe like to be at the heart of things and, as Christians, it will nourish us,\u201d he said.",
      "While Cyrille said they\u2019d felt \u201cdistress, sadness\u201d when Notre Dame burned, they both also noted how sacred relics, statues and the golden cross on the altar \u2013 almost miraculously \u2013 survived the inferno.",
      "They both marveled at the renovation works that have not only eradicated nearly all traces of the fire inside but made it more resplendent than ever.",
      "Andrey Alexeev, a Ukrainian among onlookers gathering for the reopening of Notre Dame, hopes U.S. president-elect Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy can meet and talk on the ceremony\u2019s sidelines. Their host, French President Emmanuel Macron, was meeting with both leaders before they attend the reopening service for the cathedral.",
      "Alexeev was hoping Trump and Zelenskyy would meet, too. \u201cI hope that meeting can change something in a good way for Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good that Zelenskyy has a chance to speak with Trump and Macron. At least it\u2019s an opportunity for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Alexeev, who lives in Poland, was visiting Paris with his mother, Olha, who travelled from Ukraine. They were hoping for two of the 40,000 places that were set aside for the public in fenced-off areas on the banks of the River Seine, facing the cathedral. Alexeev said he\u2019s agnostic but that it felt important for him to be as close to the ceremonies as possible. By coincidence, his sister was visiting Paris when Notre Dame burned on April 15, 2019.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the greatest places not only in Europe but also the whole world,\u201d he said. Such an occasion \u201chappens once in 1,000 years, I think. So we are part of history.\u201d",
      "Saturday\u2019s events will blend solemn religious tradition with an official presidential speech and cultural grandeur.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte will welcome the dozens of heads of state and government. Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will then take over \u2014 with a rite to symbolically reopen Notre Dame\u2019s doors, kicking off the ceremonies at 7 p.m.",
      "The ceremony that was to have been held outside will then unfold inside, with a film retracing the renovations, music and a speech by Macron.",
      "Ulrich will then take over again, with a rite to reawaken Notre Dame\u2019s organ and the rest of the religious service scheduled to last about 55 minutes.",
      "PARIS \u2014 After more than 5 years of renovation, the reopening of Notre Dame \u2014 like the Paris Olympics before it \u2014 has fallen victim to bad weather.",
      "Forecasted strong winds have upended the running order of the reopening ceremonies on Saturday evening, and forced the whole thing indoors.",
      "The original plan was for an initial outdoor state ceremony led by President Emmanuel Macron, after which Archbishop Laurent Ulrich was to have taken over, leading rites and a religious service inside the cathedral. Those plans would have emphasized France\u2019s carefully policed divide between state and church.",
      "But expected stormy winds prompted the Paris diocese and Macron\u2019s office to telescope the ceremonies together, now all to be held inside the cathedral.",
      "It\u2019s the second time this year that weather has intervened in significant moments for Paris. Rains drenched the July 26 opening ceremony of the Summer Games, dampening the show and the spirits of some spectators."

      "France\u2019s iconic Notre Dame Cathedral has formally reopened its doors for the first time since a devastating fire nearly destroyed the 861-year-old landmark in 2019",
      "PARIS -- Howling winds couldn\u2019t stop Notre Dame Cathedral \u2019s heart from beating again.",
      "With three resounding knocks on its doors by Paris Archbishop Laurent Ulrich, wielding a specially designed crosier carved from fire-scorched beams, the monument roared back to life Saturday evening. For the first time since a devastating blaze nearly destroyed it in 2019, the towering Gothic masterpiece reopened for worship, its rebirth marked by song, prayer, and awe beneath its soaring arches.",
      "The ceremony, initially planned to begin on the forecourt, was moved entirely inside due to unusually fierce December winds sweeping across the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, flanked by the River Seine. Yet the occasion lost none of its splendor. Inside the luminous nave, choirs sang psalms, and the cathedral\u2019s mighty organ, silent for nearly five years, thundered to life in a triumphant interplay of melodies.",
      "The restoration, a spectacular achievement in just five years for a structure that took nearly two centuries to build, is seen as a moment of triumph for French President Emmanuel Macron, who championed the ambitious timeline \u2014 and a welcome respite from his domestic political woes.",
      "The evening\u2019s celebration, attended by 1,500 dignitaries, including President-elect Donald Trump, US first lady Jill Biden, Britain\u2019s Prince William, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, underscored Notre Dame\u2019s enduring role as both a spiritual and cultural beacon. Observers see the event as Macron's, and his intention to pivot it into a fully fledged diplomatic gathering, while highlighting France\u2019s ability to unite on the global stage despite internal political crises.",
      "As the cathedral\u2019s largest bell, the 13-ton Emmanuel \u2014 which was not named after the French leader \u2014 tolled into the Paris night, signaling the start of the ceremony, the crowd inside Notre Dame fell into an expectant hush. Emmanuel, a legacy of King Louis XIV, had rung through centuries of French history, and its peal now resonated as a call to witness another epochal moment.",
      "Outside the cathedral\u2019s monumental doors, Ulrich raised his fire-scarred crosier. \u201cBrothers and sisters, let us enter now into Notre Dame,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt is she who accompanies us on our path to peace.\u201d",
      "With the congregation of over 2,500 people watching in silence, Ulrich struck the floodlit doors, the base of his crosier reverberating against the wood. Inside, the choir answered with soaring hymns, their voices filling the nave. Illuminations on the cathedral facade heightened the drama. On the final strike, the heavy doors swung open, revealing the glowing interior of restored blond Lutetian limestone.",
      "Adding to the ceremony\u2019s visual splendor, Ulrich and the clergy wore vibrant liturgical garments designed by French fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac. Known for his signature pop-art aesthetic, Castelbajac created 2,000 colorful pieces for 700 celebrants, blending modern elements with medieval touches.",
      "Flooded with light and song, the cathedral came alive in a moment of breathtaking spectacle. What had been a silent, soot-blackened ruin five years ago now blazed with renewed vitality, marking the culmination of a nearly $1 billion global effort to resurrect it.",
      "Speaking inside the cathedral, Macron expressed \u201cgratitude\u201d Saturday to those who saved, helped, and rebuilt Notre Dame, his voice reverberating through the nave.",
      "\u201cI stand before you ... to express the gratitude of the French nation,\u201d he said, before voices flooded the space with song, harmonies not heard in over five years.",
      "\u201cTonight, the bells of Notre Dame are ringing again. And in a moment, the organ will awaken,\u201d sending the \u201cmusic of hope\u201d cascading through the luminous interior to Parisians, France, and the world beyond, he said.",
      "The celebration is expected to give a much-needed boost to the embattled French leader, whose prime minister was ousted this week, plunging the nation\u2019s politics into more turmoil.",
      "Macron has called Notre Dame\u2019s reopening \u201ca jolt of hope.\u201d Observers say he hoped the occasion would briefly silence his critics and showcase France\u2019s unity and resilience under his leadership \u2014 a rare moment of grace in a presidency now facing a grave crisis.",
      "Inside Notre Dame, 42,000 square meters of stonework\u2014equivalent to six soccer pitches\u2014gleamed anew, revealing intricate carvings and luminous limestone. Above, 2,000 oak beams, nicknamed \u201cthe forest,\u201d restored the cathedral\u2019s iconic spire and roof.",
      "The great organ, dormant for over five years, roared back to life like a slumbering giant. With its 7,952 pipes\u2014ranging from pen-sized to torso-wide\u2014and a renovated console featuring five keyboards, 115 stops, and 30 foot pedals, it responded to Archbishop Laurent Ulrich\u2019s command: \u201cWake up, organ, sacred instrument.\u201d",
      "The first low rumble grew into a triumphant symphony as four organists pulled out the stops, weaving improvised responses to the archbishop\u2019s invocations. Eight times, Ulrich addressed the organ; eight times, its voice filled the nave with breathtaking sound.",
      "Guests marveled at the spectacle, many capturing the moment on their phones. \u201cIt\u2019s a sense of perfection,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Le Page of the Notre Dame Foundation, who last saw the cathedral cloaked in scaffolding in 2021. \u201cIt was somber then. Now, it\u2019s night and day.\u201d",
      "The Rev. Andriy Morkvas, a Ukrainian priest who leads the Volodymyr Le Grand church in Paris, reflected on his first visit to Notre Dame in over a decade. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize it,\u201d he said. \u201cGod is very powerful; He can change things.\u201d He expressed hope that the cathedral\u2019s revival could inspire peace in his homeland, drawing strength from the presence of Ukraine\u2019s president. \u201cI think that will have a big impact,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope Notre Dame and Mary will help us resolve this conflict.\u201d",
      "The reopening of Notre Dame comes at a time of profound global unrest, with wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "For Catholics, Notre Dame\u2019s rector said the cathedral \u201ccarries the enveloping presence of the Virgin Mary, a maternal and embracing presence.\u2033",
      "\u201cIt is a magnificent symbol of unity,\u201d Olivier Ribadeau Dumas said. \u201cNotre Dame is not just a French monument \u2014 it is a magnificent sign of hope.\u201d",
      "The international range of dignitaries coming to Paris underline the cathedral\u2019s significance as a symbol of shared heritage and peace.",
      "Canadian visitor Noelle Alexandria, who had traveled to Paris for the reopening, was struck by the cathedral\u2019s ability to inspire. \u201cShe\u2019s been nearly ruined before, but she always comes back,\u201d Alexandria said. \u201cNot many of us could say the same after such tragedy, but Notre Dame can.\u201d",
      "Guests entered through Notre Dame\u2019s iconic western fa\u00e7ade, whose arched portals adorned with biblical carvings were once a visual guide for medieval believers. Above the central Portal of the Last Judgment, the Archangel Michael is depicted weighing souls, as demons attempt to tip the scales. These stone figures, designed to inspire both awe and fear, set the stage for a ceremony steeped in history.",
      "Inside, the hum of hundreds of guests awaiting the service filled the cathedral with human sounds once more \u2014 a stark contrast to the construction din that echoed there for years. Tuners restoring the great organ often worked through the night to find the silence needed to perfect its 7,952 pipes, ranging from pen-sized to torso-wide.",
      "Notre Dame echoed to the sound of a sustained standing ovation after the showing of a short movie that documented the gargantuan rebuilding effort. Outside, the word \u201cMERCI\u201d \u2014 thank you \u2014 was projected against the cathedral\u2019s iconic western facade. The movie showed the terrible wounds left by the inferno \u2014 the gaping holes torn into its vaulted ceilings and the burned roof.",
      "But that was followed by images of all types of artisans, many using traditional handicraft techniques, who collectively restored Notre Dame to look better now than ever. \"We went from night to light,\" said one of the workers in the movie.",
      "Security will be high through the weekend, echoing measures taken during the Paris Olympics earlier this year.",
      "The \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 \u2014 the small island in the River Seine that is home to Notre Dame and the historic heart of Paris\u2014 is closed to tourists and non-residents. Police vans and barriers blocked cobblestoned streets in a large perimeter around the island, while soldiers in thick body armor and sniffer dogs patrolled embankments. A special security detail is following Trump.",
      "Public viewing areas along the Seine\u2019s southern bank will accommodate 40,000 spectators, who can follow the celebrations on large screens.",
      "For many, Notre Dame\u2019s rebirth is not just a French achievement but a global one \u2014 after the reopening, the cathedral is set to welcome 15 million visitors annually, up from 12 million before the fire.",

      "Although 12 candidates are running for president, Saturday\u2019s election \u2014 like others since the return of multiparty politics in 1992 \u2014 has emerged as a two-horse race.",
      "Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia is the candidate of the ruling New Patriotic Party, or NPP, which has struggled to resolve the economic crisis. He faces off against former President John Dramani Mahama, the leader of the main opposition party National Democratic Congress, or NDC.

      "Members of parliament will also be elected Saturday. The ruling NPP party and the main opposition NDC each have 137 members in the 275-member legislature, with one independent member who has been voting mostly along with the ruling party. One more constituency will be added in this election, bringing the number of deputies to 276.",

      "Mahama, 65, on the other hand, restated his promise to \u201creset\u201d the country on various fronts. \u201cWe need to reset our democracy, governance, economy, finances, agriculture, infrastructure, environment, health sector, and all that we hold dear as a people,\u201d the former president said.",
      "Across the the capital, Accra, the mood for the election has been upbeat in posters and billboards with bikers displaying stunts, political rallies on the streets, election jingles and songs blasting from public speakers.",
      "But the concern for many is also palpable for the key thing at stake: The country\u2019s ailing economy, which has been challenged on various fronts in recent years.",
      "The country defaulted on most of its foreign debt last year as it faced a worsening economic crisis that spiked the price of fuel, food and other essential items. The inflation rate had hit 54% by the end of last year and though it\u2019s been coming down since then, not many Ghanaians can still tell the difference when they go to the market.",
      "Ebenezer Kotey Dsane, a 69-year-old driver said he voted for Mahama because \u201che is a good man\u201d who \u201cset up much infrastructure when he was in office.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe current regime hasn't done much,\u201d he said, pointing to the La General Hospital in Accra, one of the capital's main medical facilities, pulled down in July 2020 by the current government with a pledge to reconstruct it. \u201cUntil today, nothing has happened.\u201d",

      "MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Nearly 50 survivors of a migrant boat tragedy last month that left 25 people dead in the Indian Ocean off Madagascar arrived back in Somalia on Saturday and were received by government officials.",
      "The survivors aged 17 to 50 wore outfits made of fabric with the Somali national flag colors as they disembarked from a plane in the capital, Mogadishu, visibly relieved to return to safety.",
      "Many young Somalis embark every year on dangerous journeys in search of better opportunities abroad. The U.N. agency has previously raised concerns over the rise in irregular migration from Horn of Africa countries as people flee from conflict and drought.",
      "The survivors told The Associated Press that they were stranded in the ocean for 13 days after their boat's engines failed.",
      "Ahmed Hussein, who was traveling with his now-deceased cousin, said they were heading to Europe hoping for a better life. Two vessels carrying the migrants departed Somalia early last month.",
      "\u201cWe were split into two small boats. The engine broke down, and we drifted at sea for 13 days with no functioning engine. We had no food or water, and the (few) dates we had ran out during those 13 days. We survived by catching some fish,\u201d he said.",
      "Officials in Madagascar and Somalia had earlier said the boats capsized but offered no further explanation. The authorities had also put the number of survivors at 48 but only 47 arrived in Somalia and the whereabouts of one survivor remained unclear as officials who received the 47 did not comment.",
      "The boats left from a beach near the Somali capital, Mogadishu, on Nov. 2 with 73 people on board and were believed to be headed to the French region of Mayotte, according to Jean-Edmond Randrianantenaina, the head of Madagascar\u2019s Maritime Ports Agency. Mayotte, an archipelago, is around 1,600 kilometers (990 miles) from Mogadishu.",
      "Abdirashid Ibrahim, another survivor, recalled how some survivors had swollen ankles and couldn\u2019t walk after being rescued. \u201cOn the boat, we had nowhere to sleep, no food, and we were crammed together. Some people died from shock, and others succumbed to starvation,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "Abdulkadir Burgal, the director of the Africa Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who was at the airport to receive the survivors, told journalists that some of the people who helped the migrants embark on the dangerous journey had been arrested while others died in the incident.",
      "\u201cEight people involved in the trafficking of Somali migrants have been arrested,\u201d he said.",
      "Maryan Yasin, the president's special envoy for migration, said the survivors were happy to be home.",
      "\u201cThey assured me they will never take the same risk again. The Somali government is committed to finding a resolution, and this resolution will be a collective effort,\u201d she said."

      "A political party in North Macedonia has demanded authorities ban social networks whose content incites violence and self-destructive behavior after several young people were seriously injured in connection with the popular \u201cSuperman challenge\u201d on TikTok",
      "SKOPJE, North Macedonia -- A political party in North Macedonia on Saturday demanded authorities ban social networks whose content incites violence and self-destructive behavior after several young people were seriously injured in connection with the popular \u201cSuperman challenge\u201d on TikTok.",
      "Health authorities said at least 17 students, ages 10 to 17, were brought to hospitals in the capital Skopje and other towns over the past week with broken bones, contusions and bruises. The children were injured after being thrown into the air by their friends to fly like superheroes and get applause on the internet.",
      "The Liberal-Democratic Party, which was part of the left-led coalition that ruled the country from 2016 to earlier in 2024, issued a press statement Saturday strongly condemning \u201cthe irresponsible spread of dangerous content on social media, such as the latest TikTok 'challenge' known as \u2018Superman,\u2019 which has injured six children across (the country) in the past 24 hours.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe lack of adequate control over the content of social media allows such \u2018games\u2019 to reach the most vulnerable users,\u201d the party statement said. It demanded the \u201cimmediate introduction of measures to ban content that incites violence and self-destructive behavior, increase surveillance, and sanction platforms that enable dangerous trends.\u201d",
      "North Macedonia\u2019s education minister Vesna Janevska said students should focus on education, not TikTok challenges.",
      "\u201cThe ban on mobile phones in schools will not have an effect. Phones will be available to children in their homes, neighborhoods and other environments,\u201d she said.",
      "Psychologists have warned that the desire to be \u201cin\u201d with the trends on social networks, combined with excessive use of mobile phones, is the main reason for the rise in risky behaviors among children. They urged parents and schools to talk with students."

      "The Hospital de Jesus in Mexico City\u2019s bustling historic center covers most of a city block",
      "MEXICO CITY -- In Mexico City\u2019s bustling historic center, the Hospital de Jesus covers most of a city block. Its faded unassuming yellow facade, characteristic of the middle of the last century, obscures the medical center within founded 500 years ago by Spanish conqueror Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.",
      "Entering between street-level shoe stores, visitors find the oldest continuously operating hospital in the Americas. Stone arches lead to expansive patios filled with lush vegetation.",
      "The hospital was founded to treat the conquering Spanish, then later opened to the local Indigenous inhabitants to ensure a healthy workforce. Today it provides 24/7 emergency care, as well as affordable access to medical specialists for current residents of what was at the time of its founding the center of the Aztec empire.",
      "\u201cYou can feel the Mexican heritage here,\u201d said Dr. Pedro \u00c1lvarez S\u00e1nchez. \u201cFor 500 years, the hospital has never closed its doors.\u201d",
      "On Nov. 8, 1519, Cort\u00e9s and his soldiers entered Tenochtitlan, the Aztec name for the capital, and met Aztec emperor Moctezuma in a place known as Huitzilan, just in front of the present-day hospital.",
      "Cort\u00e9s had conquered the city by 1521, and to honor that original encounter, he founded the hospital in 1524.",
      "The meeting of Cort\u00e9s and Moctezuma is depicted in a floor-to-ceiling tile mural beside one of the central patios. The main temple of Tenochtitlan \u2014 only a few blocks from the hospital \u2014 sits in the background. The union of two suns represents the meeting of two cultures.",
      "Cort\u00e9s is buried in a small church adjacent to the hospital. Descendants of him and Moctezuma met here in 2019 to mark the anniversary of that initial encounter.",
      "Around the world, only a handful of hospitals can boast such longevity. For example, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital in London founded in 1123 and Bellevue Hospital in New York City founded in 1736 also continue to provide full medical services.",
      "Much of the hospital has remained intact thanks to a board of trustees founded in the 16th century. Over the years, countless doctors have quietly worked to conserve the hospital\u2019s mission of affordable care and to preserve the building\u2019s unique architectural features.",
      "\u201cWe want to ensure that this hospital continues to provide quality medical attention to patients,\u201d said Dr. Octaviano Rosalez Seraf\u00edn, 71, president of the hospital\u2019s board of trustees. \u201cWe want to continue the tradition of care the hospital has had for years.\u201d",
      "Celia Ch\u00e1vez Escamilla, 56, arrived at the hospital at dawn recently for an appointment with her dermatologist. \u201cHere they take good care of us,\u201d said Ch\u00e1vez. \u201cThe prices here are accessible. If you go somewhere else it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d Her consultation was just 400 pesos or under $20.",
      "Escamilla was accompanied by her daughter Myriam Rafael Sanchez, 26, who was fascinated by the medical center. \u201cI\u2019ve seen (the hospital) a lot in movies and TV shows,\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cWe have all of Mexico\u2019s history around us.\u201d",
      "The hospital didn\u2019t always serve the entire public, according to Sandra Elena Guevara Flores, an anthropologist focusing on medicine at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
      "Guevara said the hospital was not open to the Indigenous population initially, but only to the Spanish who had recently arrived in the Americas.",
      "However, as epidemics began to spread, the hospital opened its doors to more patients. \u201cIt was a strategy by the Spanish governors in the new Spain to treat the whole population,\u201d said Guevara. \u201cIt (was) so the servants and the whole labor system wouldn\u2019t die.\u201d",
      "Early Spanish doctors at the hospital often used native Mexican herbs to cure their patients. \u201cIt\u2019s said that traditional Galenic Hippocratic medicine was used in the hospital, but really it was Indigenous medicine,\u201d said Guevara. \u201cThey (Indigenous peoples) would share their knowledge.\u201d",
      "The Spanish imprint can be seen in the hospital\u2019s architecture, said Hugo Antonio Arciniega \u00c1vila, a historian and archaeological expert from the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
      "The hospital, like some other colonial structures in Mexico City, is \u2018encapsulated\u2019 inside a newer building from the 1950s.",
      "Because the Spanish built low stone structures on huge lots with massive stone walls, people who wanted to build newer facilities a century or two later would often just build over, around or among the colonial-era structures. Sometimes they would incorporate the old masonry walls into the new building, either for preservation reasons or because it was cheaper to use them than to tear them down. So from the street, there is often no sign that behind a Victorian or functionalist facade, there is a partially preserved Spanish structure within.",
      "The hospital was built in the form of a T, with two large patios and a grand staircase devised by Spanish architect Claudio de Arciniega in the 16th century. The design provided constant ventilation and sunshine to patients. The architect also included a chapel on each of the two original floors.",
      "\u201cThe architecture of this hospital is fascinating,\u201d said Arciniega about the intentional layout of religious spaces and access to open air. \u201cIf you cure the soul, you can cure the body \u2013 it\u2019s the same way the doctors thought.\u201d",
      "For the 67-year-old \u00c1lvarez, who has worked at the hospital for nearly 50 years and also serves as the board of trustees\u2019 treasurer, the center has been a constant in his life. He began working at the hospital as a lab assistant at age 18.",
      "\u201cA lot of people ask me, why do you keep working at the Hospital de Jesus?\u201d he said. \u201cI tell them because I love it.\u201d",

      "Some 18.7 million people are registered to vote in presidential and legislative elections but the two main candidates offer little hope for change for the nation. Ghana used to be a poster child for democracy in the region, but in recent years has struggled with a profound economic crisis, including surging inflation and a lack of jobs.",
      "At a time when democracy in western Africa is threatened by coups, Ghana has emerged as a beacon of democratic stability with a history of peaceful elections. It had also been an economic powerhouse, priding itself on its economic development.",

      "Although 12 candidates are running to become Ghana\u2019s next president, Saturday\u2019s election \u2014 like previous ones since the return of multiparty politics in 1992 \u2014 has emerged as a two-horse race.",
      "Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia is the candidate of the New Patriotic Party, or NPP, government that has struggled to resolve the economic crisis. He faces off against former President John Dramani Mahama, the leader of the main opposition party National Democratic Congress, or NDC. He was voted out in 2016 after failing to deliver on promises for the economy.",

The ruling NPP party and the main opposition NDC each have 137 members in the 275 member legislature, with one independent member who has been voting mostly along with the ruling party. One more constituency will be allowed to vote in this election, bringing the number of deputies to 276.",

      "Across the the capital of Accra, the mood for the election has been upbeat in posters and billboards with bikers displaying stunts, political rallies on the streets, election jingles and songs blasting from public speakers.",
      "But the concern for many is also palpable for the key thing at stake: The country\u2019s ailing economy, which has been challenged on various fronts in recent years.",

      "The organization said five of the journalists \u2013 Aynur Ganbarova, Aytaj Ahmadova, Khayala Agayeva, Natig Javadli and Aysel Umudova \u2013 were Meydan TV employees. It described a sixth person, Ramin Jabrayilzade, as an independent reporter.",
      "Meydan TV, which is headquartered in Berlin and whose website has been blocked in Azerbaijan since 2019, has complained of harassment by the Azerbaijani government. It refuted the charges against its employees and said that most of the detained journalists had had their homes searched and equipment and personal belongings seized.",

      "As the search for UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson\u2019s killer stretches into a fourth day and beyond the New York City limits, investigators are reckoning with a tantalizing dichotomy",
      "NEW YORK -- They have seen him smiling on a hostel security camera, but don\u2019t know his name. They found the backpack he discarded while fleeing, but don\u2019t know where he went.",
      "As the search for UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson\u2019s killer goes on, investigators are reckoning with a tantalizing dichotomy: They have troves of evidence, but the shooter remains an enigma.",
      "Police don\u2019t know who he is, where he is, or why he did it \u2014 though they are confident that it was a targeted attack instead of a random act.",
      "\u201cThe net is getting tighter,\u201d New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Saturday.",
      "Hours after he spoke, police divers were seen searching a pond in Central Park, where the killer fled after the shooting. Officers have been scouring the park for days for any possible clues.",
      "Retracing the gunman\u2019s steps using surveillance video, police say, it appears he left the city by bus soon after the shooting Wednesday morning outside the New York Hilton Midtown. He was seen on video at an uptown bus station about 45 minutes later, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said.",
      "With the high-profile search expanding across state lines, the FBI announced late Friday that it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction, adding to a reward of up to $10,000 that the NYPD offered. Police say they believe the suspect acted alone.",
      "Police provided no new updates on the hunt Saturday, but investigators are urging patience, even with shooter on the loose. Hundreds of detectives are combing through video recordings and social media, vetting tips from the public and interviewing people who might have information, including Thompson\u2019s family and coworkers and the shooter\u2019s randomly assigned roommates at the Manhattan hostel where he stayed.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Blue Bloods.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to solve this in 60 minutes,\" Kenny told reporters Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across.\u201d",
      "The shooter paid cash at the hostel, presented what police believe was a fake ID and is believed to have paid cash for taxi rides and other transactions. He didn't speak to others at the hostel and almost always kept his face covered with a mask, only lowering it while eating.",
      "But investigators caught a break when they came across security camera images of an unguarded moment in which he briefly showed his face soon after arriving in New York on Nov. 24.",
      "Police distributed the images to news outlets and on social media but so far haven't been able to ID him using facial recognition \u2014 possibly because of the angle of the images or limitations on the use of the technology, Kenny said.",
      "On Friday evening, investigators found a backpack in Central Park that had been worn by the gunman, police said. They didn\u2019t immediately reveal what, if anything, it contained but said it would be tested and analyzed.",
      "Another potential clue, a fingerprint on an item he purchased at a Starbucks minutes before the shooting, has so far proven useless for identifying him, Kenny said.",
      "Aided by surveillance cameras on nearly every building and block, police have been able to retrace the shooter\u2019s movements.",
      "They know he ambushed Thompson at 6:44 a.m. as the executive arrived at the Hilton for his company\u2019s annual investor conference, using a 9 mm pistol that resembled the guns farmers use to put down animals without causing a loud noise. They know ammunition found near Thompson\u2019s body bore the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d mimicking a phrase used by insurance industry critics.",
      "Kenny said the fact that the shooter knew UnitedHealthcare group was holding a conference at the hotel and what route Thompson might take to get there suggested that he could possibly be a disgruntled employee or client.",

Investigators were looking at whether the shooter may have been a disgruntled employee or client of the insurer, Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters.",

      "Police didn\u2019t immediately reveal what, if anything, it contained but said it would be analyzed for clues.",
      "The gunman made sure to conceal his identity with a mask during almost all of his time in the city, including during the attack and while he ate, yet left a trail of evidence in view of the nation\u2019s biggest city and its network of security cameras.",

      "The gunman got off a bus that originated in Atlanta and made several stops along the way, Kenny said. Police have not determined where he got on the bus. Investigators have a list of passengers, but none of them would have had to provide an ID when they climbed aboard, Kenny said.",

      "\u201cFrom every indication we have from witnesses, from the Starbucks, from the hostel, he kept his mask on at all times except for the one instance where we have him photographed with the mask off,\u201d Kenny said.",
      "His roommates at the hostel also said he didn\u2019t speak to them. Nothing of investigative value was found in a search of the suspected shooter\u2019s hotel room.",

We\u2019re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across. Eventually, when an apprehension is made, we will have to present all of these facts to a judge and jury, so we\u2019re taking our time, doing it right and making sure we\u2019re going to get justice for this victim and closure for his family.\u201d",
      "Security video of the shooting shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind, firing several shots with a gun equipped with a silencer, barely pausing to clear a jam while the executive fell to the sidewalk.",
      "Police were looking into the possibility that the weapon was a veterinary pistol, which is a weapon commonly used on farms and ranches if an animal has to be euthanized quietly, Kenny said \u2014 though he stressed that hadn\u2019t been confirmed.",

      "Doctors are included in an insurer\u2019s network one year but not the next. Getting someone on the phone to help can be next to impossible. Coverage of care and prescriptions is often unceremoniously denied.",
      "This week\u2019s fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has unleashed a wave of public feeling \u2014 exasperation, anger, resentment, helplessness \u2014 from Americans sharing personal stories of interactions with insurance companies, often seen as faceless corporate giants.",
      "In particular, the words written on ammunition found at the shooting scene \u2014 \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d echoing a phrase used to describe how insurers dodge claim payouts \u2014 amplified voices that have long been critical of the industry.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden, I am fired up again,\u201d said Tim Anderson, describing how his wife, Mary, had to deal with UnitedHealthcare coverage denials before she died from Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in 2022.",
      "Anderson said they couldn\u2019t get coverage for machines to help his wife breathe or talk \u2014 toward the end, she communicated by blinking when he showed her pictures. The family had to rely on donations from a local ALS group, he said.",
      "\u201cThe business model for insurance is don\u2019t pay,\u201d said Anderson, 67, of Centerville, Ohio.",
      "\u201cWhen Mary could still talk, she said to me to keep fighting this,\u201d he added. \u201cIt needs to be exposed.\u201d",
      "For Anderson and others, Thompson's death and the message left at the scene have created an opportunity to vent their frustrations. Conversations at dinner tables, office water coolers, social gatherings and on social media have pivoted to the topic, as police efforts to find the gunman keep the case in the news.",
      "Hans Maristela said he understands why the chatter is bubbling up. The 54-year-old caregiver in California was moved to comment on Facebook about UnitedHealthcare's reputation of denying coverage. As a Catholic, he said, he grieves Thompson's death and feels for his family, especially with the holidays around the corner.",
      "But he sees frustration with insurers even among his clients, most of them wealthy older people who've not been shielded from high out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\u201cAnd then you know the CEO of this company you pay a lot of money to gets $10 million dollars a year, you won\u2019t have a lot of sympathy for the guy,\" Maristela said, citing Thompson's compensation package that included base pay and stock options. \u201cHealth care is a business, I understand, but the obsession with share price, with profit, has to be reevaluated.\u201d",
      "University of Pennsylvania researcher Michael Anne Kyle said she's not surprised by the growth of conversation around insurers.",
      "\u201cPeople are often struggling with this by themselves, and when you see someone else talk about it, that may prompt you to join the conversation,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle studies how patients access care and said she's seen frustration with the system build for years. Costs are rising, and insurers are using more controls such as prior authorizations and doctor networks to manage them. Patients are often stuck in the middle of disputes between doctors and insurers.",
      "\u201cPatients are already spending a lot of money on health care, and then they\u2019re still facing problems with the service,\u201d she said.",
      "Insurers often note that most of the money they bring in goes back out the door to pay claims, and that they try to corral soaring costs and the overuse of some care.",
      "In Ohio, Anderson said his initial reaction to the CEO shooting was to question whether it was connected to a coverage denial, like the ones he'd experienced with his wife.",
      "\u201cI definitely do not condone killing people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I read it and said, 'I wonder if somebody had a spouse whose coverage was denied.\u2019\u201d",
      "It's something Will Flanary, a Portland-based ophthalmologist and comedian with a large social media following, saw online a lot in the shooting's immediate aftermath and found very telling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s zero sympathy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lesson to take away from that is not, \u2018Let\u2019s shame people for celebrating a murder.\u2019 No, it\u2019s: \u2018Look at the amount of anger that people have toward this system that\u2019s taken advantage of people and do something to try to fix that.\u2019\u201d",
      "Flanary's content, published under the name Dr. Glaucomflecken, started out as niche eye doctor jokes and a way to cope with his own experiences with two cancer diagnoses and a sudden cardiac arrest. But it has evolved, featuring character skits that call attention to and satirize the decisions of large health insurers, including UnitedHealthcare.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m always talking about how powerful social media can be with advocacy,\" he said, \"because it really is the only way to put a significant amount of pressure on these corporations who are doing bad things for patients.\u201d",

      "The appeals court ruling, written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, said the law was \u201ccarefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary.\" The judges also rejected the claim that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, Ginsburg wrote the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \u201csuppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance are expected to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, but it's unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "TikTok indicated in a statement on Friday the two companies are preparing to take their case to high court, saying the Supreme Court has \u201can established historical record of protecting Americans\u2019 right to free speech.\"",
      "\"We expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\u201d a company spokesperson said.",
      "Alan Morrison, a professor at The George Washington University Law School, said he expects the Supreme Court to take up the case because of the novelty of the issues raised in the lawsuit. If that happens, attorneys for the two companies still have to convince the court to grant them an emergency stay that will prevent the government from enforcing the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline stipulated in the law, Morrison said.",
      "Such a move could drag out the process until the Justices make a ruling.",
      "Tiffany Cianci, a TikTok content creator who has supported the platform, said she was not shocked about the outcome of the court's ruling on Friday because lower courts typically defer to the executive branch on these types of cases. She believes the company will have a stronger case at the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI believe that the next stages are more likely to produce a victory for TikTokers and for TikTok as a whole,\u201d Cianci said.",
      "Another wild card is President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the recent presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "The Trump transition team has not offered details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok.\" But spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last month that he plans to \u201cdeliver\u201d on his campaign promises.",
      "After Trump takes office on Jan. 20th, it would fall on his Justice Department to enforce the law and punish any potential violators. Penalties would apply to any app stores that would violate a prohibition on TikTok and to internet hosting services which would be barred from supporting it.",
      "Some have speculated that Trump could ask his Justice Department to abstain from enforcing the law. But tech companies like Apple and Google, which offer TikTok's app on their app stores, would then have to trust that the administration would not come after them for any violations.",
      "Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said enforcement discretion \u2014 or executive orders \u2014 can not override existing law, leaving Trump with \u201climited room for unilateral action.\"",
      "There are other things Trump could potentially do. It's possible he could invoke provisions of the law that allow the president to determine whether a sale or a similar transaction frees TikTok from \u201cforeign adversary\u201d control. Another option is to urge Congress to repeal the law. But that too would require support from congressional Republicans who have overwhelmingly supported the prospect of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said he was \u201coptimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok\u201d and allow its continued use in the United States.",
      "ByteDance has said it won't sell TikTok. And even if it wanted to, a sale of the proprietary algorithm that powers TikTok is likely to get blocked under Chinese export controls that the country issued in 2020.",
      "That means if TikTok is sold without the algorithm, its likely that the buyer would only purchase a shell of the platform that doesn't contain the technology that made the app a cultural powerhouse.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in buying it.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital. The spokesperson did not disclose the identity of the participants."

      "The U.S. government has ordered testing of the nation\u2019s milk supply for bird flu to better monitor the spread of the virus in dairy cows",
      "The U.S. government on Friday ordered testing of the nation's milk supply for bird flu to better monitor the spread of the virus in dairy cows.",
      "Raw or unpasteurized milk from dairy farms and processors nationwide must be tested on request starting Dec. 16, the Agriculture Department said. Testing will begin in six states \u2014 California, Colorado, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon and Pennsylvania.",
      "Officials said the move is aimed at \u201ccontaining and ultimately eliminating the virus,\" known as Type A H5N1, which was detected for the first time in March in U.S. dairy cows. Since then, more than 700 herds have been confirmed to be infected in 15 states.",
      "\u201cThis will give farms and farmworkers better confidence in the safety of their animals and ability to protect themselves, and it will put us on a path to quickly controlling and stopping the virus\u2019 spread nationwide,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.",
      "The risk to people from bird flu remains low, health officials said. Pasteurization, or heat treatment, kills the virus in milk, leaving it safe to drink.",
      "Veterinarians, farmers, scientists and academics have been calling for nationwide milk testing for months, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, who led the efforts.",
      "\u201cIt's another step in the right direction,\u201d Poulsen said. \u201cThey're coming around that we need a better handle on it.\u201d",
      "Dairy farmers and processors across the U.S. have been reluctant to test animals or milk for the virus, fearing economic or other repercussions. Jamie Jonker, chief science officer of the National Milk Producers Federation, said the industry supports USDA efforts to eliminate the virus.",
      "Under the federal order, dairy farmers and those who handle raw milk intended for pasteurization must provide samples of the milk on request for testing for bird flu. It requires reporting of positive tests to the USDA and it requires herd owners to provide basic information to allow tracing of the disease in cattle.",
      "The move follows an April 24 federal order that mandated testing of certain dairy cattle before they could move between states and required reporting of any positive tests. Despite that order, the virus has continued to spread, Poulsen noted.",
      "Raw milk from infected cows contains high loads of live virus, testing has shown.",
      "At least 58 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, mostly farm workers who became mildly ill after close contact with infected cows, including their milk, or infected poultry.",
      "Bird flu has also been spreading among wild birds and a number of other animals.",
      "Federal officials continue to warn against drinking raw milk, which can contain a host of germs that make people sick. In California, officials quarantined a farm and halted distribution of milk after bird flu virus was detected in raw milk sold in stores. Raw Farm of Fresno issued a voluntary recall of raw milk and cream produced after Nov. 9.",

      "A federal appeals court panel on Friday unanimously upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok as soon as next month, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied TikTok's petition to overturn the law \u2014 which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January \u2014 and rebuffed the company's challenge of the statute, which it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\u201d said the court's opinion, which was written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg. \u201cHere the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary\u2019s ability to gather data on people in the United States.\u201d",
      "TikTok and ByteDance \u2014 another plaintiff in the lawsuit \u2014 are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, though its unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,\u201d Hughes said. Unless stopped, he argued the statute \u201cwill silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.\u201d",
      "Though the case is squarely in the court system, it's also possible the two companies might be thrown some sort of a lifeline by President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "\u201cHe wants to save TikTok,\u201d Rep. Michael Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said Friday during an interview on Fox Business.",
      "The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China.",
      "The U.S. has said it\u2019s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect. The European Union on Friday expressed similar concerns as it investigates intelligence that suggests Russia possibly abused the platform to influence the elections in Romania.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday.",
      "TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn\u2019t provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing\u2019s benefit in the U.S. They have also argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government.",
      "Friday\u2019s ruling came after the appeals court panel, composed of two Republicans and one Democrat appointed judges, heard oral arguments in September.",
      "In the hearing, which lasted more than two hours, the panel appeared to grapple with how TikTok\u2019s foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. On Friday, all three denied TikTok\u2019s petition.",
      "In the court's ruling, Ginsburg, a Republican appointee, rejected TikTok's main legal arguments against the law, including that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder, or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He also said the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \"suppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "\u201cContent on the platform could in principle remain unchanged after divestiture, and people in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,\u201d Ginsburg wrote, using the abbreviation for the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge on the court, issued a concurring opinion.",
      "TikTok\u2019s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators \u2014 for which the company is covering legal costs \u2014 as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Other organizations, including the Knight First Amendment Institute, had also filed amicus briefs supporting TikTok.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply misguided ruling that reads important First Amendment precedents too narrowly and gives the government sweeping power to restrict Americans\u2019 access to information, ideas, and media from abroad,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the organization. \u201cWe hope that the appeals court\u2019s ruling won\u2019t be the last word.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers who had pushed for the legislation celebrated the court's ruling.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\u201d said Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China.",
      "Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who co-authored the law, said \u201cit's time for ByteDance to accept\u201d the law.",
      "To assuage concerns about the company\u2019s owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data.",
      "The company has also argued the government\u2019s broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient.",
      "Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it\u2019s impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm \u2014 the platform\u2019s secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan \u2014 would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. business.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital."

      "Deciding whether Juan Soto tops Shohei Ohtani for baseball\u2019s largest contract could be in the eye of the beholder because of all the deferred money in Ohtani\u2019s deal",
      "NEW YORK -- Deciding whether Juan Soto tops Shohei Ohtani for baseball\u2019s largest contract could be in the eye of the beholder because of all the deferred money in Ohtani's deal.",
      "Ohtani agreed last December to a $700 million, 10-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, easily exceeding the previous high set when Mike Trout and the Los Angeles Angels struck a $426.5 million, 12-year agreement through 2030.",
      "Ohtani\u2019s deal includes $680 million in deferred money payable from 2034-43. There are several interpretations for how to value that deal in current dollars:",
      "1. For baseball's luxury tax, the average annual value is pegged at $46.08 million using a 4.33% discount rate.2. The players' association uses a 5% rate, which puts the value at $43.75 million per season.3. For MLB's regular payroll, a 10% rate results in a $28.21 million per year rate.",
      "1. For baseball's luxury tax, the average annual value is pegged at $46.08 million using a 4.33% discount rate.",
      "2. The players' association uses a 5% rate, which puts the value at $43.75 million per season.",
      "3. For MLB's regular payroll, a 10% rate results in a $28.21 million per year rate.",
      "Soto could get a contract of 10-to-15 years for $600 million or more.",
      "His agent, Scott Boras, is not a big fan of deferred money and thinks teams might not insist on delaying the cash.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s much less of an issue than it was before,\u201d Boras said. \u201cDeferral as a mechanism for me, is it: Will it impede my ability to get the greatest asset I can acquire? And the answer to that is I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to want to do anything that impedes their primary pursuit and goal.\u201d",
      "The interest figure used for discounting to determine luxury tax value is set in the collective bargaining agreement as the federal mid-term rate defined in section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code for the October preceding the initial contract year.",
      "That rate dropped to 3.7% this offseason, which meant if Ohtani\u2019s deal had been agreed to this month, its annual luxury tax value would have been about $49.3 million. That would have resulted in an additional $3.5 million annual tax bill for the Dodgers, who will exceed the top threshold and would pay additional tax at a 110% rate on each dollar.",
      "MLB\u2019s regular payrolls, which use the same rate as the one for calculating the qualifying offer price based on the 125 largest contracts, use the prime rate set by J.P. Morgan Chase on the preceding Nov. 1 plus 1%, rounded to the nearest full percentage point. That figure dropped to 9% for this offseason.",
      "Deferred compensation must be funded by the second July 1 after the season in which it was earned, discounted to a present-day value at a 5% rate.",
      "Los Angeles owes deferred payments just over $1 billion due from 2028-46 to Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, Blake Snell and Tommy Edman.",
      "\u201cIt's just trying to kick dollars down the road,\u201d St. Louis Cardinals president of baseball operations John Mozeliak said at the general managers meetings last month.",
      "Ohtani's payments are two-thirds of the total owed.",
      "\u201cIt was a unique situation for where a club was, a unique situation for a player who has very significant earning potential outside of strictly his compensation from a club,\" New York Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said. \u201cThose other ones are much more representative of what you see in sort of standard contracts around the industry. Each organization, each ownership group is going to have a slightly different perspective on this, on how they\u2019re calculating the returns off of that deferred compensation.\u201d",
      "Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said his team's leadership from Guggenheim Baseball Management has the expertise to fund deferred compensation wisely.",
      "\"A lot of our ownership group are from financial background and can have that money going to work right now,\" he said.",
      "MLB proposed during collective bargaining on June 21, 2021, to put an end to the practice.",
      "\u201cFor contracts entered into after the effective date of the Basic Agreement, deferred compensation of any kind will not be permitted,\u201d the proposal read, according to a copy obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "That idea was rejected by the union and not included in the five-year agreement that expires in December 2026.",
      "New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman thinks his team's large resources encourage players to seek their money as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cWe're open to deferrals,\" he said. \"A lot of times players are less open to doing deferrals for us than they are for maybe other markets, but if we can do stuff that benefits us, of course we will.\u201d",

      "The Netherlands-based automaker said the hydraulic control unit on the trucks is prone to failure, which can cause the anti-lock brake, electronic stability control and traction control systems to not work properly. Stellantis said regular braking systems are not affected by the defective part and that it's unaware of any related injuries.",
      "The trucks in question are all model years 2017-18 and include the Ram 2500, 3500, 4500 and 5500. The recall includes a total of 317,630 trucks, including a small number of them in Canada, Mexico and elsewhere.",

      "Customers with additional questions or concerns may call 1-800-853-1403.",
      "Last month, Stellantis announced a recall of about 207,000 Jeep and Dodge SUVs in the U.S. to fix a computer problem that can disable the anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control safety features. In September, Stellantis recalled nearly 1.5 million Ram pickup trucks worldwide to fix a software problem that can disable the electronic stability control system.",
      "Last week Stellantis announced that CEO Carlos Tavares was stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker.",
      "In addition to the recalls, Stellantis has been struggling with falling sales that have led to layoffs and contributed to ballooning inventory on dealer lots. Last quarter, Stellantis reported that net revenues plunged 27% from the same period a year ago.",
      "Stellantis, the world\u2019s fourth-largest automaker, was created by the 2021 merger of PSA Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.",

      "\u201cThe ship is one of 10 vessels licensed by the Puntland administration to operate in Somali waters, with its license valid for the past three years. The hijackers initially took the ship to Jiifle, a coastal area in Godobjiraan district of Nugaal region.

      "Under pressure from his country's powerful and vocal farming lobby, French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday the deal remained \u201cunacceptable\u201d as it stands and stressed that governments have not yet seen \u201cthe final outcome\u201d of negotiations.",
      "\u201cThe agreement has neither been signed nor ratified. This is not the end of the story,\u201d Macron's office said, adding that France demands additional safeguards for farmers and commitments to sustainable development and health controls.",
      "For France to block the deal, it would need the support of three or more other EU member states representing at least 35% of the bloc's population.",
      "The French government, which has been rallying countries to oppose the pact, named Austria, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland as other wary states that share French concerns about the deal.",
      "To take effect, the pact must also be endorsed by the European Parliament.",
      "In remarks aimed at her \u201cfellow Europeans,\u201d and perhaps in particular French skeptics, von der Leyen promised the accord would boost 60,000 businesses through lower tariffs, streamlined customs procedures and preferential access to raw materials otherwise supplied by China.",
      "\u201cThis will create huge business opportunities,\u201d von der Leyen said.",
      "She then turned to address European farmers who fear that an influx of cheap food imports will jeopardize their livelihoods. South American countries do not have to adhere to the same standards for animal treatment and pesticide use.",
      "\u201cWe have heard you, listened to your concerns, and we are acting on them,\u201d von der Leyen said.",
      "Outrage over environmental rules, rising costs and unregulated imports has unleashed massive farmers\u2019 protests across the continent over the past year.",
      "Leaders on both sides of the Atlantic who long have pushed for the deal praised the announcement Friday, welcoming the results as a boon for export industries.",
      "It marks the first major trade agreement for Mercosur, which is comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and, newly, Bolivia. The bloc had previously only managed to conclude free-trade deals with Egypt, Israel and Singapore.",
      "\u201cAn important obstacle to the agreement has been overcome,\u201d said Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, where the nation's vaunted car industry is poised to profit.",
      "From Spain, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez called the agreement \u201can unprecedented economic bridge.\"",
      "At the Mercosur summit in Uruguay\u2019s capital of Montevideo, Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva praised \u201ca modern and balanced text which recognizes Mercosur\u2019s environmental credentials.\"",
      "\u201cWe are securing new markets for our exports and strengthening investment flows,\u201d he said.",
      "The Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency said it expects the pact to boost the nation's Europe-bound exports by $7 billion.",
      "Libertarian President Javier Milei of Argentina described the accord as aligning with his free market principles. Argentines are excited about selling more beef and agricultural products in the EU.",
      "The deal is the product of 25 years of painstaking negotiations, dating back to a Mercosur summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1999. Talks collapsed over differences in economic priorities, regulatory standards and agricultural policies. The rise of protectionist tendencies also repeatedly upended hopes.",
      "Momentum picked up in 2016, as former President Trump imposed harsh tariffs on Europe. At the same time, market-friendly governments came to power in South America's biggest economies, Brazil and Argentina, which had been closed for years.",
      "In June 2019, negotiators announced a deal that included provisions for tariff reductions and commitments to environmental standards.",
      "But it was never implemented. In Brazil, the region's economic powerhouse, right-wing former President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, presided over record levels of deforestation in the Amazon, prompting EU governments to demand tougher sustainability criteria. In Argentina, a new left-wing protectionist government opposed the deal.",
      "But things picked up as the region's politics shifted again in 2023. Brazil's President Lula rode to power on pledges to rein in illegal logging, soothing concerns that the pact could accelerate deforestation. Argentina's Milei is working to open the nation's notoriously closed and crisis-stricken economy.",
      "But if past EU trade agreements are any indication, ratification could take years.",
      "\"We celebrate it, but it's still far from reality,\u201d Milei said of the accord.",
      "In 2016, the EU and Canada signed a pact, known as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or CETA, but the approval process is still lumbering along.",
      "Germany\u2019s parliament only signed off on that pact two years ago, and the French Senate rejected it in March this year.",
      "\u201cAnyone with any memory is skeptical,\" said Brian Winter, a vice president of the New York-based Council of the Americas. \u201cThey have trotted out leaders and declared victory and celebrated, and yet there always seems to be a hitch.\u201d",

      "Joseph Paintsil and Dejan Joveljic scored in the first half, and the LA Galaxy won their record sixth MLS Cup championship with a 2-1 victory over the New York Red Bulls",
      "CARSON, Calif. -- Joseph Paintsil and Dejan Joveljic scored in the first half, and the LA Galaxy won their record sixth MLS Cup championship with a 2-1 victory over the New York Red Bulls on Saturday.",
      "After striking twice in the first 13 minutes of the final with goals from their star forwards, the Galaxy nursed their lead through a scoreless second half to raise their league\u2019s biggest trophy for the first time since 2014.",
      "MLS\u2019 most successful franchise struggled through most of the ensuing decade, even finishing 26th in the 29-team league last year. But the Galaxy turned everything around this season with a high-scoring new lineup that finished second in the Western Conference and then streaked through the playoffs with a playoff-record 18 goals in five games to win another crown.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just so proud of this group after the challenges that we (had) and the way they bounced back and competed as a group,\u201d Galaxy coach Greg Vanney said. \u201cWe spent a lot of energy at the start, but I\u2019m just so proud of these guys. They\u2019ve cemented themselves as legends in this club.\u201d",
      "Sean Nealis scored for the seventh-seeded Red Bulls, whose improbable postseason charge ended one win shy of their first Cup championship. With the league's youngest roster, New York fell just short of becoming the lowest-seeded team to win MLS' playoff tournament under first-year German coach Sandro Schwarz.",
      "\u201cI love these guys,\u201d Schwarz said. \u201cSome guys, they are crying. In the big picture, that\u2019s a start. Sometimes when you lose the final, it\u2019s tough, but you use this experience to create the next energy, the next intensity.\u201d",
      "The Galaxy won this title without perhaps their most important player. Riqui Puig, the playmaking midfielder from Barcelona who ran their offense impressively all season long, tore a ligament in his knee last week in the Western Conference final.",
      "Puig watched this game in a suit, but his teammates hadn't forgotten him: After his replacement, Gast\u00f3n Brugman, set up LA's opening goal with a superb pass in the ninth minute, Paintsil held up Puig's jersey to their roaring fans during the celebration.",
      "\u201cI was really waiting for this moment,\u201d said Paintsil, who scored his 14th goal of an impressive season. \u201cI\u2019m much more, 10 times faster than them, and Gaston saw the space. ... It was really a good thing. We did it for Riqui, and we did it for our family that came, and our supporters.\u201d",
      "Just four minutes later, Joveljic sprinted past four New York defenders and chipped home the 21st goal of his outstanding year as the Galaxy\u2019s striker.",
      "Brugman was named the MLS Cup MVP after a commanding performance in midfield. The Uruguayan hadn't started a match for the Galaxy since Oct. 5, playing only as a postseason substitute before the final.",
      "Galaxy goalkeeper John McCarthy made four saves to win his second MLS title in three seasons. He was the MVP of the 2022 MLS Cup Final for the Galaxy\u2019s crosstown rival, Los Angeles FC.",
      "Nealis beat McCarthy in the 28th minute when he volleyed from LA's penalty area.",
      "The second half was lively, but scoreless. Red Bulls captain Emil Forsberg hit the outside of the post in the 72nd minute, while LA's Gabriel Pec and Galaxy substitute Marco Reus nearly converted chances a few moments later.",
      "The ball got loose in the Galaxy's penalty area in the third minute of extra time, but two Red Bulls couldn't finish.",
      "After Galaxy owner Phil Anschutz received the MLS Cup that bears his name because of his steady financial support of the league during its shaky years, Galaxy captain Maya Yoshida carried the trophy onto a stage filled with his teammates for a celebration amid fireworks and confetti.",
      "The Galaxy extended their lead over DC United (4) for the most MLS Cup championships in league history. The Red Bulls remain one of three original MLS franchises never to win the title, along with FC Dallas and the New England Revolution.",
      "Vanney became the fourth coach to win an MLS title with two clubs. He lost three MLS Cup Finals as a Galaxy player, but won it as Toronto's coach in 2017.",
      "The Galaxy finished 17-0-3 this season at their frequently renamed suburban stadium, where the sellout crowd of 26,812 for the final included several robust cheering sections of Red Bulls supporters hoping to see their New Jersey-based club\u2019s breakthrough.",
      "Just last season, the Galaxy's own supporters boycotted the team at certain home matches, fed up with years of mismanagement and no progress. But the club famous for employing global stars from David Beckham and Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Robbie Keane and Javier \u201cChicharito\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez swiftly rebuilt itself into a contender this season by spending big to get lesser-known young talents.",
      "The Galaxy signed Pec from Brazil and Paintsil, a Ghanaian playing in Belgium. The duo combined with incumbent Serbian striker Joveljic to form a potent attack that could outscore almost any MLS opponent.",
      "But the Galaxy also relied heavily on Puig, their Catalan catalyst and one of MLS\u2019 best players. Puig stayed in last week's game after injuring his knee, and he even delivered the decisive pass to Joveljic for the game\u2019s only goal.",

      "Lisa Simpson once said during an episode of \u201cThe Simpsons:\u201d What could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?",
      "On Monday night, the entire Simpsons universe gets to experience it in a way not many could have imagined.",
      "The prime-time matchup between the Cincinnati Bengals and Dallas Cowboys will also take place at Springfield\u2019s Atoms Stadium as part of \u201cThe Simpsons Funday Football\u201d alternate broadcast.",
      "The altcast will be streamed on ESPN+, Disney+, and NFL+ (on mobile devices). ESPN and ABC have the main broadcast, while ESPN2 will carry the final \u201cManningCast\u201d of the regular season.",
      "The replay will be available on Disney+ for 30 days. Globally, more than 145 countries will have access to either live or on replay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re such huge football fans, and the Simpsons audience and the football audience, I feel, are like the same audience of just American families and football. And the Simpsons are so much a part of the DNA of the American family and culture that for us to, like, mush them together in this crazy video game, it\u2019s so fun,\u201d said Matt Selman, executive producer of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d",
      "While the game is the focal point, the alternate broadcast, in some ways, will resemble a three-hour episode of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d It starts with Homer eating too many hot dogs and having a dream while watching football.",
      "Homer joins the Cowboys in the dream while Bart teams up with the Bengals. Lisa and Marge will be sideline reporters.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the beginning of the story, and the story continues through the entire game until Homer wakes up from his dream at the end of the game. It is like a complete story, and the NFL game will happen in between. It\u2019s just going to be an amazing presentation with tons of surprises,\u201d said Michael \u201cSpike\u201d Szykowny, ESPN\u2019s VP of edit and animation.",
      "This is the second year ESPN has done an alternate broadcast for an NFL game. It used the characters from \u201cToy Story\u201d for last year\u2019s Sunday morning game from London between the Atlanta Falcons and Jacksonville Jaguars.",
      "\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d has featured many sports-themed episodes during its 35 seasons. Even though \u201cHomer at the Bat\u201d remains the consensus favorite sports episode for many Simpsons fans, there have been football ones such as \u201cBart Star\u201d and \u201cLisa The Greek.\u201d There also was a Super Bowl-themed one after Fox\u2019s broadcast of Super Bowl 33 between Denver and Atlanta in 1999.",
      "Even though \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d remains a staple on Fox\u2019s prime-time schedule, it is part of the Disney family after their acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2019. All 35 seasons are on Disney+.",
      "The show\u2019s creators have worked with ESPN and the NFL to make sure the look and sound is definitely Simpsonsesque.",
      "The theme song is a mash-up of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d opening and \u201cMonday Night Football\u2019s\u201d iconic \u201cHeavy Action.\u201d",
      "There have also been pre-recorded skits and bits to use during the broadcast featuring Simpson\u2019s legendary voices Hank Azaria, Nancy Cartwright, Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, and Yeardley Smith.",
      "The telecast will be entirely animated, with the players\u2019 movements in sync with what is happening in real-time on the field. That is done through player-tracking data enabled by the NFL\u2019s Next Gen Stats system and Sony\u2019s Beyond Sports Technology.",
      "While Next Gen Stats tracks where players are on the field with a tracking chip in the shoulder pads, there is skeletal data tracking and limb tracking data \u2014 which uses 29 points per player \u2014 to get closer to the player\u2019s movements.",
      "The other data tracking will allow Beyond Sports and Disney to add special characters to the game. For example, there might be a play where Lisa catches the ball and goes 30 yards instead of Cincinnati\u2019s Tee Higgins.",
      "\u201cLisa is much smaller than the rest of the players. So, in real life, the ball would go over her head, but now, with data processing, we can take the ball and make it go exactly into her hands. So for the viewer, it still looks believable, and it all makes sense,\u201d said Beyond Sports co-founder Nicolaas Westerhof.",
      "The other major challenge is making \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d two-dimensional cartoon characters into 3-D simulations. Szykowny and his team worked to make that a reality over the past couple of months.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a big leap of faith for them to say, hey, we trust you to make our characters 3-D and work with it. Our ESPN creative studio team has done a wonderful job,\u201d Szykowny said.",
      "Lisa, Krusty, Nelson, Milhouse and Ralph will be with Bart and the Bengals; while Carl, Barney, Lenny and Moe join up with with Homer and the Cowboys.",
      "The broadcast will also feature ESPN personalities Stephen A. Smith, Peyton Manning and Eli Manning.",
      "ESPN\u2019s Drew Carter, Mina Kimes and Dan Orlovsky will call the game from Bristol, Connecticut, and also be animated. They will wear Meta Quest Pro headsets to experience the game from Springfield using VR technology.",
      "For Kimes, being part of the broadcast and being an animated Simpsons character is a dream come true. She is a massive fan of the show and has a framed photo of Lisa Simpson \u2014 who she said is a personal hero and icon \u2014 as part of her backdrop when she makes appearances on ESPN NFL shows from her home in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have any input, and I didn\u2019t see anything beforehand, so I wasn\u2019t sure if it would look like me, but it kind of does, which is very funny,\u201d said Kimes, who drew Simpsons characters when she was a kid. \u201cTo see the actual staff turn me into one was a dream.\u201d",
      "Even though the Bengals (4-8) and Cowboys (5-7) have struggled this season, Selman thinks both teams have personalities that appeal to \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d universe.",
      "\u201cWe were just so lucky also that the Cowboys are sort of like a Homer Simpson-type team, American team, and Mike McCarthy might be a Homer-type guy, one might imagine,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd then you have Joe Burrow on the other side who is a cool young, spiky-haired, blonde bad boy -- he\u2019s like Bart. And that fits our character archetypes so perfectly.",
      "\u201cIf Homer is mad at Bart and has a hot dog dream while watching \u2019Monday Night Football\u2019, and then it\u2019s basically McCarthy versus Burrow, Homer versus Bart, and that\u2019s the simple father versus son strangling \u2014 Homer strangling Bart dynamic that has been part of the show for 35 years. I don\u2019t know if that would have worked as well if it was like Titans versus Jacksonville. We would have found something. We would have made it work.\u201d",

      "The person spoke to The Associated Press on Saturday on condition of anonymity because the agreement was pending a physical. ESPN first reported the move.",
      "It's a big splash by the Giants' new-look front office, which is now led by former All-Star catcher Buster Posey, who took over for the fired Farhan Zaidi in September. San Francisco has missed the playoffs in each of the last three years and just completed a disappointing 80-82 season.",
      "Adames' deal is the richest in franchise history, according to MLB.com, topping a $167 million, eight-year extension that Posey signed in 2013.",
      "Adames is off the market as the Juan Soto sweepstakes heats up across the league. The young slugger is expected to make his free agency decision very soon.

      "NASSAU, Bahamas -- Justin Thomas was long off the tee and made a few long putts on the back nine to overtake Scottie Scheffler with a 6-under 66 and build a one-shot lead Saturday over golf's best player going into the final round of the Hero World Challenge.",
      "Thomas is trying out a 46-inch driver \u2014 a little more than an inch longer than normal \u2014 that he previously used for practice at home to gain speed and length. He blasted a 361-yard drive to 8 feet on the par-4 seventh hole and led the field in driving distance.",
      "But it was a few long putts that put him ahead of Scheffler, who had a 69.",
      "Thomas was on the verge of falling two shots behind when he made an 18-foot par putt on the par-3 12th hole. On the reachable par-4 14th, he was in a nasty spot in a sandy area and could only splash it out to nearly 50 feet.",
      "He made that one for a most unlikely birdie, while behind him Scheffler muffed a chip on the 13th hole and made his lone bogey of a windy day.",
      "Scheffler never caught up to him, missing birdie chances on the reachable 14th and the par-5 15th. Thomas hit his approach to 3 feet for birdie on the 16th after a 343-yard drive. Scheffler made an 18-foot birdie putt on the 16th to close within one.",
      "Scheffler missed birdie chances on the last two holes from the 10-foot and 15-foot range, while Thomas missed an 8-foot birdie attempt at the last.",
      "\u201cI had a stretch at 13, 14, 15 where I felt like I lost a shot or two there, but outside of that I did a lot of really good things today,\u201d Scheffler said.",
      "Thomas hasn't won since the 2022 PGA Championship at Southern Hills, and a victory at Albany Golf Club wouldn't count as an official win. But the two-time major champion has made steady progress toward getting his game back in order.",
      "\u201cI'm driving it great. I've had a lot of confidence with it,\u201d Thomas said of his longer driver. \u201cI feel like I've been able to put myself in some pretty good spots going into the green. I\u2019m still not taking advantage of some of them as much as I would like, but that\u2019s golf and we're always going to say that.\u201d",
      "Thomas was at 17-under 199 and will be in the final group Sunday with Scheffler, who is trying to end his spectacular season with a ninth title.",
      "Tom Kim put himself in the mix, which he might not have imagined Thursday when he was 3 over through six holes of the holiday tournament. Kim got back in the game with a 65 on Friday, and then followed with 12 birdies for a 62.",
      "He had a shot at the course record \u2014 Rickie Fowler shot 61 in the final round when he won at Albany in 2017 \u2014 until Kim found a bunker and took two shots to reach the green in making a double bogey on the par-3 17th.",
      "Even so, he was only two shots behind. Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley (68) was four back.",
      "\u201cFeel like I\u2019ve been seeing signs of improvement, which is what you want and that\u2019s all I can do,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI can\u2019t control everybody else or what\u2019s going on, I\u2019ve just got to keep playing as good as I possibly can and hope that it\u2019s enough come Sunday.\u201d",

    "summary": "Oklahoma State announced it has agreed to a new contract with football coach Mike Gundy",
    "story": [
      "Oklahoma State announced it has agreed to a new contract with football coach Mike Gundy",
      "Mike Gundy is coming back.",
      "Oklahoma State announced Saturday that its longtime football coach agreed to a new deal. The restructuring comes after the Cowboys, among the preseason favorites in the Big 12, finished with a disappointing 3-9 record. A rash of injuries and problems at quarterback ruined a season that culminated with a 52-0 loss at Colorado.",
      "Gundy has talked often about how difficult it is to compete financially in this era, and it appears his deal has been restructured to reflect that. News reports published before the announcement said some of Gundy\u2019s salary will be reallocated for revenue sharing with players.",
      "The school said details will be announced once the contract is signed.",
      "\u201cWe are happy to announce that we have agreed on a new contract with the winningest coach in OSU history with terms that benefit Oklahoma State University, OSU student-athletes and Cowboy Football,\u201d the school said.",
      "The school\u2019s Board of Regents held a special meeting on Friday morning regarding Gundy\u2019s status, but no immediate action was taken.",
      "The fact that Gundy has 169 wins in 20 years and has reached the Big 12 title game two of the past four seasons, plus a hefty buyout, likely saved him from being fired outright. The Cowboys won the conference in 2011 and had been to bowl games for 18 straight seasons before this one.",
      "It had been a while since the Cowboys struggled like they did this season, and Gundy upset the fan base when he fired back at his critics.",
      "\u201cIn most cases, the people that are negative and voicing their opinion are the same ones that can\u2019t pay their own bills,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cThey\u2019re not taking care of themselves. They\u2019re not taking care of their own family. They\u2019re not taking care of their own job. But they have an obligation to speak out and complain about others because it makes them feel better.",
      "\"But then, in the end, when they go to bed at night, they\u2019re the same failure that they were before they said anything negative about anybody else.\u201d",
      "Gundy has made several apologies over the years for comments and behavior, but his success has kept him safe. In 2020, he apologized for calling COVID-19 the \u201cChinese Virus.\u201d He apologized again that year after he wore a T-shirt featuring the far-right One America News Network that upset star running back Chuba Hubbard.",
      "The Cowboys reportedly have parted ways with offensive coordinator Kasey Dunn and defensive coordinator Bryan Nardo.",
      "Dunn became offensive coordinator in 2020. He held the position last season, when running back Ollie Gordon II won the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top running back. Gordon wasn't quite as good this season, and a highly touted offensive line struggled to open holes for him.",
      "Nardo was hired in 2023 and had a solid first year. He coached much of this season without injured stars Nick Martin and Collin Oliver. Martin was the top defensive player in the AP's Big 12 mid-season awards.",
      "The Cowboys ranked last in the Big 12 in points allowed and yards per game allowed. They gave up 500.6 yards per contest, by far the worst in the 16-team league.",

      "\u201cI think those things sting for sure,\u201d Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said. \u201cYou remember the losses way more than you remember the wins, and especially when you don\u2019t play to what you\u2019re capable of playing. Those things will haunt you and the reality is it\u2019s still what drives you, what wakes you up every day to come in and be your absolute best.\u201d",
      "Brock Purdy threw three interceptions in Iowa State\u2019s 2020 loss, when he was still a year away from being Mr. Irrelevant as the last pick in the NFL draft and eventually helping San Francisco reach a Super Bowl.",
      "This time, any hope of a rally from a two-touchdown deficit at halftime ended with Abu Sama III's lost fumble five plays into the third quarter and Rocco Becht's interception not too long after that.",
      "Those turnovers resulted in touchdown catches for Xavier Guillory, putting the Sun Devils up 38-10 with 6 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter.",
      "Another Abu fumble on the next possession just made it worse, with Cam Skattebo taking a short pass 33 yards for a touchdown to go with his 170 yards and two TDs rushing.",
      "What would have been a fourth consecutive giveaway was overturned when a hit by Shamari Simmons forced a fumble from Becht but was overturned on review. Simmons was called for targeting instead as Becht stayed down and exited the game. He returned on Iowa State's next possession.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a second-half team, and today it just wasn\u2019t clicking on all cylinders for us,\u201d said Becht, who was 21 of 35 for 214 yards with two touchdowns and the pick. \u201cWe had everything in our hands and we just needed to execute. At the end of the day, we just didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Iowa State (No. 16 CFP), which is 10-3 in the first 10-win season in the program's 133-year history, actually led 7-3 when Becht extended his streak of consecutive games with a touchdown pass to 17 with a 3-yarder to Carson Hansen.",
      "But the only quarterback in the nation with a pair of 1,000-yard receivers couldn't get much production out of either before the outcome was settled.",
      "When Arizona State extended its lead to 45-10 in the third quarter, Jayden Higgins had four catches for 58 yards and Jaylin Noel just two for 25. Higgins finished with 115 yards, while Noel scored a touchdown and had 64 yards.",
      "The Cyclones are still trying to win their first conference title since 1912, when they went 2-0 in the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association as part of a 6-2 season. That was a year after a 2-0-1 record won the Missouri Valley title in a 6-1-1 season.",
      "\u201cThe reality from our end is we had some opportunities late in the season to put ourselves probably in the best situation,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThose are great lessons learned, and we\u2019ll grow with it. Young football team that\u2019s got the ability to grow forward for sure.\u201d",

      "College football fans are facing some hard choices in the expanded playoff system with some teams set to play away from home multiple times",
      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- A little more than an hour before the Big 12 championship game kicked off in front of thousands of empty seats at the home of the Dallas Cowboys, Commissioner Brett Yormark brought up the conundrum faced by fans with the expanded postseason format.",
      "\u201cFans now have to decide what games they want to go to,\u201d Yormark said before No. 12 Arizona State beat 16th-ranked Iowa State 45-19 on Saturday before an announced crowd of 55,889 that appeared far smaller.",
      "The winner will make the first 12-team College Football Playoff, possibly as the 12th seed and almost certainly as one of four teams that will play at their opponent's stadium in the first round.",
      "\u201cIf you host that first-round game, you\u2019re going to four games to get to the finals and to win the championship,\u201d Yormark said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something that\u2019s new, plus the conference championship. On the fans, I think it\u2019s kind of challenging right now.\u201d",
      "Regardless, Yormark remains committed to conference title games. Besides the issue of fans, there have been suggestions that some conferences might be better off not playing a title game as it relates to playoff hopes.",
      "It's possible that SMU will get left out of the playoff with a loss to Clemson in the ACC championship game. The Sun Devils were the top seed in a tiebreaker in the tight Big 12 race. The top four teams in the 16-team league finished with two conference losses apiece.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tentpole event,\u201d Yormark said. \u201cAnd for this game specifically today, it\u2019s win and you\u2019re in. So it\u2019s a very meaningful game. This is an important part of who we are, our brand.\u201d",
      "The Big 12 has a contract through 2031 to play at 80,000-seat AT&T Stadium. While it's unlikely any of the Power Four conferences would abandon the neutral-site approach, Yormark didn't dismiss the idea of the top seed hosting a league title game.",
      "\u201cWe've got to think through that,\u201d Yormark said. \u201cWe can't expect our fans to travel to every game, given where the world is today, discretionary income. We'll see how it plays out the first year, but we have to be mindful of it.\u201d",
      "This is the 10th time the Big 12 championship game has been played at AT&T Stadium, and a year after a record attendance of 84,523 for the game when Texas \u2014 now in the SEC \u2014 beat Oklahoma State to get into the four-team playoff.",
      "Iowa State\u2019s only other Big 12 title game appearance came during the COVID 19-impacted 2020 season, when there was a restricted crowd of 18,720 to watch the Cyclones lose to Oklahoma.",
      "Other than that, the smallest crowd for a title game under the retractable roof and the giant video board was the first one in 2017, when an attendance of 64,104 was announced for Oklahoma\u2019s win over TCU.",
      "Yormark didn't want to revisit his comments earlier in the week that the Big 12 winner was more deserving of a first-round bye than any Group of Five conference champion.",
      "But he didn't ignore his thoughts either a day after No. 10 Boise State beat 19th-ranked UNLV 21-7. Heisman Trophy candidate Ashton Jeanty ran for 209 yards and a touchdown and will have a chance to break the FBS single-season rushing record in the playoff.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into too much about how we\u2019re positioned versus other conferences,\u201d Yormark said. \u201cBut I will say, where I sit, there should be no comparison between us and any G5 conference champion. I'll double down on that for sure. Hopefully the selection committee will do what they need to do.\u201d",

      "Goalkeeper Andre Onana's second-half blunder against Forest proved costly. At 1-1, two minutes after the break, Onana misjudged Morgan Gibbs-White's tame shot from outside the box. He dived the wrong way and watched the ball roll in.",
      "For Amorim, who took over last month after leaving Portuguese champion Sporting Lisbon, it was the first home league match he has lost since February 2023.",

      "Lindsey Vonn finished in the middle of the pack in a pair of lower-level downhill events as she competed for the first time in nearly six years",
      "COPPER MOUNTAIN, Colo. -- For a pair of lower-level downhill events, this sure had plenty of Olympic medal-capturing and World Cup-winning ski racers.",
      "The stage belonged to Lindsey Vonn, the 40-year-old who took another step on her comeback trail Saturday with her first races in nearly six years.",
      "Vonn wasn't particularly speedy and finished in the middle of the pack on a cold but sunny day at Copper Mountain. Times and places weren't the mission, though, as much as getting used to the speed again and gaining the necessary points to compete on the World Cup circuit this season. Vonn accomplished both, finishing 24th in the first downhill race of the day and 27th in the second.",
      "She posted on social media after the FIS races that she had enough points to enter World Cup events. The timing couldn't be more perfect \u2014 the next stop on the women's circuit is Beaver Creek, Colorado, in a week. Vonn, who used to own a home in nearby Vail, hasn't committed to any sort of timetable for a World Cup return.",
      "\u201cToday was a solid start and I had a blast being in start with my teammates again!\u201d Vonn wrote on X. \u201cWhile I\u2019m sure people will speculate and say I\u2019m not in top form because of the results, I disagree. This was training for me. I\u2019m still testing equipment and getting back in the groove.\u201d",
      "Her competition \u2014 a veritable who's who of high-profile ski racers \u2014 applauded her efforts.",
      "\u201cI don't expect her to come back and win \u2014 just that she comes back and she has fun,\u201d said Federica Brignone of Italy, a former overall World Cup champion and three-time Olympic medalist. \u201cShe's having fun, and she\u2019s doing what she loves. That\u2019s the best thing that she could do.\u201d",
      "In the first race on a frigid morning, Vonn wound up 1.44 seconds behind the winning time of 1 minute, 5.79 seconds posted by Mirjam Puchner of Austria.",
      "In her second race through the course later in the morning, Vonn was 1.53 seconds behind Cornelia Huetter of Austria, who finished in 1:05.99. Huetter is the reigning season-long World Cup downhill champion.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to compare with her again, and nice to have her (racing) again,\u201d Huetter said. \u201cFor sure, for the skiing World Cup, we have a lot of more attention. It's generally good for all racers because everyone is looking.\u201d",
      "Also in the field were Nadia Delago of Italy, who won a bronze medal in downhill at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, and Puchner, the Olympic silver winner in super-G in Beijing. In addition, there was Marta Bassino of Italy, a winner of the super-G at the 2023 world championships, and two-time Olympic champion Michelle Gisin of Switzerland.",
      "\u201cFor me, it was really a training, but it was fun to have a World Cup race level right here,\u201d Gisin said. \u201cIt was a crazy race.\u201d",
      "Vonn remains a popular figure and took the time after each run to sign autographs for young fans along with posing for photos.",
      "When she left the sport, Vonn had 82 World Cup race victories, which stood as the record for a woman and within reach of the all-time Alpine record of 86 held by Swedish standout Ingemar Stenmark.",
      "The women\u2019s mark held by Vonn was surpassed in January 2023 by Mikaela Shiffrin, who now has 99 wins \u2014 more than any Alpine ski racer in the history of the sport. Shiffrin is currently sidelined after a crash in a giant slalom event in Killington, Vermont, last weekend.",
      "Vonn\u2019s last major race was in February 2019, when she finished third in a downhill during the world championships in Sweden. The three-time Olympic medalist left the circuit still near the top of her game. But all the broken arms and legs, concussions and torn knee ligaments took too big a toll and sent her into retirement.",
      "She had a partial knee replacement last April and felt good enough to give racing another shot.",
      "\u201cIt's very impressive to see all the passion that Lindsey still has,\u201d Gisin said.",
      "Also racing Saturday was 45-year-old Sarah Schleper, who once competed for the United States but now represents Mexico. Schleper was the next racer behind Vonn and they got a chance to share a moment between a pair of 40-somethings still racing.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Give me some tips, Lindsey,\u2019\u201d Schleper said. \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a highway tuck, the whole thing.\u2019 Then she\u2019s like, \u2018It\u2019s just like the good old days.\u2019\"",

      "His 246th and last race with Mercedes comes in a season in which Hamilton has won twice \u2014 including an emotional victory at his home British Grand Prix \u2014 but also been frustrated by a run of poor results. Hamilton has been largely outclassed by his teammate George Russell in recent races and struggled with penalties and a puncture last week in Qatar.",

      "\u201cIn regards to the Heisman, I ask all voters to please just watch the film, watch the stats,\u201d Danielson said. \u201cThat will show you that he\u2019s the best football player in the country. \u2026 If you\u2019re a Heisman candidate, you should play in a championship game. And to see what he did in a championship game for his team also speaks volumes.\u201d",
      "It was a not-so-subtle dig at Heisman frontrunner and Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter, whose team was left out of the Big 12 championship game and won\u2019t make a playoff appearance.",
      "But Jeanty will be in the playoffs too, albeit long after the ballots have been cast and the ceremony held. And he\u2019ll have a chance to finish one of the greatest single-season rushing performances in FBS history.",
      "\u201cHe showcases week in and week out that he\u2019s the best football player in the country and I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s close,\u201d Danielson said.",
      "The fact that Jeanty is even at Boise State this season in the era of NIL and transfer portals is almost as amazing as his eye-popping stats \u2014the 2,497 yards rushing along with 29 touchdowns and five TD runs of 70-plus yards.",
      "Jeanty, who spurned several offseason NIL offers from Power 4 schools a year ago, chose to return to Boise State to do something special.",
      "He soaked it all in Friday.",
      "\u201cAs soon as I woke up, that was all that was on my mind,\u201d Jeanty said of his time at Boise State. \u201cI was just so grateful for the program, the coaches and the community and everybody that believes in me. I took it all in the whole game. It was just an amazing experience. I wouldn\u2019t want to go out any other way.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Bitcoin has topped the $100,000 mark, extending a rally in the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency sparked by the election of Donald Trump",
      "NEW YORK -- Bitcoin topped $100,000 for the first time this week as a massive rally in the world's most popular cryptocurrency, largely accelerated by the election of Donald Trump, rolls on.",
      "The cryptocurrency officially to rose six figures Wednesday night, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Bitcoin has soared since Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. The asset climbed from $69,374 on Election Day, hitting as high as $103,713 Wednesday, according to CoinDesk. And the latest all-time high arrives just two years after bitcoin dropped below $17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.",
      "Bitcoin fell back below the $100,000 by Thursday afternoon, sitting above $99,000 by 4 p.m. ET. Even amid a massive rally that has more than doubled the value of bitcoin this year, some experts continue to warn of investment risks around the asset, which has quite a volatile history.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now. But chances are you\u2019ve heard about it more and more over the last few years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it\u2019s typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like ethereum, XRP, tether and dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money, but most daily financial transactions are still conducted using fiat currencies such as the dollar. Also, bitcoin can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.",
      "Trump, who was once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "On Thursday morning, hours after bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 mark, Trump congratulated \u201cBITCOINERS\u201d on his social media platform Truth Social. He also appeared to take credit for the recent rally, writing, \u201cYOU\u2019RE WELCOME!!!\u201d",
      "Top crypto players welcomed Trump\u2019s election victory last month, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for \u2014 which, generally speaking, aim for an increased sense of legitimacy without too much red tape. And the industry has made sizeable investments along the way. Back in August, Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer rights advocacy nonprofit, reported finding that crypto-sector corporations spent more than $119 million in 2024 to back pro-crypto candidates across federal elections.",
      "Trump made his latest pro-crypto move when he announced his plans Wednesday to nominate Atkins to chair the SEC. Atkins was an SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush. In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation. He joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization, in 2017.",
      "Under current chair Gary Gensler, who will step down when Trump takes office, the SEC has cracked down on the crypto industry \u2014 penalizing a number of companies for violating securities laws. Gensler has also faced ample criticism from industry players in the process.",
      "One crypto-friendly move the SEC did make under Gensler was the approval in January of spot bitcoin ETFs, or exchange trade funds, which allow investors to have a stake in bitcoin without directly buying it. The spot ETFs were the dominant driver of bitcoin's price before Trump's win \u2014 but, like much of the crypto\u2019s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection.",
      "Bitcoin surpassing the coveted $100,000 mark has left much of the crypto world buzzing.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t just a rally \u2014 it\u2019s a fundamental transformation of bitcoin\u2019s place in the financial system,\u201d Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of crypto custodian Anchorage Digital, said in a statement \u2014 while pointing to the growth of who's entering the market, particularly with rising institutional adoption.",
      "Still, others note that the new heights of bitcoin's price don't necessarily mean the asset is going mainstream. The $100,000 level is \u201cmerely a psychological factor and ultimately just a number,\u201d Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at British investment company AJ Bell, wrote in a Thursday commentary.",
      "That being said, bitcoin could keep climbing to more and more all-time highs, particularly if Trump makes good on his promises for more crypto-friendly regulation once in office. If Trump actually makes a bitcoin reserve, for example, supply changes could also propel the price forward.",
      "\u201cIt is hard to overstate the magnitude of the change in Washington\u2019s attitude towards crypto post-election,\u201d Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, said via email Thursday, reiterating that prices could keep rising if trends persist. \u201cThere is a lot more demand than there is supply, and that\u2019s usually a pretty good recipe for success.\u201d",
      "Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is never promised. Worldwide regulatory uncertainties and environmental concerns around bitcoin \u201cmining\" \u2014 the creation of new bitcoin, which consumes a lot of energy \u2014 are among factors that analysts like Coatsworth note could hamper future growth. And, as still a relatively young asset with a history of volatility, longer-term adoption has yet to be seen through.",
      "Today\u2019s excitement around bitcoin may make many who aren\u2019t already in the space want to get in on the action. For those in a position to invest, Hougan says it's not too late \u2014 noting that bitcoin is still early in its development and most institutional investors \u201cstill have zero exposure.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Hougan and others maintain that it's important to tread cautiously and not bite off more than you can chew. Experts continue to stress caution around getting carried away with crypto \u201cFOMO,\u201d or the fear of missing out, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "\u201cA lot of people have got rich from the cryptocurrency soaring in value this year, but this high-risk asset isn\u2019t suitable for everyone,\u201d Coatsworth noted Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s volatile, unpredictable and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment.\u201d",
      "In short, history shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you\u2019ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "Coatsworth points to recent research from the Bank for International Settlements, a Switzerland-based global organization of central banks, which found that about three-quarters of retail buyers on crypto exchange apps likely lost money on their bitcoin investments between 2015 and 2022.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. And the late-2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with bitcoin falling below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs, and again, now the post-election frenzy. But lighter regulation from the coming Trump administration could also mean less guardrails.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 14:34:23 -0500",
    "summary": "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat",
    "story": [
      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat",
      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat. Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50.",
      "For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, such as the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (around 30 degrees Celsius) and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older.",
      "The study in Friday's journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: People between 18 and 35. That age group alone had nine times as many temperature-related deaths as those older than 50.",
      "Study authors and outside experts are scrambling to figure out why. Demographics alone don't explain why more young adult Mexicans are dying in high heat than their elders. Two theories: Outdoor workers who can't escape the heat, and young people who don't know their limits.",
      "The trend is likely to widen as the world warms from human-caused climate change, according to computer simulations run by the study team.",
      "\u201cWe found that younger people are especially vulnerable to humid heat,\u201d study co-author Jeffrey Shrader, a climate economist at Columbia University, said. \u201cAs the climate warms, we're really going to be shifting the burden of temperature-related mortality towards younger individuals and away from older individuals who tend to be more vulnerable to cold temperatures.\u201d",
      "Data from cold weather shows more than 300 deaths of Mexican residents 50 and older for every young person dying from cold temperatures, according to the study.",
      "\u201cPeople of all ages are increasingly at risk from the rising temperatures, and this study shows that those that we might have considered relatively safe from heat-related adverse health outcomes might not be so much so,\u201d said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown that monitors health effects of climate change. She was not part of the study team.",
      "\u201cHeat is a much more dangerous silent killer than most people acknowledge it to be, and that heat is increasingly putting our health and survival at risk,\" Romanello said in an email.",
      "Study authors decided to examine weather-related deaths in Mexico because that country not only has detailed mortality data, but it has a variety of different climates making it an ideal place to study in depth, Shrader said.",
      "Researchers also want to figure out whether this is just a situation in Mexico or other warmer sections of the globe have similar spikes in young adult deaths in high heat and humidity.",
      "Initially the team just wanted to look at deaths and what scientists call wet-bulb globe temperatures, but when they looked at age differences, they were surprised and looked in more detail, Shrader said. Wet-bulb temperature, which is intended to mirror how the body cools itself, is derived using a complicated measurement system that factors in humidity and solar radiation. A wet-bulb globe temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is thought to be the limit for human survivability. Most places don\u2019t reach that level.",
      "Researchers determined temperature-related mortality by complex statistical analysis that compares numerous factors in the number of deaths and removes everything they can except temperature fluctuations, said study co-author Andrew Wilson, a Columbia climate economics researcher.",
      "Researchers also calculated the ideal temperature for when there are the fewest excess deaths at each age group. Younger adults' sweet temperature spot is about nine degrees Fahrenheit (five degrees Celsius) cooler than it is for older people, Shrader and Wilson said.",
      "Some outside health and climate experts were initially puzzled at the higher youth mortality seen in the study. Co-author Patrick Kinney, a professor of urban health and sustainability at Boston University, said it was likely the study included a higher proportion of outdoor workers exposed to heat than prior studies did.",
      "Study co-author Tereza Cavazos, a climate scientist at the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Mexico, said she remembers her father's generations taking siestas in the high heat of the day and that was healthy. That doesn't happen so much now, she said.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of population that is vulnerable in the future. Not even in the future, right now,\u201d Cavazos said. She mentioned three Mexican heat waves this year that hit in the middle of the country and kept the deadly heat going overnight so people had little relief. Usually cool nights allow a body to recover.",
      "Younger people often have a sense of invulnerability to weather extremes and do things that increase their risk, such as play sports in high heat, Cavazos said.",
      "\u201cHigh humidity makes it a lot harder for the body to cool itself through sweating \u2013 which is how our body primarily stays cool,\" said Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and climate change expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. She was not part of the study team. \"So someone young and healthy working outside in heat and high humidity can reach a point where the body can no longer cool itself safely \u2013 causing a deadly form of heat injury called heat stroke.\u201d",

      "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he is \u201coptimistic\u201d about President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term and expressed some excitement about potential regulatory cutbacks in the coming years",
      "NEW YORK -- Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said Wednesday he is \u201coptimistic\u201d about President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term and expressed some excitement about potential regulatory cutbacks in the coming years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m actually very optimistic this time around,\u201d Bezos said on stage during a wide-ranging interview at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit in New York. \u201cHe seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. If I can help do that, I\u2019m going to help him.\"",
      "\u201cWe do have too many regulations in this country,\u201d Bezos added.",
      "The comments follow Bezos' October decision to prohibit The Washington Post, which he owns, from endorsing a presidential candidate, a move that led to tens of thousands of people canceling their subscriptions and protests from journalists with a deep history at the newspaper.",
      "At the time, Bezos wrote in an op-ed in the newspaper saying editorial endorsements create a perception of bias at a time when many Americans don\u2019t believe the media, and do nothing to tip the scales of an election.",
      "On Wednesday, he said he would try to talk Trump \"out of the idea\u201d that the press is the enemy.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve probably grown in the last eight years,\u201d he said to journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin. \u201cHe has, too. This is not the case. The press is not the enemy.\u201d",
      "Trump had railed against Bezos and his companies, including Amazon and The Washington Post, during his first term. In 2019, Amazon argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract. The Biden administration later pursued a contract with both Amazon and Microsoft.",
      "In another part of the interview, Bezos said he doesn't expect Elon Musk, who has been tasked with cutting regulations in the upcoming Trump term, to use his power to hurt his business competitors. Bezos owns Blue Origin, a rival to Musk's SpaceX."

      "Waymo is gearing up to bring its robotaxi service to Miami which will accelerate an expansion that\u2019s been happening while its hobbled rivals remain in its rearview mirror",
      "Waymo is gearing up to bring its robotaxi service to Miami which will accelerate an expansion that's been happening while its hobbled rivals remain in its rearview mirror.",
      "As part of the road map unfurled Thursday, Waymo plans to begin testing its driverless Jaguars in Miami next year, giving the robotaxis time to learn their way around Florida's biggest city before they start charging for rides in 2026. The move comes less than a month after Waymo opened up its robotaxi service to anyone looking for a ride in an 80-square-mile (129-square-kilometer) expanse in Los Angeles, extending its reach beyond its two major markets in Phoenix and San Francisco.",
      "Waymo also has plans to launch fleets in Atlanta and Austin next year as part of a partnership with the ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "The growth spurred Waymo to team up with fleet management service Moove to oversee maintenance of its robotaxis in Phoenix, where it now operates about 200 vehicles. Moove also will help manage the company's robotaxis in Miami.",
      "The steady expansion into new markets is starting to fulfill what once seemed like a fantastical dream when Google began a secret self-driving car project dubbed \"Chauffeur\u201d in 2009 that ultimately spun off as Waymo in 2016.",
      "Although Waymo is still piling up substantial losses under its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., the service now provides more than 150,000 weekly trips without any history of catastrophic traffic accidents. That track record has increased confidence that Waymo will be able to continue to steer its robotaxis into more markets and eventually produce a steady stream of profits \u2014 an expectation that helped it recently raise $5.6 billion from Alphabet and a list of other major investors.",
      "Meanwhile, robotaxi rival Cruise is still trying to recover from a grisly accident last year that culminated in one of its driverless cars in San Francisco dragging a jaywalking pedestrian who had been struck by a different car driven by a human. California regulators suspended Cruise's license in the aftermath and its once-ambitious expansion plans have been scaled back by its corporate parent, automaker General Motors.",
      "Having periodically promised a fleet of Tesla robotaxis for nearly a decade, Tesla CEO Elon Musk renewed the pledge again in October when he predicted the electric carmaker's \"Cybercabs\" will be on U.S. roads in 2026."

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 00:02:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Iran is poised to &ldquo;quite dramatically&rdquo; increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium",
    "story": [
      "Iran is poised to \u201cquite dramatically\u201d increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium",
      "MANAMA, Bahrain -- Iran is poised to \u201cquite dramatically\u201d increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium as it has started cascades of advanced centrifuges, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned Friday.",
      "The comments from Rafael Mariano Grossi came just hours after Iran said it conducted a successful space launch with its heaviest payload ever, the latest for its program that the West alleges improves Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program.",
      "The launch of the Simorgh rocket comes as Iran\u2019s nuclear program now enriches uranium at 60%, a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. While Iran maintains its program is peaceful, officials in the Islamic Republic increasingly threaten to potentially seek the bomb and an intercontinental ballistic missile that would allow Tehran to use the weapon against distant foes like the United States.",
      "The moves are likely to further raise tensions gripping the wider Middle East over Israel\u2019s continued war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as an uneasy ceasefire holds in Lebanon. However, Iran may as well be preparing the ground for possible talks with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who in his first term unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "The U.S. intelligence community in a report released Thursday said that while \u201cIran is not building a nuclear weapon\u201d it has \u201cundertaken activities that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses.\u201d",
      "The Iranian debate over seeking the bomb \u201crisks emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran\u2019s decision-making apparatus and shifting the thinking of current and future Iranian elites about the utility of nuclear weapons,\u201d the report added.",
      "Grossi, speaking to journalists in Bahrain, on the sidelines of the International Institute of Strategic Studies\u2019 Manama Dialogue, said his inspectors planned to see just how many centrifuges Iran would be spinning after Tehran informed his agency of its plans.",
      "\u201cI think it is very concerning,\u201d Grossi said. \u201cThey were preparing and they have all of these facilities sort of in abeyance and now they are activating that. So we are going to see.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIf they really make them turn \u2014 all of them \u2014 it's going to be a huge jump.\u201d",
      "An IAEA statement issued shortly after Grossi's remarks said Iran had begun feeding two cascades of advanced IR-6 centrifuges with uranium previously enriched up to 20% at its underground Fordo facility. That site is located under a mountain, protecting it from airstrikes.",
      "Cascades are a group of centrifuges that spin uranium gas together to more quickly enrich the uranium. The IR-6 centrifuges enrich uranium faster than Iran\u2019s baseline IR-1 centrifuges, which have been the workhorse of the country\u2019s atomic program. Adding 20% uranium, as opposed to 5% uranium previously planned, further speeds up that process.",
      "\u201cThe facility\u2019s updated design information showed that the effect of this change would be to significantly increase the rate of production,\u201d the IAEA statement said. Iran separately will start feeding natural uranium into eight other IR-6 cascades at Fordo as well to produce 5%-enriched uranium, it added.",
      "The IAEA warned in late November that Iran was preparing to begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges. That came as a response to the Board of Governors at the IAEA condemning Iran for failing to cooperate fully with the agency.",
      "Iran did not acknowledge the preparations. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Meanwhile, the launch Friday took place at Iran\u2019s Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province, some 220 kilometers (135 miles) east of Tehran. That\u2019s the site of Iran\u2019s civilian space program, which has suffered a series of failed Simorgh launches in the past.",
      "The Simorgh carried what Iran described as an \u201corbital propulsion system,\u201d as well as two research systems to a 400-kilometer (250-mile) orbit above the Earth. A system that could change the orbit of a spacecraft would allow Iran to geo-synchronize the orbits of its satellites, a capability Tehran has long sought.",
      "It also carried the Fakhr-1 satellite for Iran\u2019s military, the first time Iran\u2019s civilian program is known to have carried a military payload.",
      "Iran also put the payload of the Simorgh at 300 kilograms (660 pounds), heavier than all its previous successful launches within the country. State television carried footage of a correspondent discussing the payload just as the Simorgh lifted off into the sky, as people called out: \u201cGod is the greatest!\u201d",
      "The U.S. military referred questions about the launch to the country\u2019s Space Command, which did not respond. Space experts said tracking data appeared to show the launch successfully put objects in orbit.",
      "The United States has previously said Iran\u2019s satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program expired in October 2023.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s work on space-launch vehicles \u2014 including its Simorgh \u2014 probably would shorten the timeline to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, if it decided to develop one, because the systems use similar technologies,\u201d a U.S. intelligence community report released in July said.",
      "Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003.",
      "Under Iran\u2019s relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. The late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May.",
      "Iran\u2019s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who has been signaling he wants to negotiate with the West over sanctions, has yet to offer a strategy when it comes to Iran\u2019s ambitions in space. The Simorgh launch represented the first for his administration from the country\u2019s civil space program. Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard conducted a successful launch of its parallel program in September.",

      "BANGKOK -- China has banned exports of key materials used to make a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, radar systems and CT scanners, swiping back at Washington after it expanded export controls to include dozens of Chinese companies that make equipment used to produce advanced computer chips.",
      "Both sides say their controls are justified by national security concerns and both accuse the other of \u201cweaponizing\u201d trade. Analysts say the latest restrictions could have a wide impact on manufacturing in many industries and supply chains.",
      "\u201cCritical mineral security is now intrinsically linked to the escalating tech trade war,\u201d Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz of the Center for Strategic International Studies, wrote in a report on Beijing's decision.",
      "The full impact will depend partly on whether U.S. industries can compensate for any loss of access to the strategically important materials, equipment and components.",
      "Here\u2019s why this could be a tipping point in trade conflict between the two biggest economies, coming at a time when antagonisms already were expected to heat up once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, given his vows to hike tariffs on imports of Chinese-made products.",
      "China has banned, in principle, exports to the United States of gallium, germanium and antimony \u2014 critical minerals needed to make advanced semiconductors, among many other types of equipment. Beijing also tightened controls on exports of graphite, which is used in EV and grid-storage batteries. China is the largest source for most of these materials and also dominates refining of those materials, which are used both for consumer goods and for military purposes.",
      "The limits announced Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings.",
      "Next on the list of potential bans, experts say: tungsten, magnesium and aluminum alloys.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced its measures after the U.S. government ordered a slew of new measures meant to prevent sales to China of certain types of advanced semiconductors and the tools and software needed to make them. Washington also expanded its \u201centity list\u201d of companies facing strict export controls to include 140 more companies, nearly all of them based in China or Chinese-owned.",
      "Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the revised rules were intended to impair China\u2019s ability to use advanced technologies that \u201cpose a risk to our national security.\u201d The updated regulations also limit exports to China of high-bandwidth memory chips that are needed to process massive amounts of data in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence.",
      "Export licenses will likely be denied for any U.S. company trying to do business with the 140 companies newly added to the \u201centity list,\u201d as well as the dozens of others already on the list. The aim, officials said, is to stop Chinese companies from leveraging U.S. technology to make their own semiconductors.",
      "The Biden administration has been expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls while encouraging an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "Washington also extended the restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor technology to companies in other countries, though it excluded companies in key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands that are thought to have adequate export controls of their own.",
      "In a word: very. For the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other producers of advanced technology and components, access to materials with such properties as high conductivity is crucial: gallium and germanium increasingly are used in advanced semiconductors in place of silicon.",
      "The materials subject to Chinese export controls are among 50 the United States Geologic Survey has designated as \u201ccritical minerals\u201d \u2014 non-fuel minerals essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "Gallium topped that list. It is needed to make the same high-bandwidth memory chips the U.S. wants to avoid allowing China to access for use in artificial intelligence and defense applications. It's used to make LEDs, lasers and magnets used in many products. Germanium is used for optical fiber and solar panels, among other uses.",
      "A USGS study recently estimated the likely total cost to the U.S. economy from disruptions to supplies of gallium and germanium alone at more than $3 billion. But the situation is complicated. China imposed licensing requirements on exports of both metals in July 2023. It has not exported either to the U.S. this year, according to Chinese customs data. Antimony exports also have plunged.",
      "China produces the lion's share of most critical minerals, but there are alternatives. Japan also imports nearly all of its gallium, for example, but it also extracts it by recycling scrap metal.",
      "Washington has been moving to tap sources other than China, forming a \"Minerals Security Partnership\" with the EU and 15 other countries. President Joe Biden's visit to Africa this week highlighted that effort. Potential supply disruptions also have spurred efforts to tap U.S. deposits of rare earths and other critical materials in southeastern Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, Minnesota and parts of the American Southwest.",
      "Germanium has been extracted from zinc mined in Alaska and Tennessee and the U.S. government has a stockpile. The Department of Defense has a recycling program that can extract scrap germanium from night vision lenses and tank turret windows.",
      "But China's dominance as a supplier gives it an overwhelming cost advantage, and U.S. resource companies face strong pressures over the potential environmental impact of mines and refineries.",
      "Since then-President Trump launched a trade war against Beijing that has ramped up over time, China has adopted a relatively constrained and cautious approach in responding to the U.S. limits on access to advanced technology.",
      "Much depends on the future course of overall relations. It is unclear if Trump will follow through on his vows to push tariffs sharply higher once he takes office or if such declarations are the opening gambits in future trade negotiations.",
      "China hit back with its own tariff hikes, but excluded many items crucial for its own economy. It sanctioned certain companies, especially defense contractors doing business with Taiwan, but refrained from outright bans on exports of vital materials to the U.S.",
      "This time may be different.",
      "Just after China's Commerce Ministry announced its export ban, various Chinese industry associations including automakers and the China Semiconductor Association issued statements denouncing Washington's moves to curb access to strategically sensitive technologies and declaring that U.S. computer chips are unreliable.",
      "Beijing's announcement also extends its ban on exporting Chinese-produced gallium and other critical minerals to the U.S. to apply to all countries, entities and individuals, saying violators will \u201cbe held accountable according to law.\u201d",

      "TikTok's future in the U.S. appeared uncertain on Friday after a federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge to a law that requires the social media platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned by mid-January.",
      "A panel of three judges on The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously that the law withstood constitutional scrutiny, rebuffing arguments from the two companies that the statute violated their rights and the rights of TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "The government has said it wants ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its stakes. But if it doesn't and the platform goes away, it would have a seismic impact on the lives of content creators who rely on the platform for income as well as users who use it for entertainment and connection.",
      "Here are some details on the ruling and what could happen next:",
      "In their lawsuit, TikTok and ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, had challenged the law on various fronts, arguing in part that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment and was an unconstitutional bill of attainder that unfairly targeted the two companies.",
      "But the court sided with attorneys for the Justice Department who said that the government was attempting to address national security concerns and the way in which it chose to do so did not violate the constitution.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say that Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread, or suppress, information. However, the U.S. hasn't publicly provided examples of that happening.",
      "The appeals court ruling, written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, said the law was \u201ccarefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary.\" The judges also rejected the claim that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, Ginsburg wrote the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \u201csuppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance are expected to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, but it's unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "TikTok indicated in a statement on Friday the two companies are preparing to take their case to high court, saying the Supreme Court has \u201can established historical record of protecting Americans\u2019 right to free speech.\"",
      "\"We expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\u201d a company spokesperson said.",
      "Alan Morrison, a professor at The George Washington University Law School, said he expects the Supreme Court to take up the case because of the novelty of the issues raised in the lawsuit. If that happens, attorneys for the two companies still have to convince the court to grant them an emergency stay that will prevent the government from enforcing the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline stipulated in the law, Morrison said.",
      "Such a move could drag out the process until the Justices make a ruling.",
      "Tiffany Cianci, a TikTok content creator who has supported the platform, said she was not shocked about the outcome of the court's ruling on Friday because lower courts typically defer to the executive branch on these types of cases. She believes the company will have a stronger case at the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI believe that the next stages are more likely to produce a victory for TikTokers and for TikTok as a whole,\u201d Cianci said.",
      "Another wild card is President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the recent presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "The Trump transition team has not offered details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok.\" But spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last month that he plans to \u201cdeliver\u201d on his campaign promises.",
      "After Trump takes office on Jan. 20th, it would fall on his Justice Department to enforce the law and punish any potential violators. Penalties would apply to any app stores that would violate a prohibition on TikTok and to internet hosting services which would be barred from supporting it.",
      "Some have speculated that Trump could ask his Justice Department to abstain from enforcing the law. But tech companies like Apple and Google, which offer TikTok's app on their app stores, would then have to trust that the administration would not come after them for any violations.",
      "Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said enforcement discretion \u2014 or executive orders \u2014 can not override existing law, leaving Trump with \u201climited room for unilateral action.\"",
      "There are other things Trump could potentially do. It's possible he could invoke provisions of the law that allow the president to determine whether a sale or a similar transaction frees TikTok from \u201cforeign adversary\u201d control. Another option is to urge Congress to repeal the law. But that too would require support from congressional Republicans who have overwhelmingly supported the prospect of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said he was \u201coptimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok\u201d and allow its continued use in the United States.",
      "ByteDance has said it won't sell TikTok. And even if it wanted to, a sale of the proprietary algorithm that powers TikTok is likely to get blocked under Chinese export controls that the country issued in 2020.",
      "That means if TikTok is sold without the algorithm, its likely that the buyer would only purchase a shell of the platform that doesn't contain the technology that made the app a cultural powerhouse.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in buying it.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital. The spokesperson did not disclose the identity of the participants."

      "NASA's two stuck astronauts have hit the six-month mark in space",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Known across the globe as the stuck astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams hit the six-month mark in space Thursday with two more to go.",
      "The pair rocketed into orbit on June 5, the first to ride Boeing\u2019s new Starliner crew capsule on what was supposed to be a weeklong test flight. They arrived at the International Space Station the next day, only after overcoming a cascade of thruster failures and helium leaks. NASA deemed the capsule too risky for a return flight, so it will be February before their long and trying mission comes to a close.",
      "While NASA managers bristle at calling them stuck or stranded, the two retired Navy captains shrug off the description of their plight. They insist they\u2019re fine and accepting of their fate. Wilmore views it as a detour of sorts: \u201cWe\u2019re just on a different path.\u201d",
      "\u201cI like everything about being up here,\u201d Williams told students Wednesday from an elementary school named for her in Needham, Massachusetts, her hometown. \"Just living in space is super fun.\u201d",
      "Both astronauts have lived up there before so they quickly became full-fledged members of the crew, helping with science experiments and chores like fixing a broken toilet, vacuuming the air vents and watering the plants. Williams took over as station commander in September.",
      "\u201cMindset does go a long way,\u201d Wilmore said in response to a question from Nashville first-graders in October. He\u2019s from Mount Juliet, Tennessee. \u201cI don\u2019t look at these situations in life as being downers.\u201d",
      "Boeing flew its Starliner capsule home empty in September, and NASA moved Wilmore and Williams to a SpaceX flight not due back until late February. Two other astronauts were bumped to make room and to keep to a six-month schedule for crew rotations.",
      "Like other station crews, Wilmore and Williams trained for spacewalks and any unexpected situations that might arise.",
      "\u201cWhen the crews go up, they know they could be there for up to a year,\u201d said NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free.",
      "NASA astronaut Frank Rubio found that out the hard way when the Russian Space Agency had to rush up a replacement capsule for him and two cosmonauts in 2023, pushing their six-month mission to just past a year.",
      "Boeing said this week that input from Wilmore and Williams has been \u201cinvaluable\" in the ongoing inquiry of what went wrong. The company said in a statement that it is preparing for Starliner's next flight but declined comment on when it might launch again.",
      "NASA also has high praise for the pair.",
      "\u201cWhether it was luck or whether it was selection, they were great folks to have for this mission,\u201d NASA's chief health and medical officer, Dr. JD Polk, said during an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "On top of everything else, Williams, 59, has had to deal with \u201crumors,\u201d as she calls them, of serious weight loss. She insists her weight is the same as it was on launch day, which Polk confirms.",
      "During Wednesday's student chat, Williams said she didn't have much of an appetite when she first arrived in space. But now she's \u201csuper hungry\u201d and eating three meals a day plus snacks, while logging the required two hours of daily exercise.",
      "Williams, a distance runner, uses the space station treadmill to support races in her home state. She competed in Cape Cod\u2019s 7-mile Falmouth Road Race in August. She ran the 2007 Boston Marathon up there as well.",
      "She has a New England Patriots shirt with her for game days, as well as a Red Sox spring training shirt.",
      "\u201cHopefully I\u2019ll be home before that happens -- but you never know,\u201d she said in November. Husband Michael Williams, a retired federal marshal and former Navy aviator, is caring for their dogs back home in Houston.",
      "As for Wilmore, 61, he's missing his younger daughter's senior year in high school and his older daughter's theater productions in college.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t deny that being unexpectedly separated, especially during the holidays when the entire family gets together, brings increased yearnings to share the time and events together,\u201d his wife, Deanna Wilmore, told the AP in a text this week. Her husband \u201chas it worse than us\u201d since he's confined to the space station and can only connect via video for short periods.",
      "\u201cWe are certainly looking forward to February!!\u201d she wrote.",

      "In an era when online anger and social tensions are increasingly directed at the businesses consumers count on, Meta last year spent $24.4 million to surround CEO Mark Zuckerberg with security",
      "NEW YORK -- He\u2019s one of the most famous corporate leaders in the world, delivering products embraced by billions. But it\u2019s the haters that companies like Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta worry about.",
      "In an era when online anger and social tensions are increasingly directed at the businesses consumers count on, Meta last year spent $24.4 million on guards, alarms and other measures to keep Zuckerberg and the company\u2019s former chief operating officer safe.",
      "Some high-profile CEOs surround themselves with security. But the fatal shooting this week of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson while he walked alone on a New York City sidewalk has put a spotlight on the widely varied approaches companies take in protecting their leaders against threats.",
      "Thompson had no personal security and appeared unaware of the shooter lurking before he was gunned down.",
      "And today\u2019s political, economic and technological climate is only going to make the job of evaluating threats against executives and taking action to protect them even more difficult, experts say.",
      "\u201cWe are better today at collecting signals. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re any better at making sense of the signals we collect,\u201d says Fred Burton of Ontic, a provider of threat management software for companies.",
      "After Thompson's shooting, Burton said, \u201cI\u2019ve been on the phone all day with some organizations asking for consultation, saying, \u2019Am I doing enough?\u201d",
      "Since the killing, some health insurers have taken steps to safeguard their executives and rank-and-file workers.",
      "Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, said Friday it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons and will have its employees work from home.",
      "\u201cAlthough we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "A Medica spokesman said the company had also removed biographical information about its executives from its website as a precaution.",
      "UnitedHealth Group, parent of the insurer Thompson led, removed photos of its top executives from its website hours after the shooting, later removing their names and biographies.",
      "But well before the attack, some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, were spending heavily on personal and residential security for their top executives.",
      "Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "Zuckerberg \u201cis synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,\u201d the Menlo Park, California, company explained earlier this year in an annual shareholder disclosure.",
      "At Apple, the world\u2019s largest tech company by stock valuation, CEO Tim Cook was tormented by a stalker  who sent him sexually provocative emails and even showed up outside his Silicon Valley home at one point before the company\u2019s security team successfully took legal action against her in 2022.",
      "Cook is regularly accompanied by security personnel when he appears in public. Still, the company\u2019s $820,000 allotted last year to protect top executives is a fraction of what other tech giants spent for CEO security.",
      "Just over a quarter of the companies in the Fortune 500 reported spending money to protect their CEOs and other top executives. Of those that did, the median payment for personal security doubled over the last three years to about $98,000.",
      "In many companies, investor meetings like the one UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Thompson was walking to when he was shot are viewed as very risky because details on the location and who will be speaking are highly publicized.",
      "\u201cIt gives people an opportunity to arrive well in advance and take a look at the room, take a look at how people would probably come and go out of a location,\u201d said Dave Komendat, president of DSKomendat Risk Management Services, which is based in the greater Seattle area.",
      "Some firms respond by beefing up security. For example, tech companies routinely require everyone attending a major event, such as Apple\u2019s annual unveiling of the next iPhone or a shareholder meeting, to go through airport-style security checkpoints before entering.",
      "Others forgo in-person meetings with shareholders. Government health insurance provider Centene Corp. joined that group Thursday, citing the UnitedHealthcare executive's death in announcing that its upcoming Investor Day will be held online, rather than in-person as originally planned.",
      "\u201cBut there are also company cultures that really frown on that and want their leaders to be accessible to people, accessible to shareholders, employees,\u201d Komendat said.",
      "Depending on the company, such an approach may make sense. Many top executives are little known to the public, operating in industries and locations that make them far less prone to public exposure and to threats.",
      "\u201cDetermining the need for and appropriate level of an executive-level protection program is specific to each organization,\u201d says David Johnston, vice president of asset protection and retail operations at the National Retail Federation. \u201cThese safeguards should also include the constant monitoring of potential threats and the ability to adapt to maintain the appropriate level of security and safety.\u201d",
      "Some organizations have a protective intelligence group that uses digital tools such as machine learning or artificial intelligence to comb through online comments to detect threats not only on social media platforms such as X but also on the dark web, says Komendat. They look for what\u2019s being said about the company, its employees and its leadership to uncover risks.",
      "\u201cThere are always threats directed towards senior leaders at companies. Many of them are not credible,\u201d Komendat said. \u201cThe question always is trying to determine what is a real threat versus what is someone just venting with no intent to take any additional action.\u201d",
      "Burton, a former special agent with the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service, points out that despite the current climate, there is little in the way of organized groups that target companies.",
      "Today, one of the primary worries are loners whose rantings online are fed by others who are like-minded. It\u2019s up to corporate security analysts to zero in on such dialogue and decide whether or not it represents a real threat.",
      "And CEOs aren\u2019t the only targets of disgruntled customers. In the U.S., there were 525 workplace fatalities due to assault in 2022, according to the National Safety Council. Industries including healthcare, education and service providers are more prone to violence than others, and taxi drivers are more than 20 times more likely to be murdered on the job than other workers, the group said.",
      "But the ambush of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Thompson this week is bound to get some CEOs second-guessing.",
      "\u201cWhat invariably happen at moments like this in time is you will get additional ears listening\u201d to security professionals seeking money to beef up executive protection, Burton says.",
      "\u201cBecause I can guarantee you there\u2019s not a CEO in America who\u2019s not aware of this incident.\u201d",

      "The nationwide vaccine campaign, implemented by the government in partnership with the global vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization and the United Nations children\u2019s agency, will target 20,000 frontline workers across the country, officials said.",

      "But now, as he\u2019s approaching 60, he\u2019s considering selling his Fairfax County home and moving away. That\u2019s because he\u2019s getting a new neighbor: Plaza 500, a 466,000-square-foot data center and an adjacent electrical substation to be built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",

      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies. But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world\u2019s most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "Tyler Ray, a vocal critic of data centers and leader in the fight against the Virginia project, said the incentives offered are not enough to counteract the consequences of building a facility so close to homes.",
      "\u201cAll that we are asking for is, as the county is trying to bring in this data center income, that they are doing it in a way that doesn\u2019t run residents away from their homes,\u201d he said.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area\u2019s westernmost counties. Cyclists who ride the popular Washington & Old Dominion trail are at times flanked by data centers, and the thousands of commuters who head into the nation\u2019s capital each day can see them in the distance from the Metro.",
      "Plaza 500, one of the latest proposals in the area, is encroaching on neighborhoods like never before, said Newman, who heads a homeowners association in the community.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised a significant property tax boost and, in addition to permanent positions in the data center itself, hundreds of temporary construction and electrical jobs to build the facility.",
      "Tyler Ray and his husband moved to the Bren Pointe community in 2022, hoping to balance proximity to Washington with a desire for green space.",
      "But shortly after the couple moved in, Starwood Capital began scoping out a commercial property near their new home as a possible location for the Plaza 500 project.",
      "When Ray and his neighbors learned of the proposal, they held protests, attended regular county meetings and drew media attention to their concerns to try and stop the development. But their efforts were largely unsuccessful: the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project would be grandfathered in under the old rules.",
      "Ray worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers\u2019 hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "A spokesman for the firm declined to respond to questions for this story.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue,\u201d Ray said, \u201chas any chance to go up against the data center industry.\u201d",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia\u2019s existing data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue, more than the $750 million in tax breaks given to the tech companies that own them in 2023.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2014 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its two data centers in Loudoun County, which has about 440,000 residents, created only around 150 direct jobs. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\u201cI have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\u201d Smith said. \u201cData centers are not going away.\u201d",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS, which is owned by Amazon, paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. The company also paid out $10 million total in two, one-time payments to a community development fund and spent another $1.7 million in charitable donations in the community in 2023.",
      "That money has been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services for the roughly 12,000-person county, going toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer, police body cameras, and $5,000 grants for homebuyers among other things.",
      "Still, some residents are skeptical of the scale of tax break deals. Suspicions started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint against them.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But some remain wary of the relationships between the company and local officials, and raised eyebrows at one of the latest data center deals which gives AWS an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers.",
      "Former county commissioner Jim Doherty described a meeting with AWS officials soon after he was elected to office at an upscale restaurant in Boardman, where large windows opened onto the Columbia River.",
      "The AWS representatives asked what Doherty wanted to accomplish as a commissioner. \u201cThey said, \u2018Tell us what your dreams are. Tell us what you need. Tell us what we can do for you,\u2019\u201d Doherty recalled. Other former officials have described similar interactions. Doherty said AWS didn\u2019t ask for anything in return, but the exchange left him uneasy.",
      "\u201cWe engage with stakeholders in every community where we operate around the world, and part of that outreach is to better understand a community\u2019s goals,\u201d said Kevin Miller, AWS' Vice President of global data centers. \u201cThis helps AWS be a catalyst for communities to achieve those goals, and reflects our ongoing commitment to being good neighbors.\u201d",
      "Doherty and another former county commissioner Melissa Lindsay said they pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations. They also lobbied to hire outside counsel to negotiate on their behalf, feeling outgunned by the phalanx of AWS-suited lawyers.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to blow it up. We didn\u2019t want to run them off,\" said Lindsay. \u201cBut there were better deals to be made.\u201d",

      "Bitcoin burst on the scene after trust had withered in the financial system and Washington\u2019s ability to protect people from it",
      "NEW YORK -- Born from the ashes of the 2008 global financial crisis, bitcoin arrived after trust had withered in the financial system and in Washington's ability to protect those who must participate in it. Now, it's Washington's very embrace of bitcoin that's helping to send its price to records and lining the pockets of its believers.",
      "Bitcoin briefly surged above $103,000 after President-elect Donald Trump said he intends to nominate Paul Atkins, a former regulator who's seen as friendly to crypto, as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He would replace Gary Gensler, who critics say has been overly aggressive in his oversight of crypto.",
      "It's the latest leg in an astonishing run for bitcoin, whose swings in price are already notoriously extreme.",
      "Bitcoin has more than doubled this year, with a particularly big jump coming after Election Day, when its price was sitting below $70,000. During his campaign, Trump called for making the United States \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "The crypto industry, meanwhile, did its part to bring politicians friendly to digital currencies into Washington. Crypto corporations poured over $119 million into influencing federal elections in 2024, primarily into a political action committee dedicated to electing pro-crypto candidates and defeating crypto skeptics, according to a recent review by Public Citizen.",
      "It's a large amount. Crypto companies accounted for 44% of all the corporate money contributed during this year\u2019s elections, according to the consumer advocacy organization.",
      "Such a tight embrace marks an interesting twist from bitcoin's early days, when someone or a group of someones under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto created a kind of electronic cash that wouldn't be beholden to any government or financial institution.",
      "In the white paper announcing bitcoin, Namakoto said the traditional way of doing business on the internet \u201cworks well enough for most transactions.\u201d But, Nakamoto said, it \u201cstill suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model,\u201d where a third party like a bank needs to process payments.",
      "Instead, Nakamoto suggested harnessing computing power around the world as a way to create a digital currency that can\u2019t be double-spent. \u201cWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.\u201d That is what became the bitcoin network.",
      "Since then, bitcoin has moved from the financial fringes toward the mainstream, in jagged fits and starts. While it hasn't taken off as a way to pay for groceries, it found popularity as a kind of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a way to store value in something that's not subject to the direct influence of a federal government or a central bank.",
      "In its early days, it had a reputation for use by drug dealers, scammers, crypto enthusiasts, libertarians and others who were looking to move money without oversight by the government. Now, it's also found its way into more investor portfolios. Earlier this year, the SEC approved exchange-traded funds that track the spot price of bitcoin. Such ETFs give investors a relatively easy way to buy bitcoin directly in their existing trading accounts.",
      "Through its life, bitcoin has soared through a series of manic bull runs as well as \u201ccrypto winters\u201d that brought extreme declines. It went from just over $5,000 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to nearly $69,000 by late 2021, before crashing below $17,000 following hikes to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and the 2022 collapse of crypto exchange FTX.",
      "With bitcoin in its latest bull run, the man who's about to roll into the White House seemed to take at least some credit.",
      "\u201cCONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!!\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network. \u201c$100,000!!! YOU\u2019RE WELCOME!!!\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Smartmatic does not need to give Fox News any information about U.S. federal charges against the voting machine company\u2019s co-founder over alleged bribery in the Philippines",
      "NEW YORK -- Smartmatic won't be required to give Fox News a trove of information about U.S. federal charges against the voting machine company's co-founder over alleged bribery in the Philippines, a judge ruled Thursday.",
      "Fox News and parent Fox Corp. sought the information to help fight Smartmatic's $2.7 billion defamation suit over broadcasts about the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Smartmatic says its business was gutted when Fox aired false claims that the election-tech company helped rig the voting.",
      "Fox says it was simply reporting on newsworthy allegations made by then-President Donald Trump and his allies.",
      "At the same hearing, Judge David B. Cohen also turned down Smartmatic's request to question two Fox Corp. board members. The company has already questioned others.",
      "The Aug. 8 indictment of Smartmatic co-founder Roger Pi\u00f1ate and two other executives concerns a geographically distant matter: Smartmatic's efforts to get work in the Philippines between 2015 and 2018.",
      "But Fox maintains the criminal case is pertinent to Smartmatic's business prospects, and therefore to the election-tech company's claims about what it lost and stands to lose because of Fox's 2020 coverage.",
      "\u201cAs of Aug 8, governments will have to take into account the risks of doing business with a company (where some executives have been) accused of serious corruption by the U.S. Department of Justice,\" Fox lawyer Brad Masters told a New York court Thursday.",
      "He asked the court to order Smartmatic to provide any documents that it has given to the DOJ for the bribery investigation; any customer inquiries about the criminal charges; and any staff communications about the matter and its impact on the company.",
      "The indictment accuses Pi\u00f1ate and two other Smartmatic executives of scheming to pay over $1 million in bribes to a Filipino election official to deploy the company's machines and pay promptly for them. Federal prosecutors say the payments were made through sham loan agreements and via a slush fund created by overcharging for the machines.",
      "Pi\u00f1ate, who has served as Smartmatic\u2019s president, and at least one of the other executives have pleaded not guilty to conspiring to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and to money laundering. It\u2019s unclear from court records whether the third executive has entered a plea or has an attorney who can comment on the charges.",
      "Boca Raton, Florida-based Smartmatic itself isn\u2019t charged in the criminal case. The company put the executives on leave and sought to reassure voters that elections are \u201cconducted with the utmost integrity and transparency.\u201d",
      "Smartmatic's lawyers contend the indictment is irrelevant to the defamation suit, which is about election-fraud claims that Trump's attorneys made on Fox News programs.",
      "The indictment is \u201cmerely an allegation,\u201d Smartmatic attorney Caitlin Kovacs argued Thursday. She suggested Fox wanted to \u201cplay prosecutor to the jury\u201d and \u201caccuse Smartmatic of a crime that they didn\u2019t commit.\u201d",
      "Cohen denied two similar requests from Fox while the federal investigation was ongoing. He said Thursday that the indictment didn't change his mind.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a mere accusation. It raises no presumption of guilt,\u201d he said.",
      "Smartmatic is suing over shows in which Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell portrayed the company as part of a broad conspiracy to steal the 2020 vote from Trump, a Republican and the winner of this year's election.",
      "Federal and state election officials, exhaustive reviews in battleground states and Trump\u2019s own then-attorney general found no widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Nor did they uncover any credible evidence that the vote was tainted. Dozens of judges, including some whom Trump appointed, rejected his fraud claims.",
      "Fox News ultimately aired an interview with an election technology expert who refuted the allegations against Smartmatic.",
      "As is normal in the run-up to a civil trial, various players connected to both parties have been questioned under oath by the other side's lawyers. These out-of-court sessions are called depositions.",
      "Smartmatic wanted Thursday to get depositions ordered for Fox Corp. board members Chase Carey and Roland Hernandez. The two attended meetings where critical decisions were made, Smartmatic argues.",
      "Fox lawyer Devin Anderson said there's no indication that Carey and Hernandez \u201chave any relevant information\u201d to add. Smartmatic already has questioned other board members, including Executive Chair and CEO Lachlan Murdoch and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, as well as Fox founder Rupert Murdoch, the attorney said.",
      "Depositions generally aren't made public at this stage of a case.",
      "Smartmatic lawyer Erik Connolly said after court that the company was pursuing other information to show \u201cthat Fox Corp. controlled the disinformation spread by Fox News.\u201d",
      "A message seeking comment was sent to Fox. The news network is countersuing Smartmatic, claiming the defamation case violates a New York law against baseless suits aimed at squelching reporting or criticism on public issues.",
      "Smartmatic recently settled defamation suits against One America News Network and Newsmax. Fox News settled for $787 million last year with another voting-technology company, Dominion Voting Systems."

      "A pair of European satellites has rocketed into orbit on a mission to create artificial solar eclipses",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A pair of European satellites rocketed into orbit Thursday on the first mission to create artificial solar eclipses through fancy formation flying in space.",
      "Each fake eclipse should last six hours once operations begin next year. That's considerably longer than the few minutes of totality offered by a natural eclipse here on Earth, allowing for prolonged study of the sun's corona, or outer atmosphere.",
      "The launch took place from India.",
      "\u201cWe are a very happy science team here\u201d in India, the European Space Agency's mission scientist Joe Zender said via email.",
      "Billed as a tech demo, the two satellites will separate in a month or so and fly 492 feet (150 meters) apart once reaching their destination high above Earth, lining up with the sun so that one spacecraft casts a shadow on the other.",
      "This will require extreme precision, within just one millimeter, equivalent to a fingernail's thickness, according to the European Space Agency. To maintain their position, the satellites will rely on GPS, star trackers, lasers and radio links, flying autonomously.",
      "Each cube-shaped spacecraft is less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) across. The shadow-casting satellite holds a disk to block the sun from the telescope on the other satellite. This disk will mimic the moon in a natural total solar eclipse, with the darkened satellite posing as Earth.",
      "\u201cThis has a huge scientific relevance\u201d in addition to testing high-precision formation flying,\u201d said the European Space Agency\u2019s technology and engineering director Dietmar Pilz.",
      "Scientists need the glaring face of the sun completely blocked in order to scrutinize the wispy crown-like corona encircling it, getting an especially good look close to the solar rim on this mission. They're particularly interested to learn why the corona is hotter than the surface of the sun, and also want to better understand coronal mass ejections, eruptions of billions of tons of plasma with magnetic fields out into space.",
      "The resulting geomagnetic storms can disrupt power and communication on Earth and in orbit. Such outbursts can also produce stunning auroras in unexpected places.",
      "With a lopsided orbit stretching from 370 miles (600 kilometers) to 37,000 miles (60,000 kilometers) away, the satellites will take nearly 20 hours to circle the world. Six of those hours \u2014 at the farther end of certain orbits \u2014 will be spent generating an eclipse. Other orbits will be strictly for formation flying experiments, according to the European Space Agency.",
      "The first eclipse results should be available in March, following checkout of both craft.",
      "Zender said eclipses will be created at least twice a week, with six hours of totality each time for corona observations. The frequency will depend on solar activity, he noted, and prove a boon for scientists who now must travel across the world for a mere three to five minutes of totality during the occasional eclipse.",
      "The $210 million mission, dubbed Proba-3, is aiming for at least 1,000 hours of \u201con demand\u201d totality during its two-year operation. Once their job is done, both satellites will gradually drop lower until they burn up in the atmosphere, likely within five years.",
      "Liftoff was delayed a day by a last-minute issue with the backup propulsion system of one of the satellites, crucial for precision formation flying. The European Space Agency said engineers relied on a computer software fix.",

      "NASA will use the Orion capsule with its original heat shield for the next flight with four astronauts, according to Nelson, but make changes to the reentry path at flight's end. To rip off and replace the heat shield would have meant at least a full year's delay and stalled the moon landing even further, officials said.",

      "A federal appeals court panel on Friday unanimously upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok as soon as next month, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied TikTok's petition to overturn the law \u2014 which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January \u2014 and rebuffed the company's challenge of the statute, which it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\u201d said the court's opinion, which was written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg. \u201cHere the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary\u2019s ability to gather data on people in the United States.\u201d",
      "TikTok and ByteDance \u2014 another plaintiff in the lawsuit \u2014 are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, though its unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,\u201d Hughes said. Unless stopped, he argued the statute \u201cwill silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.\u201d",
      "Though the case is squarely in the court system, it's also possible the two companies might be thrown some sort of a lifeline by President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "\u201cHe wants to save TikTok,\u201d Rep. Michael Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said Friday during an interview on Fox Business.",
      "The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China.",
      "The U.S. has said it\u2019s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect. The European Union on Friday expressed similar concerns as it investigates intelligence that suggests Russia possibly abused the platform to influence the elections in Romania.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday.",
      "TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn\u2019t provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing\u2019s benefit in the U.S. They have also argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government.",
      "Friday\u2019s ruling came after the appeals court panel, composed of two Republicans and one Democrat appointed judges, heard oral arguments in September.",
      "In the hearing, which lasted more than two hours, the panel appeared to grapple with how TikTok\u2019s foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. On Friday, all three denied TikTok\u2019s petition.",
      "In the court's ruling, Ginsburg, a Republican appointee, rejected TikTok's main legal arguments against the law, including that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder, or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He also said the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \"suppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "\u201cContent on the platform could in principle remain unchanged after divestiture, and people in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,\u201d Ginsburg wrote, using the abbreviation for the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge on the court, issued a concurring opinion.",
      "TikTok\u2019s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators \u2014 for which the company is covering legal costs \u2014 as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Other organizations, including the Knight First Amendment Institute, had also filed amicus briefs supporting TikTok.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply misguided ruling that reads important First Amendment precedents too narrowly and gives the government sweeping power to restrict Americans\u2019 access to information, ideas, and media from abroad,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the organization. \u201cWe hope that the appeals court\u2019s ruling won\u2019t be the last word.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers who had pushed for the legislation celebrated the court's ruling.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\u201d said Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China.",
      "Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who co-authored the law, said \u201cit's time for ByteDance to accept\u201d the law.",
      "To assuage concerns about the company\u2019s owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data.",
      "The company has also argued the government\u2019s broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient.",
      "Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it\u2019s impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm \u2014 the platform\u2019s secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan \u2014 would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. business.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital."

Billionaire hedge fund manager and longtime museum donor Ken Griffin bought it at an auction in July for $45 million, the most ever paid for dinosaur remains. Sean Decatur, president of the American Museum of Natural History, said that Griffin approved a long-term loan of Apex, as well as allowing scientists to take samples from the fossil for analysis.",
      "\u201cThis partnership allows Apex to have pride of place at a museum world-renowned for its dinosaur collection and for its longstanding leadership in paleontology and, even more exciting, enables us to pursue specialized Stegosaurus research centered around this extraordinary and scientifically important specimen,\u201d Decatur said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Of the more than 80 stegosauri made available to scientific institutions, very few are substantially complete, the statement said. Apex is the most complete specimen ever found, Decatur said. With about 80% of its 320 bones preserved, it is miraculous for creature that has been dead for 150 million years. The specimen is also prized by scientists because it is estimated to have died at a relatively old age, and it could reveal insights into stegosaurus metabolism and bone growth.",
      "Scientists will make CT scans of the internal structures of the dinosaur's skull and analyze a small sample extracted from one of its giant thigh bones, the statement said.",
      "\u201cAs exciting as is it is to have this dinosaur on display, it is even more exciting to have the opportunity to study it and make important scientific data available for research,\u201d said Roger Benson, who curates the American Museum of Natural History's fossil amphibians, reptiles, birds and plants.",
      "The museum\u2019s paleontologists have a long record of breaking ground in dinosaur research, including identifying the first dinosaur eggs and early evidence of dinosaur feathers, the statement said.",
      "Commercial paleontologist Jason Cooper discovered in Apex on his land near Dinosaur, Colorado, on the Utah border near Dinosaur National Monument.",
      "Griffin's successful $44.6 million bid for Apex over the summer set a record for dinosaur remains, beating out the $31.8 million paid for \u201cStan,\u201d the remains of a Tyrannosaurus rex sold in 2020. Like Apex, the Stan fossils were purchased by a private individual with plans to make it available to the public. The T. rex has been slated to be on display in Abu Dhabi, in United Arab Emirates, at a museum that opens in late 2025.",

      "The manhunt for CEO Brian Thompson's killer is now on its fourth day.",
      "The backpack recovered by the NYPD that allegedly belonged to the suspect wanted in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, only had two items inside: a Tommy Hilfiger jacket and Monopoly money, sources with knowledge of the ongoing investigation told ABC News Saturday.",
      "The NYPD believes it is making good progress toward identifying the suspect but, as of Saturday evening, no identification has been made, sources told ABC News.",
      "Investigators continued to comb through the city for evidence and clues for a fourth day to try and catch the unidentified fugitive. That included the use of police divers.",
      "Officers searched a pond near Bethesda Fountain in Central Park, not too far from where the suspect's backpack was found Friday night.",
      "Police have not yet recovered the distinctive gun used in the shooting. It is unclear if officers recovered any evidence from the water.",
      "New York investigators and the FBI continue to track the shooter's movements after the Wednesday morning incident and have said that he left the city that day.",
      "Some New York investigators arrived in Atlanta Saturday following tips that have come in about the shooter, according to sources. The Atlanta PD confirmed the arrival of the New York team but declined to give more specifics.",
      "The suspect allegedly arrived in New York on a Greyhound bus that departed from Atlanta. Police have learned that the suspect took a taxi to the Port Authority bus facility at 178th Street and boarded a bus out of New York City following the shooting, according to police.",
      "The bus the suspect is believed to have boarded out of the city made six or seven stops, and investigators have followed leads in multiple states, the sources said.",
      "The killer entered New York City by bus on Nov. 24, when a surveillance camera at Port Authority Bus Terminal caught his arrival at 9 p.m., law enforcement sources told ABC News.",
      "The inbound bus originated in Atlanta, but it was not immediately clear where the suspect boarded. Sources told ABC News he was spotted on board in Washington, D.C.",
      "The 10-day period he was in New York City before the shooting is the focus of investigative efforts.",
      "The FBI is now assisting in a nationwide manhunt for the suspect, according to law enforcement sources, and the unidentified man remains at large in the wake of Wednesday's attack, which was described by police as \"brazen, targeted\" and \"premeditated.\"",
      "Police still do not have a name of the suspect, the sources said.",
      "Meanwhile, citing the recent killing of Thompson, Centene, a major health insurer, said it would be moving its planned in-person investor day in New York City next week to virtual, according to a statement from the company on Friday.",
      "\"All of us at Centene are deeply saddened by Brian Thompson's death and want to express our support for all of those affected. Health insurance is a big industry and a small community; many members of the CenTeam crossed paths with Brian during their careers,\" said Centene Chief Executive Officer, Sarah M. London. \"He was a person with a deep sense of empathy and clear passion for improving access to care. Our hearts are with his family and his colleagues during this difficult time.\"",
      "The masked gunman shot Thompson at point-blank range at 6:44 a.m. Wednesday outside the New York Hilton Midtown, where Thompson was heading for his company's investors conference.",
      "\"The shooter then walks toward the victim and continues to shoot,\" NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. \"It appears that the gun malfunctions, as he clears the jam and begins to fire again.\"",
      "Written on the shell casings were the words \"deny,\" \"defend\" and \"depose,\" according to police sources.",
      "The words on the bullets echo the title of the 2010 book \"Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It.\" Police are aware of the similarity, and are investigating whether one possible motive is anger at the insurance industry, sources said.",
      "Investigators believe they were able to score DNA samples from several pieces of evidence discovered at or near the crime scene, law enforcement sources told ABC News. The samples are currently at the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to be run through databases for a possible match -- a process that could take several days, the sources said.",
      "Police were also able to extract a fingerprint off a water bottle the suspect bought at a Starbucks, but the print is smudged so it's not clear how helpful it will be, sources said.",

      "According to court documents, the 57-year-old woman approached Fuentes' home in Berwyn on Nov. 10, shortly after his address was leaked following his post, the Chicago Tribune reported. Berwyn is a Chicago suburb of about 54,000 people.",

      "A federal judge paused the child sexual abuse case involving President-elect Donald Trump's education secretary pick Linda McMahon, her husband Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).",
      "The Maryland lawsuit, filed in October by five John Does who worked as the ringside crew when they were teens, alleges WWE co-founders Linda and Vince McMahon turned a blind eye to years of sexual abuse of the underaged \"ring boys\" by an announcer and executives at the company. The McMahons have denied the claims.",
      "The stay in the case is a major development for the businesswoman and former Small Business Administration head -- Linda McMahon's cabinet role is tasked with investigating sexual misconduct in education programs.",
      "Linda McMahon has been meeting with senators who will determine whether she'll be confirmed for the position in Trump's second administration while her apparent lack of experience in schools is being debated.",
      "U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar granted a stay in the case pending a ruling by the Supreme Court of Maryland in the Maryland Child Victims Act of 2023 (CVA). The CVA could repeal the statute of limitations in certain civil actions relating to child sexual abuse, according to Maryland House Bill 1. This includes sexual abuse and any other sexual conduct that is a crime.",
      "Earlier this week, the defendants, WWE, it's parent company TKO, and the McMahons, sought a stay in the case until the Maryland Supreme Court rules on CVA's constitutionality.

    "story": [
      "He's \"going to be a future force to be reckoned with,\" one Republican said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has been the ultimate GOP mover and shaker since 2015, using his sway to impact the party far beyond just his own political career. Now, Vice President-elect JD Vance has some early opportunities to make his own mark.",
      "Vance, still Ohio's junior senator, has shepherded some of Trump's Cabinet picks around and can use his ties to his colleagues to promote others. He is also in touch with Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine as he mulls who to tap to replace Vance in the Senate until 2026, when that person would then have to run in a special election to serve the rest of the seat's term.",
      "It's unlikely that Vance -- or anyone -- can emulate Trump's unique ability to affect change in the party. But Vance is the country's second-highest ranking Republican and considered Trump's heir apparent, making the upcoming opportunities chances to glimpse the power the 40-year-old holds across the GOP to promote the incoming administration's goals but also his own stock beyond his formal role.",
      "\"It's pretty clear that he is in a pole position after Trump to help lead the party. So, he's going to, I think, take these opportunities to show the party that he's a loyal soldier to Donald Trump, but he's also going to be a future force to be reckoned with,\" said former Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who remains in touch with Trump's team.",
      "Vance is not a sherpa for every single Cabinet pick, but he did escort former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, Trump's failed attorney general pick, and Pete Hegseth, tapped to lead the Pentagon, around Capitol Hill. He's also making calls to Senate colleagues about some of Trump's Cabinet choices, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "He's also in what one source described as semi-regular contact with DeWine as the two-term governor mulls who to appoint to the Senate seat that Vance is vacating. The decision is ultimately DeWine's, and there currently doesn't appear to be a favorite for the role, but sources said they would be surprised if the person was someone who rubbed Vance and Trump the wrong way.",
      "\"Ohio is his domain, so I think you can expect that his voice in the upcoming Senate race will be important,\" one source close to Vance said. \"There is a want to land on somebody that everybody involved will be happy with, DeWine, Trump and JD.\"",
      "To be certain, Vance can only move the needle so far with Cabinet confirmations and Senate appointments, decisions that are up to a Senate looking for chances to assert its independence and a governor who has clashed with Trump but remained electorally viable. There will also be tougher battles to come as the next administration works to muscle through its policy priorities, and Trump will still run the show as a dominant political figure who virtually blocks out the sun.",
      "But the dual conversations over appointments could offer early indications of how much Republicans listen when Vance speaks, even as someone's No. 2.",
      "\"He talks to [senators] a lot,\" said one source in Vance's orbit. \"They're his colleagues still for another four weeks. So, yeah, he works the phones. He was on Capitol Hill this week. I think he wants to see folks get in there so the administration can hit the ground running on day one.",
      "\"He's a surrogate for when the President has to be in multiple places at the same time. He's influential, but I don\u2019t know that he's more persuasive than the president as such. He\u2019s augmenting,\" the person added.",
      "Already, Vance has seen some of his allies elevated in the incoming administration.",
      "James Braid, who was Vance's deputy chief of staff in the Senate, will be the White House's formal liaison to Congress. Daniel Driscoll, another Vance ally, was tapped to be secretary of the Army. Trump picked hedge fund manager and Vance friend Scott Bessent as his treasury secretary after he donated millions to the presidential ticket.",
      "And Vance has already proven his sway by helping now-Ohio Republican Sen.-elect Bernie Moreno win Trump's endorsement in the Ohio Senate primary this year and then get him over the finish line against Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown who had defied political gravity for several cycles.",
      "There have been setbacks, too -- Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration after sexual misconduct allegations dogged his nomination, and Hegseth is facing headwinds over allegations of sexual assault and heavy drinking that he's denied. However, it's unclear how much outside help could improve their chances given the gravity of the allegations.",
      "\"This is a chance to see how many of Vice President-Elect Vance's confidants end up in the Cabinet, and whether they are Cabinet secretaries, or the other place to take a very serious look is the undersecretaries,\" said Steve Stivers, a former congressman who leads the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. \"It's not just the Cabinet secretaries, but the undersecretaries that matter here, because those will be people filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 being ready to move up.\"",
      "Still, there's no guarantee that Vance will be able to be as big of a mover and shaker as normally possible for vice presidents in Trump's White House.",
      "The president-elect is famously wary of others enjoying too bright of a spotlight, and there could be other high-profile Republicans who are also anticipated to be power players after Trump leaves office, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump's pick to lead the State Department, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is rumored to be in the mix for Pentagon chief if Hegseth's nomination falls through.",
      "\"Obviously, he has a great opportunity here. But I think for folks to say it's a fait accompli that JD Vance is somehow ahead of the rest of the field today, I just don't think that's accurate,\" said one former senior Trump administration official.",
      "\"What is he going to do that's outside of the Trump shadow, that is actually him, that is not him acting as a liaison for Donald Trump? And of those things, what does he do that pisses off Donald Trump? Because it's a guy that doesn't really like people operating outside of his shadow.\"",
      "But at the end of the day, Vance will have a more elevated platform than any other Republican in the country except for one, and Trump enters office as a lame duck because of constitutional term limits, possibly leaving Vance well-positioned for a potential vacuum in a party dominated by Trump for nearly a decade.",
      "\"Trump picked him for a specific reason, and that reason is to carry the mantle. Now, he's 40 years old. That dude could be around for a while. Trump was looking ahead,\" said Ohio GOP strategist Mike Hartley. \"I think he's going to give him every opportunity to succeed.\"",

      "The woman, who is only identified in the police report as Jane Doe, has not publicly come forward.",
      "Hegseth has repeatedly reiterated that he was not charged and has denied the assault allegations.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 22:29:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Senior staffers from the Trump and Harris campaigns met at Harvard University's Campaign Managers Conference on Friday to discuss the unprecedented 2024 campaign summer.",
    "story": [
      "Much of the debate focused on the 107 days Harris was the Democratic nominee.",
      "Senior staffers from the Trump and Harris campaigns met at Harvard University's Campaign Managers Conference on Friday to discuss the summer of 2024, which gave way to an unprecedented political season that included a disastrous debate performance for President Joe Biden, a subsequent new Democratic nominee in Vice President Kamala Harris, and two assassination attempts on former President Donald Trump.",
      "Much of the debate focused on the 107 days with Harris as the new Democratic nominee and how the campaigns had to tweak their strategies on a highly truncated timeline. The following are highlights from the sprawling, wide-ranging conversation.",
      "Sparks flew toward the end of their discussion when a member of the Trump campaign said the former president \"outworked\" Harris.",
      "\"Why didn't you trust your candidate more?\" questioned Taylor Budowich, deputy campaign manager for the Trump campaign. \"Why didn't you put her out more? You said \u2026 you couldn't ever compete with the amount of attention Donald Trump got. You never gave her a shot.\"",
      "The Harris campaign pushed back at Budowich, saying that its strategy was successful and not that the Trump campaign outworked them.",
      "\"Your strategy was a good strategy, but you have no idea how hard the people on the other side worked,\" said Quentin Fulks, principal deputy campaign manager for the Harris campaign. \"I have no idea how hard you all work.\"",
      "Budowich interjected, saying he was referring to Harris and not the entire campaign, but Fulks asserted that Harris worked hard.",
      "\"I didn't say she didn't work hard. I said she got outworked,\" Budowich clarified.",
      "Fulks defended the vice president, explaining that it was not a fair comparison because the Harris campaign had a different strategy, which he said wasn't successful. He reiterated that it was nothing related to her work ethic.",
      "Asked by ABC News' Brittany Shepherd about the fallout from President Joe Biden seeming to call Trump supporters garbage on a call hosted by the nonprofit Voto Latino during the final weeks of the campaign, Fulks said Democrats need to do a better job at not creating self-inflicted wounds -- pointing to some in his own party very quickly criticizing Biden after the White House, and Biden himself, attempted to clarify the statement, in comparison to what he sees to be Republicans' very long leash for Donald Trump.",
      "\"Our people, once again, continue to shoot ourselves in the foot,\" Fulks said.",
      "\"The discipline on the Right is better than the discipline on the Left,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that is not about morals, values, any of that. It's literally about discipline and seeing the big picture of how you win and what you can swallow in order to get to a win.\"",
      "Jen O'Malley Dillon, Harris campaign chairwoman, didn't stray with the repeated messaging on Biden's debate performance, reiterating he had a \"bad night\" and pointing to Obama as a precedent of incumbents having uneven debates, and argued the campaign saw a real path for Biden to win the election despite it all.",
      "\"So, we very much felt like we throughout had a path to 270. We felt like we had the right candidate, the person we believed in, and the person was leading our country quite well,\" O'Malley Dillon said. \"We still believe that.\"",
      "Without pointing to a particular moment, Fulks conceded that early in the debate, campaign staff could tell Biden wasn't performing.",
      "Trump's team was far more pointed, saying it was evident Biden \"was not going to survive\" the election cycle \"about a minute\" into the debate, according to Chris LaCivita, Trump's co-campaign manager.",
      "\"I think that for us, and this was with all due respect to the president, we felt like there were challenges that were on full display at the debate,\" said James Blair, the Trump campaign's political director. \"There's also been days where those challenges seem less apparent. That night was not one of them.\"",
      "Referring to Biden's debate performance and what followed, O'Malley Dillon said, \"There has probably not been a more difficult period for a campaign team to navigate.\"",
      "Blair quickly interjected, noting that two assassination attempts and navigating the indictments were also challenging to navigate, and O'Malley Dillon later acknowledged the difficulty of the Trump team's summer and mentioned she reached out to Susie Wiles, Trump campaign manager, in the aftermath.",
      "When asked about the large number of Democrats calling for Biden to drop out of the race following his disastrous debate performance, Fulks referred to it as a \"slow bleed.\"",
      "Fulks later agreed with a point LaCivita made earlier in the day: Visuals matter when running for office, and the Biden campaign wanted to put Biden out in public, doing a series of events to counter his debate performance.",
      "\"I think Chris is right,\" Fulks said. \"Something visual happened in front of people's eyes. The only way to combat that is to give them something visual. And the only visual play you have at that point is putting Joe Biden in front of as many people as possible, which is what we tried to do. And so, when he caught COVID, it's almost like a dagger.\"",
      "The Trump campaign said it was preparing for what ended up becoming inevitable, adding that it began tracking and opposition research and polling alternative running mates as early as May on Harris but also ranged in other possible candidates, such as Michelle Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
      "Clearly a pivotal political moment as much as it was a harrowing personal moment for both campaigns, the first assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, \"severely limited where we could campaign because, after the first attempt, they basically told us, lock down, no more outdoor events,\" said Tony Fabrizio, chief pollster for the Trump campaign. \"And if we want to do an outdoor event, it needed, like, double the lead time.\"",
      "The Harris campaign, for its part, pulled its negative advertising in the days after the assassination attempt.",
      "\"We also were mindful about the way that we were campaigning. \"There's no place for political violence in democracy. And we wanted to make sure that our campaign was reflecting that in this moment,\" added Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Harris campaign manager.",
      "The Harris campaign, pressed multiple times on whether it was made aware of Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 race prior to him making the announcement public or if there were any conversations beforehand about the possibility of Biden dropping out, asserted it found out shortly before he made his announcement and that there were no conversations beforehand.",
      "Asked if there was any chance of another Democrat becoming the nominee besides Harris, Fulks said there's always a possibility but noted that Biden wanted to throw his support behind Harris. He added that a Democratic primary this late in the cycle would have been messy.",
      "\"From my perspective, Vice President Harris was the only commonsense choice to be made. But I think that President Biden made that -- she's his vice president and she was loyal to him, and he decided to support her,\" Fulks said.",

    "summary": "Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 chief of staff said Harris ran a \u201cpretty flawless campaign\u201d during a summit of campaign managers, reporters, and Harvard University staff.",
    "story": [
      "Senior staffers from several campaigns offered their reflections of 2024.",
      "Sheila Nix, Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 chief of staff, said Thursday evening that Harris ran a \u201cpretty flawless campaign\u201d during a summit of campaign managers, reporters and Harvard University staff.",
      "\u201cI think the vice president was the best position of all the possible people on our side. She had been sitting vice president for 3 1/2 years and was also part of the campaign and was ready to jump in,\u201d Nix said during a dinner reception for the Campaign Manager Conference at the Charles Hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cWe obviously had a lot of things to do right away,\u201d Nix continued. \u201cWe had to get the delegates so that she could be the nominee. We had to flip the convention to her instead of President Biden. We had to merge teams and we had a 107-day campaign in front of us and we had to move quickly.",
      "\u201cI would posit she ran a pretty flawless campaign, and she did all the steps that [were] required to be successful,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think -- obviously, we did not win, but I do think we hit all the marks.\u201d",
      "Senior staffers from several other campaigns, such as those of Asa Hutchinson, Dean Phillips, Jill Stein, Nikki Haley, Chris Christie and President-elect Donald Trump, also offered brief reflections during the dinner. The collective broadly addressed two main themes: reasoning to jump into the race and what may have been a strategic misstep.",
      "Several of the campaigns mused on whether they made the right decision on holding back from going on offense against Trump during the primaries -- leaving Christie's campaign and, to a lesser extent, Hutchinson\u2019s on an island of their own.",
      "\u201cAnybody here who ever wants to challenge the race at any level for any office, you don't ever beat an incumbent without attacking the incumbent,\u201d said Mike DuHaime, senior adviser to Christie. \u201cYou have to say the incumbent has not been doing a good job or I would be better than the incumbent. You can't say that the incumbent is really, really, really, really, really great, but I'm also really, really, really, really great.\u201d",
      "The Christie campaign became frustrated when it realized the other primary candidates weren\u2019t following Christie\u2019s lead, DuHaime added.",
      "\u201cIt becomes frustrating, obviously. And you start to talk privately about what were, what are other people's actual motivations,\u201d DuHaime said.",
      "While Christie took on Trump directly, aggressively and consistently, the same could not be said for Hutchinson.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it got to the point where in order for him just to continue to fight, to have his voice and his name and his face seen, he had to go on the offensive,\u201d said Rob Burgess, campaign manager for Hutchinson. \u201cClearly, he didn't do it as aggressively as Gov. Christie, but he did it in his own Arkansas way.\u201d",
      "Even though Haley became the last candidate standing against Trump during the primary, the former South Carolina governor did not start going after Trump as aggressively as other competitors until she became the sole alternative.",
      "Along with Haley, other candidates such as South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, North Dakota Sen. Doug Burgum and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also avoided heavily attacking Trump out of fear that it would turn off those who still liked the former president and supported his agenda but had doubts he could win.",
      "\u201cI think, like a lot of people in here, we determined that 40% of the electorate was always going to be for President Trump, 40% were Trump curious and then 20% of the possibly primary were not going to be for President Trump,\u201d said Mike Zolnierowicz, campaign manager for Burgum.",
      "Nix, Harris\u2019 campaign manager, also attributed Trump\u2019s decision not to participate in any debate following the ABC News presidential debate on Sept. 10 as detrimental to the Harris campaign\u2019s strategy of presenting the choice between Trump and Harris clearly to voters several times.",
      "\u201cI think that was hard for us to then get the attention that we would have liked to,\u201d Nix said.",
      "During the dinner, one common theme discussed among several of the campaign managers was the decision to have either a one-state strategy or a multistate strategy.",
      "Betsy Ankney, Haley\u2019s campaign manager, stressed that a Republican candidate couldn\u2019t be successful if he or she only zeroed in on one state.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that we saw earlier was that, you know, Iowa [and] New Hampshire were eight days apart,\u201d Ankney said. \u201cEvery other candidate other than Donald Trump and Nikki Haley had a one-state strategy. Chris Christie was playing in New Hampshire. DeSantis, Iowa. There was no way that you could be successful in this campaign without having a strong showing in the world stage and being able to go to distance.\u201d",
      "Ankeny added that campaigns mismanaging their influxes of cash -- their \u201cembarrassment of riches\u201d -- was another major misstep of the election.",
      "\u201cI think that a potential theme of this entire election cycle is an embarrassment of riches,\u201d she said. \u201cYou saw that with the DeSantis campaign in the primary. You saw that with the Harris campaign in general. A lot of times, when candidates have more money than they know what to do with, they make bad decisions, and we were mean and lean and scrappy.\u201d",
      "Campaign managers for Scott, Christie and Hutchinson discussed focusing and investing in one of the early primary states rather than all of them due to limited resources, lack of money and what many saw campaigns as their best chance to be successful.",
      "Although the campaign manager for DeSantis was not in attendance, his presidential campaign also focused heavily on one state: Iowa.",
      "Hutchinson\u2019s campaign manager, Burgess, was blunt during Thursday night\u2019s conversation that he and the former Arkansas governor disagreed on whether to focus on one state or multiple states, leading Burgess to leave the campaign.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to run a five-state campaign, and I didn't know how I was going to pay for it,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cI wasn't comfortable with him taking a mortgage out of his house, and I didn't want to be responsible for the campaign having debt.\u201d"

      "\"He was a great student - Princeton/Harvard educated - with a Military state of mind. He will be a fantastic, high energy, Secretary of Defense Defense, one who leads with charisma and skill. Pete is a WINNER, and there is nothing that can be done to change that,\" Trump added.",
      "The post comes after Trump's public silence as Hegseth met with GOP senators every day this week in the face of new allegations of sexual impropriety, financial mismanagement, public drunkenness and other personal misconduct.",

      "His confirmation, though, remains far from certain. Republicans will have a narrow three-seat majority in the Senate next year.",
      "Trump's team, ABC News reported, was focused on figuring out where the nine female Republican senators stand on Hegseth. So far, one key female Republican on the Armed Services Committee -- Joni Ernst -- has notably not yet backed Hegseth. Two female senators -- Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Katie Britt of Alabama -- have endorsed Hegseth.",

      "Hegseth's attorney Tim Parlatore said Thursday on CNN that Hegseth's name had been submitted to the FBI and that the FBI gave them the needed forms on Wednesday.",
      "\"I am expecting that the background check is going to take a lot of the false stories that have been circulated in the media and it's going to put them completely to bed. I think that the surprise you're going to find is how false all the reporting has been,\" Parlatore said.",

Kennedy Jr. \u2013 who recently raised eyebrows by appearing on his wife's social media account apparently showering naked in the background while she promoted her beauty line \u2013 also has agreed to disclose his finances and undergo a federal ethics review if confirmed as health secretary, said spokesperson Katie Miller.",
      "\"Both Mr. Kennedy and Dr. Oz plan to divest where appropriate and fully cooperate with the Office of Government of Ethics,\" Miller told ABC News.",

      "\"It is one of the most basic commitments to not commit a criminal conflict of interest violation\" when taking a government job, Marsco said.",

However, government officials are required to recuse themselves from making decisions that could impact their spouse's employment and would still have to divest financial holdings that conflict with their work.",

      "Two months after its launch, the company failed to make much traction in the cryptocurrency space after it faced criticism about its ambiguous business plan beyond its association with Trump. According to James Butterfill, the head of research at asset management company CoinShares, the company's early marketing materials offered little more than \"buzzwords.\"",
      "The weak launch also suggested its founders and the Trumps would make little to no money from the venture. Because World Liberty Financial had made less than $30 million in revenue prior to Sun's investment, all of the money raised by the company would be held in a reserve to cover operating expenses while the Trumps would make nothing, according to terms in the company's so-called \"gold paper.\"",
      "Enter Justin Sun, the eclectic cryptocurrency billionaire who -- prior to spending millions on a banana duct-taped to a wall -- attracted headlines for spending more than half a million dollars on an NTF of a pet rock, and $4.5 million for a lunch with Warren Buffet.",
      "His $30 million investment through Tron -- the popular cryptocurrency he founded in 2017 -- made him the largest investor in the project and fueled resurgence of interest in the once-struggling platform.",
      "\"The U.S. is becoming the blockchain hub, and Bitcoin owes it to @realDonaldTrump!\" Sun wrote on X announcing his investment.",
      "Last year the SEC sued Sun and his companies with securities fraud for allegedly manipulating the value of a cryptocurrency and paying celebrities including Lindsey Lohan, Ne-Yo, and Jake Paul to promote the assets without disclosing they had been paid. Sun and his companies have denied wrongdoing, and the celebrities have settled the case without admitting or denying the allegations.",
      "Tron and other cryptocurrencies have also faced criticism for allegedly enabling criminals to make financial transactions undetected, with a report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime calling Tron \"a preferred choice for crypto money launderers in East and Southeast.\" Tron's leadership called the report's allegation \"inaccurate\" and said it \"supports the UN's stance against malicious actors in the blockchain space.\"",
      "After his $30 million investment, World Liberty Financial named Sun an adviser, saying that his \"insights and experience will be instrumental\" to the company's growth.",
      "Weissman told ABC News he was concerned about the arrangement.",
      "\"It's exactly the sort of figure that you'd want to run away from if you were starting a business, and instead they're embracing it,\" Weissman said of World Liberty Financial and Sun.",
      "The investment could prove to be lucrative for Sun, given Trump's association with the project and the number of cryptocurrencies that have rallied following the election. On Thursday, shares of the leading cryptocurrency bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time.",
      "\"With a lot of crypto, having good PR or a good kind of voice helps a lot to get something noticed, and there's no better time for World Liberty Financial,\" Butterfill said. \"The lines between the private endeavor that this is and the public connections that Trump has are quite blurred, and the kind of people running World Liberty Financial will probably play on that a little bit.\"",
      "Trump's name and likeness are seen throughout World Liberty Financial's website and marketing materials, and Trump himself is listed as the company's \"chief crypto advocate,\" though the firm discloses that neither Trump nor his family members are officers of the company. According to the company, World Liberty Financial is \"inspired\" by Trump and hopes to introduce the platform \"to a broader audience that may have previously been unfamiliar or hesitant to engage with decentralized assets and cryptocurrency.\"",
      "\"They're trying to take advantage of President-elect Trump's popularity and the fact that he just won an election, and see if they can get this business up and running and off the ground,\" said Scott Amey, general counsel at the watchdog Project on Government Oversight.",
      "Though Sun and Trump have never met, several ethics experts ABC News spoke with also raised concerns that the investment -- and Trump's possible profit from it -- could influence Trump's policy toward cryptocurrencies, including whether the Securities and Exchange Commission continues to pursue the aggressive litigation brought under the Biden administration.",
      "\"If you face charges from the SEC, it's a pretty good investment to put money in the future president's hands in order to influence who might end up making those decisions at the SEC,\" said Libowitz.",
      "Steve Witkoff, Trump's longtime friend who, along with his sons, is a co-founder of World Liberty Financial, told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" in September that Trump's foray into crypto would not pose a conflict because he would likely place his assets into a trust -- as Trump did during his first administration when he placed his assets into a revocable trust controlled by his sons and a business associate.",
      "But that arrangement would not fully remedy the concerns about conflicts stemming from Trump's crypto venture, according to multiple experts. Trump is still able to broadly understand the state of his assets, he can still profit from them, and he has the authority to regain control of the assets -- all of which limit the trust's effectiveness in preventing conflicts, several experts said.",
      "\"Absent divesting and stepping away from these investments totally, he still stands to profit from them,\" said Amey.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. Senate subcommittee has held a hearing to question the growing use of airline fees to charge passengers for things like early boarding and better seats",
      "Members of a U.S. Senate subcommittee took aim at airline executives Wednesday for using an expanding menu of fees to charge customers for early boarding, better seats and other comforts that used to be part of the ticket price.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he thinks the federal government should review and perhaps fine the airlines for their use of what he called junk fees.",
      "Blumenthal, the chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said seat fees were pure profit for the airlines because they don't have to create new seats or incur other expenses by allowing customers to pick where to sit.",
      "Some senators expressed frustration during Wednesday's hearing when airline executives could not explain how they set the amount of various fees. They said the vagaries of airline pricing make it hard for consumers to budget for trips.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all captives on your airplanes at a certain point. You just say, \u2018You want to pick seat? We\u2019re just going to charge you some random amount more,\u2019\u201d Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said. \u201cIt would be good if you guys could be transparent about what you do and why.\u201d",
      "The fees don't seem to be discouraging anybody. Americans are flying more than ever.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration reported screening nearly 3.1 million travelers at airports around the country on Sunday, a new single-day record. The 15 busiest days in TSA history have all occurred this year, with traffic at airport checkpoints up 5% over 2023.",
      "Airline executives bristle at the term \u201cjunk fees,\u201d and argue they are merely giving consumers what they want: choices.",
      "\u201cOur customers who prioritize affordability have the option to choose a lower-fare product and, in doing so, opt out of paying for additional services that they do not want,\u201d Andrew Nocella, the chief commercial officer of United Airlines, said in testimony prepared for the panel's hearing. \u201cBut we also have customers who seek more services, and they retain the ability to choose the services they value, for an incremental fee, like a seat with extra legroom or checked bags.\u201d",
      "Airlines have been adding fees on desirable seats to take advantage of increasing demand.",
      "The airline executives took offense at the charge that they are gouging travelers.",
      "\u201cIt has never been more affordable to fly,\" said Steve Johnson, chief strategy officer for American Airlines.",
      "Transportation Department figures indicate that airfares have fallen by about one-third since 2000 when taking inflation into account. However, those figures do not include fees.",
      "Senators said fees should be described clearly during the ticket-buying process. The executives said their airlines do that.",
      "Some subcommittee members also criticized airlines for the way they enforce fees.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sparred with executives of Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, which paid employees $26 million in bonuses for spotting customers whose carry-on bags were too big to fit under a seat. The passengers were forced to pay a fee \u2014 up to $77 on Spirit and $99 on Frontier \u2014 to use an overhead bin.",
      "\u201cIf people want to know why it\u2019s such a terrible experience to fly, this is news for them today,\u201d Hawley told the airlines executives Wednesday. \u201cYour airlines are paying millions of dollars to your employees to harass people who have already paid!\u201d",
      "Frontier Chief Commercial Officer Robert Schroeter and his counterpart at Spirit, Matthew Klein, said ensuring that people follow the rules was a matter of fairness to all passengers.",
      "When Hawley asked why bag fees may vary from one customer to another, Schroeter said Frontier must cover its costs.",
      "\u201cOverall, our job is to generate the most revenue we can so we can keep profitable as an airline,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. airlines raised more than $7 billion from fees on checked bags last year, with American Airlines and United Airlines leading the pack. They scooped up another $1 billion in ticket-change and cancellation fees, although that was about one-third of what they raised before the coronavirus pandemic, when the biggest airlines dropped change fees.",
      "Exact figures on other types of fees are hard to determine, but the Senate panel reported last week that United, American, Delta Air Lines, Frontier and Spirit collected a combined total of more than $12 billion in seat fees between 2018 and 2023. That included charges for things such as more legroom or an aisle seat near the front of the plane.",
      "Airline fees have been a frequent target of criticism by the Biden administration, all the way up to President Joe Biden.",
      "A Transportation Department rule that took effect in October requires airlines to make automatic cash refunds for tickets and fees when flights are canceled.",
      "The airline industry is suing to block another regulation requiring more prominent disclosure of baggage and cancellation fees. An appeals court has blocked that rule, and its fate is uncertain under President-elect Donald Trump. Blumenthal asked the five executives to drop the lawsuit. None agreed to do so.",
      "The airline industry and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have continued to fight over fees and other regulations, even after the November election."

      "As the search for UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson\u2019s killer goes on, investigators are reckoning with a tantalizing dichotomy: They have troves of evidence, but the shooter remains an enigma.",

      "\u201cThe net is getting tighter,\u201d New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Saturday.",
      "Hours after he spoke, police divers were seen searching a pond in Central Park, where the killer fled after the shooting. Officers have been scouring the park for days for any possible clues.",
      "Retracing the gunman\u2019s steps using surveillance video, police say, it appears he left the city by bus soon after the shooting Wednesday morning outside the New York Hilton Midtown. He was seen on video at an uptown bus station about 45 minutes later, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said.",
      "With the high-profile search expanding across state lines, the FBI announced late Friday that it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction, adding to a reward of up to $10,000 that the NYPD offered. Police say they believe the suspect acted alone.",
      "Police provided no new updates on the hunt Saturday, but investigators are urging patience, even with shooter on the loose. Hundreds of detectives are combing through video recordings and social media, vetting tips from the public and interviewing people who might have information, including Thompson\u2019s family and coworkers and the shooter\u2019s randomly assigned roommates at the Manhattan hostel where he stayed.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Blue Bloods.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to solve this in 60 minutes,\" Kenny told reporters Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across.\u201d",
      "The shooter paid cash at the hostel, presented what police believe was a fake ID and is believed to have paid cash for taxi rides and other transactions. He didn't speak to others at the hostel and almost always kept his face covered with a mask, only lowering it while eating.",
      "But investigators caught a break when they came across security camera images of an unguarded moment in which he briefly showed his face soon after arriving in New York on Nov. 24.",
      "Police distributed the images to news outlets and on social media but so far haven't been able to ID him using facial recognition \u2014 possibly because of the angle of the images or limitations on the use of the technology, Kenny said.",
      "On Friday evening, investigators found a backpack in Central Park that had been worn by the gunman, police said. They didn\u2019t immediately reveal what, if anything, it contained but said it would be tested and analyzed.",
      "Another potential clue, a fingerprint on an item he purchased at a Starbucks minutes before the shooting, has so far proven useless for identifying him, Kenny said.",
      "Aided by surveillance cameras on nearly every building and block, police have been able to retrace the shooter\u2019s movements.",
      "They know he ambushed Thompson at 6:44 a.m. as the executive arrived at the Hilton for his company\u2019s annual investor conference, using a 9 mm pistol that resembled the guns farmers use to put down animals without causing a loud noise. They know ammunition found near Thompson\u2019s body bore the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d mimicking a phrase used by insurance industry critics.",
      "Kenny said the fact that the shooter knew UnitedHealthcare group was holding a conference at the hotel and what route Thompson might take to get there suggested that he could possibly be a disgruntled employee or client.",
      "Investigators know from surveillance video that the shooter fled into Central Park on a bicycle and ditched it around 7 a.m. near 85th Street.",
      "He then walked a couple blocks and got into a taxi, arriving at 7:30 a.m. at the George Washington Bridge Bus Station, which is near the northern tip of Manhattan and offers commuter service to New Jersey and Greyhound routes to Philadelphia, Boston and Washington.",
      "Investigators don't know what happened next. They are searching through more surveillance video but have yet to locate video of the shooter getting on a bus or exiting the station.",
      "\u201cWe have reason to believe that the person in question has left New York City,\u201d Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told CNN on Friday.",
      "Police have determined from video that the gunman initially arrived at the main bus terminal Manhattan on a Greyhound bus that originated in Atlanta, though it's not clear whether he embarked there or at one of about a half-dozen stops along the route.",
      "Immediately after that, he took a cab to the vicinity of the Hilton and was there for about a half hour, Kenny said.",
      "At around 11 p.m., he went by taxi to the HI New York City Hostel. It was there, while speaking with an employee in the lobby, that he briefly pulled down the mask and smiled, giving investigators the brief glimpse they are now relying on to identify and capture a killer.",

It\u2019s similar to the quote on our currency, E pluribus unum \u2014 \u2018Out of many, one.\u2019 We have SSN 800, but many participated in the reality of it being here today.\u201d",
      "Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro called the ship \u201cthe very best of our submarine force capabilities.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe will always be propelled by the proud legacy of her namesake, represented here today by three of her courageous sponsors, who overcame tremendous adversity as members of the Little Rock Nine,\u201d Del Toro said.",
      "A number of speakers also noted the 83rd anniversary of Japan's attack in Pearl Harbor, the event that launched the United States into World War II.",
      "The submarine is the fifth naval ship named for Arkansas, including a battleship. The most recent was a guided missile cruiser that was decommissioned in 1988.",
      "The Arkansas is the 27th in a series of Virginia-class submarines and the 13th built at Newport News, a massive shipyard owned by Huntington Ingalls Industries. The other submarines are built at General Dynamics Corp.'s Electric Boat shipyard in Connecticut.",
      "The Arkansas is expected to launch in 2025."

      "The former president urged audience members in a packed theater to remain engaged and find ways to communicate with those they disagree with despite a divisive political time. The two spoke about a month after former President Donald Trump's win over Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just passing through, and we all need to just calm down and do something that builds people up instead of tears them down,\u201d Bill Clinton said.",

      "The Clintons spoke during a panel discussion with journalist Laura Ling, who the former president helped free in 2009 when she was detained in North Korea with another journalist. The event was held as part of a weekend of activities marking the 20th anniversary of the Clinton Presidential Library's opening in Little Rock. The library is preparing to undergo an update of its exhibits and an expansion that will include Hillary Clinton's personal archives.",
      "Hillary Clinton said part of the goal is to modernize the facility and expand it to make it a more open, inviting place for people for convene and make connections.",
      "When asked about advice he would give for people disappointed by the election results, Bill Clinton said people need to continue working toward bringing people together and improving others' lives.",

      "Some residents of seven Louisiana nursing homes who were sent to ride out 2021's Hurricane Ida in a warehouse are being offered shares of a nearly $9 million settlement",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Some of the elderly residents of seven Louisiana nursing homes who were sent in 2021 to ride out Hurricane Ida in a crowded, ill-equipped warehouse are being offered shares of a nearly $9 million settlement after they sued.",
      "Retired state judge William \u201cRusty\u201d Knight told The Times-Picayune of New Orleans that all the 427 former residents who filed legal claims are being sent letters outlining the proposed settlement. Knight said amounts differ based on patients' individual circumstances.",
      "People who don't contest the amount offered can expect to receive money within a few weeks. A hearing for those who want to fight the settlement will be held in January.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a longer road getting here than we wanted it to be,\u201d Knight said. \u201cNobody\u2019s getting what they should. quite frankly, because there\u2019s not enough money.\u201d",
      "Bob Dean Jr., 70, owned seven nursing homes in New Orleans and southeast Louisiana. As Ida approached, Dean moved hundreds of residents into a building in the town of Independence, roughly 70 miles (110 kilometers) northwest of New Orleans.",
      "Authorities said conditions at the warehouse deteriorated rapidly after the powerful storm hit on Aug. 29, 2021. They found ill and elderly bedridden people on mattresses on the wet floor, some crying for help, some lying in their own waste. Civil suits against Dean\u2019s corporation said the ceiling leaked and toilets overflowed at the sweltering warehouse, and there was too little food and water.",
      "Within days after the storm hit, the state reported the deaths of seven of the evacuees, five of them classified as storm-related.",
      "By the time Dean was arrested on state charges in June 2022, he had lost state licenses and federal funding for his nursing homes. Dean pleaded no contest to 15 criminal counts in July and was sentenced to three years of probation, paying $258,000 in restitution and more than $1 million as a penalty.",
      "Last month, Dean agreed to pay $8.2 million to the federal government to settle allegations that he misused assets and income from four nursing homes whose loans were insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Prosecutors say he funneled nursing home money to his personal bank accounts, using the money to buy antiques, guns and cars.",
      "But Dean also faced civil lawsuits or legal claims from 427 of the 843 patients who were taken to Independence, or their surviving relatives. Many of the plaintiffs and their lawyers have suggested Dean was hiding other assets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no true justice after what my clients endured,\u201d attorney Matthew Hemmer, who represents hundreds of nursing home victims, told WVUE-TV.",
      "Knight said he knows of 165 of Dean's former residents who have died since the evacuation, and he said he expects to learn more people have died as responses to the settlement offer are returned."

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has announced that the U.S. will provide nearly $1 billion more in longer-term weapons support to Ukraine",
      "SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- The United States will provide nearly $1 billion more in longer-term weapons support to Ukraine, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Saturday as the Biden administration rushes to spend all the congressionally approved money it has left to bolster Kyiv before President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month.",
      "The latest package will include more drones and munitions for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, that the U.S. has provided. While these weapons are critically needed now, they will be funded through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which pays for longer-term systems to be put on contract.",
      "The weapon systems purchased are often intended to support Ukraine's future military capabilities, not make an immediate difference on the battlefield.",
      "The $988 million package is on top of an additional $725 million in U.S. military assistance, including counter-drone systems and HIMARS munitions, announced Monday that would be drawn from the Pentagon\u2019s stockpiles to more quickly get to the front lines. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with more than $62 billion in military aid since Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022.",
      "\u201cThe baton will soon be passed,\u201d Austin said. \u201cOthers will decide the course ahead. And I hope that they will build on the strength that we have forged over the past four years.\u201d",
      "Ukraine is facing an intensified onslaught by Russia, which is now using thousands of North Korean troops to augment its fight to take back the Kursk region. Moscow also has launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile and regularly strikes Kyiv's civilian infrastructure.",
      "With questions about whether Trump will maintain military support to Ukraine, the Biden administration has been trying to spend every dollar remaining from a massive foreign aid bill passed earlier this year to put Ukraine in the strongest position possible.",
      "\u201cThis administration has made its choice. So has a bipartisan coalition in Congress. The next administration must make its own choice,\u201d Austin said in a speech at an annual gathering of national security officials, defense firms and lawmakers at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.",
      "Trump had a hastily arranged meeting Saturday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and France's Emmanuel Macron while in Paris for the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral. Macron and other European leaders are trying to persuade Trump to maintain support for Ukraine.",
      "Trump, a longtime admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has criticized U.S. aid for Ukraine and called for bringing a quick end to the war, raising concerns in Ukraine about what terms may be laid out for any future negotiations.",
      "Austin said he was \u201cconfident that President Reagan would have stood on the side of Ukraine, American security and human freedom.\u201d",
      "It was one of Austin\u2019s last major speeches as President Joe Biden\u2019s defense secretary and a cap to his more than 41 years serving as a soldier and general.",
      "Under Austin\u2019s watch, the Pentagon in 2022 launched a regular meeting that now counts more than 50 countries to figure out how to get the tens of millions of rounds of ammunition and billions of dollars in advanced weaponry to Ukraine. Without that flow of support, it's possible the country would have fallen to Russia after it invaded.",
      "\u201cTogether, we have helped Ukraine survive an all-out assault by the largest military in Europe,\u201d Austin said.",
      "Austin and Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longtime Republican leader, were honored at the conference for their lifetime of service, and they used the opportunity to press for the U.S. to continue to build and support its alliances, a sharp contrast to Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First \u201c policy.",
      "Austin called the Ukraine Defense Contact Group \u201cthe most consequential global coalition since the time of President George H.W. Bush and Iraq\u2019s 1990 invasion of Kuwait,\u201d showing that \"America and our friends have become the arsenal of Ukrainian democracy.\u201d",
      "Before Saturday's announcement, there was roughly $8 billion left to use to pull existing weapons out of U.S. stockpiles and to put additional weapons on contract to help Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWe're not going to stop Putin by telling Ukraine we aren't going to give you anything more,\u201d Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said at a panel at the Reagan National Defense Forum."

      "A Florida prosecutor says he will seek to vacate as many as 2,600 convictions of people who bought crack cocaine manufactured by the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office between 1988 and 1990",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A Florida prosecutor says he will seek to vacate as many as 2,600 convictions of people who bought crack cocaine manufactured by the Broward County Sheriff's Office for sting operations between 1988 and 1990.",
      "The Florida Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that people couldn't be charged in cases where the sheriff's office made the crack cocaine and undercover deputies then sold it to buyers who were arrested and charged.",
      "Broward County State Attorney Harold F. Pryor said Friday that while his office was reviewing old records, prosecutors realized that many people may still have criminal charges or convictions on their records because of the sting operation.",
      "\u201cIt is never too late to do the right thing,\u201d Pryor said in a statement.",
      "It\u2019s just one example of how the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s led to harsh police practices and heavy criminal penalties.",
      "Some people may have been convicted of serious felonies because they bought drugs within 1,000 feet (300 meters) of a school. Conviction under that law required at the time that defendants be sentenced to at least three years in prison.",
      "\u201cThey were arresting people not for selling, but for purchasing,\u201d Ed Hoeg, a defense lawyer, told the Sun Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale. At the time, Hoeg was a public defender who represented Leon Williams, whose appeal led to the state Supreme Court outlawing the practice.",
      "\u201cThey had detention deputies posing as dealers,\u201d Hoeg said. \u201cThey would sell it, and these poor people who were addicts were buying it. And they were selling it within 1,000 feet of schools, so the penalties would be greater.\u201d",
      "The sheriff's office said at the time that it began making crack because it didn't have enough of the seized drug to use in its sting operations and because it didn't have to later test the cocaine content of crack made by a sheriff's office chemist.",
      "\u201cWe find that the law enforcement\u2019s conduct here was so outrageous as to violate Florida\u2019s due process clause,\u201d the state Supreme Court wrote in the decision.",
      "Pryor said he notified Broward County Sheriff Gregory Tony that Pryor would ask judges to vacate the convictions. Pryor said Tony supports the plan. Some defendants may also be able to seal or expunge the records, the prosecutor said.",
      "The review will take \u201ca considerable amount of time,\u201d Pryor said. He said his office will contact people who may be affected."

      "For all of Trump's bold talk, though, it is unclear how many of his efforts will bear fruit.",
      "The pre-inauguration threats and deal-making are highly unusual, like so much of what Trump does, said Julian Zelizer, a political historian at Princeton University.",
      "\u201cTransitions are always a little complicated in this way. Even though we talk about one president at a time,\" he said, \u201cthe reality is one president plus. And that plus can act assertively sometimes.\"",
      "Zelizer said that is particularly true of Trump, who was president previously and already has relationships with many foreign leaders such as Macron, who invited both Trump and Biden to Paris this weekend as part of the Notre Dame celebration.",
      "\u201cRight now he\u2019s sort of governing even though he\u2019s not the president yet. He\u2019s having these public meetings with foreign leaders, which aren't simply introductions. He's staking out policy and negotiating things from drug trafficking to tariffs,\" Zelizer said.",
      "Trump had already met with several foreign leaders before this weekend's trip. He hosted Argentinian President Javier Milei in Florida at his Mar-a-Lago club in November. After the tariff threat, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago for a three-hour dinner meeting. Canadian officials later said the country is ready to make new investments in border security, with plans for more helicopters, drones and law enforcement officers.",

      "That comes after Trump's incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, traveled to Qatar and Israel for high-level talks about a cease-fire and hostage deal in Gaza, according to a U.S. official familiar with the efforts, meeting with the prime ministers of both countries.

      "Trump aides were said to be especially cognizant of potential conflicts given their experience in 2016, when interactions between Trump allies and Russian officials came under scrutiny. That included a phone call in which Trump's incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn, discussed new sanctions with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, suggesting things would improve after Trump became president. Flynn was later charged with lying to the FBI about the conversation.",

      "She added: \u201cWorld leaders recognize that President Trump is returning to power and will lead with strength to put the best interests of the United States of America first again. That is why many foreign leaders and officials have reached out to correspond with President Trump and his incoming team.\u201d",
      "Such efforts can nonetheless cause complications.",
      "If, say, Biden is having productive conversations on a thorny foreign policy issue and Trump weighs in, that could make it harder for Biden \u201cbecause people are hearing two different voices\u201d that may be in conflict, Zelizer said.",
      "Leaders like Russia's Vladimir Putin and Netanyahu may also anticipate a more favorable incoming administration and wait Biden out, hoping for a better deal.",
      "Although there is no requirement that an incoming administration coordinate calls and meetings with foreign officials with the State Department or National Security Council, that has long been considered standard practice.",
      "That is, in part, because transition teams, particularly in their early days and weeks, do not always have the latest information about the state of relations with foreign nations and may not have the resources, including interpretation and logistical ability, to handle such meetings efficiently.",
      "It is unclear the level of State Department involvement, but the Biden and Trump teams say they have been talking, particularly on the Middle East, with the incoming and outgoing administrations having agreed to work together on efforts to free hostages who remain held in Gaza, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive talks and spoke on condition of anonymity.",

      "Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon has written to the energy secretary calling for \"decisive action\", while the Department for Energy Security has said it is consulting with lenders.",
      "Estimates suggest as many as 250,000 homes in the UK have this type of insulation, with some of it installed under the previous government's official scheme.",
      "The Green Homes Grant scheme, which ran in England, saw installations completely subsidised for those on certain benefits.",
      "But some of the UK's biggest mortgage firms are reluctant to deal with homes with spray foam insulation due to concerns over poor fittings leaving moisture trapped and roof timbers at risk of decay.",
      "Industry experts have told the BBC spray foam is an effective insulator if fitted properly, and urgent action is needed to stop panicked homeowners needlessly turning to \"cowboy\" removal companies.",
      "Lenders reject homes with spray foam insulation",
      "'It cost me \u00a34,500 to repair foam insulation damage'",

      "He and his wife hoped to move to a bigger house in Nottingham, closer to potential secondary schools for their young daughter.",
      "When they put their house on the market this summer, they quickly received an offer at asking price. But Robbie said he was \"shocked\" when the buyers' lenders rejected the property and they pulled out of the purchase.",
      "The work was carried out by a Trustmark-approved installer and Robbie was given documentation including a British Board of Agr\u00e9ment (BBA) product certificate.",

      "Spray foam insulation has been used to stop heat escaping from roofs, lofts and attics for decades and comes in two forms.",
      "Closed cell spray foam is rigid once set. It is a better thermal insulator and was previously sold to stabilise failing roofs. But if it has been used inappropriately or installed poorly, it might put stress on timbers, restrict air circulation and put them at risk of decaying.",
      "Open cell spray foam remains soft once set and is only used for insulation. It is more breathable but is often installed where a highly-resistant underlay like bitumen felt is already present, stopping vapour from escaping.",
      "Geoff Hunt, an independent chartered building surveyor, said open cell spray foam had gained popularity in recent years, bolstered by government initiatives.",
      "But he said mortgage lenders struggle to assess spray foam, leading to \"caution and refusals on higher-risk applications\", for example, where it has been applied directly onto roof tiles.",
      "Properly-installed open cell foam on a sound roof has not been conclusively linked to roof decay, he added, emphasising that it is important for homeowners with this type of insulation not to panic.",
      "'Conned'",
      "Philippa from Wiltshire also had open cell spray foam fitted in her loft in 2021, with the \u00a38,662 cost covered by the Green Homes Grant scheme.",
      "She recently accepted an offer from first-time buyers on her property, but said Nationwide would not lend to them without further paperwork on the insulation.",
      "She said this \"spooked\" her buyers and they pulled out before she had the chance to supply the additional documents.",
      "Nationwide told the BBC it was \"unable to make a final lending decision\" without documentary evidence that spray foam was installed correctly or a report on the structural integrity of the roof.",
      "Philippa said she cannot afford to remove the insulation and has reduced her asking price to cover the cost on any future buyer\u2019s side.",
      "\"I feel like I've been conned by the government,\" she said, adding that she did not believe spray foam insulation should be available for sale until there is a better understanding of the product.",
      "'Un-mortgageable'",
      "While the Green Homes Grant scheme closed in 2021, spray foam insulation is still available under the Great British Insulation Scheme as the government seeks to improve the energy efficiency of homes and drives towards its 2030 \"net zero\" target.",
      "Rico Wojtulewicz, head of policy at the National Federation of Builders, said he had been trying to raise awareness of potential issues with spray foam insulation for years.",
      "\"Government may view spray foam as an easy solution but an un-mortgageable, unhealthy or damaged home is a worse outcome than requiring greater retrofitting thought or more expensive heating,\" he said.",
      "He is calling for the government to work with installation companies.",
      "It comes as Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon has written to Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, calling for \"decisive action\" and \"support\" for homeowners facing financial repercussions.",
      "Mr Gordon said he was moved to act after he and many of his party's MPs had been contacted by constituents facing unexpected costs, the letter said.",
      "\"This government must do more to support them,\" it added.",

      "The boss of Vodafone has insisted the telecom company's merger with rival Three - which has finally been approved by the regulator - will not result in higher prices.",
      "The \u00a316.5bn tie-up will create the UK's biggest mobile network, with 27 million customers.",
      "It has been given the go-ahead conditional on the merged companies agreeing to invest billions in the country's 5G network and to cap certain mobile tariffs for three years.",
      "Vodafone's chief executive Margherita Della Valle told the Today programme, on BBC Radio Four, the deal would be \"self-funded\", which meant \"no extra costs from public funding and no extra cost for our customers\".",

      "He added it appeared to \"largely strike a good balance between nurturing competition and encouraging investment\".",
      "Industry analyst Paolo Pescatore told BBC News it was still a \"waiting game\" in terms of assessing the impact of the tie-up.",
      "\"The bottom line is it will take many years before the full merits of the deal are realised, and there\u2019s a lot of tough decisions to come,\" he said.",
      "Mr Pescatore also said \"it\u2019s now up to both parties to deliver on their promises\", but  \"that should mean wins for UK plc \u2013 bringing much needed investment in the network \u2013 and for consumers in the form of better services\".",

      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",

      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history... with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",

      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",

      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",

      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No-one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",

    "story": [
      "A vow to scrap the two-child benefit cap and changes to basic and intermediate tax thresholds are among the plans for the Scottish government for the next financial year.",
      "The announcements were made by Finance Secretary Shona Robison as she revealed her tax and spending plans for 2025/26.",
      "Other talking points included an extra \u00a32bn for the NHS and a \u00a3768m investment in affordable homes.",
      "Here are five key takeaways from this year's Scottish Budget.",
      "1. Two-child benefits cap",
      "The biggest announcement in the budget actually isn\u2019t part of the tax or spending plans for next year.",
      "It was Shona Robison\u2019s \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d moment of announcing that the Scottish government would move to scrap - or offset, or mitigate - the two-child benefits cap.",
      "That\u2019s a UK-wide policy, imposed by the Department of Work and Pensions on welfare payments such as universal credit and child tax credits - so it will take some time, and will need some help from the UK government.",
      "It\u2019s not yet clear what the mechanism will be, how it will work, or how much it will cost.",
      "The Scottish Fiscal Commission says it was only sent the proposal last week, and that it hasn\u2019t had time to cost it; they call it a \u201cfiscal risk\u201d.",
      "But be in no doubt that this is a big challenge to Labour.",
      "It comes days after an announcement on the winter fuel payment also designed to outflank Anas Sarwar\u2019s party and embarrass the UK administration.",
      "If all goes to plan then the SNP government will start sending out payments to families of the 15,000 children affected in April 2026. One month before the next Holyrood election.",
      "Labour says it's willing to listen to ideas, but points out that there is not a penny in the coming year\u2019s budget to support it.",
      "They will surely need to come up with a more substantial response before that election comes much closer.",
      "2. Taxes",
      "There were no big changes to the devolved income tax system in this budget.",
      "There was some tinkering with thresholds, which will have a political impact if not a big financial one.",
      "Robison is increasing the thresholds for the basic and intermediate rates - two of the lower rungs in Scotland\u2019s six-band ladder of taxes.",
      "Because Chancellor Rachel Reeves has frozen those thresholds in the rest of the UK, it means Scots earning less than \u00a330,300 will pay less tax than if they lived in England or Wales.",
      "The difference is less than \u00a330 a year, but it allows Robison to say that 51% of Scottish taxpayers pay less.",
      "One bill that will almost certainly be going up is council tax. But with last year\u2019s one-off freeze on local rates coming to an end, it will be down to your local representatives to decide.",
      "Rather than wielding a stick by imposing any sort of cap, Robison instead sought to guilt local authorities into holding down increases, saying that \u201cwith record funding there is no reason for big increases in council tax next year\u201d.",
      "She says there\u2019s an extra \u00a31bn for local government - but it remains to be seen how much of that councillors will be free to allocate, and how much will fall into ring-fenced areas.",
      "Every year the government says it has increased funding for councils, then councils hit back that it\u2019s not enough, and there\u2019s a row over exactly how much money is enough money.",
      "We will no doubt go around in circles on that until budgets at a local and national level are finalised next year.",
      "3. Spending priorities",
      "The budget totalled more than \u00a363bn, and previously ubiquitous talk of tough decisions and austerity was notably absent. There was a positive tone - like Robison suddenly had some cash to splash on the government\u2019s favourite policies.",
      "John Swinney has made the eradication of child poverty as his top priority, and as ever there is cash in the budget for the flagship Scottish Child Payment.",
      "The cash to mitigate the two-child cap doesn\u2019t feature in this budget - only some money to set up that system, whatever it turns out to look like.",
      "In total, spending on social security is up by \u00a3800m - highlighting a key feature of devolved government, in the SNP\u2019s appetite for big state interventions and welfare safety nets.",
      "You can include in that last week\u2019s announcement about winter fuel payments, which are being partially reinstated from next year.",
      "This week Mr Swinney has also (unsurprisingly) earmarked the NHS as a core priority, and as expected it has a record funding settlement - \u00a321bn, or a third of the total budget.",
      "That includes almost \u00a3200m to cut waiting times and cash for local hospital projects in Edinburgh, Fort William and Airdrie.",
      "There were also billions of pounds for net zero and climate policies - including money from the ScotWind fund, a pot of cash raised by auctioning off plots of the seabed for offshore wind, which Robison had previously feared she might need to use for day-to-day funding.",
      "And there is \u00a3768m for affordable housing, which chiefly goes to reverse a cut made under Humza Yousaf\u2019s administration last year, but does ultimately leave spending higher and will apparently create 8,000 new homes in the coming year.",
      "4. Growing the economy",
      "A big focus of governments across the UK has been economic growth. Rachel Reeves has put it at the core of everything she is doing as chancellor, as Robison said a thriving economy was \u201can essential requirement\u201d.",
      "The finance secretary had been challenged to match the chancellor\u2019s support for firms in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors - a 40% relief on business rates.",
      "Scotland has a slightly different system of \u201cnon-domestic rates\u201d, but ultimately Robison said there would be a similar 40% relief for the vast majority of hospitality premises.",
      "Retail and leisure were notably absent (although there is some support for music venues), and we will see how far this shakes out in terms of who does and doesn\u2019t qualify for funding.",
      "The Scottish Hospitality Group has said it is a \u201csignificantly more restricted\u201d offer than that down south, calling it a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d.",
      "A motif of Ms Robison\u2019s speech was name-checking her cabinet colleagues as she spoke to each of their portfolio areas.",
      "That felt particularly notable in the case of Kate Forbes - an influential figure as the woman John Swinney brought into government in part to mend fences with business.",
      "She has highlighted more money for town centre regeneration as well as a tripling of investment in the offshore wind supply chain, which it is said will leverage ten times that figure in private investment.",
      "This approach of public cash opening the door to huge flows of private funds is a favourite tactic of Ms Reeves - and indeed is the core purpose of GB Energy.",
      "That UK energy firm is set to have some company when it sets up in Aberdeen, with Ms Robison pledging to establish a hub or offshore wind in the North East.",
      "5. Politics",
      "The SNP does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and thus needs the help of other parties to pass a budget.",
      "John Swinney has talked about wanting to reach out to opponents and run a collaborative administration.",
      "But there is no chance of a deal with the Conservatives, who want a billion pounds of tax cuts, or Labour, who really just want an election.",
      "That leaves the Greens and the Lib Dems as the most likely dance partners.",
      "Robison quite deliberately nodded to the key asks of both parties. There was funding for ferries, mental health and dentistry for the Lib Dems. The Greens demanded \u00a34.7bn for green policies - and she pledged \u00a34.9bn.",
      "The Greens welcomed some of the measures, but said \u201csignificant further changes\u201d were needed. They are particularly suspicious of the sums on offer for councils.",
      "The Lib Dems welcomed even more of Robison\u2019s announcements, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton reeling off a whole series of measures where he said it was right the government had listened to him.",
      "The draft budget is really the starting point for talks, which won\u2019t come to a head until the first votes at Holyrood in February.",
      "But the fevered talk of snap elections which followed the collapse of the Bute House Agreement has faded. A deal with someone still feels the most likely outcome.",

    "story": [
      "Three rail operators will be renationalised by Labour next year, but the move is not expected to bring down fares for passengers travelling on these lines.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she recognised that \"affordability is really important to people\" but that people were \"willing to pay for a good service\".",
      "It comes as the government confirmed South Western Railway will be renationalised in May 2025, C2C in July 2025, and Greater Anglia in autumn 2025, after Labour passed a law allowing it to do so.",
      "But some have criticised the plans, arguing that public ownership will not make much difference unless it is paired with fresh investment in the railways.",
      "What does nationalise mean?",
      "The move is part of Labour's wider plans to renationalise rail services as operators' contracts either end or reach a break.",
      "Under the existing system, Britain's railway lines are run by train operating companies as franchises for a fixed length of time.",
      "Northern Ireland's rail system has remained nationalised since 1948.",

      "What will it mean for train ticket prices?",

    "story": [
      "Sweden has a global reputation for championing gender equality, so why are young women embracing a social media trend that celebrates quitting work?",
      "Vilma Larsson, 25, previously had jobs in a grocery store, a care home and a factory. But she quit work a year ago to become a stay-at-home-girlfriend, and says she\u2019s never been happier.",
      "\u201cMy life is softer. I am not struggling. I am not very stressed.\u201d",
      "Her boyfriend works remotely in finance, and while he spends his days on his laptop, she\u2019s at the gym, out for coffee, or cooking. The couple grew up in small towns in central Sweden, but now travel a lot, and are spending the winter in Cyprus.",
      "\u201cEvery month he gives me a salary from his money that he made. But if I need more, I'll ask him. Or if I need less, I don't - I just save the rest,\u201d explains Ms Larsson.",
      "She shares her lifestyle on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, where she\u2019s amassed 11,000 followers. Some of her posts have had almost 400,000 likes, although she says she\u2019s not making an income from her content.",
      "She uses the hashtags \u201chemmaflickv\u00e4n\u201d and \u201chemmafru\u201d (Swedish for stay-at-home girlfriend and housewife) and describes herself as a \u201csoft girl\u201d \u2013 an identity that embraces a softer, more feminine way of living rather than focussing on a career.",
      "The soft girl lifestyle has been a microtrend on social media in different parts of the world since the late 2010s. But in Sweden \u2013 with five decades of policies designed to promote dual income households behind it \u2013 the concept\u2019s recent popularity has sparked both surprise and division.",
      "Ungdomsbarometern \u2013  Sweden\u2019s largest annual survey of young people \u2013 first put the national spotlight on Swedes embracing the soft girl trend a year ago, after it became a popular choice when 15 to 24-year-olds were asked to predict trends for 2024.",
      "Another study released by Ungdomsbaromatern this August suggested it was even becoming an aspiration among younger schoolgirls, with 14% of seven to 14-year-olds identifying as soft girls.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about leaning away from this \u2018girl boss\u2019 ideal that we've seen for a lot of years, where there are very, very high demands for success in every aspect of life,\u201d explains Johanna G\u00f6ransson, a researcher for Ungdomsbarometern.",
      "There is no official data on the number of young \u201csoft girls\u201d quitting work altogether and living off their partners like Ms Larsson, and Ms G\u00f6ransson says it is likely to be a small proportion.",
      "But it\u2019s nevertheless become a major talking point in Sweden, from opinion pieces in broadsheet newspapers, to panel discussions at Almedalen \u2013 a huge annual cross-party political event \u2013 and on Swedish public service television.",
      "Gudrun Schyman \u2013 the co-founder and former leader of Sweden\u2019s feminist party Feministiskt initiativ - says she\u2019s taken part in recent debates on the issue. She believes women living off their partners wealth is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d, and \u201ca step backwards\u201d for gender equality.",
      "Ms Schyman argues that young Swedes have been influenced by the country\u2019s right-wing coalition government, which collaborates with the nationalist Sweden Democrats party, as well as the \u201cbroader development\u201d of populism in Europe and the United States.",
      "She also thinks there\u2019s a lack of awareness about life in Sweden before it embraced policies designed to promote gender equality, such as heavily subsidised childcare and shared parental leave. \u201cYoung women today don't carry the history of how women had to fight for their rights - the right to work, the right to have a salary, and the right to economic independence.\u201d",
      "At the other end of the political spectrum, the Sweden Democrats party has been positive towards the soft girls trend.",
      "\u201cI think that people should get to decide over their own life,\u201d says Denice Westerberg, national spokesperson for the party\u2019s youth wing. \u201cAnd if you have that economic possibility to do that [live off a partner] then good for you.",
      "\u201cWe still live in a country with all the opportunities to have a career. We still have all the rights, but we have the right to choose to live more traditionally.\u201d",
      "Aside from ideological debates, discussions have focussed on the social and cultural factors that could be influencing young women to quit work - or at least aspire to a softer lifestyle.",
      "Sweden has a reputation for work life balance - most employees get six-weeks holiday a year, and less than 1% work more than 50 hours a week.",
      "Still, Ungdomsbaromatern\u2019s research suggests rising stress levels amongst young people, and Ms G\u00f6ransson believes soft girls trend may be an extension of recent global work trends such as \u201cquiet quitting\u201d, which encourages employees not to overextend themselves.",
      "Meanwhile, the Generation Z age group (the cohort born between 1997 and 2012) are making, and being influenced by, social media content that celebrates leisure time rather than career goals.",
      "Business Daily: Sweden\u2019s #softgirls trend",
      "\u201cWork doesn't really feature that much if you look at lifestyle content on social media today, it's much more about exercise and wellness,\u201d explains Ms G\u00f6ransson. \u201cAnd if that's the picture young people have of what a normal life looks like, then, of course, maybe you're not so excited about spending eight hours in an office a day.\u201d",
      "But perhaps the biggest talking point is whether the trend is a response to the limitations of Sweden\u2019s pioneering gender equality policies.",
      "Alongside Slovenia, Sweden has the highest proportion of working mothers in Europe, yet government statistics suggest women in heterosexual couples still do a larger share of housework and childcare than men.",
      "They also take 70% of state-funded parental leave, and are more likely to go on sick leave for stress. Meanwhile, although the income gap between men and women remains lower than the EU average of 12.7%, it has stalled at around 10%  since 2019.",
      "Ms Larsson \u2013 who wants to have children in the future \u2013 says her decision to become a stay-at-home girlfriend is partly due to watching older women struggle to juggle a career and homelife.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of women feel burned out from their work,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just think of my mother and her mother, my grandma, and my sister, everyone. They're always so stressed.\u201d",
      "At Sweden\u2019s state-funded Gender Equality Agency, Peter Wickstr\u00f6m, head of the department for policy analysis and monitoring, also believes the soft girl trend can be viewed as a \u201crational reaction\u201d to the perceived \u201cdemands\u201d experienced by young women.",
      "Shoka \u00c5hrman, an economist at one of Sweden\u2019s largest pension funds, SPP, says she does not believe enough Swedish girlfriends or wives will quit work for it to have an impact on the country\u2019s economy.",
      "However, she is working to raise awareness amongst Swedish women that leaving the labour force (as well as going part time) could impact their personal finances, from savings and pensions, to salary levels if they return to work.",
      "Ms \u00c5hrman hopes the current soft girl debates will serve as a wake-up call to both politicians and businesses alike that there is still work to be done to address ongoing structural inequalities in Sweden.",
      "\u201cI think the source of it, which is mental health issues, burnouts and all that, is what's more worrying, because that affects not only the few younger girls today that want to stay home as soft girls,\u201d she says.",

      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",

What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",

      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",

      "When she plays the final notes of Karma in Vancouver on Sunday night, the Eras Tour will be over, forever.",
      "First announced in November 2022, it's been even bigger than Swift could have wildest-dreamed - with 149 shows in 53 cities seen by 10.1 million fans.",
      "Along the way, it hoovered up $2bn in ticket sales, stimulated local economies and triggered seismic events.",
      "Swift has called it \"the most exhausting, all-encompassing, but most joyful, most rewarding, most wonderful thing that has ever happened\" in her life.",
      "Writing in her recently-published tour book, Swift said the 45-song, career-spanning setlist was inspired by the decision to re-record her first six albums, which made her fall \"back in love\" with her past work.",
      "She went on to play concerts in \"the pouring rain, in the blazing heat, in the thickest of humidity, in the wildest of winds and in the bitter cold,\" she wrote, even when she was \"sick or exhausted or injured,\" or working through a \"broken heart\".",
      "But the concerts were about more than the music. Fans swapped friendship bracelets and made lifelong friends with strangers. Outside the stadiums, ticketless Swifties gathered in car parks to sing along.",
      "At one show in Munich, 40,000 people congregated on a nearby hill just to catch a glimpse of the show, almost outnumbering the fans inside the city's former Olympic Stadium.",
      "For many, the chance to hear these songs live for the first time was overwhelming.",

      "Female Rage: The Musical",
      "The conclusion of the tour leaves Swift at a crossroads. This Eras Tour will be the yardstick against which the rest of her career will be measured - and her next move will be watched closely by fans and critics alike.",
      "So what options does she have?",
      "\"Taylor is a very future-minded thinker, so I imagine she has the next few years already completely planned out.\" says Bryan West, a dedicated Taylor Swift reporter for USA Today and The Tennessean, who has seen the Eras tour 89 times.",
      "Noting Swift's tendency to dovetail her projects, he thinks there will be some sort of \"news-making\" announcement at her final show.",
      "Most likely, this will be the reveal of Reputation (Taylor's Version) - the latest instalment of her re-recorded album series, complete with bonus tracks from the vault.",
      "That said, fans have been anticipating that announcement all year and the album is yet to materialise, despite numerous, tantalising hints it's on its way.",
      "West has some other theories, too.",
      "\"We've seen film crews at many of the gigs, so I'd not be shocked if she's been shooting a documentary this entire time.",
      "\"And in her new book, she said, 'See you next era', so there have been reports that she's working on new music.\"",
      "A longer term prospect is that Swift will pivot to film. In December 2022, she signed a deal to direct a film for Searchlight Pictures, based on her own original script.",
      "Making the announcement, Searchlight presidents David Greenbaum and Matthew Greenfield called her \"a once in a generation artist and storyteller\", but the trail has gone cold since then. Perhaps she'll return to the director's chair in 2025?",
      "West has also tracked several trademarks filed by the star this year, including Taylor-Con and Female Rage: The Musical \"which could be anything from a television show to a documentary series to a Broadway production\".",
      "But maybe we're expecting too much?",
      "Pushin' strollers",
      "\"She needs to take some time off, first and foremost,\" says Jack Saunders, host of Radio 1's New Music Show, \"because it's completely unrealistic to expect a human being to operate at the performance level that she has been doing for the last couple of years and dive straight back in.",
      "\"We've heard a lot from Taylor - so it's healthy for us and it's healthy for her to step back and take some time away, so that she can fuel herself for whatever's next.\"",
      "Indeed, Swift has hinted she's tiring of the music industry grind.",
      "Clara Bow, a track from her latest album The Tortured Poets Department, is a barbed commentary on the industry's lust for new blood.",
      "Other songs find her daydreaming about wedding rings and \"pushin' strollers\" - so there's every possibility Swift will take a year off to focus on her romance with American football star Travis Kelce.",
      "\"She probably will take a break,\" says West, \"but she's not one that necessarily sits still. She's always creating. She's always coming up with new projects.\"",
      "If Swift does head back to the studio, singer-songwriter Self Esteem hopes she'll spend the cultural (and financial) capital she's built up over the last two years to do something unexpected.",
      "\"If I was her, I'd indulge myself in making music in all the different genres and styles I hadn't been able to explore because of branding and expectations,\" she says.",
      "\"And it sounds really worthy, but I can't wait until I have enough money to fund working class people who can't get access to music - so if I was her, I'd do that.\"",
      "(It's worth noting that Swift has a history of charitable giving, including donations to local foodbanks on every stop of the Eras tour).",
      "Whatever happens, a left-hand swerve makes sense; in her Eras Tour book, the star says she \"hates to do the same thing twice\".",
      "But for this weekend, Michelle just wants to savour the final moments of a one-off phenomenon.",
      "\"We love concerts in my family. I love the buzz of being in a whole crowd of people excited about the same thing,\" she says, \"but this feels different.",
      "\"I love how the tour has brought people all over the world together.",
      "\"It will certainly be interesting to see what her next move is,\" she adds, \"but I can't bring myself to speculate.",
      "\"I'll just wait and see - because, whatever she does next, Taylor and her team should be very proud of the joy that was brought to so many during the Eras Tour run.\""

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:37:07 GMT",
    "summary": "The Chvrches singer on going solo, and the loneliness of being the only woman in a touring band.",
    "story": [
      "Lauren Mayberry is a peacemaker.",
      "Since 2011, she's been frontwoman of the Glaswegian band Chvrches, topping festival bills and the album charts with a trademark barrage of distorted synths and razor-sharp melodies.",
      "Mayberry was the baby of the band - just 23 when she joined, and years younger than her bandmates, Iain Cook and Martin Doherty.",
      "But their chemistry was instant. Chvrches' debut single, The Mother We Share, was written and recorded in 48 hours, using the only three synths they owned - but it became a word of mouth hit, earning them airplay on BBC Radio 1 and support slots with Passion Pit and Depeche Mode.",
      "In the press, they carefully presented themselves as a band, with each member receiving equal billing. But Mayberry says she worried about being the junior partner.",
      "\"I was always conscious that I was younger than the other guys, and they had a lot more experience,\" she says.",
      "\"They\u2019d been to music school, and I hadn't. So I always felt like I was on the back foot, in terms of where I sat in the hierarchy.\"",
      "That feeling was amplified during a 2019 tour of Australia.",
      "The itinerary gave the band a four-day break in Melbourne, and Mayberry was looking forward to spending the downtime with her bandmates and the crew - until she discovered they'd made separate plans and she was stranded in her hotel room.",
      "\"I remember being very upset and hurt by that because I was always worrying about everyone else and taking care of everybody, and it was a humbling moment,\" she says.",
      "\"In the end, I hired a little car and drove to an Australian spa town and had a wee cry listening to Taylor Swift\u2019s Cruel Summer.\"",
      "Looking back, she thinks that being the only woman in the touring party left her carrying the \"emotional labour\" of keeping the show on the road.",
      "\"I feel like I twisted myself into a pretzel sometimes to make everyone happy.",
      "\"Then I\u2019d look back and think, \u2018And were you happy?'",
      "\"Not really, but I was keeping the peace.\"",
      "She considered leaving the band after that Australian incident. Then Covid struck, and Chvrches ended up making a fourth album, 2021's Screen Violence, remotely.",
      "She finally took the plunge a year later, but not before signing a new record deal with her bandmates, assuring the future of the project.",
      "\"I was conscious it would give people a sense of security, that I\u2019d made a commitment,\" she says.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s how it actually works, but that was my hope.\"",
      "She\u2019s keen to stress there\u2019s no bad blood: Doherty and Cook have given her their full support. Still, it\u2019s natural for someone leaving a band to define themselves in opposition to that music - otherwise what\u2019s the point?",
      "As Mayberry succinctly puts it: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a crap knock-off Chvrches record.\u201d",
      "In recording sessions, she'd flinch when anyone pulled out a vintage synth. Instead, she pursued a more organic, lyrics-first approach.",
      "But after a decade in a trio, the instinct to compromise was hard-wired.",
      "\u201cI'm very used to arguing my point, then trying to see other people's point of view,\" she says.",
      "\"So it was a real learning curve to be like, \u2018No, this is my opinion, and if I don't think it's right, then it's not right, and that's the end of the conversation'.\u201d",
      "Crying wolf",
      "The result is Vicious Creature, an album that showcases new depths to Mayberry\u2018s voice, which fluctuates between vulnerability and venom, while paying homage to her pop heroines.",
      "She channels the spirit of All Saints on the album opener Something In The Air; and borrows the choppy, sampled strings of Annie Lennox's Walking On Broken Glass to power the single Crocodile Tears.",
      "The latter is a furious riposte to an emotionally manipulative man, where Mayberry snarls: \u201cWhat a man will say just to get his way / Always crying wolf, so I\u2019m sad to say / I don\u2019t really wanna hear it from you, babe\".",
      "The singer says she's role-playing in that song, inspired by the dark, subversive femininity of Velma Kelly in the musical Chicago, or Cabaret's Sally Bowles.",
      "It's one of several songs that survived the first incarnation of the album - tentatively titled Fiction - that would be \"dark, theatrical and character driven\".",
      "Slowly, over time, more personal songs started to creep into the mix.",
      "The syncopated pulse of Change Shapes is a condemnation of music industry sexism (\"I'm a doll inside a box, with a ball and a chain\"). Sorry, Etc tells a similar story over a chaotic hybrid of garage rock and drum & bass.",
      "\"There were definitely a few songs where it was at best expressing frustrations and at worst [feeling] kind of hurt,\" about her life in music, Mayberry says.",
      "The album's most intimate moment is a muted piano ballad called Oh, Mother.",
      "Over three verses, Mayberry documents the shifting relationship with her mother - from the unquestioning love of childhood to adolescent disgust and, finally, the realisation that their time together is limited.",
      "\"It kills me to know you won't be around,\" she sings gently. \"Oh mother, what will I do without you?\"",
      "The last song written for the record, the words poured out after Mayberry's friend and co-writer Dan McDougall sketched out the chords in the studio.",
      "Discussing the lyrics, which were inspired by a family illness, the singer becomes a little emotional.",
      "\"When you're living in the shadow of things like that, it's on your mind all the time,\" she says.",
      "\"I think about it all the time. When I go away on tour, I always think, \u2018Oh, is this the tour where I'm gone and I miss it\u2019.",
      "\"So that last afternoon in the studio was quite a weepy one... But then we went to Nando's. So it's all about balance.\"",
      "Oh, Mother is the sort of song she could never have written in Chvrches, Mayberry says.",
      "\"It's not a place that we would go emotionally or sonically,\" she says.",
      "\"I think the best songs happen when the lyrics and the meaning and the sonics interlink but [with Chvrches] I was writing things in my notebooks and thinking, \u2018This is never going to fit with what the band have built\u2019.\"",
      "Change is never easy, though. While some reviews have called the album a \"masterclass in pop alchemy\", others have said Mayberry \"still sounds like someone finding their feet\".",
      "Fans of Chvrches' industrial sound have expressed disappointment too, but the singer has learned to distance herself from criticism.",
      "\"When people are like, \u2018Screw you\u2019, I rationalise it like this: You\u2019re mad at me, but you're mad at me because life is hard, and our music made your life a bit easier for a minute. And now you're like, \u2018Please don't take that away.\u2019",
      "\"When I was 24, that was overwhelming, but it made sense once I could compartmentalise it.",
      "\"You are the representative of something that means so much to this person - so when you do something else, it threatens the idea of that existing.\"",
      "The flipside of that equation comes in concert. When Mayberry plays a song like Asking For A Friend, with its reassuring mantra, \"you still matter\", she often sees \"someone in the audience having a wee dance-cry\".",
      "\"And when people cry, I cry. Everyone's like, 'Are you ok?' but I'm just caught up in the moment.",
      "\"But I hope that\u2019s why I\u2019m good at my job, because I have some kind of empathy.",
      "\"It\u2019s inconvenient for my life, but hopefully good for the crowd.\""

      "An earlier video for All My Love also saw Chris Martin walking the streets of Las Vegas in disguise, singing karaoke and handing out balloons to strangers... a scene which Van Dyke briefly recreates in the latest clip.",
      "In an interview on the US chat show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Martin revealed that he and Van Dyke are neighbours in California, and that they had been friends for years.",
      "\"This really may be the most fun thing I've ever done,\" he said of the video.",

      "Presenter Gregg Wallace is a national figure, who has been in people\u2019s living rooms several times a week for 20 years.",
      "His programmes, most prominently MasterChef, are made by independent production companies.",
      "But his name and face are associated with the BBC, and, as allegations continue to emerge, the corporation is under fire.",
      "It\u2019s the last thing it needs, so soon after other high profile scandals including the disgraced BBC News presenter Huw Edwards.",
      "The BBC has questions to answer about the allegations over what it knew about Wallace\u2019s behaviour on and off set, and - if it was alerted to these types of allegations - what it did about them.",
      "BBC News has been made aware of two occasions when complaints were made. One, by the radio host Aasmah Mir, related to Celebrity MasterChef in 2017.",
      "She says she complained to the production company behind the show and later spoke to the BBC\u2019s Kate Phillips who was then controller for entertainment commissioning. I understand Phillips was later assured that the issue had been addressed.",
      "Another complaint, just a year afterwards, concerned Impossible Celebrities, made by a different production company.",
      "In a letter from 2018 seen by BBC News, Phillips wrote that she had spoken to Wallace for 90 minutes to make clear what the BBC expected of him. She also confirmed in the letter that many aspects of his behaviour were unacceptable and unprofessional.",
      "Six years on, the emerging allegations about Wallace\u2019s conduct raise questions about whether executives - at the production company Banijay and the BBC - reacted appropriately.",
      "But BBC News has not been told whether the BBC executives involved in Wallace\u2019s shows were made aware of any complaints about him after 2018 and the conversation between him and Phillips. If they weren\u2019t, there is some plausible deniability that they thought the issues raised had been sorted.",
      "Then again, that defence may only go so far. There are wider questions about how much a TV executive should probe, if they are aware that rumours have begun to swirl.",
      "Popbitch, the weekly celebrity newsletter that makes its way into the inboxes of most media executives, had run stories involving allegations about Wallace\u2019s language and behaviour in the past, for example. When does the odd gossipy claim about talent misbehaviour become an issue bosses should take a look at?",
      "Should more questions have been asked by the BBC after 2018?",
      "Some have made the point that these types of scandals involving high profile TV presenters only seem to emerge when the media shines a light on them.",
      "It\u2019s only then, it is argued, that executives take action and launch an investigation. The claim is that before journalists get involved, the executives are more concerned with protecting the star, the show and their bottom line.",
      "In light of Huw Edwards, the BBC launched a workplace review into preventing abuses of power. At the time, the BBC chair Samir Shah said there \"continues to be a sense that powerful people 'get away with it'.\"",
      "But for me, how the Wallace claims may have been handled isn\u2019t entirely comparable to the Edwards scandal.",
      "Huw Edwards was employed directly by the BBC, Wallace is contracted by production companies that make his shows and sell them to the BBC.",
      "To put this in context, 326 independent companies made programmes for the BBC in the year 2023/4, accounting for 55% of the BBC\u2019s TV hours.",
      "I have picked up some frustration on the corporate side of the BBC that the corporation is taking criticism for a programme that it doesn't make.",
      "A BBC insider told me it essentially bought a product from a third party and is now being held to account for the actions of staff in a different organisation.",
      "My assessment is that if there were complaints - or claims of bad behaviour on set - the first port of call would have been the production company.",
      "But that defence - that the BBC is at arm's length on this one - only goes so far. Audiences don\u2019t make that distinction. In the end, they associate Wallace with the BBC, not a production company.",
      "The damage rests at the BBC\u2019s door.",

      "Wallace's response to MasterChef claims was misogynistic, says No 10",
      "The workplace review will aim to look at how to ensure that junior people with less power feel able to speak up, when a presenter is behaving badly. The director general Tim Davie has already said he\u2019d like to ban the word \"talent\" for the BBC\u2019s stars, to help end the hierarchies that can be a part of programme making when powerful, highly paid people with audience recognition are involved.",
      "But, understandably, the review won\u2019t have oversight of the independent sector. These are independent companies responsible for their own codes.",
      "It would however be useful for the review to lay out what BBC processes are triggered when rumours begin to emerge about a particular star and what the BBC expects from its executives and indeed the production companies it buys programmes from.",
      "Philippa Childs, the head of union Bectu, told Radio 4 on Wednesday \"the time has come for the whole industry to come together and accept that there does need to be some independent scrutiny of how broadcasters [and] production companies work, to try and address this endemic problem\".",
      "The Wallace story may be a wake-up call for the production sector. For years, we\u2019ve heard about junior staff feeling unable to speak truth to power in these sorts of scenarios.",

      "\"I would have wanted to have known it so many times,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhen I was on the floor and couldn't get an ambulance,\u201d she continues. \u201cWhen I went home [from hospital] and I read in People magazine that we wouldn't know for 30 days if I was going to live or die.\u201d",
      "An artery had ruptured, causing a bleed on her brain and a stroke. She says she was given a 1% chance of survival and had to relearn basics like walking and talking.",
      "She goes on to list the challenges she has faced since, including financial troubles and a custody battle with her ex-husband Phil Bronstein over their adopted son Roan.",
      "Until my question, Stone explains, she had not fully recognised she had come through it all. \u201cIt's been that long and it's OK\u2026 it's over\u2026 everybody made it to shore,\u201d she says.",
      "Resilience is the theme of this year\u2019s BBC World Service 100 Women season, and she beams as I tell her she is on our list of inspiring and influential women.",
      "Stone was propelled to superstardom by her performance in the 1992 erotic thriller Basic Instinct. It saw her branded a sex symbol, and she has spoken about being typecast as a result.",

      "Her artworks are bold and impressionistic, and - in her own words - \u201cvery large\u201d. This, she explains, is partly because she was inspired by an aunt who painted murals on the walls of her house - and partly because she can\u2019t see well enough to paint small.",
      "She says she doesn\u2019t envisage what the final creation will look like as she paints. \u201cI'm just in it so deeply,\u201d she says. \u201cIt's so immersive. It's just wonderful.\u201d",
      "We also talk about online dating - because yes, Hollywood icon and superstar Sharon Stone has been using dating apps, like so many other people trying to find love. She was even temporarily blocked from Bumble after other users thought her profile was fake.",
      "But websites \u201cdon't give you the thing that dating's all about, which is chemistry\u201d, she says. \u201cYou have to sniff that out for yourself like a truffle pig,\" she adds, laughing that \u201cyou can\u2019t smell through the pages\u201d.",

      "She says she wasn\u2019t convinced by the actions of some of the characters she played. But now, she says: \u201cI think we're getting to a place where women are just playing how a women would actually behave in the circumstance.\u201d",

      "In his 14 years as an MP, the former minister came to be viewed as one of the most controversial politicians of recent times thanks to some of his hardline views. These include total opposition to abortion (even in cases of incest and rape) and a belief that there should be no climate change legislation.",
      "In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people, Sir Jacob said it would have been \"common sense\"  for residents to flee the building, ignoring fire brigade advice. A survivors group described the comments as \"extremely painful and insulting\". Sir Jacob later said he \"profoundly apologised\".",

      "It is not known how much he is being paid by Discovery+ for the documentary, but as his wife is the heiress to a reported \u00a345 million fortune, money doesn't seem to be a motive.",

      "To be eligible, patients will also need to have one obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease.",
      "Under the rollout plans, those with the highest clinical need will be prioritised first.",
      "It is estimated around 220,000 will benefit in the first three years.",
      "NICE then plans to evaluate how that is working, before pushing ahead with the wider rollout.",
      "As this is final draft guidance, it is still possible rollout could be delayed if there are any appeals made against the decision. If there is not, the guidance will be rubber-stamped before Christmas, NICE said.",
      "Concerns",
      "Mounjaro, which is given via weekly injections, will cost the NHS \u00a3122 per patient per month for the maximum dose, but NICE judged it to be cost-effective given the cost of obesity.",
      "There is a risk that users can put weight back on once they stop using it.",
      "Ministers in Wales will be using the guidance from NICE to inform their rollout.",
      "It is already recommended for use in Scotland \u2013 although the NHS is reportedly struggling with its rollout.",

      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",

What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",

      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",

    "story": [
      "The government will be given the power to bypass council planning committees in England under plans to make it easier to build new homes.",
      "Officials will be allowed to speed up the process by rubber-stamping proposals that comply with existing council strategies without getting permission from a committee.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the planning process was acting like a \"drag anchor\" on aims to deliver more housing and vowed to bring a \"sweeping overhaul\" of the local committee system.",
      "House builders broadly welcomed the streamlining, but councils said a better way would be to give them more resources.",
      "A Conservative spokesman said the government's plans are \"nothing more than a list of empty promises which will do nothing to ensure that Britain has the housing it needs where it needs it\".",
      "Earlier this week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer restated his pledge to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029 despite accepting it could be \"a little too ambitious\".",
      "The fast-track planning process would apply to housing proposals and associated infrastructure such as schools, if they had already been broadly agreed as part of local development plans where councils set out a strategy for land use in their areas.",
      "If the proposals \"comply\" with these plans, the government said, they could \"bypass planning committees entirely to tackle chronic uncertainty, unacceptable delays and unnecessary waste of time and resources\".",
      "Rayner said building more homes and infrastructure meant \"unblocking the clogged-up planning system that serves as a chokehold on growth\".",
      "\"Building 1.5 million homes over five years means tackling the housing crisis we inherited head-on with bold action,\" she added.",
      "According to government planning statistics, between January and March 2024 only 19% of major applications were determined within the statutory 13-week period and only 38% of minor applications were determined in the statutory eight-week period.",

      "Taking away the option for local people to prevent a development by making a case at a planning committee may result in a political backlash, particularly in rural areas.",
      "Labour has already angered farmers by bringing agricultural land within the scope of inheritance tax, and needs to nurture support outside cities if it is to maintain political strength.",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA) said that, far from planning delays being to blame for holding up house building, a million proposed homes had in fact been agreed in principle by councils in their local strategies but developers had not brought forward plans.",
      "Councillor Adam Hug, housing spokesperson for the association representing councils, said local authorities and communities \"need to be full partners in tackling the housing crisis together\".",
      "He added this could be achieved with \"new development supported by the infrastructure needed to make communities thrive and proper consultation and engagement that can help ensure local people are able to benefit\".",
      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF) said that while \"democratic involvement and oversight of planning\" was a \"fundamental element of the process\" it could be \"very frustrating for applicants to have the principle of development debated over and over again\".",
      "The housing ministry also hopes to streamline the strategic planning process and introduce a requirement for better training for members of planning committees. A Planning and Infrastructure Bill will be introduced next month.",
      "Many in local government and the housebuilding industry believe the now-mandatory target of 1.5 million new homes by 2029 will be impossible to meet.",

      "\"The reality is that there comes a time if you are technically leading a particular institution or area of responsibility where the shame of what has gone wrong \u2013 whether one is personally responsible or not \u2013 must require a head to roll,\" the archbishop said in the Lords on Thursday.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 18:52:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Scrapping the two-child cap and changes to tax thresholds are among plans for the next financial year.",
    "story": [
      "A vow to scrap the two-child benefit cap and changes to basic and intermediate tax thresholds are among the plans for the Scottish government for the next financial year.",
      "The announcements were made by Finance Secretary Shona Robison as she revealed her tax and spending plans for 2025/26.",
      "Other talking points included an extra \u00a32bn for the NHS and a \u00a3768m investment in affordable homes.",
      "Here are five key takeaways from this year's Scottish Budget.",
      "1. Two-child benefits cap",
      "The biggest announcement in the budget actually isn\u2019t part of the tax or spending plans for next year.",
      "It was Shona Robison\u2019s \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d moment of announcing that the Scottish government would move to scrap - or offset, or mitigate - the two-child benefits cap.",
      "That\u2019s a UK-wide policy, imposed by the Department of Work and Pensions on welfare payments such as universal credit and child tax credits - so it will take some time, and will need some help from the UK government.",
      "It\u2019s not yet clear what the mechanism will be, how it will work, or how much it will cost.",
      "The Scottish Fiscal Commission says it was only sent the proposal last week, and that it hasn\u2019t had time to cost it; they call it a \u201cfiscal risk\u201d.",
      "But be in no doubt that this is a big challenge to Labour.",
      "It comes days after an announcement on the winter fuel payment also designed to outflank Anas Sarwar\u2019s party and embarrass the UK administration.",
      "If all goes to plan then the SNP government will start sending out payments to families of the 15,000 children affected in April 2026. One month before the next Holyrood election.",
      "Labour says it's willing to listen to ideas, but points out that there is not a penny in the coming year\u2019s budget to support it.",
      "They will surely need to come up with a more substantial response before that election comes much closer.",
      "2. Taxes",
      "There were no big changes to the devolved income tax system in this budget.",
      "There was some tinkering with thresholds, which will have a political impact if not a big financial one.",
      "Robison is increasing the thresholds for the basic and intermediate rates - two of the lower rungs in Scotland\u2019s six-band ladder of taxes.",
      "Because Chancellor Rachel Reeves has frozen those thresholds in the rest of the UK, it means Scots earning less than \u00a330,300 will pay less tax than if they lived in England or Wales.",
      "The difference is less than \u00a330 a year, but it allows Robison to say that 51% of Scottish taxpayers pay less.",
      "One bill that will almost certainly be going up is council tax. But with last year\u2019s one-off freeze on local rates coming to an end, it will be down to your local representatives to decide.",
      "Rather than wielding a stick by imposing any sort of cap, Robison instead sought to guilt local authorities into holding down increases, saying that \u201cwith record funding there is no reason for big increases in council tax next year\u201d.",
      "She says there\u2019s an extra \u00a31bn for local government - but it remains to be seen how much of that councillors will be free to allocate, and how much will fall into ring-fenced areas.",
      "Every year the government says it has increased funding for councils, then councils hit back that it\u2019s not enough, and there\u2019s a row over exactly how much money is enough money.",
      "We will no doubt go around in circles on that until budgets at a local and national level are finalised next year.",
      "3. Spending priorities",
      "The budget totalled more than \u00a363bn, and previously ubiquitous talk of tough decisions and austerity was notably absent. There was a positive tone - like Robison suddenly had some cash to splash on the government\u2019s favourite policies.",
      "John Swinney has made the eradication of child poverty as his top priority, and as ever there is cash in the budget for the flagship Scottish Child Payment.",
      "The cash to mitigate the two-child cap doesn\u2019t feature in this budget - only some money to set up that system, whatever it turns out to look like.",
      "In total, spending on social security is up by \u00a3800m - highlighting a key feature of devolved government, in the SNP\u2019s appetite for big state interventions and welfare safety nets.",
      "You can include in that last week\u2019s announcement about winter fuel payments, which are being partially reinstated from next year.",
      "This week Mr Swinney has also (unsurprisingly) earmarked the NHS as a core priority, and as expected it has a record funding settlement - \u00a321bn, or a third of the total budget.",
      "That includes almost \u00a3200m to cut waiting times and cash for local hospital projects in Edinburgh, Fort William and Airdrie.",
      "There were also billions of pounds for net zero and climate policies - including money from the ScotWind fund, a pot of cash raised by auctioning off plots of the seabed for offshore wind, which Robison had previously feared she might need to use for day-to-day funding.",
      "And there is \u00a3768m for affordable housing, which chiefly goes to reverse a cut made under Humza Yousaf\u2019s administration last year, but does ultimately leave spending higher and will apparently create 8,000 new homes in the coming year.",
      "4. Growing the economy",
      "A big focus of governments across the UK has been economic growth. Rachel Reeves has put it at the core of everything she is doing as chancellor, as Robison said a thriving economy was \u201can essential requirement\u201d.",
      "The finance secretary had been challenged to match the chancellor\u2019s support for firms in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors - a 40% relief on business rates.",
      "Scotland has a slightly different system of \u201cnon-domestic rates\u201d, but ultimately Robison said there would be a similar 40% relief for the vast majority of hospitality premises.",
      "Retail and leisure were notably absent (although there is some support for music venues), and we will see how far this shakes out in terms of who does and doesn\u2019t qualify for funding.",
      "The Scottish Hospitality Group has said it is a \u201csignificantly more restricted\u201d offer than that down south, calling it a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d.",
      "A motif of Ms Robison\u2019s speech was name-checking her cabinet colleagues as she spoke to each of their portfolio areas.",
      "That felt particularly notable in the case of Kate Forbes - an influential figure as the woman John Swinney brought into government in part to mend fences with business.",
      "She has highlighted more money for town centre regeneration as well as a tripling of investment in the offshore wind supply chain, which it is said will leverage ten times that figure in private investment.",
      "This approach of public cash opening the door to huge flows of private funds is a favourite tactic of Ms Reeves - and indeed is the core purpose of GB Energy.",
      "That UK energy firm is set to have some company when it sets up in Aberdeen, with Ms Robison pledging to establish a hub or offshore wind in the North East.",
      "5. Politics",
      "The SNP does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and thus needs the help of other parties to pass a budget.",
      "John Swinney has talked about wanting to reach out to opponents and run a collaborative administration.",
      "But there is no chance of a deal with the Conservatives, who want a billion pounds of tax cuts, or Labour, who really just want an election.",
      "That leaves the Greens and the Lib Dems as the most likely dance partners.",
      "Robison quite deliberately nodded to the key asks of both parties. There was funding for ferries, mental health and dentistry for the Lib Dems. The Greens demanded \u00a34.7bn for green policies - and she pledged \u00a34.9bn.",
      "The Greens welcomed some of the measures, but said \u201csignificant further changes\u201d were needed. They are particularly suspicious of the sums on offer for councils.",
      "The Lib Dems welcomed even more of Robison\u2019s announcements, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton reeling off a whole series of measures where he said it was right the government had listened to him.",
      "The draft budget is really the starting point for talks, which won\u2019t come to a head until the first votes at Holyrood in February.",
      "But the fevered talk of snap elections which followed the collapse of the Bute House Agreement has faded. A deal with someone still feels the most likely outcome.",

      "But, when asked by Badenoch for details about the new information, he replied: \"I'm not going to disclose private information.\"",
      "He added that Haigh's swift resignation was a \"marked contrast\" to the behaviour of the previous Conservative government and accused Badenoch of being \"obsessed with the Westminster issues\".",

Maybe she'll want to retract that statement.\u201d",
      "Last week, Haigh became the first minister to resign since the Labour government took office in July.",
      "On Thursday evening, Sky News and The Times revealed details of her past conviction.",
      "Haigh subsequently issued a statement giving further details of the incident, which took place in 2013 when she was working for insurance company Aviva.",
      "She said she had reported a mugging to the police and that a work mobile phone was one of the items that had been stolen.",
      "She later said she found the handset in a drawer at home.",
      "Turning on the phone \"triggered police attention\", she said, and the matter was taken to magistrates' court for making a false report to police.",
      "Haigh said: \"Under the advice of my solicitor I pleaded guilty \u2013 despite the fact this was a genuine mistake from which I did not make any gain.\"",
      "She received a conditional discharge six months before becoming an MP in the 2015 general election.",
      "Early on Friday, the morning after the details of the conviction emerged, Haigh sent a resignation letter to the prime minister, saying she did not want to become a distraction.",
      "The BBC has been told by Whitehall sources that she had told Sir Keir about her conviction when he picked her to be in his shadow cabinet in 2020.",
      "She did not tell the government's propriety and ethics team about it when she became a member of the cabinet after Labour won July's general election.",
      "She believed it was sufficient to have disclosed her spent conviction to Sir Keir when Labour was in opposition, the BBC has been told.",
      "On Friday, a Downing Street spokesperson refused to say what Sir Keir knew about the conviction, only that he accepted her resignation after \"further information\" emerged.",
      "The spokesperson was questioned for 25 minutes on the issue but refused to give more details.",
      "A regular briefing with journalists after Wednesday\u2019s Prime Minister Questions was no different, with a Labour spokesperson present simply saying they would not get into \u201cprivate discussions with former cabinet ministers\u201d.",
      "However the BBC understands that some in Downing Street were unhappy Haigh had not run her explanation past them before releasing it to the media on Thursday and felt she should have told senior civil servants about the conviction on becoming a minister.",
      "On Wednesday, Badenoch's spokesperson said: \u201cIt's not good enough to say this is a private matter.\u201d",
      "\"Did he know about the criminal conviction and put her in the Cabinet anyway? Or did he not and that is why he fired her on Friday?",

    "story": [
      "Councils in England facing soaring homelessness costs are urging the government to foot more of the bill, the BBC can reveal.",
      "Local authorities which house people in temporary accommodation generally pay the up-front costs and claim the cash back from central government.",

      "\u201cYou've seen the dramatic increase in the cost of rents since 2011,\" Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesperson, told the BBC.",
      "\"So it's getting increasingly expensive in a constrained market to find places that are suitable for people to live at costs that councils can afford.\"",
      "That lack of available accommodation options has meant many councils have had to use more expensive options, such as hotels and bed and breakfasts, to house those in need.",
      "Official government data released last week showed a record 123,100 households were in temporary accommodation at the end of June, a 16% rise on last year.",
      "Matt Downie, chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, told the BBC: \u201cAs more and more people are pushed into homelessness due to rising living costs and sky-high rents, they have nowhere else to go but to their local council, who too often have nowhere to put them but into expensive temporary accommodation that is often unfit for their needs.\u201d",
      "If someone meets the conditions for receiving temporary accommodation, it is often up to their local council to find them somewhere to stay.",
      "The council is then usually reimbursed by the Department for Work and Pensions, using the individual\u2019s benefits.",

      "But the coalition government froze that cap based on 2011 rates and no government has since unfrozen it.",
      "\u201c[Then-Chancellor] George Osborne and his gang decided to pass the buck to local authorities, and try and bear down on the benefits bill at the cost of many other things,\u201d said Hug, who is also the Labour leader of Westminster City Council.",

      "Labour\u2019s general election manifesto promised \u201ca new cross-government strategy, working with mayors and councils across the country, to put Britain back on track to ending homelessness\u201d.",

      "\"If Darren Millar is the answer, what was the question?\"",
      "Analysis",
      "By Gareth Lewis, BBC Wales political editor",

      "Expect him to do all he can to end 25 years of Welsh Labour in power.",
      "Mr Millar says he believes he can become first minister, and is also open to a deal with any of the other political parties in the Senedd to make sure there is no Labour FM after the 2026 election.",
      "Significantly he has also appointed a man who has sat at the top Conservative table before -  former Welsh secretary David TC Davies is his most senior adviser.",
      "First impressions on day one are that Millar means business.",
      "Reaction",
      "A Welsh Labour spokesperson said: \"Voters have already rejected Darren Millar and his colleagues at the general election. Instead of trying to understand why, they are papering over the cracks.\"",
      "Reform UK Wales spokesman, Oliver Lewis, said: \"The simple fact is, Darren Millar has been an MS since 2007 and has been nothing but ineffective in opposition, just like every other Welsh Tory.\"",
      "Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth congratulated Millar but said he takes the job \"at a time of chaos and infighting in his party, and with the Tories having failed to offer any credible solutions to the challenges facing Wales\".",
      "A Welsh Liberal Democrat spokesperson added: \"In July Welsh voters delivered their devastating verdict on the Conservatives, booting out every single Tory MP in Wales. Re-arranging the deckchairs in their Senedd group isn't going to make anyone forget their record of incompetence, sleaze, and failure.\""

      "Many councils accept the need for more new homes \u2013 but they are concerned about whether the targets handed to each of the 317 authorities in England are realistic or achievable.",
      "They fear the algorithm used to calculate the targets has not taken into account strains on local infrastructure, land shortages, and a lack of capacity in the planning system and construction industry.",
      "The concerns are shared by Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat authorities, according to BBC analysis of 90% of the consultation responses.",
      "Asked whether the government would force councils to meet the targets, Rayner said: \"We are saying that they\u2019re mandatory targets...",
      "\"So we're telling [councils], this is what we expect, and we'll work with them to deliver it.\"",
      "She pointed to \u00a3500m of extra funding for new affordable homes announced in the Budget as an example of support the government was providing.",
      "Rayner was also asked about the resignation of Louise Haigh as transport secretary, after it emerged she pleaded guilty to a fraud offence a decade ago.",

      "Asked if she was right and it was not a \"big deal\", Rayner said: \"Of course it's a big deal because I do think that women face barriers, and I think women of colour face barriers as well.\"",
      "However, she added that \"it doesn't also detract from the skills that a person has\".",
      "\"I often get described as left school at 16 without any qualifications, and there\u2019s so much more to me than being a woman or being working class.\"",
      "Asked if she would still be able to achieve what she has if she was a young person today in the face of struggling public services, stagnating wages and cost-of-living pressures, Rayner acknowledged it would be \"a challenge\" and \"you have to have a bit of luck\".",
      "But she said the government wanted to invest in state education \"so that people have those opportunities that I had\".",
      "Rayner added that as deputy prime minister she felt she had to do herself justice.",

    "story": [
      "Three rail operators will be renationalised by Labour next year, but the move is not expected to bring down fares for passengers travelling on these lines.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she recognised that \"affordability is really important to people\" but that people were \"willing to pay for a good service\".",
      "It comes as the government confirmed South Western Railway will be renationalised in May 2025, C2C in July 2025, and Greater Anglia in autumn 2025, after Labour passed a law allowing it to do so.",
      "But some have criticised the plans, arguing that public ownership will not make much difference unless it is paired with fresh investment in the railways.",

      "Those around Starmer acknowledge that the mission boards are not yet quite at full strength. They will soon become more public-facing entities, holding meetings outside of London and doing more to bring in expertise from outside government.",
      "Stocktaking",
      "But the principal way in which the prime minister will seek to drive his agenda is via \u201cstock takes\u201d. These are meetings where Sir Keir brings those responsible for each mission into Downing Street to hold them accountable for what the data is showing in their area and asking them how they propose to improve. It\u2019s an idea which was pioneered by Sir Tony Blair on the advice of Michael Barber, his delivery adviser, who recently returned to government.",
      "The frequency of these stocktakes will soon increase, a senior government source said, adding: \u201cIf we are saying that this is the mission of the government and this is how people should judge its success and failure then it is clearly something you need the PM driving through.\u201d",
      "In the next few weeks Pat McFadden, the cabinet minister helping the prime minister to coordinate policy across Whitehall, will give a speech with more detail on the government\u2019s plans for civil service reform.",
      "Both he and Sir Keir are said to be seized of the need to bring more outside expertise into government and to make better use of data and artificial intelligence.",
      "The government\u2019s stated aims here are bold. Announcing the appointment of Sir Chris Wormald this week as the new cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, Sir Keir charged him with \u201cnothing less than the complete re-wiring of the British state\u201d.",
      "There was no shortage of people in Whitehall questioning whether the longest-serving head of a government department  - Sir Chris has run the health department for eight years and education for four before that  - is the right person to transform Whitehall. Sir Chris's supporters say that within the current system he is one of those most open to reform.",
      "The appointment was received with open contempt by Cummings, who sarcastically described it as a \u201ctruly beautiful, artistic\u201d decision which should serve as a \u201cwake up call\u201d that \u201cthe Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change\u201d.",
      "And on that, at the very least, the success of this government depends on Dominic Cummings being wrong."

      "What are the milestones?",
      "All of the milestones are to be completed by the next general election, likely in 2029 - and in the case of clean power, to be \"on track\" for the 2030 deadline.",

      "Will the government be able to hit its new targets?",
      "Not to be confused with missions, foundations and first steps...",
      "It's easy to become confused when Sir Keir talks about what his government wants to do.",
      "As we understand it, the six \u201cmilestones\u201d set out today are things he wants voters to judge the government against by 2029, when the next election is likely to be held.",
      "They follow the six \"first steps\" he set out in May, just before the general election was called.",
      "The six milestones are ways to measure the five missions he set out in February 2023.",
      "The missions \u2013 like building an NHS fit for the future \u2013 are meant to be the driving purpose for the government. These are what civil servants have been ordered to prioritise.",
      "All of this is built upon three foundations - economic stability, secure borders and national security, according to Sir Keir.",
      "95% clean power by 2030",
      "The prime minister said being \u201con track\u201d for 95% clean power by 2030 was one of his milestones.",
      "But before and during the election, Labour constantly spoke about \u201czero carbon electricity by 2030\u201d - and this was what the party's manifesto promised.",
      "Sir Keir denied he was rowing back on 100% zero carbon, telling reporters that the \"clean energy pledge is today exactly what it was in the election\" and \"there was always going to be a mix [of energy sources]\".",
      "Is he right?",
      "The 95% clean power figure follows advice from the National Energy Systems Operator (NESO), which recently said a clean power system is one where demand is met by \u201cmainly renewables, with gas-fired generation used rarely to ensure security of supply\u201d.",
      "It says gas should \u201cprovide less than 5% of Great Britain\u2019s generation in a typical weather year\u201d.",
      "Two years ago Sir Keir also acknowledged that fossil fuels may be needed as a \u201cfall back\u201d.",
      "So while the 95% clean power does seem consistent with official advice and concessions in the past, it is the first time that figure has been used by the prime minister.",
      "Warning for 'tepid' civil servants",
      "One of the most striking things about the PM's speech was how much of it was aimed at shaking up the civil service.",
      "Too many in Whitehall, he said, were \"comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline\".",
      "Amid plenty of frustration at the top of his administration about their capacity to drive change, the PM said \"mission-led government\" was not just about delivering changed public services, but also about changing the nature of government itself.",

      "His answer pointed to him seeing it as a baseline expectation of government, rather than one of these half dozen points of focus, but it strikes me that leaves space for confusion.",
      "One other thing I must mention is the prime minister's criticism of the civil service.",
      "It took Tony Blair two years in office before he grumbled about the \"scars on my back\" from trying to change the public sector.",

      "To help fund this, Chancellor Rachel Reeves increased the inflation-adjusted day-to-day cash resources of the health department by 3.8% in both 2024-25 and 2025-26 in her Autumn Budget.",
      "However, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, has warned that achieving the 40,000 appointments and operations target will not be enough, on its own, to hit the broader 92% waiting list target.",

      "The first is real household disposable income (RHDI) per person. This is what people have left of their pay and benefits once they have paid tax.",
      "In October, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which does the government's forecasts, predicted that RHDI per person would rise by around 0.5% per year over this Parliament.",
      "According to calculations by the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on living standards, that would be a slightly better performance than the 0.3% average growth in RHDI per person in the previous Parliament.",
      "But it would be worse than just about every other Parliament for decades.",
      "The second measure is GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) divided by the size of the population, which the prime minister says will rise for every region of the UK.",
      "In the last Parliament, overall GDP per capita fell in the UK.",
      "Starmer also mentioned the manifesto pledge to deliver the highest sustained growth in the G7, which would mean having stronger growth than the US, Canada, Italy, France, Japan and Germany.",

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has appointed Sir Chris Wormald as his Cabinet Secretary - the head of the civil service and one of the most powerful jobs in government.",
      "Announcing the appointment, the prime minister said he wanted a \"complete re-wiring of the British state\" and that there was \"no-one better placed\" to do that than Sir Chris.",
      "As someone who has worked for the civil service since the early 1990s, Sir Chris has plenty of civil service experience.",
      "Depending on your perspective that either makes him an ideal candidate who understands how to fix the system's problems or an establishment figure, wedded to the status quo.",
      "His appointment was greeted with delight by Lord Jim Bethell, a former health minister who worked with Sir Chris during the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"When the killer zombies invade, I'd like Chris Wormald at my back,\" he posted on social media.",
      "Ex-health secretary Sajid Javid described Sir Chris as \"brilliant and dedicated\" while another former health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was a \"natural reformer\" who knew \"where the bear-traps are\".",
      "However, another former colleague has been less complimentary.",
      "Dominic Cummings, a senior No 10 adviser during the pandemic, said: \"Today should be a wake-up call to all investors in UK and young talent.",
      "\"The Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change and will continue all the things of the past 20 years that have driven us into crisis.\"",
      "Chris Wormald to become new civil service head",
      "Cabinet Secretary to step down on health grounds",
      "What is the UK Covid inquiry and how does it work?",
      "In May 2016, Sir Chris became the most senior civil servant in the Department of Health and over the next eight years worked with no fewer than seven different secretaries of state from Conservative Jeremy Hunt through to Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting.",
      "In that role, he oversaw important policies and decisions made after Covid emerged. And also \u2013 crucially \u2013 in the years before the virus started spreading, when planning for a pandemic was meant to be taking place.",
      "He has already given evidence on three separate occasions to the public inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of the crisis.",
      "Following one of his evidence sessions, one lawyer for the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice group accused him of providing \"an object lesson in obfuscation, a word salad, so many, many words, so very little substance\".",
      "In November 2023, the Covid inquiry published text messages he exchanged with his then-boss, Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill.",
      "These were sent on 12 March 2020, less than two weeks before the country entered its first national lockdown.",
      "In the messages, Lord Sedwill wrote: \u201cPresumably like chickenpox we want people to get it and develop herd immunity before the next wave. We just want them not to get it all at once and preferably when it\u2019s warm and dry.\u201d",
      "Sir Chris replied: \u201cExactly right. We make the point every meeting, they don\u2019t quite get it.\"",
      "Around that time, the government was forced to deny it had a plan to develop so-called herd immunity by accepting that younger, fitter people would catch the virus.",
      "Asked about this at the time, Sir Chris accepted he had been \u201cvery, very loose\u201d in his language but was, in reality, following scientific advice.",
      "Writing on X following Sir Chris's appointment on Monday, Cummings was fiercely critical of his role at the time.",
      "\u201cMany officials came to me in panic when they realised the cabinet secretary and permanent secretary of the health department in charge of pandemic planning truly believed that the faster everyone got Covid, the better,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cHe is now in charge of the entire system. Plan accordingly!\u201d",
      "Cummings also accused Sir Chris of being \u201cembedded deeply\u201d in the infected blood scandal and repeatedly telling ministers \u201cuntruths about the documents\u201d.",
      "In 2018 Sir Chris did write letters of apology after it emerged two former health ministers were incorrectly told all documents linked to infected blood had been placed in the National Archives, when campaigners later established that was not the case.",
      "Three years later, in 2021, Sir Chris then recused himself from any decisions related to the scandal.",
      "It later emerged that his father Peter, who was himself a Department of Health official from 1978 to 1981, was involved in meetings and decisions related to Britain\u2019s Blood Products Laboratory and had provided written evidence to the infected blood inquiry.",
      "Sir Chris was born in London in 1968 and went to Rutlish School in Merton, the same school former Prime Minister Sir John Major had gone to over 20 years earlier.",
      "He studied at St John's College, Oxford and on graduating almost immediately joined the civil service, starting out as a fast stream trainee in the Department for Education.",
      "Over the next 20 years he rose through the ranks, serving across Whitehall including at the Department for Communities and Local Government and in the office of the then-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.",
      "Now at the pinnacle of his career, it had been widely-known that Sir Chris was on the final shortlist to be the prime minister's new cabinet secretary, alongside Antonia Romeo, who leads the Ministry of Justice, and Tamara Finkelstein, the top civil servant at the environment department.",
      "Nevertheless his appointment came as a bit of a surprise in Westminster, where there was a feeling that Sir Chris's time had been and gone.",
      "While some civil servants privately share Cummings' assessment of their new boss, those in the health department may welcome the fact that the top job has been given to someone who understands the NHS.",
      "Getting down NHS waiting lists is one of the prime minister's priorities and he may have had this in mind when picking Sir Chris.",
      "Another factor in the selection could be Sir Chris's relatively low media profile.",
      "Bruised by the brief tenure of his well-known chief of staff Sue Gray, the prime minister will hope that Sir Chris largely continues to go under the radar of the wider public's consciousness."

      "The plan had been to send astronauts around the Moon but not land in September 2025. The date had already slipped once before, from November of this year.",
      "That will mean that a Moon landing will not take place until at least 2027, a year later than originally planned.",
      "The delay is needed to fix an issue with the capsule's heat shield, which returned from the previous test flight excessively charred and eroded, with cracks and some fragments broken off.",
      "Mr Nelson told a news conference that \"the safety of our astronauts is our North Star\".",
      "\"We do not fly until we are ready. We need to do the next test flight, and we need to do it right. And that's how the Artemis programme proceeds.\"",
      "Mr Nelson said that engineers had got to the root of the problem and believed that it could be fixed by changing the trajectory of the capsule's re-entry \u2013 but it would take time to carry out a thorough assessment.",
      "Nasa is in a race with the Chinese space agency, which has its own plans to send astronauts to the Moon. Mr Nelson said he was confident that the Artemis programme would reach the lunar surface first, but he called on Nasa's commercial and international partners to \"double down to meet and improve this schedule\".",
      "\"We plan to launch Artemis 3 in mid-2027. That will be well ahead of the Chinese government's announced intention that they have already publicly stated is 2030.\"",

      "The nomination of Jared Isaacman by President-elect Donald Trump to take over from Mr Nelson as Nasa's head has added to growing concerns that big changes are in store for Nasa's Moon programme.",

      "\"SLS is an old-school rocket. It is not reusable like Starship, hence very expensive, and it has taken a long time to get it operational. And slow and expensive is a precarious position to be in when the incoming president, we expect, is looking to save costs.",
      "\"Isaacman is going to bring a new pair of eyes over how Nasa operates. And it's hard to predict what this combination of Isaacman, Musk and Trump might mean for Nasa as we know it.\""

      "For about two months each year, fisherman Faustino Mauloko da Cunha transforms his home along the South Pacific coast into a whale monitoring station.",
      "From the morning, villagers and student volunteers gather at the house in Subaun,  a village in the north of Timor-Leste. Armed with binoculars and telephoto cameras, they watch the cobalt waters for one of its great treasures - pygmy blue whales.",
      "When there is a sighting, it\u2019s all systems go.",
      "Faustino's son, Zacarias, dispatches a drone. Then the team\u2019s leader, Australian marine ecologist Karen Edyvane, guides him to take the best photographs. When the drone returns, the team reviews the pictures, taking notes on a white board.",
      "It's a small and thrifty operation in Timor-Leste, which is part of an archipelago that lies between South East Asia and the South Pacific. But it has generated a wealth of information about pygmy blue whales - one of the largest animals on earth, whose vast habitats and elusive nature make them challenging to study.",
      "These citizen science researchers, all of them locals, have spotted nearly 3,000 pygmy blue whales over the past 10 years - Prof Edyvane considers that a \u201ctruly extraordinary\u201d number.",
      "Timor-Leste has one of the world\u2019s highest concentrations of marine mammals.",
      "During the migration season - October and November - hundreds of pygmy blue whales pass through the country\u2019s waters as they make the epic journey spanning thousands of kilometres from the Banda Sea, which lies to the north of Timor-Leste, to southern Australia.",
      "But the area has been under-researched, says Prof Edyvane, who started the citizen science monitoring programme in 2014.",
      "During the last two whale seasons, she has based herself in Subaun, about 50km (31 miles) from the capital Dili, working with fishermen, students and dive tour operators to document the cetaceans.",
      "They have documented \"some of the lesser known, intimate reproductive behaviours of blue whales, some for the very first time,\" says Prof Edyvane, a researcher at Charles Darwin University and Australian National University.",
      "In 2022, for instance, tourists with a local tour operator invovlved in the programme captured underwater footage of a mother nursing her calf, offering a glimpse into the species\u2019 reproductive behaviours, which have remained largely unknown.",
      "\"It\u2019s very, very exciting,\u201d she adds.",
      "The programme started as a Facebook group, inviting local tour operators, fishermen and residents to share sightings of cetaceans.",
      "Prof Edyvane trained them on surveying methods and taught them how to use telephoto cameras and drones so that they could conduct aerial and boat surveys.",
      "\u201cWhen locals see the whales swimming by, they will post pictures on Facebook and WhatsApp. Updates come on a real-time basis and when someone shares something, everyone gets very excited,\u201d Prof Edyvane says.",
      "In 2016, the team worked with a dive tour operator to launch the first whale-watching tour.",
      "It was only last year that they set up a \u201cresearch station\u201d outside the da Cunha\u2019s village home - photos show a simple hut overlooking the bay. Outside are two tables, plastic chairs and white boards mounted on the hut's walls.",
      "During this year's whale season, undergraduates from the National University of East Timor and University Oriental Timor-Leste gathered at the research station to help with the sightings.",
      "Even such a basic structure has made the task easier.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re able to monitor all day and all night,\" Prof Edyvane says. \"We\u2019ve also been able to get the most incredible footage. The whales come in so close sometimes we can actually hear their blows.\"",
      "Citizen researchers like these have become powerful eyes and ears on the ground for marine scientists, says wildlife scientist Vanessa Pirotta.",
      "\u201cThe combination of people having access to tools like drones and social media means we have insights into things that are happening while we may be behind the desk writing grants to fund our work,\u201d she said.",
      "The increase in research activity in Subaun has also led to a rise in tourism.",
      "The demand for whale-watching tours has increased, diving instructor Cassio Schumacher tells the BBC, adding that these tours are \u201cbooked up years in advance\u201d.",
      "Local non-profits have warned of the risks of unregulated whale tourism and the government has said it intends to use Prof Edyvane's research  to \u201cfully protect and conserve\" the marine life that pass through Timor-Leste\u2019s waters.",
      "Prof Edyvane believes that with regulation, whale tourism has the potential to create jobs and grow Timor-Leste\u2019s economy.",
      "The country is one of the poorest in the world, where average annual incomes in cities hover around $1,500, according to the International Monetary Fund. In Subaun, most villagers work as subsistence fishermen and farmers, earning just about $600 to $900 a year.",
      "The da Cunha family has now started preparing meals from local produce and the day\u2019s catch for the students and tourists - an additional source of income.",
      "\u201cWe enjoyed having the guests around and will love to do it again,\" Faustino, 51, tells the BBC on a WhatsApp video call.  \"We will make it a better experience [next season].\"",

      "This will remove many of the safeguards that have allowed the animals to flourish in Europe and means that from the beginning of March next year, each EU country will be able to set an annual quota of wolves to kill.",
      "The Commission argued that the number of wolves in the EU has almost doubled, from 11,000 in 2012 to over 20,000 today, and that they were causing too much damage to livestock.",
      "The Worldwide Fund for Nature  (WWF) has called the decision \"extremely disappointing\".",
      "\"Wolf populations have barely recovered after going extinct in most parts of Europe, and weakening their protection could jeopardise this fragile recovery,\" said the WWF in a statement.",

      "Wildlife campaigners have argued that improved protection methods, including trained sheep dogs, would be a better solution than removing safeguards.

      "Another argument against shooting wolves is that they hunt in packs of five to eight, usually a pair and their offspring. If the older wolves are shot, the pack fragments, making it harder for them to catch deer and wild boar.",
      "\u201cIndividual wolves are more likely to attack sheep and other domesticated animals,\u201d Mr Haring explains.",

    "story": [
      "TikTok's bid to overturn a law which would see it banned or sold in the US from early 2025 has been rejected.",
      "The social media company had hoped a federal appeals court would agree with its argument that the law was unconstitutional because it represented a \"staggering\" impact on the free speech of its 170 million US users.",
      "But the court upheld the law, which it said \"was the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents\".",
      "TikTok says it will now take its fight to the US Supreme Court, the country's highest legal authority.",
      "The US wants TikTok sold or banned because of what it says are its owners links to the Chinese state - links TikTok and parent company Bytedance have always denied.",
      "The court agreed the law was \"carefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary, and it was part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed by the PRC (People's Republic of China).\"",
      "But TikTok said it was not the end of its legal fight.",
      "\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "They added that the law was based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information\" and a ban would censor US citizens.",
      "Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US Presidential Election may also present a lifeline for the app.",
      "Despite unsuccessfully attempting to ban TikTok during his first term in 2020, he said in the run-up to the November elections he would not allow the ban on TikTok to take effect.",
      "When and why could the US ban TikTok?",
      "Is TikTok really a danger to the West?",
      "Trump will be inaugurated on 20 January - the day after the law says TikTok must be be banned or sold.",
      "However, it remains to be seen whether he will follow through on his pre-election vow.",
      "Professor James Grimmelmann of Cornell University said the president-elect would be \"swimming upstream to give TikTok a reprieve\".",
      "\"The anti-China sentiment in the US Congress is very strong, so there are now substantial constituencies in both parties that want TikTok to be restricted from the US market,\" he told BBC News.",
      "Users and rivals",
      "The court case has been closely watched both by those who use TikTok- and the app's rivals.",
      "Tiffany Cianci, a small business advocate and TikTok creator, said she was \"not shocked\" by Friday's decision - but told BBC News she would not be shifting her TikTok content or presence to the platform's rivals, such as Instagram.",
      "\"I'm not going to do what they want and take my content to their platforms where it's not as successful where it's more likely to be censored, where I am more likely to have less control over my audience,\" she said.",

      "\"Enabling such complex AI and big data processing at TikTok's immense scale requires a colossal and expensive technical infrastructure,\" Johnson said.",

      "In the run-up to the U.S. election, Musk's political posts received more views than all U.S. political campaign ads on X's disclosure dataset, Johnson said.",

      "Her \"Hawk\" digital coin hit a $490m market cap  shortly after it launched on Wednesday, before suddenly losing more than 95% of its value within hours.",
      "This has led some, including YouTube cryptocurrency investigator Coffeezilla, to accuse Ms Welch of scamming investors with a \"pump and dump\" - where the people behind a coin hype up its price before launch, then sell it for profit.",
      "She has denied allegations that her team sold any of the tokens they owned.",
      "The BBC has approached Ms Welch's representatives for comment.",
      "\"Team hasn't sold one token,\" she wrote in a copy and pasted post on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday.",

      "However it fell sharply from this high to around $60m just 20 minutes later.",
      "Fans and investors have accused Ms Welch and her team of \"misleading\" and \"betraying\" them and suggested the launch had been a \"rug pull\" - where promoters of a cryptocurrency draw in buyers, only to stop trading activity and make off with money raised from sales.",

      "\"These people were unwilling to take any accountability\" of the \"Hawk Tuah scam\", he claimed, after sharing a clip of him speaking to some of the people behind the cryptocurrency.",

      "The team behind the cryptocurrency, OverHere, has dismissed other claims about the launch in an X post.",
      "It stressed that \"Haliey's Team has sold absolutely no tokens whatsoever\".",
      "Meme coins such as this have been booming in popularity due to their jokey, cheap appeal for investors.",
      "They are often viewed as being less risky than more high profile crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but carry the same dangers - with often no protection for those who lose money on them.",
      "Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told the BBC on Thursday that while more young people are investing in meme coins, many of them are losing money.",
      "Several celebrities or influencers who have ventured into the crypto market have faced similar backlashes.",

      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",

      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",

      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",

      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",

      "6. Crypto King fraudster",

      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",

    "story": [
      "Luxury car maker Jaguar has unveiled its new electric concept car and, like a recent controversial teaser video, it has divided opinion.",
      "Some on social media said the new Type 00 car was \"exciting\" and \"absolutely stunning\", while others called it \"rubbish\" and told Jaguar's designers to \"go back to the drawing board\".",
      "However, the carmaker has suggested the reaction is exactly what it wanted, as it tries to reset its brand to revive sluggish sales.",
      "\"Jaguar needs to be bold and disruptive in order to cut through and get our message across,\" boss Rawdon Glover told the BBC.",
      "He said his goal was to restore Jaguar's image as a luxury brand, while no longer trying to compete by pumping out large numbers of cars.",
      "Jaguar has long been the weakest link within the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) group, which also makes Range Rovers and Land Rover Defenders.",
      "Since 2018, sales have plunged from 180,000 to just 67,000 last year.",
      "Last month, JLR stopped selling new Jaguars in the UK altogether, ahead of its relaunch as an electric-only brand in 2026",
      "The firm also announced a new logo, alongside a so-called \"social media tease\", which featured models dressed in bright colours but no actual vehicles.",
      "Many criticised the advert as \"woke\", with Elon Musk - boss of Jaguar competitor Tesla - asking \"Do you sell cars?\"",
      "Others criticised the change to Jaguar's iconic growling cat badge, which has been altered and no longer appears on the front of the car.",
      "Mr Glover has defended the effort, saying the debate helped to draw \"more eyeballs\" to the firm for this week's unveiling of the new concept car.",
      "\"In that context... the strategy was successful,\" he said.",
      "\"We absolutely don't want to ostracize any of our customer base ... But, as I say, [the] most important thing for us is we need to attract a new audience to Jaguar's brand to make sure that we are safeguarding the next 90 years of Jaguar's future.\"",
      "'Trust and reserve judgement' on rebrand, says Jaguar",
      "JLR halts UK Jaguar sales before electric relaunch",
      "JLR announced the transition to electric vehicles in 2021, keeping all of its three British plants open as part of the strategy.",
      "It said the decision to stop selling new Jaguar cars in the UK last month was a deliberate move to \"create some breathing space\" before unveiling its new look.",
      "The Type 00 model unveiled at a Miami art fair is a concept car and so will not go into production for sale to the public.",
      "Instead, the vehicle, which features an ultra-long bonnet and big wheels, gives a pointer to the direction of the brand's new models.",
      "Mr Glover said Jaguar had \"ripped up the rulebook\" with the new design, which is also intended to evoke Jaguars past when the brand was in its heyday.",
      "The rebrand comes with a higher price point, with Jaguar aiming for the luxury market.",
      "\"Nobody needs a vehicle at \u00a3120,000. You have to want one,\" he said.",
      "\"Overall, this has got that sense of real occasion. And that's that's what we think is perhaps missing in that luxury EV space,\" he added.",
      "But many on social media were nonplussed by the preview.",
      "James May, broadcaster and former presenter of Top Gear, said he was \"slightly disappointed\" by the design and its price.",
      "\"I wanted something more futuristic,\" he told the BBC. \"I mean, Jaguar have been saying they will copy nothing, but there's quite a bit of other concept cars in that new Jag.\"",
      "May said Jaguar cars had traditionally been \"very reasonably priced compared with, for example, Aston Martin\".",
      "\"So I'd like to see something more like half the price that they're toting at the moment.\"",
      "'Too big'",
      "Beatrix Keim, director at the Center of Automotive Research, said that Jaguar's concept car was \"too big, too unreal\".",
      "\"This is not the way to go,\" she said, given that there are already big cars in the market and \"electric cars cannot only be for the rich\".",
      "\"Of course, Jaguar is a luxury brand,\" she added. \"But I don't think that this is the direction which Jaguar at current point of time needs, because it's losing out on volume as well. And this is not a volume car.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Wearable tech \u2013 currently dominated by smart watches - is a multi-billion dollar industry with a sharp focus on health tracking.",
      "Many premium products claim to accurately track exercise routines, body temperature, heart rate, menstrual cycle and sleep patterns, among others.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has talked about a proposal to give wearables to millions of NHS patients in England, enabling them to track symptoms such as reactions to cancer treatments, from home.",
      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

      "\"Impeach Yoon Suk Yeol! Arrest Yoon Suk Yeol!\" they chanted.",

      "On Saturday morning, four days after Yoon's abortive attempt to declare martial law, the president once again appeared on television. This time it was to say sorry to the nation, just hours before an impeachment vote.",
      "But his mea culpa did little to appease the public. As lawmakers began making their way to the national assembly, various protest rallies started up across Seoul. While a few were in support of the embattled president, most were calling on him to step down or to be impeached.",

      "By 3pm, most of the protesters had converged in front of the National Assembly. The main thoroughfare was packed with people sitting in neat rows, as police officers lined the street. Protest flags fluttered in the cold winter breeze, while in the side streets vendors sold waffles and pastries stuffed with red-bean paste to hungry protesters.",
      "With rock bands, large screens and crane cameras, South Korean protest rallies tend to resemble outdoor music festivals, and this one was no different. Throughout the afternoon, the crowd was entertained by jolly acapella tunes, sentimental folk songs, and protest anthems.",
      "The crowd sang along to \"South Korea is a Democratic Republic\" \u2013 a catchy children's song extolling the virtues of democracy; the stirring \"A March Song for You\"; and even the Korean version of \"Do You Hear the People Sing\" from the musical Les Miserables.",
      "There were also fiery speeches. \"We must wipe out the traitors! If the impeachment vote fails, all 1.5 million members of our union will run straight to the presidential office,\" vowed one union leader.",
      "\"The traitors will be judged by the sharpened blade of the people!\"",
      "\"Impeach! Impeach!\" the crowd chanted back.",
      "But as the winter light faded into night, so did the hopes of the protesters.",
      "When it was time to vote on the impeachment bill, the ruling People Power Party (PPP) announced a boycott, stymying the opposition which lacked just eight votes to pass the bill.",
      "Almost every PPP lawmaker got up from their seats and left the chamber, as members of the opposition shouted and tried to prevent them from leaving.",
      "Watching these chaotic proceedings unfold on the screens outside, many of the protesters were aghast.",
      "\"The freedom of democracy is crumbling because of just one man. It's killing me,\" lamented an office worker who attended the protest.",
      "\"I think the lawmakers are irresponsible\", said one woman.",
      "She had left her home at 5am and travelled for hours to Seoul, just to take part in the protest. \"I was waiting all day for this. I hope they go back and vote. I'm trying to stay hopeful but I don't expect it to happen.\"",

      "\"We are not going to back down until he is impeached\u2026 we will march on until our democracy finally triumphs over this madness done by this crazy president.\"",
      "Onstage, the protest leaders called on the crowd to surround the National Assembly, in the hopes that by blocking the gates and trapping PPP lawmakers inside, they could buy the opposition enough time to persuade enough PPP members to vote for impeachment.",
      "The crowd surged forward to the gates. As protest leaders read out the names of every PPP lawmaker, protesters chanted \"Go back in, vote!\" after each name.",
      "The mood lifted when PPP member Kim Sang-wook re-entered the chamber to vote, joining two others from his party who had stayed on. Hope rippled through the crowd, as protesters cheered and chanted Kim's name like he was a rock star.",
      "Organisers blasted K-pop, and the crowd started dancing, singing and waving lightsticks. In the distance, some did a Mexican wave to a Girls Generation song. Suddenly, the protest transformed into a joyful pop concert.",
      "For a while, the mood remained ebullient. Protesters believed more from the ruling party would cross the floor by the deadline of 1am.",
      "But there were ominous signs. Kim told reporters that he had in fact voted against impeachment. And for hours, nobody else from the PPP joined.",
      "Finally, at about 9pm, the Speaker said he would close the vote early. Immediately, the festive mood evaporated. The impeachment bill needed just five more votes to proceed, but they were nowhere in sight - and time was running out.",
      "The crowd pressed closer to the gates. \"Go in, go in!\" they pleaded, urging PPP lawmakers to re-enter the chamber to vote.",
      "At 9.20pm, the speaker closed the vote. The crowd went silent as they watched parliamentary officials sift through the ballots. Some let out disappointed groans, while a few screamed angrily at the screens. The usual chant of \"impeach, impeach\" floated through the air, but it seemed to have lost its vigour.",
      "After what seemed like an eternity, the speaker announced the bill did not pass. It did not meet the quorum of 200 votes for counting. In the crowd, a woman cried out in pain and buried her face in her boyfriend's chest, sobbing.",
      "The protest leaders rushed to the stage, this time to rally people's spirits. \"We will not stop until Yoon is punished. The people will not accept the existence of PPP. We will fight till the end, till Yoon is impeached,\" vowed one speaker. \"Dear people, will you join us in our fight to remove Yoon?\"",
      "The crowd roared back emphatically: \"Yes!\"",
      "Meanwhile, inside the National Assembly, opposition leaders vowed to table the impeachment bill again and again until they got rid of Yoon. They have the public on their side: three quarters of South Koreans want an impeachment, according to the latest polls, while Yoon's approval rating has slid even further to just 13%.",
      "In an attempt to end on a high note, the protest leaders played All I Want for Christmas as a send-off. \"Don't forget your belongings, and please take your rubbish with you,\" they urged the dispersing crowd, as Mariah Carey's voice echoed down the rapidly emptying avenue.",

    "story": [
      "The \"brazen and targeted\" killing of health insurance executive Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, outside a New York hotel this week shocked America. The reaction to the crime also exposed a simmering rage against a trillion-dollar industry.",
      "\"Prior authorisation\" does not seem like a phrase that would generate much passion.",
      "But on a hot day this past July, more than 100 people gathered outside the Minnesota headquarters of UnitedHealthcare to protest against the insurance firm's policies and denial of patient claims.",
      "\"Prior authorisation\" allows companies to review suggested treatments before agreeing to pay for them.",
      "Eleven people were arrested for blocking a road during the protest.",
      "Police records indicate they came from around the country, including Maine, New York, Texas and West Virginia, to the rally organised by the People's Action Institute.",
      "Unai Montes-Irueste, media strategy director of the Chicago-based advocacy group, said those protesting had personal experience with denied claims and other problems with the healthcare system.",
      "\"They are denied care, then they have to go through an appeals process that's incredibly difficult to win,\" he told the BBC.",
      "The latent anger felt by many Americans at the healthcare system - a dizzying array of providers, for profit and not-for-profit companies, insurance giants, and government programmes - burst into the open following the apparent targeted killing of Thompson in New York City on Wednesday.",
      "Thompson was the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the insurance unit of health services provider UnitedHealth Group. The company is the largest insurer in the US.",
      "Police are still on the hunt for the suspected killer, whose motivation is unknown, but authorities have revealed messages written on shell casings found at the scene.",
      "The words \"deny\", \"defend\", and \"depose\" were discovered on the casings, which investigators believe could refer to tactics which critics say insurance companies use to avoid payouts and to increase profits.",
      "A scroll through Thompson's LinkedIn history reveals that many were angry about denied claims.",
      "One woman responded to a post the executive had made boasting of his firm's work on making drugs more affordable.",
      "\"I have stage 4 metastatic lung cancer,\" she wrote. \"We've just left [UnitedHealthcare] because of all the denials for my meds. Every month there is a different reason for the denial.\"",
      "Thompson's wife told US broadcaster NBC that he had received threatening messages before.",
      "\"There had been some threats,\" Paulette Thompson said. \"Basically, I don't know, a lack of [medical] coverage? I don't know details.\"",
      "\"I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him.\"",
      "A security expert says that frustration at high costs across a range of industries inevitably results in threats against corporate leaders.",
      "Philip Klein, who runs the Texas-based Klein Investigations, which protected Thompson when he gave a speech in the early 2000s, says that he's astonished the executive didn't have security for his trip to New York City.",
      "\"There's lot of anger in the United States of America right now,\" Mr Klein said.",
      "\"Companies need to wake up and realise that their executives could be hunted down anywhere.\"",

      "Michael Tuffin, president of insurance industry organistion Ahip, said he was \"heartbroken and horrified by the loss of my friend Brian Thompson\".",
      "\"He was a devoted father, a good friend to many and a refreshingly candid colleague and leader.\"",
      "In a statement, UnitedHealth Group said it had received many messages of support  from \"patients, consumers, health care professionals, associations, government officials and other caring people\".",
      "But online many people, including UnitedHealthcare customers and users of other insurance services, reacted differently.",
      "Those reactions ranged from acerbic jokes (one common quip was \"thoughts and prior authorisations\", a play on the phrase \"thoughts and prayers\") to commentary on the number of insurance claims rejected by UnitedHealthcare and other firms.",
      "At the extreme end, critics of the industry pointedly said they had no pity for Thompson. Some even celebrated his death.",
      "The online anger seemed to bridge the political divide.",
      "Animosity was expressed from avowed socialists to right-wing activists suspicious of the so-called \"deep state\" and corporate power. It also came from ordinary people sharing stories about insurance firms denying their claims for medical treatments.",
      "Mr Montes-Irueste of People's Action said he was shocked by the news of the killing.",
      "He said his group campaigned in a \"nonviolent, democratic\" way - but he added he understood the bitterness online.",
      "\"We have a balkanised and broken healthcare system, which is why there are very strong feelings being expressed right now by folks who are experiencing that broken system in various different ways,\" he said.",
      "Mr Tuffin, head of the health insurance trade association, condemned any threats made against his colleagues, describing them as \"mission-driven professionals working to make coverage and care as affordable as possible\".",
      "The posts underlined the deep frustration many Americans feel towards health insurers and the system in general.",
      "\"The system is incredibly complicated,\" said Sara Collins, a senior scholar at The Commonwealth Fund, a healthcare research foundation.",
      "\"Just navigating and understanding how you get covered can be challenging for people,\" she said. \"And everything might seem fine until you get sick and need your plan.\"",
      "Recent Commonwealth Fund research found that 45% of insured working-age adults were charged for something they thought should have been free or covered by insurance, and less than half of those who reported suspected billing errors challenged them. And 17% of respondents said their insurer denied coverage for care that was recommended by their doctor.",
      "Not only is the US health system complicated, it's expensive, and huge costs can often fall directly on individuals.",
      "Prices are negotiated between providers and insurers, Ms Collins says, meaning that what's charged to patients or insurance companies often bears little resemblance to the actual costs of providing medical services.",
      "\"We find high rates of people saying that their healthcare costs are unaffordable, across all insurance types, even (government-funded) Medicaid and Medicare,\" she said.",
      "\"People accumulate medical debt because they can't pay their bills. This is unique to the United States. We truly have a medical debt crisis.\"",
      "A survey by researchers at health policy foundation KFF found that around two-thirds of Americans said insurance companies deserve \"a lot\" of blame for high healthcare costs. Most insured adults, 81%, still rated their health insurance as \"excellent\" or \"good\".",
      "Christine Eibner, a senior economist at the nonprofit think tank the RAND Corporation, said that in recent years insurers have been increasingly issuing denials for treatment coverage and making use of prior authorisations to decline coverage.",
      "She said premiums are about $25,000 (\u00a319,600) per family.",
      "\"On top of that, people face out-of-pocket costs, which could easily be in the thousands of dollars,\" she said.",
      "UnitedHealthcare and other insurance providers have faced lawsuits, media investigations and government probes over their practices.",
      "Last year, UnitedHealthcare settled a lawsuit brought by a chronically ill college student whose story was covered by news site ProPublica, which says he was saddled with $800,000 of medical bills when his doctor-prescribed drugs were denied.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 19:39:02 GMT",
    "summary": "The IAEA agency says Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme has \"spawned in every direction\" over the last decade.",
    "story": [
      "The head of the UN nuclear watchdog has told the BBC Iran's decision to begin producing significantly more highly enriched uranium was \"very worrisome\".",
      "Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said Iran was increasing its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, just below the level of purity needed for a nuclear weapon.",
      "This will be seen by many in the region as Tehran's response to its military and diplomatic setbacks in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza in recent months.",
      "Mr Grossi said it was \"no secret\" some politicians in Iran were calling for the development of a nuclear weapon - but after holding talks in Tehran in recent weeks, he said that \"doesn't seem to be the path of choice\" by the current leadership.",
      "Mr Grossi was speaking on the margins of the Manama Dialogue conference in Bahrain run by the London-based think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "He warned Israel against attacking Iranian nuclear facilities, saying the consequences would be \"very, very serious indeed\" in terms of Tehran's retaliation and the potential spread of radiation.",
      "He also said it was \"extremely concerning\" that more countries were thinking of acquiring nuclear weapons and that the public conversation about their use had become \"normalised\".",
      "In a report to IAEA governors on Friday, Mr Grossi said his inspectors had confirmed Iran was feeding more partially enriched uranium into the cascades of two centrifuges at its Fordow nuclear plant south of Tehran.",
      "\"The facility's updated design information showed that the effect of this change would be to significantly increase the rate of production of UF6 (uranium) enriched up to 60%,\" the report said. It assessed the facility would produce 34kg (75lb) of 60% uranium per month compared previously with 4.7kg.",
      "The IAEA had demanded further \"safeguard measures\" at Fordow \"as a matter of urgency to enable the agency to provide timely and technically credible assurances that the facility is not being misused to produce uranium of an enrichment level higher than that declared by Iran, and that there is no diversion of declared nuclear material\".",
      "Iran denies having a military nuclear programme. But Mr Grossi told the BBC its nuclear energy facilities had increased over the last decade.",
      "\"They have a nuclear programme that has grown, has spawned in every possible direction.",
      "\"The Iran of 2015 has nothing to do with Iran of 2025. Iran is starting production of 60% [uranium] at a much higher level of production, which means they will have the amounts necessary - if they so choose - to have a nuclear device in a much faster way. So we see an escalation in this regard, which is very worrisome.\"",
      "On a visit to Tehran last month, Mr Grossi said he had been given an assurance by Iranian leaders that they would limit their production of 60% enriched uranium.",
      "Iran's decision to increase production comes after little progress was made in nuclear talks between European and Iranian officials last week.",
      "Mr Grossi said there were groups in Iran that were \"very vocal\" calling for the country to \"do its own thing\" on nuclear weapons.",
      "\"In my conversations with the government, that doesn't seem to be the path of choice, but they sometimes refer to this as something they might need to reconsider. I hope not. I have told them this would be a regrettable choice.\"",
      "Israel has not yet launched a full-scale attack on Iran's nuclear facilities - but its ministers have openly discussed the possibility.",
      "Asked about the consequences of any such Israeli attack, Mr Grossi said: \"I don't think this would go without an answer, militarily speaking, so I think we need to avoid this.",
      "\"One should not forget that a big part of the nuclear programme in Iran is underground and very well protected. So kinetic action against the programme would require a vast deployment of force.",
      "\"I just hope that we are not going to get there. I know the radiological consequences if you attack a nuclear facility.\"",
      "Mr Grossi also warned that the world's nuclear non-proliferation regime was under stress, as established nuclear powers \"seem to be relying more on nuclear weapons or modernising their arsenals\".",
      "As a result, other nations were talking more about acquiring nuclear weapons.",
      "\"There are countries saying: well, why not us? If we see that we have a world... with new conflicts, the big [countries] are saying that perhaps they might use the nuclear weapons they have, maybe we should think about our own security.\"",

      "Garland was only 16 when she played Dorothy in the classic 1939 musical The Wizard of Oz. Media outlet Variety ranked it second in its inaugural list of \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\".",
      "The film is a musical adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 children's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. While in the book, the magical slippers are silver, the producers for the film changed them to red to take advantage of the new Technicolor technology.",
      "In the film, as in the book, a pivotal moment occurs when Dorothy must click her heels three times as she repeats \"There's no place like home\" in order to leave the magical land of Oz and return to Kansas and her Auntie Em.",

      "One of the pairs is on exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. But this pair up for auction has its own unique history.",
      "Collector Michael Shaw had loaned the slippers out to the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, when they were stolen in 2005.",
      "Professional thief Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to smash the glass case and snatch the slippers, believing that their insured value of $1m must be because they were covered in actual gemstones.",
      "But when he took them to a \"fence\" - and intermediary who sells stolen goods to discreet buyers - he discovered they were just glass.",
      "So he gave the shoes to someone else. It wasn't until 2018 that the FBI recovered the shoes in a sting operation. What happened to them in those 13 years is still not known.",
      "In 2023, Martin - who was in his 70s and used a wheelchair - pleaded guilty to stealing them, and was sentenced to time served.",
      "\"There's some closure, and we do know definitely that Terry Jon Martin did break into our museum, but I'd like to know what happened to them after he let them go,\" John Kelsch, curator of the Judy Garland Museum, told CBS News Minnesota in 2023. \"Just to do it because he thought they were real rubies and to turn them over to a jewelry fence. I mean, the value is not rubies. The value is an American treasure, a national treasure. To steal them without knowing that seems ludicrous.\"",

    "story": [
      "Romania's constitutional court has annulled the result of the first round of voting in the presidential election just days before the second round was due to take place.",
      "It means the process will be restarted from scratch, with the government due to decide a date for a new vote.",
      "The first round was won by Calin Georgescu, an almost unknown far-right Nato-sceptic who has previously praised Vladimir Putin.",
      "The court's decision comes after intelligence documents were declassified, suggesting Georgescu benefitted from a mass influence operation \u2013 conducted from abroad \u2013 to interfere with the result of the vote.",
      "Hours after the court's decision, Georgescu told a Romanian TV channel that the country's democracy was \"under attack\", describing the verdict as a \"formalised coup d'etat\".",
      "He said he would \"go forward through the voting process\", implying that he would try to run again for president, though it's far from clear that that will be possible.",
      "Outgoing Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said the court's decision to annul was \"the only correct solution after the declassification of the documents... which show that the result of the Romanians' vote was blatantly distorted as a result of Russia's intervention\".",
      "In an address on Friday evening, current President Klaus Iohannis confirmed he would remain in the role until a new president was elected.",

      "Many of the residents also visited the district magistrate's office to lodge a complaint. Outside, they shouted slogans against Dr Bajaj and the Muslim couple.",
      "The protests have had their intended effect. On Friday, Dr Bajaj told the BBC that a resolution, mediated by the city's elected representative, had been reached and the new Muslim owners would re-sell the house to a Hindu family already living in the housing society.",
      "Dr Bajaj, who runs an eye hospital in the city and had lived in the society for more than six years, said he had sold the house to the Muslim couple who are both doctors and that their families had known each other for 40 years.

      "A notorious far-right extremist, convicted of murdering South African anti-apartheid hero Chris Hani, is set to be deported to his native Poland, the government has said.",

      "Hani was a key member of the African National Congress (ANC), which led the fight against white-minority rule and has been in power ever since, and also head of the South African Communist Party. Since his murder, he has become revered as a hero of the fight for freedom and equality in the country.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 12:51:57 GMT",
    "summary": "Macron rejected calls to resign, a day after his prime minister was ousted in a no-confidence vote.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron has said he will name a new prime minister \"in the coming days\", after Michel Barnier resigned following a no-confidence vote in parliament.",
      "In a 10-minute address to the nation on Thursday, he rejected opposition pressure to stand down, vowing to stay in his post \"fully, until the end of the mandate\" in 2027.",
      "Macron was holding talks on Friday with leaders of the Socialists, who said they were ready for a compromise in forming a \"fixed-term\" government, but not under a prime minister from a right-wing party.",
      "The Socialists joined colleagues on the left and far right in voting to remove Michel Barnier on Wednesday, only three months after he was appointed by Macron.",
      "The president thanked Barnier for his dedication during his brief term as prime minister, and accused MPs of collaborating in an \"anti-republican front\" to bring down the government.",
      "The vote was the first time a French government had been voted down by parliament in more than 60 years, a move Macron labelled \"unprecedented\".",
      "In France, it is the president who chooses the prime minister who then runs the government. But the prime minister must answer to parliament and Barnier lasted only three months before he was ousted in a no-confidence vote.",
      "Finding someone who will not be immediately rejected by parliament could be difficult for Macron, whose decision in June to call snap elections led to a deadlocked parliament.",
      "The National Assembly is now split into three big voting blocs - the left, centre and far right. If Macron's next choice of prime minister is to last, it is thought at least part of the left bloc will need to be persuaded to join the next government.",
      "The president held talks with several political leaders on Friday, having told the French people he would \"appoint in the coming days a prime minister who will form a government of general interest\".",
      "He first spoke to centrists in the \"Macron camp\", before meeting Socialist leaders, who are part of a broader left-wing bloc, the New Popular Front. He will also talk to the right-wing Republicans.",
      "Socialist leader Olivier Faure said ahead of the talks that he was open to discussion and \"compromises on every issue\" towards forming a government based on a \"fixed term contract\". But he made clear he had little desire to \"ensure the continuity of Macronism\".",
      "No new parliamentary elections can be held until July 2025, which might explain Faure's remarks on being open to a limited term for the next government.",
      "Faure said after the talks Macron had \"absolutely not\" asked the Socialists to split from the wider New Popular Front (NFP). However, the biggest member of the NFP, the far-left France Unbowed, said Faure had been given no mandate to speak on the Popular Front's behalf.",
      "Responding to Macron's speech on Thursday, Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally (RN), posted  social media: \"A little reminder to President Macron, who is supposed to be the guarantor of the Constitution: censure is not anti-republican, it is provided for in the Constitution of our Fifth Republic.\"",
      "The no-confidence vote that toppled Barnier's leadership had been tabled by both the New Popular Front (NFP) left-wing alliance, and Le Pen's RN.",
      "They united to censure the government after the former Brexit negotiator used special powers to force through his budget without a vote.",
      "A total of 331 MPs voted in support of the motion against Barnier, far more than the 288 required for it to pass.",
      "Barnier resigned on Thursday, and the budget was automatically withdrawn. He will remain in office on a caretaker basis with his ministers until a new government is appointed. Macron's role is unaffected.",
      "Macron has been heavily criticised for deciding to call snap elections, creating a deadlock in parliament and an escalating political crisis.",
      "He admitted in his address that his decision \"was not understood\": \"Many have blamed me for it and, I know, many continue to blame me. It's a fact and it's my responsibility.\"",
      "Addressing voters directly, he said some of his political opponents had chosen \"chaos over responsibility\" and that they were not thinking \"about you, the voters\", suggesting their focus was on the next presidential elections.",
      "Macron gave no indication of who the next prime minister would be, but said their immediate focus would be the budget for 2025.",
      "Speculation has been swirling over who could be named, with potential candidates including Defence Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, and centrist former presidential candidate Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou.",
      "Before Macron chose Barnier as prime minister, he asked his predecessor Gabriel Attal to stay on as caretaker for two months after the summer elections.",
      "It seems highly unlikely that the next government can be in place before Saturday, when world leaders including US President-elect Donald Trump are due to attend the opening ceremony of the rebuilt Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris.",
      "The building was devastated by fire in April 2019, and its reconstruction little more than five years later has drawn worldwide praise.",
      "Macron said the rebuilding of the ravaged cathedral, plus France's successful hosting of the 2024 Olympics, were \"proof that we can do great things\".",
      "\"We can do the impossible,\" he said. \"The world admires us for that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Koh Jae-hak can still vividly remember when he saw soldiers gunning down a group of young women in cold blood.",
      "It was April 1960. Students had launched protests calling for the resignation of the dictatorial president Syngman Rhee. Mr Koh was working in a government building when he looked out of the window and saw protesters clashing with police.",
      "\"There were demonstrations from various universities, and they all gathered in front\u2026 that's when shots were fired,\" the 87-year-old said. Days later, martial law was declared.",
      "South Korea is widely considered a peaceful beacon of democracy in Asia, but that wasn't always the case. This is a country that saw 16 bouts of martial law during its first four decades ruled largely by dictators.",
      "It is why democracy is now deeply treasured by South Koreans as a hard-won right. It is also why President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law this week \u2013 the first to happen in 45 years and during democratic rule - was particularly triggering and prompted such a visceral response.",
      "Almost immediately, lawmakers jumped out of bed and rushed to the national assembly, clambering over fences to reverse martial law.",
      "Hundreds of ordinary citizens gathered to hold back troops who had been ordered to throw out MPs.",
      "Some soldiers, apparently unwilling to carry out their orders, reportedly dragged their feet in clearing the crowd and entering the building.",
      "When Yoon declared martial law on Tuesday night, he said it was necessary to get rid of \"pro-North anti-state\" forces. Initially, it caused confusion with some South Koreans who believed there was a genuine threat from the North.",
      "But as they continued watching Yoon's televised announcement, many grew sceptical. He gave no evidence of such forces at work, nor explained who they were. As Yoon had previously used similar language to describe the opposition that had been stymying his reforms, the public concluded he was actually trying to crush his political foes.",
      "Previous periods of martial law had also been justified by leaders as necessary to stabilise the country, and sometimes stamp out what they alleged were communist subversives planted by North Korea.",
      "They curtailed freedom of press and freedom of movement. Night curfews and arrests were common.",
      "Violent clashes sometimes took place, most indelibly in 1980, when then President Chun Doo-hwan extended martial law to deal with student protesters calling for democracy in the southern city of Gwangju. A brutal military crackdown was launched, and it has since been labelled a massacre \u2013 while the official death toll is 193, some experts believe hundreds more died.",
      "South Korea eventually transitioned to democracy in 1988, when the government held its first free and fair presidential election following mounting public pressure. But the preceding decades had permanently and profoundly shaped the nation's consciousness.",
      "\"Most Koreans have trauma, deep trauma, about martial law,\" said Kelly Kim, 53, an environmental activist. \"We don't want to repeat the same thing over and over.\"",
      "Ms Kim was a young child when martial law was last in place and has little memory of it. Still, she shudders at the thought of it returning.",

Those creative industries have turned their own lenses onto the country's past, bringing history to life for those too young to remember.",

The movie depicts the political chaos that took place in 1979 as martial law was declared following the assassination of then president Park Chung-hee.",
      "\"As soon as I saw the images [of Yoon's declaration of martial law], it reminded me of that movie\u2026 it made me question, are we about to repeat that history now?\" said Marina Kang, a 37-year-old web designer.",

      "Among younger citizens, there is a sense of disbelief that it could have returned. Despite never knowing life under martial law, they have been taught by their parents and older relatives to fear it.",
      "\"At first [when I heard Yoon's announcement], I was excited at the thought of getting a day off from school. But that joy was fleeting, and I was overwhelmed by the fear of daily life collapsing. I couldn't sleep,\" said 15-year-old Kwon Hoo.",
      "\"My father was concerned that under martial law, he wouldn't be able to stay out late even though his work required him to\u2026 when he heard the news about the possibility of a curfew being imposed again, he started swearing while watching the news.\"",

      "\"Back then, it was a time defined by ideological warfare between democracy and communist socialism,\" said Kang Hyo-san, 83. He was sitting next to his friend Mr Koh in a cafe at Gwanghwamun, Seoul's main square and focal point for the city's protest rallies.",
      "The competing ideologies would lead to clashes and \"when the military intervened, the situation would stabilise\u2026 it was a process to restore order and properly establish free democracy.",
      "\"Given the circumstances, we couldn't help but view it positively,\" he said, adding that he felt each period of martial law left the country in a more \"favourable\" position. Martial law in South Korea \"fundamentally differed\" from other nations, where it \"wasn't about killing people or senseless violence\", he insisted.",
      "But this time, it's different. Both octogenarians felt that Yoon's declaration of martial law was unacceptable. \"Even though we've experienced martial law many times throughout our lives, this time there's no justification for its declaration,\" said Mr Koh.",
      "Like them, Ms Kim, the environmental activist, was glad Yoon did not succeed and democracy prevailed in the end. \"Because we fought so hard to get it, right? We don't want to lose it again.",

    "story": [
      "\"Daya, darwaaza tod do.\" (Daya, break down the door)",
      "Most Indians will instantly recognise this dialogue from the popular detective show CID, which ran from 1998 to 2018, making it one of India's longest-running television shows.",
      "The whodunnit featured three intrepid policemen - ACP Pradyuman, inspector Daya and inspector Abhijeet - solving case after case, as no criminal was ever a match for them. The low-budget episodes had comically simple plots, iffy acting, and all it took for a suspect to confess was a good slap from ACP Pradyuman.",
      "But over the years, the show has achieved cult status, and its characters and dialogues have spawned a wealth of jokes, memes and reels.",
      "CID is set to return later this month, sparking mixed reactions among its fans. Some are eager to see the three policemen back in action but others say that the show's old-world charm might not fit in with the gritty realism of modern-day crime shows.",
      "Over the past few days, the creators of the show have been releasing teasers for upcoming episodes on Instagram, each garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and comments.",
      "Apart from the three main characters, the teasers feature familiar tropes and dialogues. These include Inspector Daya kicking open doors to reveal a suspect's hideout and ACP Pradyuman muttering his iconic line, 'kuch toh gadbad hai, Daya' (something's not right, Daya), signaling to both his team and the audience that a crime has taken place.",
      "Trisha Shah, 35, a content creator from Mumbai and a fan of the show, says that the teasers make her nostalgic.",
      "\"CID was one of the few crime shows on television back then and my parents didn't mind me watching it because of its family-friendly content,\" Ms Shah says.",
      "\"Despite being a crime show, it never showed gruesome violence, sexual crimes, foul language or anything that was not suitable for family viewing.\"",
      "In an interview to Film Companion, an entertainment journalism platform, one of the writers of the show said that they even avoided giving surnames to the characters to avoid hurting anyone's sentiments.",
      "But the show's outlandish plots more than made up for its primness, whether that was ACP Pradyuman coming back from the dead or inspector Daya single-handedly manoeuvring a poison-gas filled plane to safety.",
      "In an interview to Forbes magazine, the producer of the show, BP Singh, described these scenes and plots as \"believable nonsense\".",
      "\"You may later laugh at it [the scene]. But for those five minutes, it is so engrossing that you don't mind it,\" he told the magazine.",
      "In a rather comical fashion, the characters would also explain plots and technologies used to solve crimes through their dialogues, making it easy for even children to grasp what was happening.",
      "\"The bad guys always got caught and that was comforting to watch,\" Ms Shah says. \"I don't think I'll enjoy the show today, but back then, it was a big deal.\"",
      "In the 1990s, TV was a big deal as it was the only form of home entertainment. At the start of the decade, India eased broadcasting rights, making more channels available.",
      "\"Initially, channels like Star began showing reruns of American shows like Baywatch and The Bold and The Beautiful. But new entrants like Zee TV and Sony began producing original shows to cater to the Indian audience,\" says Harsh Taneja, an associate professor of media at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.",
      "Producers often adapted Western shows for Indian audiences by importing format Bibles -  guidelines outlining story structure - and modifying them for local context, he says. So, a show like CID often featured plots that closely resembled those of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, an American crime drama.",
      "The 1990s and 2000s saw television become a staple in households as people's spending power grew. Many homes had not just one but two televisions, leading producers to create content targeting different age groups, says Mr Taneja.",
      "Interestingly, the target audience of CID, when it was released in the 1990s, was children in the age group of six to 14. After CID, several other crime-focussed shows began to populate channels - from Crime Patrol to Savadhan India. But one could say that it was CID that created an appetite for crime shows among viewers.",
      "Priya Ravi, 40, remembers waiting eagerly for each CID episode to air when she was a child. She confesses that it was the show that made her push her parents to get a television set at their home.",
      "\"Episodes used to air twice a week, and initially I used to go to a friend's place to watch them. But then I convinced my parents to get a TV so that I could watch the episodes at home. I was so happy the day the TV arrived,\" Ms Ravi says.",
      "She says that though she won't watch the new CID episodes, she'll definitely encourage her two children, aged seven and nine, to watch them.",
      "\"If the show remains as clean as it was back in the day, I think it's a great way to introduce children to some of the realities of life and make them vigilant about their safety and surroundings,\" she says.",
      "\"I'm looking forward to the heroic trio making a comeback.\"",

      "Fast-forward 25 years and women carrying individually wrapped portions of the fermented cassava couscous still walk across Abidjan, Ivory Coast's biggest city, selling this now Unesco-recognised dish.",
      "An alternative to rice, it's hard to find any hospitality venue in the Ivory Coast that doesn't serve atti\u00e9k\u00e9. From the most basic eateries to the fanciest restaurants and even on the beach, it's everywhere.",
      "Atti\u00e9k\u00e9's popularity has spilled over the country's borders, and it is now found across Africa, especially in French-speaking countries.",
      "It's also very popular in neighbouring Ghana and my home country Sierra Leone, where they have some fairly unorthodox serving suggestions.",
      "The distinctive tangy taste of atti\u00e9k\u00e9 comes from the cassava tubers mixed with fermented cassava, which gives it its unique flavour and texture.",
      "The cassava is grated, dried and then steamed before serving.",
      "Filling and versatile, Ivorian chef R\u014dze Traore describes its texture as \"fluffy yet granular, similar to couscous\".",
      "Mr Traore adds that the slight tanginess of atti\u00e9k\u00e9 provides a unique depth to meals, perfectly balancing spicy or savoury sauces.",
      "For Paule-Odile B\u00e9k\u00e9, an Ivorian chef who competed on the UK TV programme Masterchef: The Professionals, \"sour, zingy and sweet\" are the words that come to mind when she describes the taste of atti\u00e9k\u00e9.",
      "Gluten-free and available in different grain sizes, the finest is often the most expensive. Some places even sell red atti\u00e9k\u00e9, which has been soaked in palm oil.",
      "Eaten with a variety of dishes, the most popular version is with chargrilled chicken or fish, a simple, spicy tomato-based sauce and a salsa of chopped tomatoes and onions.",
      "It was one of the first dishes I cooked for my husband when we met 15 years ago. He liked it so much, he suggested we open a restaurant serving just that.",
      "Atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is unpretentious, although traditionally reserved for special occasions like weddings and birthdays, people now eat it every day.",
      "Ms B\u00e9k\u00e9, who comes from a family of atti\u00e9k\u00e9-makers, explained some nuances.",
      "\"Our attieke will be a bit more yellow than some other regions due to the proximity of the sea,\" she said.",
      "A native of Jacqueville, a small coastal town where atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is made, she features it heavily in the menu of her New York supper clubs.",
      "Although I left Ivory Coast at the age of 14 as civil unrest broke out, I have never been able to let go of atti\u00e9k\u00e9.",
      "In London, I'd travel miles to Congolese shops to excavate bags of atti\u00e9k\u00e9 from the permafrost at the bottom of a chest freezer, stockpiling it for dinner guests I could evangelise.",
      "When I moved to Nigeria, I mandated relatives to bring me care packages from Abidjan or Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital.",
      "It was one of the first things I looked for when I moved to Johannesburg in South Africa three months ago.",
      "Where to find it is always one of the first questions I have for any Ivorians I meet outside Ivory Coast.",
      "Obviously it tastes delicious, but it's hard to describe what makes atti\u00e9k\u00e9 so special.",
      "Ivorian chef Charlie Koffi says \"atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is a dish that symbolizes togetherness\".",
      "Like injera, the fermented Ethiopian pancake, or thieboudienne, Senegal's rice-and-fish dish, atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is best enjoyed in a group.",
      "Across Ivory Coast, friends and family will gather around a big plate, eating with their hands and washing it down with a cold beer or soft drink.",
      "For me, it's also a reminder of a childhood which was cut short. I was just 13 years old when on Christmas Eve 1999, as I waited for my friends to come round for a play date, a military coup rocked Ivory Coast.",
      "As soldiers drove through the city shooting in the air and telling people to head indoors, my little sister and I clung to each other in a hallway, the only windowless space in our house.",
      "Our mum was stuck in town, unable to join us.",
      "Six months later, my mum sent us to the UK to live with our grandmother, fearing the rising political tension in the run-up to the 2000 presidential elections would result in further unrest.",
      "Just two years later, the country's first civil war would break out, and it would be another 15 years before I was able to return to my childhood home.",
      "But even when I couldn't return to Babi (Abidjan's nickname), atti\u00e9k\u00e9 was always a way to connect to the place we had left behind.",
      "Even though I'm not Ivorian, like many of the expatriates and economic migrants who moved to the country during the prosperous 1990s, Ivory Coast is home.",
      "We all speak Nouchi, the French slang that peppers Ivorian music and the streets of its cities, and we all eat atti\u00e9k\u00e9.",
      "Ivory Coast has a way of making people feel at home, and atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is part of that.",
      "When I finished university, I returned to Ivory Coast for a year to work for an international NGO.",
      "On our way back from one of our assignments in the west of the country, an Ivorian colleague explained that traditionally, atti\u00e9k\u00e9 was mostly eaten with kedjenou, a rich, smoky stew made with tomatoes, onions, and chillies.",
      "This is slow-cooked with local chicken or game in a clay pot over a wood fire, infusing the dish with a deep, flavourful essence.",
      "He claimed that it was only after the French arrived that Ivorians started serving atti\u00e9k\u00e9 with grilled fish and chicken.",
      "This is not something that I've been able to confirm, but it always rang true.",
      "Ivorians, although fiercely proud of their culture, have always been open to foreign influences in their cuisine and many regional dishes have become local staples.",
      "Now that atti\u00e9k\u00e9 has been added to the list of intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding, perhaps more people outside the region will become aware of this delicious treat.",

      "For 12 years Sophie had been experiencing painful periods, weight gain, depression and fatigue.",
      "She had been diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal condition that affects about one in 10 women, but she struggled to get medical help.",
      "She felt her only option was to take her health into her own hands, and it was at this moment that Kourtney Simmang came up on her recommended page on Instagram.",
      "Kourtney promised to treat the \u201croot cause\u201d of PCOS, even though researchers have not yet identified one. She offered customers laboratory tests, a \u201chealth protocol\u201d- a diet and supplement plan - and coaching for $3,600 (\u00a32,800). Sophie signed up, paying hundreds of dollars more for supplements through Kourtney\u2019s affiliate links.",
      "Dr Jen Gunter, a gynaecologist and women\u2019s health educator, said Kourtney wasn\u2019t qualified to order the tests she was selling, and that they had limited clinical use.",
      "After nearly a year Sophie\u2019s symptoms hadn\u2019t improved, so she gave up Kourtney\u2019s cure.",
      "\u201cI left the programme with a worse relationship to my body and food, [feeling] that I didn\u2019t have the capacity to improve my PCOS,\u201d she said.",

      "The BBC World Service tracked the most-watched videos with a \u201cPCOS\u201d hashtag on TikTok and Instagram during the month of September and found that half of them spread false information.",
      "Up to 70% of women with PCOS worldwide have not been diagnosed, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and even when diagnosed, women struggle to find treatments that work.",
      "\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a gap in medicine, predators take advantage,\u201d said Dr Gunter.",
      "The main false or misleading claims shared by these influencers include:",

      "There is no evidence that highly restricted calorie diets have any positive effect, and the keto diet may make symptoms worse. Birth control pills do not cause PCOS and in fact help many women, though they don\u2019t work for everyone. There is no known root cause for PCOS and there is no cure.",

      "A spokesperson for Meta said user content on women\u2019s health is allowed on the platform with \u201cno restrictions\u201d. The company said it consulted with third parties to debunk health misinformation.",

      "Nearly all mentioned Tallene Hacatoryan who has more than two million followers across TikTok and Instagram.",
      "A registered dietician, Tallene sells supplements at $219 (\u00a3172) and access to her weight loss app for $29 (\u00a323) a month. She warns people against pharmaceuticals such as the birth control pill, or the diabetes drug, metformin, both of which have been found to be helpful for many women with PCOS.",
      "Instead she encourages her audience to heal \u201cnaturally\u201d, with her supplements. She puts a lot of emphasis on weight and what she calls \u201cPCOS belly\u201d, referring to fat around the abdomen.",

      "Amy said her GP had offered her hormonal birth control to manage her symptoms, but didn\u2019t have any other ideas for treatment. She was told to come back if in future she wanted to get pregnant.",
      "Dr Gunter said this is a vulnerable patient group that may struggle with feelings of helplessness without access to treatment. She said misinformation often caused patients to delay seeking medical help, and that this could lead to the development of further conditions, such as type 2 diabetes.",
      "In Nigeria, Medlyn, a medical student, is trying to tackle some of the shame surrounding PCOS. After trying diets and supplements to no avail, she now encourages other women to consult with their doctors and embrace evidence-based treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re diagnosed with PCOS it comes with so much stigma. People think you\u2019re lazy, you don\u2019t look after yourself, that we can\u2019t get pregnant,\u201d she said. \u201cSo nobody wants to date you, nobody wants to marry you.\u201d",

      "Police say Thompson was targeted in a pre-planned killing, for which they do not yet have a motive.",
      "Investigators are using surveillance photos, bullet casings with cryptic messages written on them, and the suspect's movements to track him down. They are also working with the FBI and authorities in other states as the search expands beyond New York.",
      "Here's what we know about the suspect and the investigation.",
      "What lines are police chasing?",
      "Police are working with \"a lot of leads\", said former FBI special agent Michael Tabman. On Friday, the FBI offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Police have put together more than 200 images of the suspect from his arrival in New York until he fled Midtown Manhattan after shooting Thompson, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.",

      "A hostel receptionist reportedly told police that the photo was taken when she asked him to show his face, in a flirtatious moment.",
      "The man was staying at the hostel on the Upper West Side in New York, where he reportedly used a fake New Jersey license as identification. Police say they have executed a search warrant at the hostel.",
      "Authorities have also been doing a \"full sweep\" of Central Park - a 2.5 mile (4km) long and 0.5 miles (0.8km) wide area in the heart of the city - and on Friday found a backpack they believe the suspect was carrying at the time of the attack. It has been sent for forensic testing, CBS reports.",
      "Officials are also attempting to make use of DNA evidence, including a water bottle and candy wrapper from the crime scene, as well as a Starbucks coffee cup, that they believe are linked to the suspect.",
      "A mobile phone was also discovered in an alley along the suspect's escape route.",
      "So far, fingerprints found left behind have been unusable for identification, police said.",

      "New York Police Department (NYPD) Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said on Friday that the suspect arrived in the city on a bus that originated from Atlanta, though it's unclear where he caught the bus along its route.",
      "He then took a cab to the vicinity of the Hilton, the hotel where he would later kill Thompson, and spent about 30 minutes there before heading to the hostel.",
      "At the hostel he had two roommates but neither saw his face as he wore his mask while he was around them, Mr Kenny said.",
      "The suspect left the hostel early on Wednesday, returned to the vicinity of the Hilton and stopped at a Starbucks.",
      "Thompson was shot at around 06:45 EST (11:45 GMT).",

      "How did the shooting and escape happen?",
      "The shooting took place in a busy part of Manhattan close to Times Square and Central Park. Thompson had been scheduled to speak at an investor conference later in the day.",
      "According to police, the suspect - who was clad in his mask and light brown or cream-coloured jacket - appeared to be waiting for Thompson for five minutes outside the Hilton hotel where he was expected to speak.",
      "Thompson, who arrived on foot, was shot in the back and leg, and was pronounced dead about half an hour later at a local hospital.",
      "The NYPD said that the suspect's weapon appeared to jam, but that he was able to quickly fix it and keep shooting.",
      "CCTV footage appears to show the gunman had fitted a suppressor, also known as a silencer, to the weapon.",
      "Investigators reportedly believe the firearm is a BT Station Six 9, a weapon which is marketed as tracing its roots back to pistols used in World War Two.",
      "Police have reportedly visited gun stores in Connecticut to try to determine where the weapon was purchased.",
      "After the shooting, video shows the suspect fleeing the scene on foot. Officials say he later got on an e-bike, which he rode toward Central Park.",
      "Police believe he left New York, possibly on a bus headed for Atlanta, Georgia, sources familiar with the matter have told CBS News.",
      "Atlanta police released a statement on Friday confirming they are helping New York authorities in the investigation.",
      "Three words written on bullet casings",
      "Investigators have so far not identified a motive in the killing, but they are focusing in part on words written in Sharpie on bullet casings discovered at the scene of the crime.",
      "The words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were discovered on the casings.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 19:57:23 GMT",
    "summary": "A court ruling follows intelligence allegations of Russian interference promoting a far-right candidate.",
    "story": [
      "Forty-eight hours before Romanians were due to vote in a presidential election run-off, the whole process was scrapped because of an unprecedented ruling by the constitutional court.",
      "The court's decision to annul the first round came after a far-right independent candidate, Calin Georgescu, came out of almost nowhere to lead the first round two weeks ago amid allegations of Russian interference.",
      "Georgescu has condemned the ruling as a coup and Romania may have to wait months to vote again.",
      "Why this decision matters",
      "Romania is a key Nato member on its eastern flank and shares a long border with Ukraine.",
      "It is not the first Eastern European state to fend off Russia's hybrid war, and the constitutional court has ruled that intelligence revelations of Russian meddling are sufficiently serious to put the presidential vote on hold.",
      "Moldova's recent presidential vote was held amid alleged Russian interference and voter fraud, and across the Black Sea in Georgia, the pro-Western opposition says contested elections there were hit by Kremlin meddling.",
      "Why has the vote been annulled?",
      "Opinion polls were almost neck and neck going into Sunday's race. Almost 19 million Romanians were eligible to choose between Calin Georgescu and liberal mayor and former TV journalist Elena Lasconi.",
      "Latest polls even gave Lasconi the edge in the run-off.",
      "But then on Wednesday Romania's outgoing President Klaus Iohannis declassified intelligence documents from the supreme council for national defence suggesting that almost 800 Tiktok accounts created by a \"foreign state\" in 2016 were suddenly activated last month to full capacity, backing Georgescu.",
      "Another 25,000 TikTok accounts had become active only two weeks before the first round.",
      "Romanian foreign intelligence said Russia was the \"enemy state\" involved and had engaged in hybrid attacks including tens of thousands of cyber attacks and other sabotage.",
      "Domestic intelligence put Georgescu's sudden surge in popularity down to a \"highly organised\" and \"guerilla\" social media campaign\" that involved identical messaging and social media influencers.",
      "TikToks promoting him were not marked as election content, violating Romania's laws, it said, while one account paid out $381,000 (\u00a3300,000) in the space of a month to users who pushed Georgescu's candidacy, while he said he had not paid anything for his campaign.",
      "That decision to declassify intelligence documents changed everything.",
      "Judges from the constitutional court met on Friday to consider a large number of requests to annul the first round.",
      "It was a complete about-turn from a decision four days before that approved the initial 24 November vote after a complete recount of 9.4 million votes.",
      "What does the ruling say?",
      "In its single-page judgement, the constitutional court says that in order to ensure the fairness and legality of the electoral process it has unanimously decided to annul the entire vote and the government must establish a new date for a re-run.",
      "The court says cites its role under the constitution \"to guard the observance of the procedure\" of presidential elections.",
      "It stresses the decision is final and binding.",
      "The president in Romania wields considerable power as commander-in-chief of the armed forces and with the task of appointing the prime minister.",
      "Who is Calin Georgescu?",
      "Calin Georgescu, who calls himself a university teacher, was a relative unknown in the presidential race.",
      "He denies he is a fan of Vladimir Putin, although he sees the Russian leader as a \"patriot and a leader\" and wants to put an end to political and military aid to Ukraine.",
      "\"Zero. Everything stops,\" he told the BBC's Sarah Rainsford. \"I have to take care just about my people. We have a lot of problems ourselves,\" in words that reflect his Romania-first stance.",
      "He says while Romania should remain in international organisations such as the EU and Nato, it must end its \"subservient\" role.",
      "He also condemns allegations that Russia was behind his electoral success as intelligence \"lies\".",
      "A 62-year-old agricultural engineer by profession, he held high-ranking civil service jobs years ago at Romania's environment and foreign ministries.",
      "He is also a conspiracy theorist who believes Man never landed on the Moon and the Covid-19 pandemic never happened, despite the seven million deaths worldwide, reported by the World Health Organization.",

      "A pair of iconic ruby slippers that were worn by Judy Garland in \"The Wizard of Oz\" \u2014 and stolen from a museum nearly two decades ago \u2014 fetched $28 million in an auction Saturday.",
      "Robert Wilonsky, a vice president with the Dallas-based auction house, told CBS News in an email that, with the buyer's premium \u2014 a commission that the buyer pays \u2014 the slippers sold for a total of $32.5 million.",
      "Heritage Auctions had estimated that the slippers would fetch $3 million or more. Online bidding opened last month and by Friday had reached $1.55 million, or $1.91 million including the buyer's premium, Wilonsky said. Over 800 people were tracking the slippers, and the company's\u00a0web page for the auction\u00a0had hit nearly 43,000 page views by Thursday, he said.",
      "As Rhys Thomas, author of the book, \"The Ruby Slippers of Oz,\" puts it, the sequined shoes from the beloved 1939 musical have seen \"more twists and turns than the Yellow Brick Road.\"",
      "They were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case.",
      "Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota, wasn't publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023. He pleaded guilty in October 2023. Martin admitted he used a small sledgehammer to break into the museum. He then used the tool to crack the case the slippers were in and take them. He said he didn't hear any alarm. He took off in his car and kept them in a trailer adjacent to his home.",
      "He was in a wheelchair and on supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",
      "His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin, who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was attempting to pull off \"one last score\" after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence \u2014 a person who buys stolen goods \u2014 later told him the rubies were just glass, DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn't specify how.",
      "The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He's scheduled to go on trial in January and hasn't entered a plea, though his attorney has said he's not guilty.",
      "The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael Shaw, who had loaned them to the museum. They were one of several pairs that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to click her heels three times and repeat, \"There's no place like home.\"",
      "Among those bidding was the Judy Garland Museum. The city of Grand Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival to supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to help the museum purchase the slippers.",

    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 13:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Anthem will reverse a policy that would have capped insurance coverage for anesthesia after objections from doctors and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",

      "At least 364 pertussis infections were reported to health authorities last week, according to figures published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, marking the worst Thanksgiving week for whooping cough in recent decades.",
      "This tops the previous Thanksgiving record of 228 cases of pertussis which were reported for the week ending Nov. 27, 2010. That year there were 27,550 cases reported by the end of 2010, below the 28,167 already tallied so far this year.",
      "Thanksgiving usually sees a slowdown in cases reported across most diseases, because of delays in testing and reporting around the holiday as well as changes in people going to the doctor.",

After seeing lower numbers of reported cases in the past few years \u2014 during and after the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 nationally, pertussis is now returning to pre-pandemic trends. Ohio is no different,\" a spokesperson for Ohio's health department said in a statement.",
      "The Ohio spokesperson said this year's increase remained \"consistent with some years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,\" and has yet to top the total number of cases reported in 2013.",
      "While total cases nationwide remain lower than some previous records, the pace of weekly reported cases reached 577 ahead of Thanksgiving \u2014 more than 10 times the same time last year, and the worst in at least a decade.",
      "Health officials have cited a variety of factors for this year's wave of whooping cough cases, including gaps in immunity from vaccination or prior infection and the switch to safer but less effective vaccines in the 1990s.",
      "\"We have to acknowledge that our vaccination rates, in Montgomery County for school-age children, are low. They've decreased since the pandemic, and they're lower than the state of Ohio, and lower than the United States as well,\" said Dr. Becky Thomas, medical director of the health department for Ohio's Montgomery County.",
      "Within Ohio, Montgomery County makes up the largest share of cases reported in recent months, despite not having the most people in the state.",
      "Around 63% of their cases have been in schoolchildren and 12% are in daycares, Thomas said. The department often finds out about outbreaks first from school nurses, warning of large numbers of kids calling out sick with whooping cough.",
      "Thomas said doctors have been seeing high pertussis case counts for months, larger than the wave they saw last year.",
      "\"We had an increase in cases last fall, but nothing compared to this fall. And when we first started noticing a really significant increase was about the time that kids went back to school, so about the middle of August,\" said Thomas.",
      "Thomas said that the vast majority of reported cases in the county have said they were vaccinated for pertussis, though it is unclear if everyone was up-to-date on the shots. A third of cases have been in teens, who are recommended to have gotten a booster dose by age 12.",
      "\"We have specific data on vaccination records for entering seventh graders that shows those vaccination rates for that tetanus, whooping cough vaccine that they should have entering school are decreased,\" said Thomas.",
      "This year's whooping cough surge also comes as health departments are bracing for the return of an expected wave of COVID-19 and flu infections this winter.",
      "\"Whooping cough isn't the only respiratory illness that we're concerned about. So we're encouraging people to stay home when they're sick, practice good hand hygiene, get their health care provider if they need to if they're symptoms are worsening or severe, and of course get vaccinated,\" said Jennifer Wentzel, the county health department's commissioner.",

    "story": [
      "This year's winter surge of influenza and COVID-19 has yet to arrive for most of the country, data published this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, with trends so far a fraction of what they were at this time last year.",
      "\"COVID-19 activity remains low and is stable in most areas. Seasonal influenza activity is increasing slightly among children but remains low nationally,\" the CDC said this week, in its weekly report on data about the two viruses.",
      "The agency's updates are usually published every week by Friday, but were delayed until after the weekend because of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A return to normal for flu?",
      "By this time last year, data tracking outpatient visits to places like emergency rooms and doctor's offices for the flu had already climbed above the agency's baseline for the season. This year's latest report suggests flu cases are only now starting to cross that threshold.",
      "\"We're maybe slightly later than last year, and maybe quite a bit later than the year before, but those years were unusually early,\" said University of North Carolina epidemiology professor Justin Lessler, a top expert in the CDC-backed network of disease forecasters.",
      "Lessler said this year's figures look \"much closer to about where you'd expect a normal flu season to be\" before the COVID-19 pandemic, when measures to curb the outbreak scrambled seasonal patterns of flu and other respiratory germs.",
      "Compared with last year, rates of weekly flu hospitalizations are around five times lower. Emergency room visits with flu from school-age kids have accelerated, the CDC's data shows, but remain less than a third of what they were at this time last year.",
      "One big factor that could be affecting the figures this year is immunity in the population from the last two waves of influenza, alongside vaccination.",
      "\"We have had two fairly substantial seasons, which could be driving this delay. Of course the question is, does that mean we're having a delay, or a milder season. That's really kind of uncertain at this point,\" said epidemiologist Shaun Truelove, associate scientist at Johns Hopkins University's public health school.",
      "Modeling of this year's flu season gathered from different experts make different assumptions about what the country's flu immunity looks like, as they try to play out different scenarios of how this year's flu season might look like.",
      "Truelove, who also helps lead the CDC-funded disease forecasting network, also thinks that this year could mark a \"return to normal\" for flu.",
      "\"That being said, flu is never consistent. We get early seasons and late seasons. So it's hard to say exactly what that means, and everything's a bit weird post-pandemic, in terms of scale and timing,\" said Truelove.",
      "Watching for another COVID-19 wave",
      "Several COVID-19 trends that the CDC tracks also remain below what was recorded at this time in 2023. This is a contrast with previous summer waves of the virus, which have only dipped slightly into the fall before picking up again during the winter.",
      "COVID-19 emergency room visits are \"low\" or \"minimal\" in nearly all states, after this year's late summer wave of the virus. Levels of the virus in wastewater are \"minimal\" in all regions, compared to \"high\" levels around this time last year.",
      "\"Does that mean that there was enough immunity built up in that summer wave that we're going to not see a winter wave? Does it mean the winter wave is going to come, but be a little bit later and maybe a little smaller,\" said Lessler.",
      "Both Truelove and Lessler said one major \"data gap\" making comparisons to previous seasons challenging has been the lapse in nationwide COVID-19 hospitalization data during the summer surge.",
      "A pandemic-era emergency requirement for health care providers to report COVID-19 hospitalizations lapsed earlier this year, and only recently resumed under a new rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Other factors muddying the figures include changes to how people test and seek care for COVID-19 infections.",
      "Another big unknown is the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most circulating variants right now are a medley of closely related variants like XEC and KP.3.1.1.",
      "\"We don't know, like we do for flu, what the average pace of COVID's evolution away from our immune system will be, when it settles down,\" Lessler said.",
      "Early data released last month by researchers at The Ohio State University found XEC looked to be more infectious compared with the parent variant it shares upstream with KP.3.1.1, but not significantly more than its siblings.",
      "\"I actually have thought it had settled down a bit, after this year. We'll see what I think after the season's done. But right now, I'm a little less sure,\" he said.",
      "Other respiratory germs on the rise",
      "While COVID-19 and flu remain at unusually low levels nationwide, rates of at least other germs that spread through coughs and sneezes remain elevated.",
      "CDC's data on emergency room visits from the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, sometimes called \"walking pneumonia,\" have increased in recent weeks especially in babies.",
      "Cases in this year's wave of pertussis, or whooping cough, are also continuing to accelerate in several states around the country.",
      "The agency tallied 577 infections of pertussis nationwide for the week ending Nov. 23, around 33% higher than last week's count. That's higher than the peak of 2014's record pertussis wave, which reached 326 weekly infections reported in late December.",
      "Ohio remains the state with the most cases of whooping cough this past week, after 66 infections with pertussis were reported.",
      "The CDC's \"acute respiratory illness\" metric, which lumps together levels of patients showing up in emergency rooms with a broad array of cough and cold illnesses including influenza and whooping cough, tallies 14 states with \"moderate\" levels including Ohio.",

    "summary": "Feds find 11 kids illegally employed for at least 4 years at Seaboard Triumph Foods facility in Sioux City, Iowa.",
    "story": [
      "Federal investigators found nearly a dozen children to be working dangerous, overnight shifts at Seaboard Triumph Foods' pork processing plant in Sioux City, Iowa, the Department of Labor announced.",
      "Employed by Guymon, Oklahoma-based sanitation contractor Qvest, 11 kids allegedly used corrosive cleaners to sanitize head splitters, jaw pullers, bandsaws, neck clippers and other equipment at the Seaboard Triumph Foods facility from at least September 2019 through September 2023, the DOL stated in a news release\u00a0on Friday.",
      "Federal law\u00a0prohibits\u00a0minors from working in meat processing due to an increased risk of injury.",
      "Seaboard Foods is among the nation's biggest pork producers. In addition to Iowa, Seaboard Foods, a division of Seaboard Corporation, has operations in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah, and in Mexico, according to the company's website.",
      "\"These findings illustrate Seaboard Triumph Foods' history of children working illegally in their Sioux City facility since at least September 2019. Despite changing sanitation contractors, children continued to work in dangerous occupations at this facility,\" Michael Lazzeri, the Midwest regional administrator with the DOL's Wage and Hour division, stated in the release.",
      "Qvest must pay $171,919 in child labor civil monetary penalties and take steps to prevent it from illegally hiring minors again.",
      "Qvest and Seaboard did not return requests for comment.",
      "Still, children under 18 illegally employed in dangerous jobs in meat and poultry slaughtering and processing operations is not unique in the industry or to the Seaboard Foods plant in Sioux Falls.",
      "Seaboard in September 2023 contracted Fayette Janitorial Services for sanitation work at its facility. After taking over the plant's sanitation services contract, Fayette allegedly rehired some of the children previously employed by Qvest, with the Somerville, Tennessee-based contractor earlier this year found to be employing nine minors at the Sioux City plant, the DOL alleged.",
      "Fayette also allegedly hired 15 children as young as 13 at a Perdue Farms processing plant in Accomac, Virginia, where a 14-year-old was severely injured. Perdue terminated its contract with Fayette before the DOL's court filing, the company said.",
      "Are migrant kids cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses?",
      "The development is part of an ongoing probe into whether migrant kids are cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses. It also comes less than a year after the government fined another sanitation services provider $1.5 million for employing more than 100 kids \u2014 \u00a0ages 13 to 17\u00a0\u2014 at 13 meat processing plants in eight states.",
      "The DOL launched its investigation after a published report detailed migrant kids working overnight for contractors in poultry processing facilities on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. A New York Times Magazine\u00a0story\u00a0last December detailed children cleaning blood, grease and feathers from equipment with acid and pressure hoses.",
      "The Times'\u00a0account\u00a0included details of a 14-year-old boy who was maimed while cleaning a conveyor belt in a deboning area at a Perdue slaughterhouse in rural Virginia. The eighth grader was among thousands of Mexican and Central American children who have crossed the border on their own to work in dangerous jobs.",
      "But it's not only migrant children tasked with illegal and dangerous work. A 16-year-old high school student, Michael Schuls, died last summer after getting\u00a0trapped in a machine at a Wisconsin sawmill.",
      "From an elevated waterslide at a Jacksonville, Florida, beach park to a sawmill in Clarkrange, Tennessee, federal investigators are finding children across the country working illegal hours and performing risky, unlawful tasks. In May, federal investigators found a 13-year-old girl allegedly working up to 60 hours a week on an assembly line in Luverne, Alabama.",
      "More recently, the DOL found a Grand Rapids, Michigan, window cleaning company had illegally hired three kids to clean residential windows and gutters, and to install Christmas lights, with one requiring surgery after suffering serious injuries after falling from a roof. Another DOL case resolved last month involved children operating and cleaning a meat grinder and driving motor vehicles to deliver orders for a pizza restaurant in Iron River, Wisconsin.",
      "The DOL's Wage and Hour division oversaw 736 investigations uncovering child labor violations affecting 4,030 children in fiscal 2024, the agency stated.",
      "In addition to the federal government, the state of Massachusetts recently took aim at companies violating child labor laws, citing an operator of dozens of Burger King franchise locations across the state for allegedly scheduling minors to work more than the legally allowed hours.

    "summary": "An appeals court judge wrote that the law that would force a sale or ban of TikTok \"survive[s] constitutional scrutiny.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court upheld a law that will ban TikTok in the U.S. in the coming months if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell its stake in the app, dealing another setback to the widely popular video-sharing service in its battle with the federal government.",
      "A panel of three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously sided with the Justice Department in declining to review the petition for relief from TikTok and ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, saying the law is constitutional.",
      "\"We conclude the portions of the Act the petitioners have standing to challenge, that is the provisions concerning TikTok and its related entities, survive constitutional scrutiny,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote in the majority opinion. \"We therefore deny the petitions.\"",
      "Congress approved\u00a0a foreign assistance package in April that included provisions giving TikTok nine months to sever ties with ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, and it is set to take effect on Jan. 19, with the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in office, but reversed his position during the presidential campaign and vowed to \"save\" the app. He takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Lawmakers and national security officials have long had suspicions about TikTok's ties to China. Officials from both parties have warned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to spy on and collect data from its roughly 170 million American users or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content. The concern is warranted, they have argued, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",
      "The appeals court's decision tees up a fight at the Supreme Court over the law's ultimate fate. The parties asked the judges to make a decision by Friday so there is enough time for the high court to review the case before the law takes effect. The justices could agree to hear the case and pause the law while they consider the legal arguments, or let the appeals court's ruling stand as the final word.",
      "TikTok expects the law will be overturned by the Supreme Court, according to spokesperson Michael Hughes, who argued the law is based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "The Justice Department, meanwhile, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Today's decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"As the D.C. Circuit recognized, this act protects the national security of the United States in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. The Justice Department is committed to defending Americans' sensitive data from authoritarian regimes that seek to exploit companies under their control.\"",
      "The court's decision",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Ginsburg wrote in his opinion. \"Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized the decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Ginsburg said. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "The D.C. Circuit found that the government's national-security justifications for banning TikTok \u2014 to counter China's efforts to collect Americans' data and limit its ability to manipulate content covertly on the platform \u2014 are \"wholly consistent\" with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"The government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.\"",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China committee, praised the decision, calling it \"a loss for the Chinese Community Party,\" while also expressing optimism about the app's future in the U.S.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\" Moolenaar said in a statement.",
      "The House China committee spearheaded the bipartisan effort to pass the law.",
      "The legal arguments",
      "TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge in May that called the legislation \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "\"In reality, there is no choice,\" the petition said, adding that a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\"",
      "The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",
      "During oral arguments in September, the appeals panel appeared skeptical of TikTok's argument that free expression outweighs national security concerns, but the three judges were also critical of the government's stance.",
      "TikTok's lawyer Andrew Pincus said the law \"is unprecedented and its effect would be staggering.\"",
      "\"This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,\" Pincus said. \"Notwithstanding the obvious less restrictive alternatives, the government has not come anywhere near satisfying strict scrutiny.\"",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan said, under TikTok's rationale, the U.S. would not be able to ban a foreign country from owning a major media company in the U.S. if the two are at war.",
      "\"Is your submission that Congress can't bar the enemy's ownership of a major media source in the U.S.?\" Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, asked Pincus.",
      "When Pincus noted that news outlets like Politico and Business Insider are owned by foreign entities, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, quickly chimed in: \"But not foreign adversaries.\"",
      "Rao also pushed back on Pincus' argument that Congress did not include any evidence of its claims that TikTok poses a national security risk in the legislation.",
      "\"I know Congress doesn't legislate all the time, but here they did,\" she said. \"They actually passed a law and many of your arguments want us to treat them as an agency. It's strange. It's a very strange framework for thinking about our first branch of government.\"",
      "Attorney Jeffrey Fisher, who represents TikTok creators, compared the restrictions on TikTok to the U.S. government hypothetically banning bookstores from selling books written by foreign authors in conjunction with a foreign government.",
      "\"We're not talking about banning Tocqueville in the United States,\" Rao countered. \"We're talking about a determination by the political branches that there's a foreign adversary that is potentially exercising covert influence in the United States. Very different.\"",
      "Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, expressed skepticism over the notion that the law singles out TikTok.",
      "\"It describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity,\" he said, noting that the company and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns. \"That's the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny said the data on Americans that could be collected through the app \"would be quite valuable to a foreign adversary if it were trying to approach an American to try to have them be an intelligence asset.\" Tenny also spoke about the risk of content manipulation by China.",
      "\"What is being targeted is a foreign company that controls this recommendation engine and many aspects of the algorithm that's used to determine what content is shown to Americans on the app,\" Tenny said.",
      "But Srinivasan said it's Americans' choice to use the app, despite what content may appear.",
      "\"The fact that that's being denied subjects this to serious First Amendment scrutiny,\" he said.",
      "He later added, \"What gives arguable force to the other side's First Amendment argument is that it's not just that the government is targeting curation that occurs abroad. It's the reason the curation occurring abroad is being targeted, and the reason is a concern about the content consequences of that curation in the U.S.\"",

    "story": [
      "The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is surfacing the public's deep frustration with the health insurance industry.",
      "On \"CBS Mornings\" Friday, Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News said the main issue is that health care costs are too high.",
      "\"What we see in this country is that the number one cause of bankruptcy is health-care-related expenses,\" she said.",
      "After groceries, transportation and rent, health care costs are the No. 1 cost of concern to families in this country, according to KFF polling.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Gounder said.",
      "Can the insurance industry do something about high costs?",
      "There are things that can be done, Gounder said.",
      "Under President Barack Obama, for example, there was the Affordable Care Act, which helped to expand health insurance.",
      "\"You had Medicaid, you had the marketplace, then you also have subsidies to make it more affordable to purchase plans on the marketplace,\" Gounder said. \"Those were made even more generous during the pandemic, and then those more generous subsidies were extended under the Inflation Reduction Act under President Biden.\"",
      "But, there is still the challenge of why health care costs are rising.",
      "\"You have efforts to extend coverage and make more people have health care be available, but prices are going up,\" Gounder said.",
      "What could change in U.S. health care look like?",
      "In the U.S., people are faced with both rising health care costs and insurance premiums.",
      "According to a\u00a0KFF poll\u00a0from earlier this year, a quarter of U.S. adults say they've skipped or postponed getting the care they need simply because of the cost.",
      "Compared with other developed countries, the U.S has a different, \"very piecemeal\" approach, Gounder said.",
      "\"Many other countries have what we call socialized medicine,\" Gounder said. \"By the way, Medicare is socialized medicine, and even that socialized medicine is the most expensive in terms of health care for the elderly in the world.\"",
      "Many different proposals have been made to improve the situation, she said, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to negotiate down the price of drugs.",
      "\"We've already seen one round of price negotiations. The incoming administration wants to eliminate the Inflation Reduction Act, at least many of the provisions of that. So whether that will continue, we don't know,\" she said.",
      "There have also been mergers and acquisitions in the health care industry, which means less competition.",
      "\"Biden administration has really been trying to pursue antitrust suits to block some of these,\" Gounder said. \"The Trump administration, the prior administration, tried to make health care pricing more transparent. That was another way of trying to make things better. It's not enough. These are all sort of chipping away at a bigger problem.\"",
      "What you can do if a claim is denied",
      "In posts to social media, doctors are sharing their experiences with more and more claims being denied \u2014 something Gounder is seeing too.",
      "\"What we're also seeing now is increasing use of AI by the insurance companies to deny claims, and then you have competing AIs being developed by health care systems to fight the health insurance AIs,\" she said. \"Me as a doctor, I have to spend a lot of time on the phone with various different companies to try to explain why my patient is in the hospital.\"",
      "If you are finding your claims to be denied, Gounder suggests following a few steps:",
      "Collect all of the paperwork you can to make your case",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 17:05:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, at more than $24 million, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "While Thompson had an in-house security detail during his New York City visit, it wasn't with him at the time of the shooting, according to CNN, which cited a source familiar with UnitedHealthcare's security.",
      "In the wake of the attack, corporate security experts said companies should take time to evaluate their corporate security protocols and beef up protective measures, if necessary, to protect against a variety of threats.",
      "\"My phone has been ringing off hook, with calls in particular coming from health care leaders who are reevaluating their security,\" said Paul Sarnese, a safety and security consultant and former president of the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety (IAHSS).",
      "He said the deadly incident will likely prompt more executives to seek more robust protection. \"This incident will definitely change those executives' minds that might have been reluctant to initiate security protocols. I think they'll be more receptive to executive protection,\" he said.",
      "Too much information",
      "In the wake of Thompson's death, some companies are taking steps to limit publicly available information about their executives. For example, a page on UnitedHealthcare's website about the company's leadership \u2014 where Thompson and other executives' bios were listed \u2014\u00a0no longer exists, and instead redirects to the company's home page.",
      "Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, as well as other insurers have taken similar actions, their websites show.",
      "Medica told the Associated Press Friday that it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons, in addition to removing executives bios' from its website.",
      "\"Although we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Experts say these types of moves are wise.",
      "\"I think we share too much. I don't need to know where you live and that you're married and have three wonderful kids,\" Sarnese said. \"We don't need to advertise to the public where the president and CEO are sitting.\"",
      "While executives across all industries should be evaluating their security postures, healthcare industry professionals have received more threats in recent years as a result of divisiveness that arose around safety protocols, including mask mandates, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sarnese said.",
      "\"Every industry has challenges because there is always going to be somebody who is upset with a service or product or philosophy. But COVID changed everything. We never saw the level of threats we saw during COVID toward healthcare workers and leaders, because of some of the mistrust and misinformation that was out there in the community,\" he said.",
      "\"All the ways things can go wrong\"",
      "Security industry veteran Brittney Blair of K2 Integrity said that online threat monitoring is as essential as physical protection.",
      "More companies are becoming more active in tracking cyber threats, including monitoring the web and dark web.",
      "\"I think people want to take a more proactive approach to making sure they are not in a situation where they're caught off guard or not prepared for that bad thing,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You cannot predict crime, and you can't prevent all of it, but you should be doing as much as you can to make sure you're getting ahead of any possible threat that could be coming your way.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 13:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Anthem will reverse a policy that would have capped insurance coverage for anesthesia after objections from doctors and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",
      "\"This is just the latest in a long line of appalling behavior by commercial health insurers looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,\" said Donald E. Arnold, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"This egregious policy breaks the trust between Anthem and its policyholders who expect their health insurer to pay physicians for the entirety of the care they need.\"",

A separate but related recall involves Marketside Fresh Cut Cucumber Slices sold at 34 Walmart stores in Texas.",

      "People who purchased whole, fresh American/slicer cucumbers on or after October 12 and who aren't sure of their origin should ask the seller if they are part of the recall or throw them out.",
      "Most people infected with salmonella experience diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps, with symptoms usually starting six hours to six days after swallowing the bacteria, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although most recover without treatment within a week, some people, especially the young and the old, may experience more severe illnesses that require treatment or hospitalization.",

      "The Netherlands-based automaker said the hydraulic control unit on the trucks is prone to failure, which can cause the anti-lock brake, electronic stability control and traction control systems to not work properly. Stellantis said regular braking systems are not affected by the defective part and that it's unaware of any related injuries.",
      "The trucks in question are all model years 2017-18 and include the Ram 2500, 3500, 4500 and 5500. The recall includes a total of 317,630 trucks, including a small number of them in Canada, Mexico and elsewhere.",

      "While hiring rebounded last month, the job market overall has been weakening in recent months under the strain of the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy, with the central bank boosting borrowing rates to their highest point in 23 years to combat inflation. It's also taking longer for hundreds of thousands of out-of-work Americans to find new jobs, signaling cracks within a once-hot labor market as employers continue to cope with the impact of higher borrowing costs.",
      "\"After a prior month of hurricanes and worker strikes, we did get a bounce back in the headline payroll numbers plus positive revisions,\" said Bryon Anderson, head of fixed income at Laffer Tengler Investments, in an email. \"Jobs creation may not be as robust as in the past years, but we are not seeing a disaster in the job market. \"",

      "Even so, Americans as a whole have been enjoying unusual job security. This week, the government reported that layoffs fell to just 1.6 million in October, below the lowest levels in the two decades that preceded the pandemic. At the same time, the number of job openings rebounded from a 3 1/2 year low, a sign that businesses are still seeking workers even though hiring has cooled.",
      "The economy grew at a 2.8% annual pace from July through September on healthy spending by consumers. Annual economic growth has topped a decent 2% in eight of the past nine quarters. And inflation has dropped from a 9.1% peak in June 2022 to 2.6% last month.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump wants former lawmaker and auctioneer Billy Long to replace IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he wants ex-congressman Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer, to run the IRS. As a lawmaker, Long co-sponsored legislation that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code.",
      "In making the announcement, Trump praised Long's \"32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the Country.\" He also noted that since leaving Congress in 2023, Long has worked as a business and tax adviser.",
      "While Trump didn't mention the current IRS Commissioner, Danny Werfel, in his announcement, the decision signals the president-elect is likely to replace him with Long after taking office in January, Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Naming Long as the next IRS chief drew both support from conservatives as well as criticism from the left, with Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Tax subcommittee calling it a \"terrible mistake,\" while Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo issued a statement saying he's looking forward to hearing Long's ideas for the tax agency. The fiscally conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation praised Trump's choice, saying Long could help reform the IRS.",
      "Long has recently served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, but, unlike prior IRS commissioners, his background is largely outside of the tax industry, experts noted.",
      "\"This guy is an auctioneer \u2014 that's his expertise,\" Owens noted. \"This is an incredibly unserious choice.\"",
      "Werfel, who was appointed by President Biden, stepped into the role in 2023, with his term set to expire in 2027. Typically, presidents allow IRS commissioners to serve out their term, as Mr. Biden allowed Trump's former IRS appointee, Charles Rettig, to do before naming Werfel to the role.",
      "If the Senate approves his appointment to the IRS, Long would oversee an agency with 85,000 employees and an annual budget exceeding $12 billion.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump campaign declined to comment.",
      "Here's what to know about Long and the IRS.",
      "Who is Billy Long?",
      "Long, who attended the University of Missouri but didn't graduate, described himself on a\u00a0website\u00a0for his congressional run as a \"fourth-generation native of Southwest Missouri.\" He touted his skills as an auctioneer, noting that he had been named the \"best auctioneer in the Ozarks for seven years in a row.\"",
      "Long also worked in real estate and in talk radio, hosting a show on a Missouri AM radio station.",
      "He shuttered his auction firm, Billy Long Auctions, before he was sworn into Congress in 2011, according to a local publication.",
      "What professional experience does Long have with taxes?",
      "As a congressman, Long co-sponsored some tax-related bills, including several efforts to eliminate the estate tax as well as a measure called the Tax Code Termination Act.",
      "That legislation would have wiped out much of the current tax code, replacing it with what the bill called a \"simple and fair system\" that would have applied \"a low rate to all Americans.\" Such flat taxes are considered regressive by many experts because low- and middle-income taxpayers would end up paying a larger share of their incomes than would wealthy Americans.",
      "\"As a business owner, Billy knows first-hand how government regulation and heavy taxes can affect the small businesses that serve as the economic engine of our country,\" his campaign site noted.",
      "While Long isn't an accountant or CPA, he has been involved in tax advising since leaving Congress. In a 2023 podcast, for example, he touted his work helping businesses use the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit that the IRS has\u00a0flagged for its high rate of fraud.",
      "In the podcast, Long also said that when he served as a congressman, he helped make the ERTC easier for businesses to claim, noting that the credit was difficult to qualify for during its first iteration.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "The IRS says the ERTC is aimed at employers who paid wages to workers between March 12, 2020, and January 1, 2022, and that were either suspended by government order during the pandemic or experienced a \"required decline in gross receipts during 2020 or the first three calendar quarters of 2021.\" The credit is also available to startups that began at the end of 2021 and had less than $1 million in revenue.",
      "How does Long's experience compare with prior IRS commissioners?",
      "Long's lack of tax industry experience sets him apart from other recent IRS commissioners.",
      "Werfel, the current IRS chief, has an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in public policy from Duke University as well as a law degree from the University of North Carolina. He's also held a number of government jobs involved in operations and the IRS, including serving as acting commissioner of the IRS from May to December 2013, according to his biography.",
      "Werfel's predecessor, Charles Rettig, who was appointed by President-elect Trump, also held several degrees, including a master's in taxation. Before joining the IRS, Rettig worked as a tax attorney for more than three decades and served as the chairman of the IRS Advisory Council.",
      "What is happening with the IRS now?",
      "Under Werfel, the IRS has expanded audits of wealthy taxpayers and big corporations, clawing back billions in unpaid taxes, efforts that were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The tax agency has also reduced the time it takes consumers to connect with an IRS employee, while also rolling out a free tax filing system called Direct File.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the expanded IRS funding, claiming\u00a0the agency would use the money to hire thousands of new agents to increase audits on middle-class taxpayers.",
      "The Treasury had said that funding could help the IRS add nearly 87,000 full-time workers over 10 years, but the agency didn't specify whether those new workers would be auditors, customer service workers or other types of employees. That figure also represented the total number of employees that could be hired, without calculating the impact of the number of IRS workers who are expected to retire or leave the department over the next several years.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers are expressing concern that, if appointed, Long could disrupt the progress that the IRS has made under Werfel.",
      "Werfel \"has done an excellent job rebuilding the IRS, boosting customer service and enhancing enforcement aimed at wealthy tax evaders,\" Rep. Beyer said in a statement. \"Removing him will clearly signal Trump's intention to make the agency less responsive to the American people, while giving a green light to wealthy tax cheats to evade their fair share of the tax burden.\"",
      "Still, Republican lawmakers expressed support for the pick, such as Senator Crapo, who highlighted \"privacy and security\" issues at the IRS and \"inefficient use of resources.\" He added, \"I look forward to learning more about Mr. Long's vision for the agency.\"",

      "Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was shot to death Wednesday outside the New York Hilton Midtown in Manhattan, where the company was hosting an investor day.",
      "Thompson, 50, was\u00a0named\u00a0CEO of UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group's insurance arm, in April 2021. He first joined UnitedHealth Group in 2004 and had previously served as CEO of the company's government programs, including Medicare and retiree coverage, and community and state programs providing Medicaid and other types of coverage to millions of individuals.",
      "In his most recent role as CEO of UnitedHealthcare, he was responsible for leading growth across the company's global, employer, individual, specialty and government benefits businesses, according to a 2021 company statement announcing his appointment.",
      "\"Brian's experience, relationships and values make him especially well-suited to help UnitedHealthcare improve how health care works for consumers, physicians, employers, governments and our other partners, leading to continued and sustained long-term growth,\" UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said at the time.",
      "Thompson held other positions over his 20 years at the company, including chief financial officer for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual, Community and State and Medicare and Retirement businesses. He also served as the financial controller for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual business and was a director in the company's corporate development division.",
      "A low-key CEO",
      "For a top executive at a $562 billion company that affects how millions of Americans get health care, Thompson kept a relatively low profile. At an investor meeting last year, he outlined UnitedHealth's shift to \"value-based care,\" paying doctors and other caregivers to keep patients healthy, rather than focusing on treating them when they get sick.",
      "\"Health care should be easier for people,\" Thompson said at the time. \"We are cognizant of the challenges. But navigating a future through value-based care unlocks a situation where the \u2026 family doesn't have to make the decisions on their own.\"",
      "In 2023, Thompson earned total compensation of $10.2 million, according to a\u00a0disclosure\u00a0by UnitedHealth Group.",
      "Before joining UnitedHealth Group, Thompson worked as a certified public accountant at accounting firm PwC, according to his biography on networking site LinkedIn. Thompson graduated from the University of Iowa in 1997 with a bachelor's degree in business administration and most recently resided in Maple Grove, Minnesota.",
      "Following the shooting, UnitedHealthcare canceled its Wednesday meeting with Wall Street analysts and investors, which Thompson had been scheduled to attend.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare,\" UnitedHealth Group said in a statement. \"Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him. We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian's family and all who were close to him.\"",
      "On LinkedIn, former colleagues described Thompson as an \"affable\" and \"popular\" leader.",
      "\"BT was whip-smart and affable \u2014 a guy who could grasp the complexities of health care and explain them in simple, relatable terms true to his Iowa upbringing,\" said Matt Burns, who served as vice president of communications at UnitedHealth Group from 2015 to 2018.",
      "Thompson is survived by his wife, Paulette Thompson, and two sons.",
      "\"We are shattered to hear about the senseless killing of our beloved Brian,\" Thompson's wife said in a statement provided to CBS News by her sister. \"Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives. Most importantly, Brian was an incredibly loving father to our two sons and will be greatly missed. We appreciate your well wishes and request complete privacy as our family moves through this difficult time.\"",
      "Minnesota leaders express shock",
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also weighed in on Thompson's death. \"This is a shocking and devastating loss for our whole community. 'Shocking' is the only word I can find at the moment,\" he said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 18:09:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Payments to victims of Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com are the largest yet by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "More than 4 million Americans gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com will soon collectively receive $1.8 billion in refund checks, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced Thursday.",
      "The payments make up the biggest distribution yet from the CFPB's victims relief fund, financed by civil penalties paid by companies that violate consumer protection laws, the agency said.",
      "Checks will be mailed in coming weeks to 4.3 million consumers who were charged illegal advance fees or subjected to allegedly deceptive bait-and-switch advertising by Lexington Law, CreditRepair.com and their parent companies, according to the federal agency.",
      "The CFPB in August 2023 obtained a legal judgment against the credit repair businesses, with a district court ruling the companies had violated a law that prohibits such companies from collecting fees until at least six months after their promised results.",
      "The companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the court ruling, shutting about 80% of their business operations, including telemarketing call centers.",
      "\"Exploited vulnerable consumers\"",
      "\"Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com exploited vulnerable consumers who were trying to rebuild their credit, charging them illegal junk fees for results they hadn't delivered,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra stated in a news release. \"This historic distribution of $1.8 billion demonstrates the CFPB's commitment to making consumers whole, even when the companies that harm them shut down or declare bankruptcy.\"",
      "Since its launch in 2011, the CFPB has distributed more than $3.3 billion to consumers harmed by a range of illegal practices, such as student loan and mortgage relief scams and predatory lending. The victims relief fund allows the CFPB to provide financial relief in cases where direction compensation from the violating company is not possible.",
      "The brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, the CFPB was established after the 2008 financial crisis. Funded by the Federal Reserve, the agency has weathered several legal challenges from opponents. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "Still, the agency's efforts could prove short-lived amid calls from some Republicans to weaken the agency or get rid of it entirely. On Wednesday, billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 among those designated by President-elect Donald Trump to\u00a0front an effort\u00a0to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash regulations and cut government spending \u2014 called for deleting the CFPB, arguing in a\u00a0post\u00a0on social media that there are \"too many duplicative regulatory agencies.\"",
      "When will the refund checks be sent?",
      "Payments will be sent between December and January to eligible consumers harmed by the companies, and those eligible do not need to take any action to receive a check.",
      "Those who think they are eligible but have not received a payment by mid-January can then contact JND Legal Administration at www.cfpb-lexlaw.org. Details about the distribution can be found here.",
      "How big will the payments be?",
      "The CFPB said the payments are based on a pro-rata share of fees paid by consumers to CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law, but that the payments might not cover all the fees they incurred.",
      "If the payments were divided evenly, each person would receive about $419.",
      "\"If funds remain after the distribution is complete, additional checks may be sent to consumers who cashed their initial check. You don't need to take any additional action,\" the agency said.",
      "Can I file a claim?",
      "No, according to the agency. \"There won't be opportunities to file claims for this redress case,\" it said.",
      "Is the refund check taxable?",
      "It's unlikely, because the checks are considered refunds for payments that consumers made to the credit repair companies, rather than taxable income, the CFPB said. \"If you have tax-related questions, however, please contact a tax advisor,\" it added.",

    "story": [
      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and urban and rural governments alike are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties and butt up against wooded bike trails winding through the suburbs. But one of the latest proposals in the area, Plaza 500, would see a 466,000-square-foot facility and adjacent electrical substation built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised jobs and a significant property tax boost. But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",

      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\" Smith said. \"Data centers are not going away.\"",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",
      "\"This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,\" said Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Police Chief Rick Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.",
      "AWS has cultivated relationships with local officials including Keefer and Stokoe, who have both been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks with the company. Some former county commissioners and residents worry that those relationships are too cozy.",
      "Kevin Miller, AWS's vice president of global data centers, said in an interview with the Associated Press that \"our interest is in being a model corporate citizen, to really be partners with those communities.\"",
      "Skepticism of the deals started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while also owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But the latest data center deal struck between Morrow County officials and AWS, which gives the company an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers, again raised eyebrows.",
      "Two former Morrow County Commissioners, Jim Doherty and Melissa Lindsay, pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 14:39:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas rejected a proposed plea agreement between the Justice Department and Boeing that would have settled the U.S. government's claims against the company, after crashes of two 737 Max jetliners that killed 346 people, according to a court order issued Thursday.",
      "In his ruling, Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process and ordered the parties to provide the court with a plan for possible ways forward early next month.",
      "The federal government's proposed agreement with airplane manufacturing giant over the deadly crashes included various provisions, including an admission of guilt to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and a $243.6 million fine \u2014 much less than the billions the families of the victims had requested. The deal would also have required Boeing to spend $455 million on safety programs and to work with an independent monitor who would oversee the company's progress.",
      "Investigators alleged in court records that leading up to the crashes, Boeing deceived federal officials who regulated the planes. In 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, which meant the criminal charge would have been dropped if Boeing had complied with the terms of the deal. But earlier this year, federal prosecutors informed the court that Boeing had not followed through on all of the requirements and intended to move forward with the case.",
      "By July, after weeks of negotiations, Boeing and the Justice Department settled on the proposed plea agreement, prompting an outcry from families of those who died in the crashes. At the time, CBS News reported the deal only covered wrongdoing by Boeing tied to the crashes and did not give the company immunity for other incidents, including a door panel that blew off a Max jetliner during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. According to a Justice Department official, the proposed agreement also did not cover any current or former Boeing officials, only the corporation.",
      "Attorneys for some of the victims' families opposed the deal, arguing the \"rotten\" agreement with the government did not justly remedy the families' claims against Boeing. In court filings, they accused Boeing of more criminality and urged stricter penalties, harsher monitoring and recognition of the lives lost.",
      "In rejecting the plea agreement, the judge took aim at diversity, equity and inclusion considerations that the parties said they would take when hiring an independent monitor. He wrote that he was \"concerned with the Government's shifting and contradictory explanations of how the plea agreement's diversity-and-inclusion provision will practically operate in this case.\"",
      "Judge O'Connor had previously raised this issue and in responsive court filings, the Justice Department defended the language, arguing it predated the Boeing agreement. \"This new language reflected not a change in policy but rather a principle that has always governed the process: that selection of a monitor must be based solely on merit, from the broadest possible pool of qualified candidates,\" they said.",
      "O'Connor ruled Thursday that the language was inappropriate: \"In a case of this magnitude, it is in the utmost interest of justice that the public is confident this monitor selection is done based solely on competency. The parties' DEI efforts only serve to undermine this confidence in the Government and Boeing's ethics and anti-fraud efforts.\"",
      "The judge also wrote that the Justice Department's previous efforts to oversee Boeing's conduct \"failed\" and said the independent monitor provision in the proposed deal did not go far enough to include the court in the process.",
      "\"At this point, the public interest requires the Court to step in. Marginalizing the Court in the selection and monitoring of the independent monitor as the plea agreement does undermines public confidence in Boeing's probation, fails to promote respect for the law, and is therefore not in the public interest,\" O'Connor wrote, \"Accordingly, the Court cannot accept the plea agreement.\"",
      "The Justice Department said it's reviewing the decision. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a statement, Paul Cassell, an attorney for some of the victims' families, told CBS News, \"Judge O'Connor has recognized that this was a cozy deal between the Government and Boeing that failed to focus on the overriding concerns \u2013 holding Boeing accountable for its deadly crime and ensuring that nothing like this happens again in the future.\"",

    "story": [
      "The unemployment rate might be near a historic low, but it's taking longer for hundreds of thousands of out-of-work Americans to find new jobs, signaling cracks within a once-hot labor market as employers continue to cope with the impact of higher borrowing costs.",
      "About 40% of the 7 million people who were out of work in October, or roughly 2.84 million people, have been looking for work for more than 15 weeks, an increase of 20% since a year earlier, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More than half of those job seekers have been on the hunt for new employment for more than 27 weeks, or about half a year.",
      "A drawn-out job search is increasingly common in the labor market today as companies hold off on hiring, especially in some industries such as tech and professional services, ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak told CBS MoneyWatch. It's a far cry from the heady years of 2021 and 2022, when Americans switched jobs at high rates in search of better pay and more fulfilling work, a trend termed \"The Great Resignation.\"",
      "The job market has since weakened under the strain of the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy, with the central bank boosting borrowing rates to their highest point in 23 years to combat inflation, Pollak noted. While inflation has rapidly cooled in the past two years and the Fed began cutting rates in September, the burden of higher borrowing costs has caused consumers to pull back on buying cars and homes, impacting key sectors of the economy, Pollak said.",
      "The job market today reflects \"low hiring, low firing and low job-switching,\" Pollak noted. \"It's this 'big stay'-type of situation \u2014 it's great if you have a job you like, and it's not great if you don't have a job.\"",
      "Employers in October hired 12,000 workers, a jobs report that marked the slowest month for hiring since December 2020. As the anemic number reflects, businesses were weighed down by Hurricanes Milton and Helene as well as labor disputes such as the Boeing machinists strike.",
      "Leading up to the November 5 election, a majority of American held a\u00a0dim view of the strength of the U.S. economy, a factor partly credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory. While much of voters' anger was focused on inflation, the job market also played a role in their views, with the unemployment rate inching up from a pandemic low of 3.4%, and with some workers saying their pay\u00a0hasn't yet caught up to inflation.",

      "\"The broader thread in the labor market has been a slow, gradual cooling, and the question is whether after accounting for these quirks if that will still be evident\" in Friday's data, Pollack noted, referring to businesses recovering after the storms and the labor strikes.",

      "The job market and interest rate cuts",
      "The slowing labor market helped sway the Federal Reserve's decision to begin cutting rates in September, which marked the central bank's\u00a0first rate cut in four years. The Fed followed with a second rate cut in November, and a majority of economists are forecasting another reduction at the central bank's December 18 meeting.",
      "According to BNP Parabas analysts, the job market may be in a period of uncertainty partly due to the election.",

    "summary": "Lawmakers accuse airline executives of gouging travelers with \"junk\" fees. Carriers say they give people options.",
    "story": [
      "Officials from some of the largest U.S. airlines faced intense questioning on Capitol Hill Wednesday over so-called junk fees passengers are being charged for baggage, seat selection and other services.",
      "\"Our investigation found that in 2023 alone, American, Delta, United, Frontier and Spirit collected more than $3 billion in seat fees \u2014 only seat fees. That's not airfare, that's just fees for booking a specific seat in advance, or selecting a slightly better seat,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal in a hearing by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on the impact of such charges on consumers.",
      "\"And that's an increase of 50% from 2018, just six years ago,\" added the Connecticut Democrat, who chairs panel.",
      "Overall, five U.S. carriers collected $12.4 billion in seat fees between 2018 and 2023, in addition to baggage and other charges, according to a report released last week by Democrats on the subcommittee.",
      "Speaking on behalf of their respective airlines at the hearing were Steve Johnson, vice chair and chief strategy officer, American Airlines; Peter Carter, chief external affairs officer, Delta Air Lines; Andrew Nocella, EVP and chief commercial officer, United Airlines; Robert Schroeter, SVP, chief commercial officer, Frontier Airlines; and Matthew Klein, EVP and chief commercial officer, Spirit Airlines",
      "\"Terrible experience\"",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley criticized Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines during the two-hour hearing for bonuses paid to gate employees to charge customers extra fees for large carry-ons. The subcommittee says Spirit and Frontier paid employees $26 million in incentives to strictly enforce airline bag policies in 2022 and 2023.",
      "\"You guys do appreciate that flying on your airlines is a disaster, don't you?\" the Missouri Republican said, adding, \"Flying on your airlines is horrible, it's a terrible experience. I mean, I say this as a father of three young children. But I can't tell you \u2014 nobody enjoys flying on your airlines, it's a disaster.\"",
      "Spirit charges between $15 and $77 for a carry-on bag that won't fit under a seat.",
      "Airlines say that their fee policies are transparent and allow passengers to choose various travel experiences at different price points. Frontier said its incentive program aims to ensure \"that all customers are treated equally and fairly,\" CBS News' Kris Van Cleave reported ahead of the Wednesday hearing.",
      "\"We respectfully disagree with numerous statements and conclusions contained in the report,\" Spirit said.",
      "Asked for his response to the subcommittee's findings, United CEO Scott Kirby told Van Cleave, \"At United at least, we're 100% focused on getting customers to choose to fly United. If you don't want to check a bag, you shouldn't have to pay the implied cost of checking a bag. We're creating options for customers and it's working.\"",
      "Airline fees have been a frequent target of criticism by the Biden administration, all the way up to\u00a0President Joe Biden. A Transportation Department rule that took effect in October\u00a0entitles airline passengers to automatic refunds when flights are canceled or significantly delayed, while also requiring airlines to reveal\u00a0fees\u00a0upfront.",
      "The airline industry is suing to block another regulation requiring more prominent disclosure of baggage and cancellation fees. An appeals court has blocked that rule, and its fate is uncertain under President-elect Donald Trump.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Trump said Atkins, the CEO of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner, was a \"proven leader for common sense regulations.\" In the years since leaving the SEC, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation.",
      "\"He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The commission oversees U.S. securities markets and investments and is currently led by Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry. Gensler, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, announced last month that he would be stepping down from his post on the day that Trump is inaugurated \u2014 Jan. 20, 2025.",
      "Trump, once a crypto skeptic, had pledged to make the U.S. \"the crypto capital of the planet\" and create a \"strategic reserve\" of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is now above $95,000. And shares in crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 70% since the election.",
      "Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, congratulated Atkins in a post on X.",
      "\"We appreciate his commitment to balance in regulating U.S. securities markets and look forward to his fresh leadership at (the SEC),\" Grewal wrote. \"It's sorely needed and cannot come a day too soon.\"",
      "Congressman Brad Sherman, a California Democrat and a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, said he worries Atkins would not sufficiently regulate cryptocurrencies as SEC chair.",
      "\"He'd probably take the position that no cryptocurrency is a security, and hence no exchange that deals with crypto is a securities exchange,\" Sherman said. \"The opportunity to defraud investors would be there in a very significant way.\"",
      "Atkins began his career as a lawyer and has a long history working in the financial markets sector, both in government and private practice. In the 1990s, he worked on the staffs of two former SEC chairmen, Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt.",
      "His work as an SEC commissioner started in 2002, a time when the fallout from corporate scandals at Enron and WorldCom had turned up the heat on Wall Street and its government regulators.",
      "Atkins was widely considered the most conservative member of the SEC during his tenure at the agency and was known to have a strong free-market bent. As a commissioner, he called for greater transparency in and analysis of the costs and benefits of new SEC rules.",
      "He also emphasized investor education and increased enforcement efforts against those who steal from investors over the internet, manipulate markets, engage in Ponzi schemes and other types of fraud.",
      "At the same time, Atkins objected to stiff penalties imposed on companies accused of fraudulent conduct, contending that they did not deter crime. He caused a stir in the summer of 2006 when he said the practice of granting stock options to executives before the disclosure of news that was certain to increase the share price did not constitute insider trading.",
      "U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Atkins has the experience needed to \"restore faith in the SEC.\"",
      "\"I'm confident his leadership will lead to clarity for the digital asset ecosystem and ensure U.S. capital markets remain the envy of the world,\" McHenry posted on X.",
      "Atkins already has some experience working for Trump. During Trump's first term, Atkins was a member of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, an advisory group of more than a dozen CEOs and business leaders who offered input on how to create jobs and speed economic growth.",
      "In 2017, Atkins joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory in the hopes that he would push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for.",

    "story": [
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX, has been picked to serve as NASA's next administrator, President-elect Donald Trump  announced Wednesday.",
      "If confirmed, Isaacman, 41, would be the fifth NASA administrator with spaceflight experience, replacing former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who flew into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in early 1986.",
      "\"I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"... Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman founded the payment processing company later named Shift4 Payments while he was a high school student. He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission \u2014 Inspiration4 \u2014 in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight.",
      "He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk.",
      "He is scheduled to lead another Polaris mission aboard a SpaceX capsule before leading the first crew to space aboard the California rocket builder's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Dates have not been announced for either of those missions, and it's not yet clear what impact Isaacman's selection to lead NASA will have on those flights, whether Isaacman still intends to fly aboard one or both or what sort of influence his friendship with Musk might have on NASA's future direction.",
      "But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"",
      "He said it would be the \"honor of a lifetime to serve in this role and to work alongside NASA's extraordinary team to realize our shared dreams of exploration and discovery.\"",
      "Jim Bridenstine, Nelson's predecessor at the helm of NASA, helped kickstart the agency's Artemis moon program during the first Trump administration.",
      "He said in a statement Wednesday that \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\"",
      "The Isaacman announcement comes as NASA struggles to keep the Artemis program on track amid tight budgets and what the agency's own inspector general calls the \"unsustainable\" costs of NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket.",
      "SpaceX supporters argue the company's more powerful, fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship rocket is the obvious choice for deep space exploration, but the huge rocket is far from operational with just a half-dozen suborbital test flights to its credit.",
      "The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions.",
      "NASA is currently gearing up to launch three NASA astronauts and a Canadian flyer on an SLS-Orion mission \u2014 Artemis 2 \u2014 late next year. But problems with the first Orion's heat shield and other issues threaten to push the Artemis 2 flight into 2026, years past initial expectations.",
      "It's not yet clear when the Artemis 3 mission, the first to carry astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole, might be feasible.",
      "But that flight will feature a lunar lander built by SpaceX, a variant of the company's Starship upper stage. SpaceX has carried out six test flights of the fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship to date, but has not yet put the Starship upper stage into orbit or brought it down for an intact landing.",
      "Given the company's rapid-fire test schedule, most observers believe SpaceX will get the Super Heavy-Starship working as planned in the near future, but scores of test flights will be required to demonstrate the safety and reliability required by NASA to put astronauts aboard.",
      "And the moon mission poses unique challenges.",
      "For the initial landing mission, multiple Super Heavy \"tanker\" flights will be required to refuel the moon lander in low-Earth orbit before it can be sent to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, it will await the arrival of the Artemis 3 crew, launched aboard an Orion capsule by an SLS rocket.",
      "After boarding the Starship lander, two astronauts would descend to the surface, carry out the mission's planned exploration, and then head back up to the orbiting Orion for the trip back to Earth.",

    "summary": "Amazon allegedly stopped its fastest delivery service to almost 50,000 Prime subscribers in two District of Columbia ZIP codes.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon secretly excluded two ZIP codes from its fastest delivery service while charging nearly 50,000 Prime members who live in the areas its full Prime subscription price, the District of Columbia's attorney general alleges in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.",
      "Amazon violated consumer protection laws by stopping its quickest delivery service to the two historically lower-income neighborhoods, then misled customers about why their packages were arriving later than advertised when they complained, according to the suit filed in D.C. Superior Court.",
      "The world's biggest online retailer's paid subscription service, Amazon Prime, offers two-day delivery for millions of items, as well as next-day or same-day for many other products for $139 a year, or $14.99 a month.",
      "Amazon in June 2022 decided to stop using its fleet of branded trucks to make Prime deliveries to D.C. ZIP codes 20019 and 20020, servicing them instead with third-party delivery services like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service. The company knew the decision would result in significantly slower deliveries for the areas, but did not tell existing or prospective customers, the suit alleges.",
      "Amazon informed the attorney general's office that the change came as the result of safety concerns for its drivers, the attorney general said. Yet the company was legally obligated to disclose the change to customers.",
      "\"Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide. While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one ZIP code is worth less than a dollar in another,\" D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb stated in a news\u00a0release.\"We're suing to stop this deceptive conduct and make sure District residents get what they're paying for.\"",
      "Amazon Prime two-day delivery",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 10:27:28 -0500",
    "summary": "About 3.7 million people are at immediate risk of losing health coverage should the federal government cut funding for Medicaid expansions, as some allies of President-elect Donald Trump have proposed.",
    "story": [
      "With Donald Trump's return to the White House and Republicans taking full control of Congress in 2025, the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion is back on the chopping block.",
      "More than 3 million adults in nine states would be at immediate risk of losing their health coverage should the GOP reduce the extra federal Medicaid funding that's enabled states to widen eligibility, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, and the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. That's because the states have trigger laws that would swiftly end their Medicaid expansions if federal funding falls.",
      "The states are Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia.",
      "The 2010 Affordable Care Act encouraged states to expand Medicaid programs to cover more low-income Americans who didn't get health insurance through their jobs. Forty states and the District of Columbia agreed, extending health insurance since 2014 to an estimated 21 million people and helping drive the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows.",
      "In exchange, the federal government pays 90% of the cost to cover the expanded population. That's far higher than the federal match for other Medicaid beneficiaries, which averages about 57% nationwide.",
      "Conservative policy groups, which generally have opposed the ACA, say the program costs too much and covers too many people. Democrats say the Medicaid expansion has saved lives and helped communities by widening coverage to people who could not afford private insurance.",
      "If Congress cuts federal funding, Medicaid expansion would be at risk in all states that have opted into it \u2014 even those without trigger laws \u2014 because state legislatures would be forced to make up the difference, said Renuka Tipirneni, an associate professor at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health.",
      "Decisions to keep or roll back the expansion \"would depend on the politics at the state level,\" Tipirneni said.",
      "For instance, Michigan approved a trigger as part of its Medicaid expansion in 2013, when it was controlled by a Republican governor and legislature. Last year, with the government controlled by Democrats, the state eliminated its funding trigger.",
      "Six of the nine states with trigger laws \u2014 Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Montana, North Carolina and Utah \u2014 went for Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Most of the nine states' triggers kick in if federal funding falls below the 90% threshold. Arizona's trigger would eliminate its expansion if funding falls below 80%.",
      "Montana's law rolls back expansion below 90% funding but allows it to continue if lawmakers identify additional funding. Under state law, Montana lawmakers must reauthorize its Medicaid expansion in 2025 or the expansion will end.",
      "Across the states with triggers, between 3.1 million and 3.7 million people would swiftly lose their coverage, researchers at KFF and the Georgetown center estimate. The difference depends on how states treat people who were added to Medicaid before the ACA expansion; they may continue to qualify even if the expansion ends.",
      "Three other states \u2014 Iowa, Idaho and New Mexico\u2014 have laws that require their governments to mitigate the financial impact of losing federal Medicaid expansion funding but would not automatically end expansions. With those three states included, about 4.3 million Medicaid expansion enrollees would be at risk of losing coverage, according to KFF.",
      "The ACA allowed Medicaid expansions to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $20,783 for an individual in 2024.",
      "Nearly a quarter of the 81 million people enrolled in Medicaid nationally are in the program due to expansions.",
      "\"With a reduction in the expansion match rate, it is likely that all states would need to evaluate whether to continue expansion coverage because it would require a significant increase in state spending,\" said Robin Rudowitz, vice president and director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF. \"If states drop coverage, it is likely that there would be an increase in the number of uninsured, and that would limit access to care across red and blue states that have adopted expansion.\"",
      "States rarely cut eligibility for social programs such as Medicaid once it's been granted.",
      "The triggers make it politically easier for state lawmakers to end Medicaid expansion because they would not have to take any new action to cut coverage, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.",
      "To see the impact of trigger laws, consider what happened after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down Roe v. Wade and, with it, the constitutional right to an abortion. Conservative lawmakers in 13 states had crafted trigger laws that would automatically implement bans in the event a national right to abortion were struck down. Those state laws resulted in restrictions taking effect immediately after the court ruling, or shortly thereafter.",
      "States adopted triggers as part of Medicaid expansion to win over lawmakers skeptical of putting state dollars on the hook for a federal program unpopular with most Republicans.",
      "It's unclear what Trump and congressional Republicans will do with Medicaid after he takes office in January, but one indicator could be a recent recommendation from the Paragon Health Institute, a leading conservative policy organization led by former Trump health adviser Brian Blase.",
      "Paragon has proposed that starting in 2026 the federal government would phase down the 90% federal match for expansion until 2034, when it would reach parity with each state's federal match for its traditional enrollees. Under that plan, states could still get ACA Medicaid expansion funding but restrict coverage to enrollees with incomes up to the federal poverty level. Currently, to receive expansion funding, states must offer coverage to everyone up to 138% of the poverty level.",
      "Daniel Derksen, director of the Center for Rural Health at the University of Arizona, said it's unlikely Arizona would move to eliminate its trigger and make up for lost federal funds. \"It would be a tough sell right now as it would put a big strain on the budget,\" he said.",
      "Medicaid has been in the crosshairs of Republicans in Washington before. Republican congressional leaders in 2017 proposed legislation to cut federal expansion funding, a move that would have shifted billions in costs to states. That plan, part of a strategy to repeal Obamacare, ultimately failed.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 20:44:33 -0500",
    "summary": "An appeals court judge wrote that the law that would force a sale or ban of TikTok \"survive[s] constitutional scrutiny.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court upheld a law that will ban TikTok in the U.S. in the coming months if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell its stake in the app, dealing another setback to the widely popular video-sharing service in its battle with the federal government.",
      "A panel of three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously sided with the Justice Department in declining to review the petition for relief from TikTok and ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, saying the law is constitutional.",
      "\"We conclude the portions of the Act the petitioners have standing to challenge, that is the provisions concerning TikTok and its related entities, survive constitutional scrutiny,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote in the majority opinion. \"We therefore deny the petitions.\"",
      "Congress approved\u00a0a foreign assistance package in April that included provisions giving TikTok nine months to sever ties with ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, and it is set to take effect on Jan. 19, with the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in office, but reversed his position during the presidential campaign and vowed to \"save\" the app. He takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Lawmakers and national security officials have long had suspicions about TikTok's ties to China. Officials from both parties have warned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to spy on and collect data from its roughly 170 million American users or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content. The concern is warranted, they have argued, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",
      "The appeals court's decision tees up a fight at the Supreme Court over the law's ultimate fate. The parties asked the judges to make a decision by Friday so there is enough time for the high court to review the case before the law takes effect. The justices could agree to hear the case and pause the law while they consider the legal arguments, or let the appeals court's ruling stand as the final word.",
      "TikTok expects the law will be overturned by the Supreme Court, according to spokesperson Michael Hughes, who argued the law is based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "The Justice Department, meanwhile, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Today's decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"As the D.C. Circuit recognized, this act protects the national security of the United States in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. The Justice Department is committed to defending Americans' sensitive data from authoritarian regimes that seek to exploit companies under their control.\"",
      "The court's decision",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Ginsburg wrote in his opinion. \"Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized the decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Ginsburg said. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "The D.C. Circuit found that the government's national-security justifications for banning TikTok \u2014 to counter China's efforts to collect Americans' data and limit its ability to manipulate content covertly on the platform \u2014 are \"wholly consistent\" with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"The government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.\"",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China committee, praised the decision, calling it \"a loss for the Chinese Community Party,\" while also expressing optimism about the app's future in the U.S.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\" Moolenaar said in a statement.",
      "The House China committee spearheaded the bipartisan effort to pass the law.",
      "The legal arguments",
      "TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge in May that called the legislation \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "\"In reality, there is no choice,\" the petition said, adding that a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\"",
      "The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",
      "During oral arguments in September, the appeals panel appeared skeptical of TikTok's argument that free expression outweighs national security concerns, but the three judges were also critical of the government's stance.",
      "TikTok's lawyer Andrew Pincus said the law \"is unprecedented and its effect would be staggering.\"",
      "\"This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,\" Pincus said. \"Notwithstanding the obvious less restrictive alternatives, the government has not come anywhere near satisfying strict scrutiny.\"",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan said, under TikTok's rationale, the U.S. would not be able to ban a foreign country from owning a major media company in the U.S. if the two are at war.",
      "\"Is your submission that Congress can't bar the enemy's ownership of a major media source in the U.S.?\" Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, asked Pincus.",
      "When Pincus noted that news outlets like Politico and Business Insider are owned by foreign entities, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, quickly chimed in: \"But not foreign adversaries.\"",
      "Rao also pushed back on Pincus' argument that Congress did not include any evidence of its claims that TikTok poses a national security risk in the legislation.",
      "\"I know Congress doesn't legislate all the time, but here they did,\" she said. \"They actually passed a law and many of your arguments want us to treat them as an agency. It's strange. It's a very strange framework for thinking about our first branch of government.\"",
      "Attorney Jeffrey Fisher, who represents TikTok creators, compared the restrictions on TikTok to the U.S. government hypothetically banning bookstores from selling books written by foreign authors in conjunction with a foreign government.",
      "\"We're not talking about banning Tocqueville in the United States,\" Rao countered. \"We're talking about a determination by the political branches that there's a foreign adversary that is potentially exercising covert influence in the United States. Very different.\"",
      "Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, expressed skepticism over the notion that the law singles out TikTok.",
      "\"It describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity,\" he said, noting that the company and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns. \"That's the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny said the data on Americans that could be collected through the app \"would be quite valuable to a foreign adversary if it were trying to approach an American to try to have them be an intelligence asset.\" Tenny also spoke about the risk of content manipulation by China.",
      "\"What is being targeted is a foreign company that controls this recommendation engine and many aspects of the algorithm that's used to determine what content is shown to Americans on the app,\" Tenny said.",
      "But Srinivasan said it's Americans' choice to use the app, despite what content may appear.",
      "\"The fact that that's being denied subjects this to serious First Amendment scrutiny,\" he said.",
      "He later added, \"What gives arguable force to the other side's First Amendment argument is that it's not just that the government is targeting curation that occurs abroad. It's the reason the curation occurring abroad is being targeted, and the reason is a concern about the content consequences of that curation in the U.S.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Biden is considering blanket preemptive pardons for prominent critics of President-elect Donald Trump in both parties to shield them from possible \"retribution\" or legal prosecution by the incoming administration.",
      "Multiple people familiar with the ongoing discussions tell CBS News the president has debated with senior White House aides the possibility of issuing the preemptive pardons, but no specific names have been formally recommended to him. The concept of preemptive pardons, and names of people who could benefit from them, have been more rigorously discussed among administration officials expected to help Mr. Biden make final determinations, a group that includes White House Chief of Staff Jeffrey Zients and White House Counsel Ed Siskel.",
      "Among those who could be eligible for preemptive legal relief include well-known names at the center of many of the most rancorous moments of the first Trump administration, many of whom remain the subject of his public ire.",
      "The list includes Dr. Anthony Fauci, who helped coordinate the nation's COVID-19 response and later served as Mr. Biden's top science adviser; retired Gen. Mark A. Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has called Trump a \"fascist\" and provided information for several books and news reports detailing the former president's behavior and activities around the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol; California Democratic Senator-elect Adam Schiff, and other Democratic and Republican lawmakers who led the two impeachment cases against Trump or sat on the House committee that reviewed the Jan. 6 attack \u2014   a group that includes former Wyoming Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, who actively campaigned against Trump this past fall.",
      "Fauci and Cheney were not immediately available for comment. Milley declined to comment.\u00a0In an interview with NPR in late November, Schiff said he didn't think a preemptive pardon is a good idea, because \"I think the courts are strong enough to withstand\" threats made by Trump.",
      "\"I think this is frankly so implausible as not to be worthy of much consideration,\" Schiff said. \"I would urge the president not to do that. I think it would seem defensive and unnecessary.\"",
      "News that Mr. Biden was considering preemptive pardons\u00a0was first reported this week by Politico. The White House initially would not engage on the subject this week, but confirmation that the idea is under consideration comes in the wake of the president's sweeping pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, shielding him from all potential criminal activity over 11 years.",
      "The pardon, the first ever issued by any American president for one of his children, came Sunday in the wake of Trump's announced plans to nominate Pam Bondi to serve as attorney general and Kash Patel to lead the FBI. Bondi, Patel and others set for positions in the second Trump administration have spent years discussing plans to seek retribution for Trump's critics or to take steps to stifle news outlets considered critical or hostile to the president-elect.",
      "Rep. Brendan Boyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania, first publicly suggested this week that Mr. Biden should issue preemptive pardons.",
      "\"Trump has made it clear that he is more focused on settling personal scores than on protecting the American people or upholding the rule of law,\" he said in a statement of Trump's plan to nominate Patel to lead the FBI.",
      "In addition to issuing preemptive protection to Trump's political enemies, Mr. Biden is also preparing to grant more traditional \"criminal justice pardons\" in the coming weeks for nonviolent drug offenders or others who've served time for various offensives and are often the beneficiaries of presidential pardons, according to one of the people familiar with his plans.",
      "The White House has been fielding hundreds of requests for such pardons or clemency, including from Rev. Jesse Jackson,\u00a0who this week wrote to the president asking for pardons\u00a0for his son, former Illinois Democratic congressman Jesse Jackson Jr., and his daughter-in-law, former Chicago Alderwoman Sandi Jackson. This week House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, suggested Mr. Biden should pardon \"on a case-by-case basis the working-class Americans in the federal prison system whose lives have been ruined by unjustly aggressive prosecutions for nonviolent offenses.\"",

      "The sum makes Musk, the world's richest person, the largest donor in the 2024 election cycle to either party, Federal Election Commission filings show.",
      "The bulk of Musk's spending was through his own America PAC, to which he contributed $239 million. But filings also showed that Musk was also behind a political action committee using the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's namesake \u2014 \"RBG PAC\" \u2014 in advertisements with misleading claims that Ginsburg held views on abortion that were similar to Trump's.",
      "Ginsburg's granddaughter, Clara Spera, told The New York Times in October that the PAC was an \"affront to her grandmother's legacy,\" and it was \"nothing short of appalling\" that Ginsburg's name was being used to support Trump's reelection campaign. Ginsburg openly supported abortion rights, whereas Trump put three conservative justices on the Supreme Court who were part of the majority opinion in the case striking down the federal right to an abortion.",
      "Musk put $20.5 million into the PAC, the only contribution it received. The group ran advertisements emphasizing Trump's statements that he would veto a national abortion ban if elected, and pointing to Ginsburg's statements that the decision in Roe v. Wade went too far.",
      "Musk also donated $10 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, which supports Republican Senate candidates, and $3 million to the MAHA Alliance PAC, a group affiliated with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" message.",
      "Through the America PAC, his main campaign vehicle, Musk and a handful of other donors funded a get-out-the-vote effort through door-knocking, texting, phone calls, mailers and advertisements.",
      "By far, America PAC's biggest expense was a $40.5 million payment to United States of America, Inc, a company registered last month with an address associated with Musk. It's unclear how exactly those funds were used.",
      "In October, Musk also pledged to give away $1 million a day to a registered voter in Pennsylvania who signed his petition. The sweepstakes were challenged in court, but a judge ruled that they could proceed. Musk's lawyers said the winners were not chosen by chance, but instead based on their personal stories, and the funds were part of a contract they signed to become spokespeople for his America PAC. Musk is now facing multiple lawsuits from participants who claim it was falsely billed as a lottery.",
      "He rose as a major political donor rapidly. In March, he posted on X, the social media platform Musk owns, that he would not donate to either presidential candidate. And then on July 3, he made his first contribution of $5 million to America PAC. Ten days later, he publicly announced his endorsement of Trump and quickly became a key figure in the former president's campaign.",
      "At a rally Musk held in Pennsylvania for Trump on Oct. 20, he reiterated a message featured in many of his X posts.",
      "\"This is the most important election in your lifetime,\" he said. \"If there's any election where you ever vote, it should be this one.\"",
      "After Trump's victory, the president-elect tapped him to lead a new initiative called the Department of Government Efficiency with former Republican presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy, advising the president on cutting $500 billion in annual spending and reducing federal government positions.",

      "Bennett said the academy's race-conscious admissions policy must receive deference extended to military judgments, which he said are set by the president and not the federal judiciary.",
      "\"The Naval Academy's race-conscious admissions policies are narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest in national security,\" he wrote. \"Defendants have proven that the Naval Academy's limited use of race in admissions has increased the racial diversity of the Navy and Marine Corps, which has enhanced national security by improving the Navy and Marine Corps' unit cohesion and lethality, recruitment and retention, and domestic and international legitimacy.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Naval Academy said it is reviewing the court's decision. Edward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, said the group is \"disappointed\" by the ruling and will appeal.",
      "\"It is our hope that the U.S. military academies ultimately will be compelled to follow the Supreme Court's prohibition of race in college admissions,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The challenge to the Naval Academy's admissions policies was brought by Students for Fair Admissions in October 2023, just three months after the Supreme Court ruled that race-conscious admissions policies used by colleges and universities were unconstitutional. The group was behind the cases that led the high court to reject affirmative action in higher education in June 2023.",
      "Students for Fair Admissions' lawsuit came in response to a footnote in the majority opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, which said the decision did not apply to the nation's service academies. The organization sought to expand the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling to include the Naval Academy, based in Annapolis, Maryland, and the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, which it separately sued in September 2023.",
      "Students for Fair Admissions had argued that the Naval Academy's admissions process was unconstitutional because it discriminated based on race. But the service academy argued that a racially diverse officer corps is necessary to execute the Navy's mission and provide national security.",
      "The court held a nine-day trial in September, which included testimony from 18 witnesses.",
      "\"The evidence in this case clearly indicates that the Naval Academy does not employ quotas, admit candidates based solely on their race or ethnicity, or place minority candidates on separate admissions tracks,\" Bennett, who served over 20 years in the U.S. Army Reserve and Maryland National Guard, wrote.",
      "The court found that the Naval Academy's admissions policies mandate that race be taken into consideration only in limited circumstances. In each of those instances, Bennett said, race is \"nondeterminative\" and is one of several factors used to assess an applicant's potential as a midshipman and eventual officer in the Navy or Marine Corps.",
      "Additionally, the court found that the Naval Academy has implemented \"extensive race-neutral factors\" within and outside of its admissions policies in an effort to achieve diversity, such as socioeconomic factors, whether an applicant has faced adversity or if a candidate is a first-generation college student. The court also highlighted the academy's recruiting and outreach efforts, which it said are \"extensive and multifaceted.\"",
      "\"The Naval Academy has established a compelling national security interest in a diverse officer corps in the Navy and Marine Corps. Furthermore, that interest is indeed measurable, and the Academy's admissions program is narrowly tailored to meet that interest,\" Bennett wrote. \"In short, this court defers to the executive branch with respect to military personnel decisions.\"",
      "The Naval Academy typically receives between 14,000 and 16,000 applicants and admits roughly 1,000 midshipmen each year. Those students then enter the Navy or Marine Corps officer corps for a five-year commitment after graduating. The admissions process is rigorous \u2014 in addition to submitting SAT or ACT results, a high school transcript and personal information, prospective students must also participate in an interview and receive a nomination from a member of Congress, the vice president, president or secretary of the Navy. Applicants must also pass a physical exam performed by a Defense Department review board.",

    "summary": "After losing his bid for vice president on the Democratic ticket this November, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he is not ruling out running for a third term in the state's top office.",
    "story": [
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. \u2014 After losing his bid for vice president on the Democratic ticket this November, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he is not ruling out running for a third term in the state's top office.",
      "\"I've always said the decision to do that is really driven more by the people as they start to see if there's a desire in the direction we're going. If we see the support is there, then I would listen,\" Walz said in an interview Thursday, his first with WCCO since the campaign ended.",
      "Walz, who is halfway through his second term, said the decision about his political future will come sometime next year, but for now he is focused on the legislative session that begins in January. The make-up of the capitol will look different: A tied Minnesota House between Republicans and Democrats will end the DFL trifecta of the last two years, which saw passage of an onslaught of progressive policy wins like paid family leave, gun safety measures, legalized cannabis, abortion rights and more.",
      "That means Minnesota is back to divided government, a defining feature of his first term in office. He pledged to work with Republicans to pass the next budget, which is the big task on the to-do list next year.",
      "And the state faces a bleak financial outlook in future years. State budget prognosticators said that the state is spending more money than revenues it's taking in, which could lead to a $5 billion deficit.",
      "\"I would also make the case that our political climate is not as damaged as the national [climate] yet. I think it's still there. And look, I'm not naive, but we proved it in 2019. We were still able to get some things out,\" Walz said. \"So I think coming back now into a climate that looks like we're going to get a split House gives us an opportunity to kind of prove to the country again that we can get stuff done.\"",
      "Minnesota doesn't have term limits for governor, but If Walz were to run again, it would be notable. Democrat Rudy Perpich is the only Minnesota governor in modern history who has served three terms, though they weren't consecutive. Former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty\u00a0tried unsuccessfully for a third term in 2018.",
      "Reflecting on the '24 campaign, Walz says he needs to \"learn more about America\"",
      "Walz's track record as governor is part of the reason Vice President Kamala Harris chose the former school teacher-turned-politician\u00a0to be her running mate. In reflecting on his time as the vice presidential nominee, Walz said he was proud of the campaign and that it was a privilege to travel across the country to make the case to voters.",
      "But he fell short.",
      "\"I think what we have to understand is the mood where people are at and understanding where they're at. I think economic issues did impact them,\" Walz told WCCO. \"I think we're going to have to understand \u2014 what type of leadership do they want? We were pledging to be inclusive. We were pledging to bring people in. Donald Trump has said that that isn't what he wants, and so if that's what America is leaning towards, I guess for me, it's to understand and learn more about America because I thought that they were going to probably move towards a more positive message.\"",
      "The Democratic Party is having a reckoning in the wake of defeat\u00a0\u2014 not only for the White House but also in Congress, where Republicans will control both chambers. Walz said his biggest lesson in losing was to listen more and for Democrats to think about how they are communicating their message.",
      "Support among working-class people propelled President-elect Donald Trump to victory. He acknowledged those trends.",
      "\"I think we're gonna have to figure out, are we communicating \u2014 I think we're communicating the right way, but are we communicating in the right spaces? Are we communicating to where people are at and where they're listening to?\" Walz said. \"To have Donald Trump seen as a champion of the middle class, I fully don't see how that would happen, but I recognize that's where people voted. So I think we have to both decide, is the message the right one?\"",
      "California is \"Trump-proofing\" its policies. Will Minnesota do the same?",
      "Democrats in California \u2014 with supermajorities in the state legislature and control of the governor's office \u2014 are in a special session to fund the attorney general's office so it's prepared to \"Trump-proof\" the state.",
      "Minnesota's political balance in St. Paul is vastly different and it's highly unlikely Republicans who will share power in the House will agree to do something similar to California. But Walz said he is contemplating what it would look like if Trump acts on some of his promises, like eliminating the Department of Education\u00a0and\u00a0clawing back money unspent for climate initiatives.",
      "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a fellow Democrat, also told Axios he\u00a0is prepared to take legal action, as he has before with other Democratic-led states, against the incoming administration.",
      "\"I'm asking my agencies to understand what would it mean if Donald Trump does follow through with these things that he said he was going to do. What would that look like for us here, and how would we be able to respond?\" Walz told WCCO.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump wants former lawmaker and auctioneer Billy Long to replace IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he wants ex-congressman Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer, to run the IRS. As a lawmaker, Long co-sponsored legislation that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code.",
      "In making the announcement, Trump praised Long's \"32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the Country.\" He also noted that since leaving Congress in 2023, Long has worked as a business and tax adviser.",
      "While Trump didn't mention the current IRS Commissioner, Danny Werfel, in his announcement, the decision signals the president-elect is likely to replace him with Long after taking office in January, Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Naming Long as the next IRS chief drew both support from conservatives as well as criticism from the left, with Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Tax subcommittee calling it a \"terrible mistake,\" while Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo issued a statement saying he's looking forward to hearing Long's ideas for the tax agency. The fiscally conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation praised Trump's choice, saying Long could help reform the IRS.",
      "Long has recently served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, but, unlike prior IRS commissioners, his background is largely outside of the tax industry, experts noted.",
      "\"This guy is an auctioneer \u2014 that's his expertise,\" Owens noted. \"This is an incredibly unserious choice.\"",
      "Werfel, who was appointed by President Biden, stepped into the role in 2023, with his term set to expire in 2027. Typically, presidents allow IRS commissioners to serve out their term, as Mr. Biden allowed Trump's former IRS appointee, Charles Rettig, to do before naming Werfel to the role.",
      "If the Senate approves his appointment to the IRS, Long would oversee an agency with 85,000 employees and an annual budget exceeding $12 billion.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump campaign declined to comment.",
      "Here's what to know about Long and the IRS.",
      "Who is Billy Long?",
      "Long, who attended the University of Missouri but didn't graduate, described himself on a\u00a0website\u00a0for his congressional run as a \"fourth-generation native of Southwest Missouri.\" He touted his skills as an auctioneer, noting that he had been named the \"best auctioneer in the Ozarks for seven years in a row.\"",
      "Long also worked in real estate and in talk radio, hosting a show on a Missouri AM radio station.",
      "He shuttered his auction firm, Billy Long Auctions, before he was sworn into Congress in 2011, according to a local publication.",
      "What professional experience does Long have with taxes?",
      "As a congressman, Long co-sponsored some tax-related bills, including several efforts to eliminate the estate tax as well as a measure called the Tax Code Termination Act.",
      "That legislation would have wiped out much of the current tax code, replacing it with what the bill called a \"simple and fair system\" that would have applied \"a low rate to all Americans.\" Such flat taxes are considered regressive by many experts because low- and middle-income taxpayers would end up paying a larger share of their incomes than would wealthy Americans.",
      "\"As a business owner, Billy knows first-hand how government regulation and heavy taxes can affect the small businesses that serve as the economic engine of our country,\" his campaign site noted.",
      "While Long isn't an accountant or CPA, he has been involved in tax advising since leaving Congress. In a 2023 podcast, for example, he touted his work helping businesses use the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit that the IRS has\u00a0flagged for its high rate of fraud.",
      "In the podcast, Long also said that when he served as a congressman, he helped make the ERTC easier for businesses to claim, noting that the credit was difficult to qualify for during its first iteration.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "The IRS says the ERTC is aimed at employers who paid wages to workers between March 12, 2020, and January 1, 2022, and that were either suspended by government order during the pandemic or experienced a \"required decline in gross receipts during 2020 or the first three calendar quarters of 2021.\" The credit is also available to startups that began at the end of 2021 and had less than $1 million in revenue.",
      "How does Long's experience compare with prior IRS commissioners?",
      "Long's lack of tax industry experience sets him apart from other recent IRS commissioners.",
      "Werfel, the current IRS chief, has an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in public policy from Duke University as well as a law degree from the University of North Carolina. He's also held a number of government jobs involved in operations and the IRS, including serving as acting commissioner of the IRS from May to December 2013, according to his biography.",
      "Werfel's predecessor, Charles Rettig, who was appointed by President-elect Trump, also held several degrees, including a master's in taxation. Before joining the IRS, Rettig worked as a tax attorney for more than three decades and served as the chairman of the IRS Advisory Council.",
      "What is happening with the IRS now?",
      "Under Werfel, the IRS has expanded audits of wealthy taxpayers and big corporations, clawing back billions in unpaid taxes, efforts that were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The tax agency has also reduced the time it takes consumers to connect with an IRS employee, while also rolling out a free tax filing system called Direct File.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the expanded IRS funding, claiming\u00a0the agency would use the money to hire thousands of new agents to increase audits on middle-class taxpayers.",
      "The Treasury had said that funding could help the IRS add nearly 87,000 full-time workers over 10 years, but the agency didn't specify whether those new workers would be auditors, customer service workers or other types of employees. That figure also represented the total number of employees that could be hired, without calculating the impact of the number of IRS workers who are expected to retire or leave the department over the next several years.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers are expressing concern that, if appointed, Long could disrupt the progress that the IRS has made under Werfel.",
      "Werfel \"has done an excellent job rebuilding the IRS, boosting customer service and enhancing enforcement aimed at wealthy tax evaders,\" Rep. Beyer said in a statement. \"Removing him will clearly signal Trump's intention to make the agency less responsive to the American people, while giving a green light to wealthy tax cheats to evade their fair share of the tax burden.\"",
      "Still, Republican lawmakers expressed support for the pick, such as Senator Crapo, who highlighted \"privacy and security\" issues at the IRS and \"inefficient use of resources.\" He added, \"I look forward to learning more about Mr. Long's vision for the agency.\"",

      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized at some point in the past. We don't, but we are going to undertake it. But we are going to definitely struggle with the resources necessary to do that,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf also warned the agency was facing an increasingly steep battle pushing through new rules, like long-stalled efforts to move forward a new \"healthy\" standard and nutrition labels that would go on the front of food packages, as well as crack down on cigarettes.",
      "\"Given the current state of judicial affairs, First Amendment rights, the fact that corporations have the same rights as individuals, every little thing we do, unless specifically in detail instructed by Congress, it's not just that we lose in court, but we lose years,\" Califf said.",
      "One long-awaited change that could see movement soon is a ban on the food dye\u00a0Red No. 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned for. California moved last year to be the first state to ban the food dye on its own over health concerns.",
      "\"We are hopeful that, within the next few weeks, we will be acting on that petition and a decision should be forthcoming,\" said Jones.",
      "In a clash with Califf, Sanders urged Califf to call out the \"food and beverage industry, whose greed is destroying the health of millions of people\" for their role in slowing the progress of the agency's food policies.",
      "Califf told the committee that the agency was facing \"direct opposition from powerful industry forces\" on issues like food chemical safety, but also refused to \"castigate the people that work in the food and beverage industry.\"",
      "\"We have an industry that if you tried to change it overnight, there are farmers all over the United States who would not be able to grow the crops they're currently growing. So there needs to be a plan and it needs to be implemented in a mature thoughtful way across the country,\" said Califf.",

      "The federal Bureau of Prisons is permanently closing the notorious \"rape club\" women's prison in Dublin, Califorina, and will idle six facilities in a sweeping realignment after years of abuse, decay and mismanagement.",
      "The agency informed employees and Congress on Thursday through a notification that it plans to shutter the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin that has been the focus of controversy for a number of years. The bureau is additionally deactivating multiple minimum-security prison camps in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Colorado, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Florida.",
      "The agency said staff and inmates at the impacted locations will be moved to other facilities.",
      "The document issued by the Bureau of Prisons said it was taking \"decisive and strategic action\" to address \"significant challenges, including a critical staffing shortage, crumbling infrastructure and limited budgetary resources.\" The agency said it is not downsizing and is committed to finding positions for every affected employee.",
      "The closures are a striking coda to the Biden administration's stewardship of the Justice Department's biggest agency. After repeatedly promising to reform FCI Dublin and other troubled facilities, Bureau of Prisons Director Colette Peters is pivoting to closures and consolidation, citing inadequate staffing and staggering costs to repair aging infrastructure.",
      "The permanent shutdown of FCI Dublin, just east of San Francisco, comes seven months after\u00a0a temporary closure was announced following reform attempts\u00a0in the wake of staff-on-inmate abuse that led to the \"rape club\" moniker. At the time, it appeared the agency was set on closing the low-security prison, but officials held out the possibility that it could be repaired and reopened for a different purpose, such as housing male inmates.",
      "The assessment identified considerable repairs necessary to reopen the FCI Dublin, the agency said. Low staffing, exacerbated by the high cost of living in the Bay Area, also contributed to the decision to close the facility, the agency said.",
      "\"We understand the impact the closure will have on our employees and are committed to ensuring all are able to continue accomplishing the agency's mission at other locations,\" the statement read.",
      "The prison has been at the center of a\u00a0years-long investigation. Since 2021, at least eight employees, including a former warden, have been charged with sexually abusing inmates.",
      "Five employees have pleaded guilty. Two were convicted at trial, including former warden Ray Garcia. The case against the eighth employee is pending.",
      "At the time of the closure announcement, FCI Dublin was housing about 600 inmates.",
      "The move comes three years after the agency closed its troubled New York jail in Manhattan after myriad problems came to light in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide there, including lax security, staffing shortages and squalid, unsafe conditions such as falling concrete and busted cells.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons and the correctional workers union have repeatedly pushed for additional federal prison funding, highlighting what they say is an inadequate amount of money to address pay increases, staff retention and a multibillion-dollar repair backlog. More than half of federal prison facilities were built before 1991 and many are becoming outmoded or obsolete, the agency said.",
      "The agency said it expects that reassigning employees to remaining facilities will boost retention and cut down on mandatory overtime and augmentation, a practice by which cooks, teachers, nurses and other prison workers are assigned to guard inmates.",
      "FCI Dublin's permanent closure represents an extraordinary acknowledgement by the Bureau of Prisons that it has failed to fix the facility's culture and environment in the wake of AP reporting that exposed rampant sexual abuse within its walls. Hundreds of people who were incarcerated at FCI Dublin are suing the agency, seeking reforms and monetary compensation for mistreatment at the facility.",
      "The closures at FCI Dublin and across the federal prison system come amid an AP investigation that has uncovered deep, previously unreported flaws within the Bureau of Prisons. AP reporting has disclosed widespread criminal activity by employees, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies, including assaults and suicides.",
      "In July, President Joe Biden signed a law strengthening oversight of the agency after AP reporting spotlighted its many flaws.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans on Thursday blocked two Democratic resolutions that would have compelled the House Ethics Committee to release a potentially damaging report on its investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, voting to refer the matter back to the committee.",
      "Democratic Reps. Sean Casten of Illinois and Steve Cohen of Tennessee introduced twin privileged resolutions, forcing floor action within two legislative days. In a 206 to 198 vote, all but one Republican voted to refer Casten's resolution back to the Ethics Committee. Cohen's resolution met the same fate in a 204 to 198 vote, with one Republican voting with Democrats. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock of California was the only member to cross party lines.",
      "In a statement, Casten accused his Republican colleagues of voting \"to sweep these allegations under the rug and set an unfortunate precedent.\" He said he would continue to pursue the report's release.",
      "The votes came after President-elect Donald Trump announced last month that he intended to nominate Gaetz for attorney general, prompting intense scrutiny over the Florida Republican's background and the House Ethics Committee's investigation into allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz, who has denied the allegations, withdrew from consideration for the attorney general nomination a little over a week after Trump made the announcement.",
      "Gaetz immediately resigned from Congress after Trump announced he wanted the Florida Republican to join his Cabinet. The timing of his resignation came days before the House panel was set to vote on releasing its report on Gaetz.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, urged the committee to keep the report secret, arguing that a former member is beyond the panel's jurisdiction and it would set a \"terrible precedent.\"",
      "\"I believe it is very important to maintain the House's tradition of not issuing ethics reports on people who are no longer members of Congress,\" he said on Nov. 15. \"The House Ethics Committee's jurisdiction is over sitting members of Congress. That's an important rule.\"",
      "Casten's resolution cited four instances in which the Ethics Committee has released reports on its investigations into members after they've resigned.",
      "The bipartisan committee met Nov. 20 to consider whether to release the report, but was evenly split along party lines about how to move forward. A day later, Gaetz withdrew himself from consideration, facing a tenuous path to Senate confirmation. There was growing interest from senators on both sides of the aisle in seeing the report before a confirmation vote.",
      "The House Ethics Committee met again Thursday to discuss its investigation into allegations against Gaetz.

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 14:39:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas rejected a proposed plea agreement between the Justice Department and Boeing that would have settled the U.S. government's claims against the company, after crashes of two 737 Max jetliners that killed 346 people, according to a court order issued Thursday.",
      "In his ruling, Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process and ordered the parties to provide the court with a plan for possible ways forward early next month.",
      "The federal government's proposed agreement with airplane manufacturing giant over the deadly crashes included various provisions, including an admission of guilt to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and a $243.6 million fine \u2014 much less than the billions the families of the victims had requested. The deal would also have required Boeing to spend $455 million on safety programs and to work with an independent monitor who would oversee the company's progress.",
      "Investigators alleged in court records that leading up to the crashes, Boeing deceived federal officials who regulated the planes. In 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, which meant the criminal charge would have been dropped if Boeing had complied with the terms of the deal. But earlier this year, federal prosecutors informed the court that Boeing had not followed through on all of the requirements and intended to move forward with the case.",
      "By July, after weeks of negotiations, Boeing and the Justice Department settled on the proposed plea agreement, prompting an outcry from families of those who died in the crashes. At the time, CBS News reported the deal only covered wrongdoing by Boeing tied to the crashes and did not give the company immunity for other incidents, including a door panel that blew off a Max jetliner during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. According to a Justice Department official, the proposed agreement also did not cover any current or former Boeing officials, only the corporation.",
      "Attorneys for some of the victims' families opposed the deal, arguing the \"rotten\" agreement with the government did not justly remedy the families' claims against Boeing. In court filings, they accused Boeing of more criminality and urged stricter penalties, harsher monitoring and recognition of the lives lost.",
      "In rejecting the plea agreement, the judge took aim at diversity, equity and inclusion considerations that the parties said they would take when hiring an independent monitor. He wrote that he was \"concerned with the Government's shifting and contradictory explanations of how the plea agreement's diversity-and-inclusion provision will practically operate in this case.\"",
      "Judge O'Connor had previously raised this issue and in responsive court filings, the Justice Department defended the language, arguing it predated the Boeing agreement. \"This new language reflected not a change in policy but rather a principle that has always governed the process: that selection of a monitor must be based solely on merit, from the broadest possible pool of qualified candidates,\" they said.",
      "O'Connor ruled Thursday that the language was inappropriate: \"In a case of this magnitude, it is in the utmost interest of justice that the public is confident this monitor selection is done based solely on competency. The parties' DEI efforts only serve to undermine this confidence in the Government and Boeing's ethics and anti-fraud efforts.\"",
      "The judge also wrote that the Justice Department's previous efforts to oversee Boeing's conduct \"failed\" and said the independent monitor provision in the proposed deal did not go far enough to include the court in the process.",
      "\"At this point, the public interest requires the Court to step in. Marginalizing the Court in the selection and monitoring of the independent monitor as the plea agreement does undermines public confidence in Boeing's probation, fails to promote respect for the law, and is therefore not in the public interest,\" O'Connor wrote, \"Accordingly, the Court cannot accept the plea agreement.\"",
      "The Justice Department said it's reviewing the decision. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a statement, Paul Cassell, an attorney for some of the victims' families, told CBS News, \"Judge O'Connor has recognized that this was a cozy deal between the Government and Boeing that failed to focus on the overriding concerns \u2013 holding Boeing accountable for its deadly crime and ensuring that nothing like this happens again in the future.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who President-elect Donald Trump tapped to lead the newly coined Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, are meeting with lawmakers Thursday as they seek to build support for the cost-cutting initiative.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson is hosting Musk and Ramaswamy on Capitol Hill to discuss ideas for reform with lawmakers, after Trump announced that the Tesla CEO and entrepreneur would spearhead the effort last month. The president-elect outlined that the two men would \"pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "Johnson said in remarks to reporters ahead of the meeting that during a \"historic moment\" for the country, the two men \"are going to help navigate through this exciting new day,\" calling them \"innovators\" and \"forward thinkers.\"",
      "\"We have long lamented the size and scope of the government, that it has grown too large,\" Johnson said. \"Government is too big, it does too many things and it does almost nothing well. And the taxpayers deserve better.\"",
      "The speaker outlined that Musk and Ramaswamy were first meeting for a \"brainstorming session\" with decision-makers in Congress, including chairs of relevant committees and the leaders of the DOGE caucuses in the House and Senate. He said that the two men were set to meet with lawmakers more broadly later in the day.",
      "\"We need to make government more efficient and that is what this whole objective is,\" Johnson said, adding that it would be a bicameral effort with bipartisan support.",
      "Last month, GOP Reps. Aaron Bean of Florida and Pete Sessions of Texas started the DOGE caucus in the House, while Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa launched its counterpart in the Senate. Ernst touted the effort on Fox News last week, noting that she has a decade-long track record on waste projects that she's bringing to the initiative.",
      "\"We look forward to working with the caucus and making sure that DOGE is successful,\" Ernst said.",
      "In recent days, some Democrats have said they will join or expressed interest in the caucus as well. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Florida Democrat, told reporters Wednesday that he's \"not afraid of having the conversation,\" saying that \"staying in a safe space and not having the conversation isn't going to help anybody.\"",
      "\"I think Democrats should embrace government efficiency,\" Moskowitz said, after becoming the first in his party to join the caucus. \"That doesn't mean that we're going to start cutting services, but I think it can be more efficient.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, told reporters on Thursday that she'd be willing to work with Musk if he \"wants to change government contracting to cut billions of dollars of waste out of the Pentagon budget.\"",
      "\"We're here to do work on behalf of the American people,\" Warren said. \"And if that means working with Elon Musk, I'm ready. And if it means fighting Elon Musk, I'm ready for that, too.\"",
      "Still, the DOGE initiative, with a meme-inspired acronym, has prompted operational questions, including what authority it will have to cut spending, which is authorized by Congress, and what spending it would target.",
      "Musk and Ramawsamy outlined that they are aiming to cut $500 billion in annual spending. But around two-thirds of federal spending is mandatory, while large portions of discretionary spending goes to defense. Among the areas the two men said they intended to target for cuts are The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, International organizations that receive grants and entities like Planned Parenthood. Musk and Ramaswamy have also outlined a plan to reduce the number of federal employees.",
      "Ramaswamy came into the Trump orbit after initially running against him in the presidential primary. Meanwhile, Musk, the world's richest person, became a major part of Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, even offering ahead of the election to give $1 million a day to sign his political action committee's petition backing the Constitution. He appeared with Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsyvlania, ahead of the election and has since been a frequent visitor to Mar-a-Lago.",

Poised to be contemporary France's shortest-serving premier, Barnier arrived at the Elysee Palace just after 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. Eastern) for the resignation formality, with the outgoing premier and government constitutionally obliged to step down after the defeat in parliament.",
      "A majority of lawmakers supported the no-confidence vote Wednesday that was proposed by the hard-left and backed by the far-right, headed by Marine Le Pen.",
      "Barnier's record-quick ejection comes after snap parliamentary elections this summer that resulted in a hung parliament, with no political force able to form an overall majority and the far-right holding the key to the government's survival.",
      "The trigger for Barnier's ouster was his 2025 budget plan including austerity measures that were unacceptable to a majority in parliament, but that he argued were necessary to stabilize France's finances. On Monday he had forced through a social security financing bill without a vote.",
      "The successful no-confidence motion cancelled the government's entire financing plan, leading to an automatic renewal of the current budget into next year, unless any new government can somehow rush through approval of a new budget by Christmas \u2014 an unlikely scenario.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe testified Thursday before the bipartisan House task force investigating the assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump, saying he takes accountability for the agency's \"abject failure\" before the shooting at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania in July that sent shockwaves through the country.",
      "The panel, which the House voted to establish earlier this year, is tasked with looking into the security failures during the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the foiled attempt in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sept. 15. The lawmakers will also make recommendations to prevent future attacks.",
      "The Secret Service came under intense scrutiny in the wake of the initial attack, and its director at the time, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned in July after a bruising day of testimony before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee.",
      "The hearing",
      "Rowe's testimony on Thursday marked his first public appearance before the task force, which heard testimony from local law enforcement and a former Secret Service agent at a hearing earlier this year. Rowe appeared before other congressional committees after he took control of the agency.",
      "\"July 13 was a failure of the Secret Service to adequately secure the Butler Farm Show site and protect President-elect Trump,\" Rowe said in an opening statement to lawmakers. \"That abject failure underscored critical gaps in Secret Service operations and I recognize that we did not meet the expectations of the American public, Congress and our protectees, and they rightly have that idea based on how we performed.\"",
      "Rowe said he had implemented several changes within the Secret Service, including launching an aviation unit to ensure drones are overhead at events with protectees and shifting its Office of Investigations to the Office of Field Operations. The agency should better leverage technology used by other federal departments, he said, citing the Secret Service's use of a robotic dog that walks the sea wall at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's South Florida estate.",
      "The hearing broke out into a shouting match between GOP Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas and Rowe when the congressman displayed a photo of Trump, President Biden and other U.S. leaders at a memorial event for the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks this fall.",
      "Fallon took issue with Rowe's position near Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump and Mr. Biden. Fallon accused the Secret Service chief of taking the place of the agent who was in charge of security for the event.",
      "\"Do not invoke 9/11 for political purposes!\" Rowe shouted in response, telling Fallon that he responded to Ground Zero on 9/11 and was at the event in New York City in September to pay respect to Secret Service agents who died. Rowe said his closeness to Trump, Mr. Biden, Harris and vice president-elect JD Vance did not impact protective operations.",
      "\"Do you know why you were there? Because you wanted to be visible because you're auditioning for this job,\" Fallon yelled.",
      "Task force chairman Rep. Mike Kelly, a Republican whose district includes Butler, said that every employee investigators asked to speak to was made available by the Secret Service, and said the agency chose \"a path of cooperation in pursuit of the truth.\"",
      "In the course of its probe, the panel conducted 46 interviews, participated in more than a dozen briefings with agencies, reviewed 20,000 pages of documents, and visited the incident sites in Butler and West Palm Beach, Kelly said.",
      "Among the deficiencies the panel identified during its investigation were communications and intelligence failures at the Butler rally. Kelly said investigators did not find evidence suggesting that Secret Service agents in proximity to Trump knew there was a suspicious or armed person on a rooftop close to where he was speaking.",
      "The task force's findings are in line with those from other investigations into the July 13 assassination attempt, including from an independent review panel that examined the shooting.",
      "The task force's investigation",
      "Made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats, the panel is expected to submit a report of its findings in the coming weeks. Following Thursday's hearing, the panel will hold a business meeting to consider the final report, the task force said.",
      "The task force released a 53-page interim report in October focused on the July 13 incident, deeming it \"preventable,\" while outlining communication and planning shortcomings. The investigation \"clearly shows a lack of planning and coordination between the Secret Service and its law enforcement partners,\" the task force said at the time, noting that the findings were preliminary.",
      "Trump was speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13 when a gunman opened fire, with a bullet grazing the former president's ear. Secret Service snipers shot and killed the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.",
      "The panel outlined in the interim report that \"fragmented lines of communication\" allowed the gunman to \"evade law enforcement,\" climb onto the roof of a nearby building and fire eight shots. The report claims that \"federal, state, and local law enforcement officers could have engaged Thomas Matthew Crooks at several pivotal moments.\"",
      "The task force also alleged in the report that responsibilities were not \"effectively\" confirmed by the Secret Service with local partners ahead of the shooting. Witnesses who participated in a walkthrough of the area days before the assassination attempt called it disorganized.",
      "When the interim report was released, the panel said it had received relevant information from other House committees, conducted 23 transcribed interviews with witnesses from state and local agencies, and obtained evidence in response to three subpoenas to federal, state and local agencies. Last month, the panel also issued subpoenas to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for testimony from two ATF employees.",
      "The panel has also sought information from federal agencies regarding the Sept. 15 incident. On that day, Trump was golfing at his course in West Palm Beach when the Secret Service arrested a man with an AK-47-style weapon who was within a few hundred yards of the president-elect. The man, Ryan Wesley Routh, has been charged with attempted assassination of a political figure in addition to firearms charges.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 11:27:11 -0500",
    "summary": "A growing number of unemployed workers have been searching for a new job for more than 15 weeks, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "The unemployment rate might be near a historic low, but it's taking longer for hundreds of thousands of out-of-work Americans to find new jobs, signaling cracks within a once-hot labor market as employers continue to cope with the impact of higher borrowing costs.",
      "About 40% of the 7 million people who were out of work in October, or roughly 2.84 million people, have been looking for work for more than 15 weeks, an increase of 20% since a year earlier, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More than half of those job seekers have been on the hunt for new employment for more than 27 weeks, or about half a year.",
      "A drawn-out job search is increasingly common in the labor market today as companies hold off on hiring, especially in some industries such as tech and professional services, ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak told CBS MoneyWatch. It's a far cry from the heady years of 2021 and 2022, when Americans switched jobs at high rates in search of better pay and more fulfilling work, a trend termed \"The Great Resignation.\"",
      "The job market has since weakened under the strain of the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy, with the central bank boosting borrowing rates to their highest point in 23 years to combat inflation, Pollak noted. While inflation has rapidly cooled in the past two years and the Fed began cutting rates in September, the burden of higher borrowing costs has caused consumers to pull back on buying cars and homes, impacting key sectors of the economy, Pollak said.",
      "The job market today reflects \"low hiring, low firing and low job-switching,\" Pollak noted. \"It's this 'big stay'-type of situation \u2014 it's great if you have a job you like, and it's not great if you don't have a job.\"",
      "Employers in October hired 12,000 workers, a jobs report that marked the slowest month for hiring since December 2020. As the anemic number reflects, businesses were weighed down by Hurricanes Milton and Helene as well as labor disputes such as the Boeing machinists strike.",
      "Leading up to the November 5 election, a majority of American held a\u00a0dim view of the strength of the U.S. economy, a factor partly credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory. While much of voters' anger was focused on inflation, the job market also played a role in their views, with the unemployment rate inching up from a pandemic low of 3.4%, and with some workers saying their pay\u00a0hasn't yet caught up to inflation.",
      "Since the election, though, voters' views of the economy\u00a0have improved, especially among Trump supporters, CBS News polling has found.",
      "November's jobs report",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department will release the November jobs report, with economists forecasting 207,000 new hires last month, according to financial data firm FactSet. The jobless rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%, near 50-year lows.",
      "\"The broader thread in the labor market has been a slow, gradual cooling, and the question is whether after accounting for these quirks if that will still be evident\" in Friday's data, Pollack noted, referring to businesses recovering after the storms and the labor strikes.",
      "Employers cut almost 60,000 jobs last month, an increase of 27% from a year earlier, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The automotive and tech industries had the largest numbers of layoffs last month, the group said.",
      "\"The automotive industry is currently experiencing significant challenges, including potential tariffs affecting U.S. automakers with overseas factories, intensifying competition from Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, and shifts in government subsidies for EVs,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in a statement.",
      "The job market and interest rate cuts",
      "The slowing labor market helped sway the Federal Reserve's decision to begin cutting rates in September, which marked the central bank's\u00a0first rate cut in four years. The Fed followed with a second rate cut in November, and a majority of economists are forecasting another reduction at the central bank's December 18 meeting.",
      "According to BNP Parabas analysts, the job market may be in a period of uncertainty partly due to the election.",
      "\"In September, an Atlanta Fed/Duke University survey found that 30% of businesses were paring investment plans due to uncertainty about the then-upcoming election,\" the analysts wrote in a recent research report, noting that they are predicting another rate cut this month.",
      "They added, \"Though we suspect that pre-election uncertainty played a role in restraining hiring of late, this report (due on 6 December) may be too early to reveal a clear unlocking of previously postponed hiring. Uncertainties about tariffs, immigration and fiscal policy remain.\"",
      "Even so, some economists are paring their forecasts for the pace of the Fed's expected rate cuts in 2025, citing President-elect Trump's plans to impose tariffs, cut taxes and deport millions of illegal immigrants, which could, if enacted, reignite inflation.",

That's not airfare, that's just fees for booking a specific seat in advance, or selecting a slightly better seat,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal in a hearing by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on the impact of such charges on consumers.",

      "Asked for his response to the subcommittee's findings, United CEO Scott Kirby told Van Cleave, \"At United at least, we're 100% focused on getting customers to choose to fly United. If you don't want to check a bag, you shouldn't have to pay the implied cost of checking a bag. We're creating options for customers and it's working.\"",

      "Atkins began his career as a lawyer and has a long history working in the financial markets sector, both in government and private practice. In the 1990s, he worked on the staffs of two former SEC chairmen, Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt.",
      "His work as an SEC commissioner started in 2002, a time when the fallout from corporate scandals at Enron and WorldCom had turned up the heat on Wall Street and its government regulators.",
      "Atkins was widely considered the most conservative member of the SEC during his tenure at the agency and was known to have a strong free-market bent. As a commissioner, he called for greater transparency in and analysis of the costs and benefits of new SEC rules.",
      "He also emphasized investor education and increased enforcement efforts against those who steal from investors over the internet, manipulate markets, engage in Ponzi schemes and other types of fraud.",
      "At the same time, Atkins objected to stiff penalties imposed on companies accused of fraudulent conduct, contending that they did not deter crime. He caused a stir in the summer of 2006 when he said the practice of granting stock options to executives before the disclosure of news that was certain to increase the share price did not constitute insider trading.",
      "U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Atkins has the experience needed to \"restore faith in the SEC.\"",

      "The shower will peak from Friday Dec. 13 into early Saturday Dec. 14 \u2014 when the moon is nearly full, according to NASA. Illumination from the moon could make spotting the cosmic show a challenge during the peak, but bright meteors can be spotted the week before the peak.",
      "Here's what you should know about the Geminids meteor shower, including how to watch:",

      "EarthSky, an astronomy website published by experts in the field, suggests finding a way to block out the moon when watching for the Geminids.",

      "Less than a year after announcing major delays for the next two Artemis moon missions, NASA managers said Thursday the projected flight dates are slipping once again, with the first piloted voyage around the moon now expected in the April 2026 timeframe, and the first lunar landing in mid 2027.",
      "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the delays are needed to revise the Orion crew capsule's re-entry trajectory to reduce stress and prevent the sort of unexpected heat shield damage seen after an unpiloted 2022 test flight \u2014 and to complete extensive testing of the capsule's environmental control and life support systems.",
      "\"Based on the data, we have decided, unanimously, to move forward with the current Artemis 2/Orion capsule and heat shield with a modified entry trajectory...to lessen the heat coming back into the Earth's atmosphere,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"Additionally, we need to complete our updates to the Orion environmental controls and the life support systems that were identified earlier this year.\"",
      "Future heat shields for the Artemis 3 moon landing mission and subsequent flights will use essentially the same materials but with modifications to improve their performance during re-entry.",
      "In the meantime, Nelson said, \"We are planning for Artemis 2 to launch in April of '26 and we're going to do all in our power, with our commercial partners, to launch earlier.\"",
      "The Artemis program aims to send astronauts to the moon's south polar region where ice deposits may allow crews to one day extract oxygen and hydrogen to produce air, water and rocket propellants that would not have to be carried up, at great expense, from Earth.",
      "Following the launch of Artemis 2, Nelson said NASA is going \"to make (any) adjustments that are necessary, and we plan to launch Artemis 3, the first landing on the moon in over a half century. Assuming the SpaceX lander is ready, we plan to launch Artemis 3 in mid-2027. That will be well ahead of the Chinese government's announced intention (of sending taikonauts to the moon in) 2030...We need to get this Artemis 2 test flight right to ensure the success of our return to the moon.\"",
      "NASA launched the Artemis program's first test flight, Artemis 1, in November 2022, using the agency's new Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket to send an unpiloted Lockheed Martin-built Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back.",
      "NASA had planned to launch the Artemis 2 mission at the end of this year to carry a three-man one-woman crew around the moon to thoroughly test the spacecraft's life support, propulsion and other systems.",
      "But after the Artemis 1 flight, engineers discovered the Orion capsule's 16-foot-wide heat shield suffered unexpected damage during it's high-speed return from the moon using a technique called a \"skip entry.\"",
      "In a skip entry, the capsule dips into the atmosphere, slows and rises back up before dropping back into the atmosphere for the final descent. The idea is similar to how a flat rock can skip across a still pond. Skip entries provide a number of benefits, including a wider range of splashdown targets.",
      "The Orion heat shield is designed to ablate, or char, during re-entry when the spacecraft enters Earth's atmosphere at more than 25,000 mph. But the charred material is intended to stay in place, providing a layer of insulation. During the Artemis 1 re-entry, more charred material separated from the heat shield than computer models predicted.",
      "While the unexpected \"liberation\" had no impact on the spacecraft \u2014 NASA said astronauts would not have even noticed had any been on board \u2014 engineers wanted to make sure they understood the underlying cause so they could update computer models to accurately predict re-entry effects across multiple trajectories.",
      "After hundreds of tests and an exhaustive engineering analysis, NASA has \"since determined that while the capsule was dipping in and out of the atmosphere as part of that planned skip entry, heat accumulated inside the heat shield's outer layer,\" said Pam Melroy, a former shuttle commander and now deputy administrator of NASA.",
      "That heat build up led to \"gases forming and becoming trapped inside the heat shield,\" she said. \"This caused internal pressure to build up and led to cracking and uneven shedding of that outer layer.\"",
      "While the same type of heat shield will be used for the Artemis 2 mission in April 2026, the crew will use a modified re-entry trajectory to reduce the sort of heating that damaged the Artemis 1 heat shield.",
      "As for the Artemis 3 lunar landing flight, the new mid-2027 target launch date assumes SpaceX's lunar lander, a variant of the upper stage used by the company's new Super Heavy-Starship rocket, completes multiple test flights in Earth orbit, along with at least one unpiloted lunar landing.",
      "On Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he was selecting billionaire Jared Isaacman, a space veteran with strong ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "During the news conference Thursday, Nelson was asked whether he was concerned that the next administration might make major changes to the Artemis program given SpaceX's development of the new Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "\"First of all, there is one human-rated spacecraft that is flying and that has already flown beyond the moon, and that's the SLS (Space Launch System) combined with Orion,\" Nelson said. \"Secondly, this is a partnership. It's a commercial partnership. It's an international partnership.",
      "\"I think what is going to happen over time is you're going to have a number of years that we're going to have the partners flying with NASA, and then whatever the technologies that are developed later on will dictate what is going to be the system that's flying.\"",
      "He concluded by saying, \"I don't see the concern that your question raises, although it's a legitimate question, that you're suddenly going to have Starship take over everything.\"",

    "summary": "Jared Isaacman is an entrepreneur and veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX, has been picked to serve as NASA's next administrator, President-elect Donald Trump  announced Wednesday.",
      "If confirmed, Isaacman, 41, would be the fifth NASA administrator with spaceflight experience, replacing former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who flew into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in early 1986.",
      "\"I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"... Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman founded the payment processing company later named Shift4 Payments while he was a high school student. He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission \u2014 Inspiration4 \u2014 in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight.",
      "He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk.",
      "He is scheduled to lead another Polaris mission aboard a SpaceX capsule before leading the first crew to space aboard the California rocket builder's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Dates have not been announced for either of those missions, and it's not yet clear what impact Isaacman's selection to lead NASA will have on those flights, whether Isaacman still intends to fly aboard one or both or what sort of influence his friendship with Musk might have on NASA's future direction.",
      "But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"",
      "He said it would be the \"honor of a lifetime to serve in this role and to work alongside NASA's extraordinary team to realize our shared dreams of exploration and discovery.\"",
      "Jim Bridenstine, Nelson's predecessor at the helm of NASA, helped kickstart the agency's Artemis moon program during the first Trump administration.",
      "He said in a statement Wednesday that \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\"",
      "The Isaacman announcement comes as NASA struggles to keep the Artemis program on track amid tight budgets and what the agency's own inspector general calls the \"unsustainable\" costs of NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket.",
      "SpaceX supporters argue the company's more powerful, fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship rocket is the obvious choice for deep space exploration, but the huge rocket is far from operational with just a half-dozen suborbital test flights to its credit.",
      "The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions.",
      "NASA is currently gearing up to launch three NASA astronauts and a Canadian flyer on an SLS-Orion mission \u2014 Artemis 2 \u2014 late next year. But problems with the first Orion's heat shield and other issues threaten to push the Artemis 2 flight into 2026, years past initial expectations.",
      "It's not yet clear when the Artemis 3 mission, the first to carry astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole, might be feasible.",
      "But that flight will feature a lunar lander built by SpaceX, a variant of the company's Starship upper stage. SpaceX has carried out six test flights of the fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship to date, but has not yet put the Starship upper stage into orbit or brought it down for an intact landing.",
      "Given the company's rapid-fire test schedule, most observers believe SpaceX will get the Super Heavy-Starship working as planned in the near future, but scores of test flights will be required to demonstrate the safety and reliability required by NASA to put astronauts aboard.",
      "And the moon mission poses unique challenges.",
      "For the initial landing mission, multiple Super Heavy \"tanker\" flights will be required to refuel the moon lander in low-Earth orbit before it can be sent to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, it will await the arrival of the Artemis 3 crew, launched aboard an Orion capsule by an SLS rocket.",
      "After boarding the Starship lander, two astronauts would descend to the surface, carry out the mission's planned exploration, and then head back up to the orbiting Orion for the trip back to Earth.",

    "summary": "Abutting homes, schools an parks, the sprawling warehouses are a huge drain on local resources and major pollutant.",
    "story": [
      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and urban and rural governments alike are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties and butt up against wooded bike trails winding through the suburbs. But one of the latest proposals in the area, Plaza 500, would see a 466,000-square-foot facility and adjacent electrical substation built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised jobs and a significant property tax boost. But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's current data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\" Smith said. \"Data centers are not going away.\"",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",
      "\"This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,\" said Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Police Chief Rick Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.",
      "AWS has cultivated relationships with local officials including Keefer and Stokoe, who have both been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks with the company. Some former county commissioners and residents worry that those relationships are too cozy.",
      "Kevin Miller, AWS's vice president of global data centers, said in an interview with the Associated Press that \"our interest is in being a model corporate citizen, to really be partners with those communities.\"",
      "Skepticism of the deals started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while also owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But the latest data center deal struck between Morrow County officials and AWS, which gives the company an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers, again raised eyebrows.",
      "Two former Morrow County Commissioners, Jim Doherty and Melissa Lindsay, pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations.",
      "\"We didn't want to blow it up. We didn't want to run them off,\" said Lindsay. \"But there were better deals to be made.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 19:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Craig Garriott has built satellites for Boeing for nearly three decades.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's providing internet to storm-ravaged communities or supporting American troops at war, Craig Garriott has long believed the satellites he builds for Boeing helped protect lives.",
      "Now, Garriott, 53, says, it's the lives of hundreds of technicians at the Boeing facility where he has worked for nearly three decades that need protecting from company management.",
      "\"They've taken the focus off quality, the focus off the people on the floor, and they've put it completely on profit and going fast,\" Garriott said in an exclusive interview with CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"I'm afraid with Boeing in the hands that it's in now down here, they're not gonna listen to me until somebody dies.\"",
      "He said efforts by Boeing executives to boost production at the company's Los Angeles-area military and commercial satellite plant have led to a \"toxic culture\" that has put workers there in danger. Garriott recalled how a four-ton satellite estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars crashed to the factory floor after it wasn't properly secured \u2014 an incident so catastrophic he compared it to \"a plane falling out of the sky.\"",
      "\"One person was underneath that satellite and they barely got out,\" said Garriott, who also represents 600 hourly workers as the head of the local carpenters union. \"It's the worst thing that can possibly happen on a site.\"",
      "A Boeing spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the incident. In a statement to CBS News, the spokesperson said, \"Boeing is dedicated to the safety of its employees, and all employees are empowered and encouraged to report any safety concerns.\"",
      "Garriott's allegations echo concerns raised by multiple whistleblowers who have worked on Boeing's commercial airliners, including the troubled 737 MAX. And they add to struggles already facing Boeing's space division.",
      "The most high-profile Boeing space failure occurred in September, when the company's Starliner spacecraft experienced a cascade of technical troubles on a manned test flight to the International Space Station. NASA considered the return flight too risky, and sent it back to Earth without the two astronauts it had planned to shuttle home. Those astronauts will instead travel back next year in a capsule built by rival SpaceX and its CEO Elon Musk.",
      "Tapped by President-elect Trump to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, Musk is set to potentially wield enormous influence over lucrative space and defense contracts, which could put Boeing at a further disadvantage.",
      "Boeing, the company that helped put a man on the moon, is now exploring a new course \u2014 indicating it may sell off parts of its space business, according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal. During Boeing's October earnings call, new CEO Kelly Ortberg suggested he was reevaluating the company's portfolio.",
      "\"We're better off doing less and doing it well than doing more and not doing it well,\" Ortberg said.",
      "The Boeing spokesperson did not respond to questions about how the company views competition from SpaceX or about steps it is taking to prepare for the incoming administration.",
      "Garriott estimates he's raised 300-400 safety violations over past year",
      "Acquired by Boeing in 2000, the satellite manufacturing facility has long been considered one of Boeing's more stable business units. It relies in part on a union workforce that Garriott said is responsible for constructing and testing satellites and their component parts.",
      "\"This is perhaps the most technical group of hourly people that you'll probably find on this planet,\" said Garriott, who estimated he's raised between 300 and 400 safety violations over the past year. Those complaints, he said, range from obstructed fire extinguishers and fire alarms to concerns over heavy machinery blocking exits and trapping workers in certain parts of the factory.",
      "In October, union workers filed a complaint with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration that, according to Garriott, highlighted unsafe conditions on the factory floor.",
      "Another technician at the facility, who spoke to CBS News on the condition he remain anonymous to protect his job, said safety had become \"an afterthought\" and quality had \"degraded\" over the past five to six years.",
      "\"You speak up now, you're a troublemaker\"",
      "Garriott sued Boeing in April alleging company management retaliated against him for raising safety issues. He said he's been harassed by leadership at the facility and has been the target of dozens of corporate investigations that he says turned up nothing and were only meant to intimidate him.",
      "\"When I first started at Boeing, the guys that spoke up and said, 'Hey, this doesn't feel right,' those guys were revered,\" Garriott said. \"You speak up now, you're a troublemaker.\"",
      "In a statement, Boeing said it investigated Garriott's claims and disputed the allegations he made in his lawsuit.",
      "'We have strict policies prohibiting retaliation toward employees who raise concerns, and Boeing did not retaliate against Mr. Garriott,\" the Boeing spokesperson said.",
      "Garriott is the latest whistleblower claiming the company retaliated against him after raising safety concerns. John Barnett, a former quality manager at the company's 787 Dreamliner factory, died by suicide in March while in Charleston, South Carolina, giving testimony in his whistleblower retaliation case.",
      "Barnett's mother, Vicky Stokes, told CBS News in April she holds the aircraft manufacturing giant responsible for the grinding treatment that ultimately left her son despondent.",
      "\"If this hadn't gone on so long, I'd still have my son, and my sons would have their brother and we wouldn't be sitting here. So in that respect, I do,\" Stokes said when asked if she places some of the blame for her son's death on Boeing.",
      "In June, former Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told lawmakers on the Senate investigations subcommittee that Boeing's culture is \"far from perfect,\" but said the company is \"committed to making sure every employee feels empowered to speak up if there is a problem.\" He also said Boeing is working on improving \"transparency and accountability, while elevating employee engagement.\"",
      "Garriott said although his family fears he will endure further reprisals from Boeing, he's now speaking out publicly in an effort to improve conditions for workers he said he took an oath as union head to protect.",
      "\"I'm not gonna stop till I know that Boeing understands that these people mean something, they matter,\" Garriott said, urging company executives to open up a dialogue with workers on the factory floor. \"Make 'em feel like they matter. Make 'em feel like their safety matters.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:59:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Bluesky has added millions of new subscribers in the last month as some users leave X. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It's unusual for a new social media service to get a foothold in a marketplace entrenched by the likes of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and TikTok which, dominate people's phones. But Bluesky, a nearly 2-year-old app, is now grabbing attention amid a recent surge of new users, which the company says is likely due to growing frustrations with X.",
      "While the platform has grown since it opened as an invite-only service in February 2023, its membership snowballed following the November 5 presidential election. Bluesky currently has more than 22 million users, up from about 12 million people in mid-October, according to the company's data.",
      "Bluesky believes its recent growth is partly due to changes at X under billionaire owner Elon Musk, according to Bluesky Chief Operating Officer Rose Wang, who recently spoke to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, has overhauled the service, changing its name to X\u00a0and\u00a0prioritizing accounts from people who pay for a blue checkmark \u2014 although accounts with more than 2,500 \"verified subscriber followers\" get access to Premium features for free.",
      "Ad sales almost immediately softened after Musk took over the platform, with companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney removing paid ads from X\u00a0last year. Most recently, The Guardian said it would no longer be posting its content under its official account on X. In its announcement, the British newspaper described X as \"toxic,\" adding that the platform has been used by Musk to shape political discourse.",
      "Musk became one of the most viral voices on elections during the 2024 campaign, frequently sharing conspiratorial narratives while promoting President-elect Donald Trump, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "When Twitter became X, \"it was no longer a public town square, and now it's more of a partisan microphone,\" Wang said, adding, \"that is a big reason why we think people are coming over.\"",
      "X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is the difference between X and Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",
      "To be sure, Bluesky may never achieve the size of bigger social media networks, which advertisers flock to in order to reach much larger groups of users. For instance, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had more than 3 billion daily users across its apps in the most recent quarter, and\u00a0booked almost $40 billion in revenue during that time.",
      "How do you sign up for Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky opened as an invitation-only platform in February 2023, but anyone can now sign up for the service.",
      "User handles on the service are a little bit different than X or other social media networks because they end with the site's domain, .bsky.social. Posts are limited to 300 characters, 20 more than on X. Photos and videos can also uploaded, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are available, too.",
      "As with other platforms, you can tag people on Bluesky by typing \"@\" before their username, you can like posts by tapping a heart icon, and use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a\u00a0menu\u00a0to hashtags, so that when users click on one they'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on a particular topic.",
      "\"It's more of a community space \u2014 it's more of a Reddit model, where you land in those cosy corners,\" Wang added. \"At the end of the day it's all about the people, and what I encourage people to do is just come to Bluesky, give it a chance and see for yourself what the experience is like.\"",

    "summary": "The FBI announced Friday night it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.",
    "story": [
      "A person of interest wanted for questioning in the deadly shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is believed to have left New York City, police said Friday. Meanwhile, investigators found in Central Park what's believed to be the suspected gunman's backpack, law enforcement officials told CBS News.",
      "The New York Police Department said the backpack was being analyzed to determine if it belonged to the suspect, who is believed to have disposed of his backpack in Central Park as he was fleeing Wednesday's shooting in midtown Manhattan.",
      "On Saturday, CBS News learned the recovered backpack contained a jacket but not the murder weapon. The backpack and its contents were sent to the crime lab for forensic tests. NYPD divers were seen searching the lake in Central Park on Saturday afternoon, and sources told CBS News New York they were looking for the murder weapon.",
      "The FBI, which is also assisting the NYPD with the investigation,\u00a0announced a $50,000 reward\u00a0Friday night for information leading to an arrest in the case.",
      "Police have not named a suspect in the investigation, but investigators are looking for a person of interest who's wanted for questioning in the case. The person of interest may have boarded a bus at a Manhattan bus terminal bound for Atlanta, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News. Joseph Kenny, the NYPD's chief of detectives, told reporters Friday that investigators don't know what bus the man may have taken.",
      "\"We have him in a taxicab, and the taxicab  takes him up to 178th Street and Broadway, which as we know is a Port Authority bus center,\" Kenny told CNN. \"Those buses are interstate buses. That's why we believe he may have left New York City.\"",
      "The Atlanta Police Department said it was contacted by the NYPD and will provide assistance as needed with the manhunt now expanding beyond New York City. Investigators were following leads in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The NYPD has asked about 80 major police departments across the U.S. for assistance on the case, senior officials told CBS News.",
      "Days before the shooting, the person of interest took a bus that had originated in Atlanta to New York City, a person briefed on the investigation confirmed to CBS News on Thursday. It is unclear when the person of interest got on the bus, whether it was in Atlanta, or on another stop along the way.",
      "When the person was in New York City, he used a fake ID with a fake name to check in to Hostelling International New York City, a hostel on Amsterdam Avenue, in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation. The official said police believe the name on the ID was made up and does not belong to anyone else.",
      "The NYPD shared two images Thursday showing the person at the hostel. They did not say when the photos were taken.",
      "The photos were taken\u00a0with his mask pulled down as he talked to a woman at the front desk. New York police interviewed the woman, who told officers she asked to \"see his pretty smile,\" a high-ranking source told CBS News New York.",
      "\"They were having a flirtatious moment and he pulls it down and he gives a big smile and that one informal moment between two human beings remains at this moment the most significant clue to date in this whole case,\" said John Miller, former NYPD deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism.",
      "Kenny told reporters that the person of interest was seen on security video arriving at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in midtown Manhattan between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Nov. 24.",
      "Police were able to identify him with surveillance video of him walking through the terminal, police sources with direct knowledge of the investigation previously told CBS News. That video was used to trace him to a Greyhound bus.",
      "From the Port Authority, he took a cab to the vicinity of the Hilton Midtown hotel   \u2014 near which the fatal shooting of Thompson occurred on Dec. 4 \u2014 and was there for about 30 minutes. He then took a cab to the hostel, Kenny said. He briefly checked out of the hostel on Nov. 29, Kenny said, but then checked back in on Nov. 30.",
      "Bus riders who pay cash for a ticket aren't required to show a valid ID. Port Authority police is working with Greyhound to determine if the person of interest provided ID at any point, and they are investigating at which point he purchased the ticket between Atlanta and New York.",

      "A pair of iconic ruby slippers that were worn by Judy Garland in \"The Wizard of Oz\" \u2014 and stolen from a museum nearly two decades ago \u2014 fetched $28 million in an auction Saturday.",
      "Robert Wilonsky, a vice president with the Dallas-based auction house, told CBS News in an email that, with the buyer's premium \u2014 a commission that the buyer pays \u2014 the slippers sold for a total of $32.5 million.",
      "Heritage Auctions had estimated that the slippers would fetch $3 million or more. Online bidding opened last month and by Friday had reached $1.55 million, or $1.91 million including the buyer's premium, Wilonsky said. Over 800 people were tracking the slippers, and the company's\u00a0web page for the auction\u00a0had hit nearly 43,000 page views by Thursday, he said.",
      "As Rhys Thomas, author of the book, \"The Ruby Slippers of Oz,\" puts it, the sequined shoes from the beloved 1939 musical have seen \"more twists and turns than the Yellow Brick Road.\"",
      "They were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case.",
      "Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota, wasn't publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023. He pleaded guilty in October 2023. Martin admitted he used a small sledgehammer to break into the museum. He then used the tool to crack the case the slippers were in and take them. He said he didn't hear any alarm. He took off in his car and kept them in a trailer adjacent to his home.",
      "He was in a wheelchair and on supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",
      "His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin, who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was attempting to pull off \"one last score\" after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence \u2014 a person who buys stolen goods \u2014 later told him the rubies were just glass, DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn't specify how.",
      "The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He's scheduled to go on trial in January and hasn't entered a plea, though his attorney has said he's not guilty.",
      "The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael Shaw, who had loaned them to the museum. They were one of several pairs that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to click her heels three times and repeat, \"There's no place like home.\"",
      "Among those bidding was the Judy Garland Museum. The city of Grand Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival to supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to help the museum purchase the slippers.",
      "\"The Wizard of Oz\" story has gained new attention in recent weeks with the release of the movie \"Wicked,\" an adaptation of the megahit Broadway musical, a prequel of sorts that reimagines the character of the Wicked Witch of the West.",

      "Congress approved\u00a0a foreign assistance package in April that included provisions giving TikTok nine months to sever ties with ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, and it is set to take effect on Jan. 19, with the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in office, but reversed his position during the presidential campaign and vowed to \"save\" the app. He takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Lawmakers and national security officials have long had suspicions about TikTok's ties to China. Officials from both parties have warned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to spy on and collect data from its roughly 170 million American users or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content. The concern is warranted, they have argued, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",
      "The appeals court's decision tees up a fight at the Supreme Court over the law's ultimate fate. The parties asked the judges to make a decision by Friday so there is enough time for the high court to review the case before the law takes effect. The justices could agree to hear the case and pause the law while they consider the legal arguments, or let the appeals court's ruling stand as the final word.",
      "TikTok expects the law will be overturned by the Supreme Court, according to spokesperson Michael Hughes, who argued the law is based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "The Justice Department, meanwhile, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Today's decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"As the D.C. Circuit recognized, this act protects the national security of the United States in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. The Justice Department is committed to defending Americans' sensitive data from authoritarian regimes that seek to exploit companies under their control.\"",
      "The court's decision",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Ginsburg wrote in his opinion. \"Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized the decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Ginsburg said. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "The D.C. Circuit found that the government's national-security justifications for banning TikTok \u2014 to counter China's efforts to collect Americans' data and limit its ability to manipulate content covertly on the platform \u2014 are \"wholly consistent\" with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"The government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.\"",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China committee, praised the decision, calling it \"a loss for the Chinese Community Party,\" while also expressing optimism about the app's future in the U.S.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\" Moolenaar said in a statement.",
      "The House China committee spearheaded the bipartisan effort to pass the law.",
      "The legal arguments",
      "TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge in May that called the legislation \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "\"In reality, there is no choice,\" the petition said, adding that a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\"",
      "The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",
      "During oral arguments in September, the appeals panel appeared skeptical of TikTok's argument that free expression outweighs national security concerns, but the three judges were also critical of the government's stance.",
      "TikTok's lawyer Andrew Pincus said the law \"is unprecedented and its effect would be staggering.\"",
      "\"This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,\" Pincus said. \"Notwithstanding the obvious less restrictive alternatives, the government has not come anywhere near satisfying strict scrutiny.\"",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan said, under TikTok's rationale, the U.S. would not be able to ban a foreign country from owning a major media company in the U.S. if the two are at war.",
      "\"Is your submission that Congress can't bar the enemy's ownership of a major media source in the U.S.?\" Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, asked Pincus.",
      "When Pincus noted that news outlets like Politico and Business Insider are owned by foreign entities, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, quickly chimed in: \"But not foreign adversaries.\"",
      "Rao also pushed back on Pincus' argument that Congress did not include any evidence of its claims that TikTok poses a national security risk in the legislation.",
      "\"I know Congress doesn't legislate all the time, but here they did,\" she said. \"They actually passed a law and many of your arguments want us to treat them as an agency. It's strange. It's a very strange framework for thinking about our first branch of government.\"",
      "Attorney Jeffrey Fisher, who represents TikTok creators, compared the restrictions on TikTok to the U.S. government hypothetically banning bookstores from selling books written by foreign authors in conjunction with a foreign government.",
      "\"We're not talking about banning Tocqueville in the United States,\" Rao countered. \"We're talking about a determination by the political branches that there's a foreign adversary that is potentially exercising covert influence in the United States. Very different.\"",
      "Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, expressed skepticism over the notion that the law singles out TikTok.",
      "\"It describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity,\" he said, noting that the company and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns. \"That's the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny said the data on Americans that could be collected through the app \"would be quite valuable to a foreign adversary if it were trying to approach an American to try to have them be an intelligence asset.\" Tenny also spoke about the risk of content manipulation by China.",
      "\"What is being targeted is a foreign company that controls this recommendation engine and many aspects of the algorithm that's used to determine what content is shown to Americans on the app,\" Tenny said.",
      "But Srinivasan said it's Americans' choice to use the app, despite what content may appear.",
      "\"The fact that that's being denied subjects this to serious First Amendment scrutiny,\" he said.",
      "He later added, \"What gives arguable force to the other side's First Amendment argument is that it's not just that the government is targeting curation that occurs abroad. It's the reason the curation occurring abroad is being targeted, and the reason is a concern about the content consequences of that curation in the U.S.\"",

      "The sum makes Musk, the world's richest person, the largest donor in the 2024 election cycle to either party, Federal Election Commission filings show.",
      "The bulk of Musk's spending was through his own America PAC, to which he contributed $239 million. But filings also showed that Musk was also behind a political action committee using the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's namesake \u2014 \"RBG PAC\" \u2014 in advertisements with misleading claims that Ginsburg held views on abortion that were similar to Trump's.",
      "Ginsburg's granddaughter, Clara Spera, told The New York Times in October that the PAC was an \"affront to her grandmother's legacy,\" and it was \"nothing short of appalling\" that Ginsburg's name was being used to support Trump's reelection campaign. Ginsburg openly supported abortion rights, whereas Trump put three conservative justices on the Supreme Court who were part of the majority opinion in the case striking down the federal right to an abortion.",
      "Musk put $20.5 million into the PAC, the only contribution it received. The group ran advertisements emphasizing Trump's statements that he would veto a national abortion ban if elected, and pointing to Ginsburg's statements that the decision in Roe v. Wade went too far.",
      "Musk also donated $10 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, which supports Republican Senate candidates, and $3 million to the MAHA Alliance PAC, a group affiliated with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" message.",
      "Through the America PAC, his main campaign vehicle, Musk and a handful of other donors funded a get-out-the-vote effort through door-knocking, texting, phone calls, mailers and advertisements.",
      "By far, America PAC's biggest expense was a $40.5 million payment to United States of America, Inc, a company registered last month with an address associated with Musk. It's unclear how exactly those funds were used.",
      "In October, Musk also pledged to give away $1 million a day to a registered voter in Pennsylvania who signed his petition. The sweepstakes were challenged in court, but a judge ruled that they could proceed. Musk's lawyers said the winners were not chosen by chance, but instead based on their personal stories, and the funds were part of a contract they signed to become spokespeople for his America PAC. Musk is now facing multiple lawsuits from participants who claim it was falsely billed as a lottery.",
      "He rose as a major political donor rapidly. In March, he posted on X, the social media platform Musk owns, that he would not donate to either presidential candidate. And then on July 3, he made his first contribution of $5 million to America PAC. Ten days later, he publicly announced his endorsement of Trump and quickly became a key figure in the former president's campaign.",
      "At a rally Musk held in Pennsylvania for Trump on Oct. 20, he reiterated a message featured in many of his X posts.",
      "\"This is the most important election in your lifetime,\" he said. \"If there's any election where you ever vote, it should be this one.\"",
      "After Trump's victory, the president-elect tapped him to lead a new initiative called the Department of Government Efficiency with former Republican presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy, advising the president on cutting $500 billion in annual spending and reducing federal government positions.",

      "Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling on Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to schedule a vote on the bill that would expand Social Security benefits to roughly 2.8 million retirees. Schumer, a Democrat and cosponsor of the legislation, could invoke a Senate rule that would skip a committee hearing and send the bill directly to a floor vote by the full Senate.",

That includes state and federal workers like teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers.

    "story": [
      "In the wake of\u00a0UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing in New York City Wednesday morning, some companies are taking additional precautionary measures to protect their executives while corporate security firms are reporting an uptick in interest in their services.",
      "The shooting of Thompson, who did not appear to have a security detail with him when he was attacked outside a Manhattan hotel, is shining a light on the business of protecting prominent corporate executives, whose security costs can reach millions of dollars per year.",
      "It's common for the top brass at public companies to be protected by guards around the clock, according to security experts. Social media's amplification of everyday individuals' dissatisfaction with a particular person, product or service has only heightened the need for protection, they say. That's particularly true in an industry like health care insurance, when many Americans say they are dissatisfied with the services they receive.",
      "Indeed, in the wake of Thompson's killing, many on social media expressed vitriol for some health insurers' practices.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings about the public voicing its frustrations.",
      "To be sure, some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, were spending heavily on personal and residential security for their top executives prior to Thompson's killing. Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, at more than $24 million, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "While Thompson had an in-house security detail during his New York City visit, it wasn't with him at the time of the shooting, according to CNN, which cited a source familiar with UnitedHealthcare's security.",
      "In the wake of the attack, corporate security experts said companies should take time to evaluate their corporate security protocols and beef up protective measures, if necessary, to protect against a variety of threats.",
      "\"My phone has been ringing off hook, with calls in particular coming from health care leaders who are reevaluating their security,\" said Paul Sarnese, a safety and security consultant and former president of the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety (IAHSS).",
      "He said the deadly incident will likely prompt more executives to seek more robust protection. \"This incident will definitely change those executives' minds that might have been reluctant to initiate security protocols. I think they'll be more receptive to executive protection,\" he said.",
      "Too much information",
      "In the wake of Thompson's death, some companies are taking steps to limit publicly available information about their executives. For example, a page on UnitedHealthcare's website about the company's leadership \u2014 where Thompson and other executives' bios were listed \u2014\u00a0no longer exists, and instead redirects to the company's home page.",
      "Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, as well as other insurers have taken similar actions, their websites show.",
      "Medica told the Associated Press Friday that it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons, in addition to removing executives bios' from its website.",
      "\"Although we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Experts say these types of moves are wise.",
      "\"I think we share too much. I don't need to know where you live and that you're married and have three wonderful kids,\" Sarnese said. \"We don't need to advertise to the public where the president and CEO are sitting.\"",
      "While executives across all industries should be evaluating their security postures, healthcare industry professionals have received more threats in recent years as a result of divisiveness that arose around safety protocols, including mask mandates, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sarnese said.",
      "\"Every industry has challenges because there is always going to be somebody who is upset with a service or product or philosophy. But COVID changed everything. We never saw the level of threats we saw during COVID toward healthcare workers and leaders, because of some of the mistrust and misinformation that was out there in the community,\" he said.",
      "\"All the ways things can go wrong\"",
      "Security industry veteran Brittney Blair of K2 Integrity said that online threat monitoring is as essential as physical protection.",
      "More companies are becoming more active in tracking cyber threats, including monitoring the web and dark web.",
      "\"I think people want to take a more proactive approach to making sure they are not in a situation where they're caught off guard or not prepared for that bad thing,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You cannot predict crime, and you can't prevent all of it, but you should be doing as much as you can to make sure you're getting ahead of any possible threat that could be coming your way.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 12:01:03 -0500",
    "summary": "The group Students for Fair Admissions challenged the U.S. Naval Academy's use of race in its admissions program.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal district court on Friday upheld the U.S. Naval Academy's race-conscious admissions policies, rejecting a challenge brought by the group Students for Fair Admissions following the Supreme Court's landmark decision ending affirmative action in higher education.",
      "U.S. Senior District Judge Richard Bennett wrote in a 179-page decision that the Naval Academy \"established a compelling national security interest in a diverse officer corps\" for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, and tied its use of race in admissions to \"the realization of an officer corps that represents the country it protects and the people it leads.\"",
      "Bennett said the academy's race-conscious admissions policy must receive deference extended to military judgments, which he said are set by the president and not the federal judiciary.",
      "\"The Naval Academy's race-conscious admissions policies are narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest in national security,\" he wrote. \"Defendants have proven that the Naval Academy's limited use of race in admissions has increased the racial diversity of the Navy and Marine Corps, which has enhanced national security by improving the Navy and Marine Corps' unit cohesion and lethality, recruitment and retention, and domestic and international legitimacy.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Naval Academy said it is reviewing the court's decision. Edward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, said the group is \"disappointed\" by the ruling and will appeal.",
      "\"It is our hope that the U.S. military academies ultimately will be compelled to follow the Supreme Court's prohibition of race in college admissions,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The challenge to the Naval Academy's admissions policies was brought by Students for Fair Admissions in October 2023, just three months after the Supreme Court ruled that race-conscious admissions policies used by colleges and universities were unconstitutional. The group was behind the cases that led the high court to reject affirmative action in higher education in June 2023.",
      "Students for Fair Admissions' lawsuit came in response to a footnote in the majority opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, which said the decision did not apply to the nation's service academies. The organization sought to expand the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling to include the Naval Academy, based in Annapolis, Maryland, and the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, which it separately sued in September 2023.",
      "Students for Fair Admissions had argued that the Naval Academy's admissions process was unconstitutional because it discriminated based on race. But the service academy argued that a racially diverse officer corps is necessary to execute the Navy's mission and provide national security.",
      "The court held a nine-day trial in September, which included testimony from 18 witnesses.",
      "\"The evidence in this case clearly indicates that the Naval Academy does not employ quotas, admit candidates based solely on their race or ethnicity, or place minority candidates on separate admissions tracks,\" Bennett, who served over 20 years in the U.S. Army Reserve and Maryland National Guard, wrote.",
      "The court found that the Naval Academy's admissions policies mandate that race be taken into consideration only in limited circumstances. In each of those instances, Bennett said, race is \"nondeterminative\" and is one of several factors used to assess an applicant's potential as a midshipman and eventual officer in the Navy or Marine Corps.",
      "Additionally, the court found that the Naval Academy has implemented \"extensive race-neutral factors\" within and outside of its admissions policies in an effort to achieve diversity, such as socioeconomic factors, whether an applicant has faced adversity or if a candidate is a first-generation college student. The court also highlighted the academy's recruiting and outreach efforts, which it said are \"extensive and multifaceted.\"",
      "\"The Naval Academy has established a compelling national security interest in a diverse officer corps in the Navy and Marine Corps. Furthermore, that interest is indeed measurable, and the Academy's admissions program is narrowly tailored to meet that interest,\" Bennett wrote. \"In short, this court defers to the executive branch with respect to military personnel decisions.\"",
      "The Naval Academy typically receives between 14,000 and 16,000 applicants and admits roughly 1,000 midshipmen each year. Those students then enter the Navy or Marine Corps officer corps for a five-year commitment after graduating. The admissions process is rigorous \u2014 in addition to submitting SAT or ACT results, a high school transcript and personal information, prospective students must also participate in an interview and receive a nomination from a member of Congress, the vice president, president or secretary of the Navy. Applicants must also pass a physical exam performed by a Defense Department review board.",

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 14:25:52 -0500",
    "summary": "After the medieval cathedral was severely damaged by fire in 2019, the work of craftsmen and artisans has restored it to glory.",
    "story": [
      "Paris was abuzz with excitement after the beloved Notre Dame Cathedral\u00a0reopened after a devastating fire.",
      "The April 2019 blaze broke out in the church's roof space, destroying its iconic spire and damaging the cathedral's roof and upper walls. Restoration work has been underway on the 860-year-old building ever since.",
      "While there is still more work to be done to ensure the restored medieval cathedral can dominate the Paris skyline for centuries to come, the church opened its doors to the public Saturday. Demand for access was huge, with people coming from near and far to line the streets of Paris and wait to see the cathedral reopen.",
      "What happened when Notre Dame Cathedral reopened?",
      "The doors of Notre Dame Cathedral were opened by Laurent Ulrich, the Archbishop of Paris, in a traditional ceremony. He knocked on the heavy front doors of the medieval church with a crozier, or staff. The staff was made of wood salvaged from the cathedral's charred roof, according to the Associated Press.",
      "A psalm was sung from within the cathedral. The cathedral's 8,000-pipe organ was also used to respond to the archbishop's invocation, as four organists performed, the AP reported. After the psalm was sung three times, the doors opened.",
      "Guests entered through the cathedral's western facade for a ceremony \"steeped in history,\" the AP reported. It was followed by a star-studded prerecorded concert, featuring artists including cellist Yo-Yo Ma, according to the Associated Press. The performances focused on a message of harmony that celebrated the cathedral's resurrection and role as a sanctuary.",
      "Ulrich and other clergy members wore vibrant liturgical garments designed by renowned French fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac. Castelbajac combined modern elements with medieval touches on colorful pieces for more than 700 celebrants, the AP reported.",
      "Speaking inside the cathedral, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed \"gratitude\" Saturday to those who saved, helped, and rebuilt Notre Dame, his voice reverberating through the nave.",
      "\"I stand before you ... to express the gratitude of the French nation,\" he said.",
      "\"Tonight, the bells of Notre Dame are ringing again. And in a moment, the organ will awaken,\" sending the \"music of hope\" cascading through the luminous interior to Parisians, France, and the world beyond, he said, according to the AP.",
      "On Sunday, Ulrich will lead an inaugural Mass in the cathedral. He will consecrate Notre Dame's new contemporary alter, which replaces the one crushed by the spire in the 2019 blaze.",
      "Restoring Notre Dame Cathedral inspires a new generation",
      "As the flames engulfed Notre Dame on that spring 2019 day, many feared that even if the cathedral survived the blaze, the skills needed to restore it were long lost. But it turned out there were still many traditional craftsmen and women quietly at work in France, and soon an army of artisans was drafted to restore the historic monument. It was an assignment of a lifetime, according to decorative painter Camille Schmoeker.",
      "\"Every day my coworkers and I were pinching ourselves, like, 'We are here,'\" said Schmoeker, who described her job as applying makeup touch-ups over the work of stonemasons. \"It's gratifying to know that I have helped create something better than what it was, and it will outlast my lifetime.\"",
      "Chief architect Philippe Villeneuve said the restoration shone a new light on traditional ways of working in construction and restoration. American carpenter Hank Silver, who worked on rebuilding the cathedral's timber roof, said the fire had a surprising effect on him and other workers.",
      "\"It's maybe a bit of a maybe a controversial point to say, but in many ways, this fire has been a great gift, not just to me personally, but (to) young people who really otherwise would never know that they could have a career as a traditional carpenter, stone cutter, mason. These trades are in the public eye again,\" Silver said. \"I think there's nothing better you can do with your life, really.\"",
      "For the artisans who have dedicated the past half-decade of their lives to rebuilding the historic site, the reopening is a bittersweet moment.",
      "\"I never thought I would get to do something like that,\" said apprentice roofer Mael Testas.",
      "\"I feel like it's in a way my little baby, and now it's all grown up,\" Silver said. \"Now it's going to be everyone's to visit.\"",
      "World leaders, including Trump, gather at Notre Dame Cathedral",
      "Many world leaders will be among the 1,500 guests attending the reopening celebration at Notre Dame Cathedral. President Biden will not be in attendance, but first lady Jill Biden will appear. President-elect Donald Trump will also be present. They, as well as leaders and dignitaries including England's Prince William and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, will be greeted by French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "Macron, who has faced political turmoil in recent days, was behind the ambitious decision to complete the cathedral's restoration in just five years. Donations from across the world helped speed the reconstruction process along. Americans were the most generous donors, with 45,000 United States citizens donating a total of $75 million. The reconstruction cost about 700 million euros, or $737 million.",
      "The reopening marks Trump's first international trip since he was reelected in November. He is set to meet with Macron and Prince William during his time in Paris. It was not immediately clear if Trump would meet with Zelenskyy The French president and other European leaders are trying to persuade Trump to continue to support Ukraine's defense against Russia.",

    "summary": "Dec. 7 marks 83 years since the attack that catapulted the U.S. into World War II.",
    "story": [
      "Bob Fernandez thought he'd go dancing and see the world when he joined the U.S. Navy as a 17-year-old high school student in August 1941.",
      "Four months later, he found himself shaking from explosions and passing ammunition to artillery crews so his ship's guns could return fire on Japanese planes bombing Pearl Harbor, a Navy base in Hawaii.",
      "\"When those things go off like that, we didn't know what's what,\" said Fernandez, who is now 100. \"We didn't even know we were in a war.\"",
      "Two survivors of the bombing \u2014 each 100 or older \u2014 are planning to return to Pearl Harbor on Saturday to observe 83 years since the attack that thrust the U.S. into World War II. They will join active-duty troops, veterans and members of the public for a remembrance ceremony hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service.",
      "Fernandez was initially planning to join them, but had to cancel because of health issues.",
      "The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle. The remains of more than 900 Arizona crew members are still entombed on the submerged vessel.",
      "A moment of silence will be held at 7:54 a.m., the same time the attack began eight decades ago. Aircraft in missing man formation are due to fly overhead to break the silence.",
      "Dozens of survivors once joined the annual remembrance but attendance has declined as survivors have aged. Today there are only 16 still living, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. Military historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated there were some 87,000 military personnel on Oahu on the day of the attack.",
      "Many laud Pearl Harbor survivors as heroes, but Fernandez doesn't view himself that way.",
      "\"I'm not a hero. I'm just nothing but an ammunition passer,\" he told The Associated Press in a phone interview from California, where he now lives with his nephew in Lodi.",
      "Fernandez was working as a mess cook on his ship, the USS Curtiss, the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, and planned to go dancing that night at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Waikiki.",
      "He brought sailors coffee and food as he waited tables during breakfast. Then they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane with the red ball insignia painted on Japanese aircraft fly by.",
      "Fernandez rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing 5-inch (12.7-centimeter), 38-caliber shells so they could begin passing them to the ship's guns.",
      "He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire up above.",
      "\"I felt kind of scared because I didn't know what the hell was going on,\" Fernandez said.",
      "The ship's guns hit a Japanese plane that crashed into one of its cranes. Shortly after, its guns hit a dive bomber which then slammed into the ship and exploded below deck, setting the hangar and main decks on fire, according to the Navy History and Heritage Command.",
      "Fernandez's ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured.",
      "\"We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn't do nothing,\" Fernandez said. \"But we never know what's going to happen in a war.\"",
      "After the attack, Fernandez had to sweep up debris. That night, he stood guard with a rifle to make sure no one tried to come aboard. When it came time to rest, he fell asleep next to where the ship's dead were lying. He only realized that when a fellow sailor woke him up and told him.",
      "After the war, Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014. His oldest son is now 82 and lives in Arizona. Two other sons and a stepdaughter have died.",
      "He has traveled to Hawaii three times to participate in the Pearl Harbor remembrance. This year would have been his fourth trip.",
      "Fernandez still enjoys music and goes dancing at a nearby restaurant once a week if he can. His favorite tune is Frank Sinatra's rendition of \"All of Me,\" a song his nephew Joe Guthrie said he still knows by heart.",
      "\"The ladies flock to him like moths to a flame,\" Guthrie said.",

    "summary": "Pope Francis will have created 110 of the 140 cardinals under 80, thus eligible to vote in a conclave.",
    "story": [
      "Pope Francis on Saturday installed 21 new cardinals, many of whom are key figures in his reform agenda: A Dominican preacher who acted as the spiritual father for Francis' recent gathering of bishops, a Neapolitan \"street priest\" like himself, and a Peruvian bishop who has strongly backed his crackdown on abuse.",
      "Francis' 10th consistory to create new princes of the church is also the biggest infusion of voting-age cardinals in his 11-year pontificate, further cementing his imprint on the group of men who will one day elect his successor. With Saturday's additions, Francis will have created 110 of the 140 cardinals under 80, thus eligible to vote in a conclave.",
      "Francis appeared at the ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica with a significant bruise on his chin but presided over the ritual without apparent problems.",
      "A Vatican spokesman said later Saturday that the bruise was caused by a contusion Friday morning when Francis hit his nightstand with his chin. The pontiff, who turns 88 later this month, appeared slightly fatigued on Saturday but carried on as normal with the scheduled ceremony.",
      "Francis has suffered several health problems in recent years and now uses a wheelchair due to knee and back pain. In 2017, while on a trip to Colombia, Francis sported a black eye after he hit his head on a support bar when his popemobile stopped suddenly.",
      "An expanded consistory",
      "His consistory brings the number of voting-age cardinals well over the 120-man limit set by St. John Paul II. But 13 existing cardinals will turn 80 next year, bringing the numbers back down.",
      "This consistory is notable too because the 21 men being elevated aren't the same ones Francis named Oct. 6 when he announced an unusual December consistory.",
      "One of Francis' original picks, Indonesian Bishop Paskalis Bruno Syukur, the bishop of Bogor, asked not to be made a cardinal \"because of his desire to grow more in his life as a priest,\" the Vatican said. Francis quickly substituted him with the Naples archbishop, Domenico Battaglia, known for his pastoral work in the slums and rough parts of Naples.",
      "Battaglia is one of five Italians getting the red hat, keeping the once-dominant Italian presence in the College of Cardinals strong. Turin is getting a cardinal in its archbishop, Roberto Repole, as is Rome: Baldassare Reina, who on the same day Francis announced he was becoming a cardinal also learned that Francis had promoted him to be his top administrator for the diocese of Rome.",
      "Francis, who is technically bishop of Rome, has been conducting a years-long reorganization of the Rome diocese and its pontifical universities. Reina \u2013 who is also grand chancellor of the pre-eminent Pontifical Lateran University \u2013 will be expected to execute the reform.",
      "Another Italian is the oldest cardinal: Angelo Acerbi, a 99-year-old retired Vatican diplomat. He is the only one among the 21 new cardinals to be older than 80 and thus ineligible to vote in a conclave. Francis' picks on Saturday also include the youngest cardinal: the 44-year-old head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Melbourne, Australia, Mykola Bychok.",
      "\"I think that there is a special sign which was made by the Pope to nominate me as the youngest cardinal in the world,\" Bychok said. \"Ukraine has been fighting for three years, officially and maybe unofficially from 2014, after the occupation of the Crimean Peninsula and two regions, Donetsk and Lugansk. \u2026 Maybe my weak voice will help to stop this war not only in Ukraine but as well in other countries around the world.\"",
      "Yet another Italian is one of two Vatican priests who do jobs in the Holy See that don't usually carry the red hat: Fabio Baggio is undersecretary in the Vatican development office. Francis also decided to make a cardinal out of George Jacob Koovakad, the priest who organizes the pope's foreign travels.",
      "High-profile roles in Francis' reforms are picked",
      "Other picks have high-profile roles in Francis' reforms.",
      "The archbishop of Lima, Peru, Carlos Gustavo Castillo Mattasoglio, made headlines recently because of an extraordinary essay he penned for El Pais newspaper in which he called for the suppression of an influential Peruvian Catholic movement, the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, which also has a presence in the U.S.",
      "Castillo called the group a \"failed experiment\" of the church in Latin America, one of several conservative, right-wing movements that cropped up in the 1970s and 1980s as a counterweight to the more left-leaning liberation theology.",
      "\"My hypothesis is that the Sodalitium obeys a political project,\" Castillo wrote. \"It is the resurrection of fascism in Latin America, artfully using the church by means of sectarian methods.\"",
      "Francis has recently expelled the Sodalitium's founder and several top members following a Vatican investigation.",
      "Castillo is one of five new Latin American cardinals named by history's first Latin American pope. They include the archbishop of Santiago del Estero, Argentina, Vicente Bokalic Iglic; the archbishop of Porto Alegre, Brazil, Jaime Spengler; the archbishop of Santiago, Chile, Fernando Natalio Chomali Garib and the archbishop of Guayaquil, Ecuador, Luis Gerardo Cabrera Herrera.",
      "Francis has long sought to broaden the geographic diversity of the College of Cardinals to show the universality of the church, particularly where it is growing. Asia got two new cardinals: Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi, the archbishop of Tokyo; and Pablo Virgilio Sinogco David, the bishop of Kalookan, Philippines. Africa also got two new cardinals: the archbishop of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Ignace Bessi Dogbo, and the bishop of Algiers, Algeria, Jean-Paul Vesco.",
      "\"There hasn't been an African pope, but it's a possibility in the church,\" Dogbo said in an interview on the eve of his installation. \"And I think that this eventuality - which is not necessarily a demand - if this eventuality were to arise, the universal church would have to be ready to take it on.\"",
      "Francis also tapped the archbishop of Tehran, Iran, Dominique Joseph Mathieu, the bishop of Belgrade, Serbia, Ladislav Nemet, while the lone North American cardinal named is the archbishop of Toronto, Frank Leo.",
      "A more inclusive church",
      "The Lithuanian-born cardinal-elect, Rolandas Makrickas, has a special job in this pontificate: As the archpriest of the St. Mary Major basilica, he hosts Francis every time the pope returns from a foreign trip, since the pope likes to pray before an icon of the Madonna in the church. Additionally, Makrickas oversaw a recent financial reform of the basilica and would have been involved in identifying the future final resting place for Francis, since the Argentine pope has said he will be buried there.",
      "Perhaps the most familiar new cardinal to anyone who has been following Francis' reform agenda is the Dominican Timothy Radcliff, the spiritual father of the just-concluded synod, or gathering of bishops. The years-long process aimed to make the church more inclusive and responsive to the needs of rank-and-file Catholics, especially women.",
      "A British theologian, the white-robed Radcliffe often provided clarifying, if not humorous interventions during the weeks-long debate and retreats. At one point he set off a mini-firestorm by suggesting that external financial pressures influenced African bishops to reject Francis' permission to allow blessings for gay couples. He later said he just meant that the African Catholic Church is under pressure from other well-financed faiths.",
      "As the synod was winding down, he offered some valuable perspective.",
      "\"Often we can have no idea as to how God's providence is at work in our lives. We do what we believe to be right and the rest is in the hands of the Lord,\" he told the gathering. \"This is just one synod. There will be others. We do not have to do everything, just try to take the next step.\"",

    "story": [
      "South Korea's embattled\u00a0President Yoon Suk Yeol\u00a0avoided an opposition-led attempt to impeach him over his short-lived imposition of martial law, as most ruling party lawmakers boycotted a parliamentary vote Saturday to deny a two-thirds majority needed to suspend his presidential power.",
      "The scrapping of the motion is expected to intensify public protests calling for Yoon's ouster and deepen political chaos in South Korea, with a survey suggesting a majority of South Koreans support the president's impeachment. Yoon's martial law declaration drew criticism from his own ruling conservative People Power Party, but it is also determined to oppose Yoon's impeachment apparently because it fears losing the presidency to liberals.",
      "After the motion fell through, members of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party rallied inside the National Assembly, chanting slogans calling for Yoon's impeachment or resignation. The party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said it will soon prepare for a new impeachment motion.",
      "\"We'll surely impeach Yoon Suk Yeol, who is the greatest risk to Republic of Korea,\" party leader Lee Jae-myung said. \"We'll surely bring back this country to normal before Christmas Day or year's end.\"",
      "Despite escaping the impeachment attempt, many experts worry Yoon won't be able to serve out his remaining 2 \u00bd years in office. They say some ruling party lawmakers could eventually join opposition parties' efforts to impeach Yoon if public demands for it grow further.",
      "Protests against Yoon are swelling",
      "On Saturday, tens of thousands of people densely packed several blocks of roads leading up to the National Assembly, waving banners, shouting slogans and dancing. Protesters also gathered in front of PPP's headquarters near the Assembly, angrily shouting for its lawmakers to vote to impeach Yoon. A smaller crowd of Yoon's supporters, which still seemed to be in the thousands, rallied in separate streets in Seoul, decrying the impeachment attempt they saw as unconstitutional.",
      "Impeaching Yoon required support from two-thirds of the National Assembly, or 200 of its 300 members. The Democratic Party and five other small opposition parties, which filed the motion, have 192 seats combined. But only three lawmakers from PPP participated in the vote. The motion was scrapped without ballot counting because the number of votes didn't reach 200.",
      "National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik called the result \"very regrettable\" and an embarrassing moment for the country's democracy that has been closely watched by the world.",
      "\"The failure to hold a qualified vote on this matter means we were not even able to exercise the democratic procedure of deciding on a critical national issue,\" he said.",
      "Opposition parties could submit a new impeachment motion after a new parliamentary session opens next Wednesday.",
      "If Yoon is impeached, his powers will be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to remove him from office. If he is removed, an election to replace him must take place within 60 days.",
      "Yoon apologizes for turmoil",
      "Earlier Saturday, Yoon issued a public apology over the martial law decree, saying he won't shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration and promising not to make another attempt to impose martial law. He said would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country's political turmoil, \"including matters related to my term in office.\"",
      "\"The declaration of this martial law was made out of my desperation. But in the course of its implementation, it caused anxiety and inconveniences to the public. I feel very sorry over that and truly apologize to the people who must have been shocked a lot,\" Yoon said.",
      "Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has struggled to push his agenda through an opposition-controlled parliament and grappled with low approval ratings amid scandals involving himself and his wife. In his martial law announcement on Tuesday night, Yoon called parliament a \"den of criminals\" bogging down state affairs and vowed to eliminate \"shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.\"",
      "The turmoil resulting from Yoon's bizarre and poorly thought-out stunt has\u00a0paralyzed South Korean politics\u00a0and sparked alarm among key diplomatic partners like the U.S. and Japan.",
      "Tuesday night saw special forces troops encircling the parliament building and army helicopters hovering over it, but the military withdrew after the National Assembly unanimously voted to overturn the decree, forcing Yoon to lift it before daybreak Wednesday. The\u00a0declaration of martial law\u00a0was the first of its kind in more than 40 years in South Korea. Eighteen lawmakers from the ruling party voted to reject Yoon's martial law decree along with opposition lawmakers. PPP later decided to oppose Yoon's impeachment motion.",
      "Yoon's speech fueled speculation that he and his party may push for a constitutional amendment to shorten his term, instead of accepting impeachment, as a way to ease public anger over the marital law and facilitate Yoon's early exit from office.",
      "Lee told reporters that Yoon's speech was \"greatly disappointing\" and that the only way forward is his immediate resignation or impeachment. His party called Yoon's martial law \"unconstitutional, illegal rebellion or coup.\"",

      "Yoon said in a brief televised address Saturday morning that he won't shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration and promised not to make another attempt to impose it.

      "It wasn't immediately clear whether the motion submitted by opposition lawmakers would get the two-thirds majority required for Yoon to be impeached.

On Wednesday, 18 members of the PPP joined a vote that unanimously canceled martial law 190-0 less than three hours after Yoon declared the measure on television, calling the opposition-controlled parliament a \"den of criminals\" bogging down state affairs. The vote took place as hundreds of heavily-armed troops encircled the National Assembly in an attempt to disrupt the vote and possibly to detain key politicians.",
      "Parliament said Saturday that it would meet at 5 p.m. local time. It will first vote on a bill appointing a special prosecutor to investigate influence peddling allegations surrounding Yoon's wife, and then on impeaching Yoon.",
      "The turmoil resulting from Yoon's bizarre and poorly-thought-out stunt has paralyzed South Korean politics and sparked alarm among key diplomatic partners, including neighboring Japan and Seoul's top ally the United States, as one of the strongest democracies in Asia faces a political crisis that could unseat its leader.",

      "A United States Navy seaman who died during the attack on Pearl Harbor has been accounted for decades after his death, military officials said Thursday.",
      "U.S. Navy Seaman 2nd Class John C. Auld, 23, was from Newcastle, England, according to a news release from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. He was assigned to the USS Oklahoma, a battleship moored at Pearl Harbor, in 1941.",
      "On Dec. 7, Auld was aboard the ship when Japanese pilots attacked Pearl Harbor. During the attack, the USS Oklahoma took multiple torpedo hits and capsized just 12 minutes after it was first hit, according to the Department of Defense. Four hundred and twenty-nine crewmembers, including Auld, died. Only 32 crewmembers survived, thanks to what the Department of Defense called \"acts of valor\" by other military members. It was the greatest death toll from any ship that day, other than the USS Arizona, which lost over 1,100 seamen.",
      "It took three years for Navy personnel to recover the crew's remains. The remains were interred in the Halawa and Nu'uanu Cemeteries on Oahu in 1944, and in 1947, military officials began working to identify the remains. The remains were disinterred and transferred to a laboratory, where 35 sets of remains were identified.",
      "The unidentified remains were buried again at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii. The names of those who could not be identified were recorded on the Courts of the Missing at the cemetery.",
      "Between June and November 2015, those remains were again exhumed and analyzed at the DPAA's laboratory. Scientists used anthropological analysis, DNA analysis, and circumstantial and material evidence to make the identification. In 2018, Auld's remains were identified. However, it wasn't until recently that the DPAA was made aware that Auld's family had been notified of his identification, which led to a delay in the announcement.",

      "Hongchi Xiao, 61, was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence for failing to get medical help for Danielle Carr-Gomm as she howled in pain and frothed at the mouth during the fourth day of a workshop in October 2016.",
      "Xiao, of Cloudbreak, California, promoted paida lajin therapy, getting patients to slap themselves repeatedly to release \"poisonous waste\" from the body. The technique has its roots in Chinese medicine but critics say it has no scientific basis and patients often end up with bruises, bleeding - or worse.",
      "Carr-Gomm was one of two of Xiao's patients who died.",

      "\"You knew from late in the afternoon of day one of the fact that Danielle Carr-Gomm had stopped taking her insulin,\" the judge said. \"Furthermore, you made it clear to her you supported this.\"",
      "Bright said Xiao only made a \"token effort\" to get Carr-Gomm to take her insulin once it was too late and had shown no sign of remorse as he continued to promote paida lajin in prison.",
      "Carr-Gomm was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1999 and was desperate to find a cure that didn't involve injecting herself with needles, her son, Matthew, said.",

You failed to summon emergency medical care when you of all people knew she was likely to die without insulin. I believe you will continue to practice it. There is a risk you will actively or tacitly encourage followers to reduce their medication.\"",

Though the cohort disliked the label, it became popular with fans, and its members are still known by the nickname almost four decades later.",
      "During an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Tuesday, Lowe, now 60, explained that he now views the label in a more favorable light.",

      "Along with Lowe, the Brat Pack members include Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Demi Moore, Andrew McCarthy, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Estevez and Jon Cryer, among others. However, which actors fit into the group has not always been clear.",
      "In Blum's New York Magazine article, titled \"Hollywood's Brat Pack,\" the journalist designated Lowe, Estevez and Nelson as members of the Brat Pack, though he named other young stars including Tom Cruise, Sean Penn and Nicolas Cage as potential members.",
      "\"This is the Hollywood 'Brat Pack,'\" Blum wrote. \"It is to the 1980s what the Rat Pack was to the 1960s\u2014a roving band of famous young stars on the prowl for parties, women, and a good time.\"",

      "During an August interview with People magazine, Lowe expressed his disdain for Blum's story and the label.",
      "\"The article was horrible,\" he said. \"It was a hit piece, there's no doubt about it. It was designed to belittle us, make us look small, with that journalistic trick of plausible deniability.\"",
      "In a 1987 Los Angeles Times article, Blum defended himself against the backlash that he received from the actors he deemed the Brat Pack in his New York Magazine story.",
      "Blum wrote that the article originated as a profile on Estevez during the filming of \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" He revealed that he came up with the Brat Pack moniker after spending a night out with Estevez, Lowe and Nelson.",
      "\"I wouldn\u2019t call it an inspiration exactly. I did think it was pretty clever,\" Blum wrote. \"It also seemed like an excellent way to describe the actors I\u2019d gotten to know ever so slightly through my reporting.\"",
      "He continued, \"They had acted like \u2014 well, I might as well say it \u2014 brats, which is not to say that I would not have acted precisely the same way if I were 23 years old, famous and rich. I might have. I might have been worse. But these guys definitely fit the bill.\"",
      "The term Brat Pack was coined by journalist David Blum. (Frank Edwards/Fotos International/Getty Images)",
      "Lowe told People magazine that experiencing the aftereffects of Blum's article \"was no fun.\" However, he noted that the author's portrayal of him in the story was not as negative as those of the other actors.",

And occasionally, some poor, misguided fool bases his judgment on whose talent is the greatest.\"",
      "\"All of us should feel lucky to have been given a name for what we contributed as actors and that fans still care 40 years later.\"",
      "Blum went on to claim that, unlike the Rat Pack's Marlon Brando, James Dean, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, none of the Brat Pack members had accumulated years of acting study. He also noted that the Brat Pack actors were not college graduates.",
      "In the WSJ article, Lowe recalled how he fell in love with acting at a young age after watching the musical \"Oliver!\"",

      "\"I figured film school could wait,\" he added. \"Then came two movies a year and I never went to college. I learned to act by watching more experienced actors on sets and by doing the job. Later, I began working with an acting coach.\"",

Hennekens, M.D., a professor of medicine at the FAU Schmidt College of Medicine, told Fox News Digital.",
      "The main causes of alcohol-related death were cardiovascular disease \u2014 primarily due to heart attacks and strokes \u2014 as well as certain \"common and serious cancers\" as well as cirrhosis of the liver, Hennekens said.",

      "\"I do not think it is possible to design a foolproof system, but I do not think that should be the goal. The goal should be to make it very difficult to get in,\" Cris Thomas, sometimes known as Space Rogue, a member of L0pht Heavy Industries, said during testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee May 19, 1998.",
      "L0pht Heavy Industries was part of one of the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity threats. Members of the group warned it was possible to take down the internet in 30 minutes and that it was nearly impossible to make a defense system that was 100% foolproof. It also had difficulties when it came to tracking where threats came from.",
      "FBI, CISA SAY CHINESE HACKERS BREACHED MULTIPLE US TELECOM PROVIDERS IN TARGETED ATTACK",
      "\"Backtracking and reverse hacking is a relatively tricky area. Based upon the relatively antiquated protocols that you are dealing with, there is not a tremendous amount of information as to where things came from, just that they came,\" said another member of the group, Peiter Zatko, who testified under his codename, \"Mudge.\"",

      "By the time the hearing took place, China was likely already at work. In the early 2000s, the U.S. government became aware of Chinese espionage targeting government entities. One string of operations known as Titan Rain started as early as 2003 and included hacks on the U.S. departments of State, Homeland Security and Energy. The public became aware of the attacks several years later.",
      "Around that time, the current CISA Director, Jen Easterly, was deployed to Iraq to investigate how terrorists were using new technology.",
      "\"I actually started in the world of counterterrorism, and I was deployed to Iraq and saw how terrorists were using communications technologies for recruitment and radicalization and operationalizing improvised explosive devices,\" Easterly said.",

The Bush administration had ordered studies on computer network attacks, but officials eventually expressed concern over the amount of damage those attacks could cause. Instead, the U.S. moved to a more defensive posture that focused on defending against attacks.",
      "\"When I stood at the Army's first cyber Battalion and was involved in the stand-up of U.S. Cyber Command, we were very focused on nation-state adversaries,\" Easterly said. \"Back then, China was really an espionage threat that we were focused on.\"",

      "Threats from China would eventually intensify. According to the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 cyber operations tracker, in the early 2000s, China\u2019s cyber campaigns mostly focused on spying on government agencies.",
      "\"Officials have rated China's aggressive and wide-ranging espionage as the leading threat to U.S. technology,\" Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., warned in 2007.",
      "By then, China had a history of spying on U.S. innovation and using it to replicate its own infrastructure. In 2009, Chinese hackers were suspected of stealing information from Lockheed Martin\u2019s Joint Strike Fighter Program.

      "In 2010, China shifted its targets to the public sector and began targeting telecommunications companies. Operation Aurora was a series of cyberattacks in which actors conducted phishing campaigns and compromised the networks of companies like Yahoo, Morgan Stanley, Google and dozens more. Google left China after the hacks and has yet to return its operations to the country. By the turn of a new decade, evidence showed China was also spying on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and abroad.",

      "\"A war in Asia could have very real impacts on the lives of Americans. You could see pipelines blowing up, trains getting derailed, water getting polluted. It really is part of China's plan to ensure they can incite societal panic and deter our ability to marshal military might and citizen will. This is the most serious threat that I have seen in my career,\" Easterly said.",

      "Hearing loss and other complications are prevalent among U.S. military veterans. Audiologist Dr. Tom Tedeschi shares why it's such a big issue and how vets should properly care for their ears.",
      "Have you ever found yourself needing to constantly turn the volume up on your TV because it sounds like the actors onscreen are speaking in whispers, but then whenever action is onscreen, your TV feels deafening? It's not just you.",
      "This is one of the most common issues people have with their TV audio, but, fortunately, you can change a few settings on your TV to make the dialogue sound clearer.",
      "Read on for three easy fixes to help your TV audio sound better.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER \u2014 THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "1. Check out your TV's audio settings",
      "A viewer adjusting TV audio settings with a remote control. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Most modern TVs feature preset audio settings that you can adjust on the fly to make things sound better, depending on whether you're gaming, watching a live concert or watching a slow-burn drama. Too much bass will often obscure spoken dialogue in TV shows and movies, and I suggest going through your TV's preset audio settings to see if you can make the audio clearer. Most TVs feature a movie, music and standard mode for TV audio. You can find your TV's audio presets by navigating to the settings from your remote and selecting \"sound.\"",
      "Some TVs will also feature audio presets explicitly designed for dialogue. Check to see if you have a setting for \"Dialogue,\" \"News,\" \"Speech\" or even \"Speech Boost\" in your TV audio settings. Any three of these should help your TV dialogue come through more clearly. You might also want to consider disabling settings for surround sound or bass boost, as these can cover up the sound of dialogue by increasing the bass too much.",
      "Increasing the treble might be worth it if you have access to EQ settings on your TV and are struggling to hear TV dialogue. It's an easy fix that can improve audio quality without taking too much away from non-dialogue sound in a movie or TV show.",
      "HOW TO EASILY CONNECT HEADPHONES TO YOUR TV FOR GREAT SOUND",
      "2. Adjust dynamic range compression",
      "A floor-standing speaker. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Dynamic range compression, or \"volume leveling,\" is useful for tailoring audio sound to personal needs. Volume leveling reduces the gulf between the loudest and quietest sounds onscreen, making it easier to hear and understand onscreen dialogue, especially in action movies, where the dialogue is often much quieter than the preceding action sequence. You'll find the settings for volume leveling or dynamic range compression in your TV audio settings, which, on most TVs, you can access directly from the remote.",
      "My TV features volume leveling, and I love to use it when I watch TV late at night at a low volume. It helps me to understand everything easily without having the speakers loud enough to wake anyone else up. It's also a great way to keep the audio level when commercials come on if you watch cable.",
      "BEST WAYS TO STREAM ANY CONTENT FROM YOUR PHONE TO A TV",
      "3. Look into speakers or a soundbar",
      "A speaker. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The default speakers built into TVs aren't the best. While a few high-level TVs come with a built-in soundbar, you'll still have the best experience with your own independent speakers or a soundbar. If you followed the two tips above but are still having trouble hearing movie or TV dialogue, it might be time to look into and invest in a set of speakers or, if you want a single unit,\u00a0a soundbar.",
      "I prefer using a soundbar with a TV over speakers for a cleaner setup because they often come with built-in subwoofers that enhance the bass, making action scenes and music sound more immersive. Additionally, modern soundbars are sleek and can easily blend with your home decor. Many of them also support advanced audio technologies like Dolby Atmos, which provides a surround sound experience without the need for multiple speakers scattered around the room.",

      "Check for a 3.5mm jack: Most TVs, especially older models, have a headphone jack located on the back or side panel. If your TV has this port, simply plug in your wired headphones for instant audio.",
      "Using adapters: If your TV lacks a headphone jack but has RCA outputs (the red and white ports), you can use an RCA-to-3.5mm adapter to connect your headphones.",
      "Bluetooth connection: Many modern TVs support Bluetooth. To connect:",

      "Bluetooth transmitter: If your TV doesn\u2019t have Bluetooth, consider using a Bluetooth transmitter. This device plugs into the TV\u2019s audio output (like the headphone jack or RCA ports) and sends audio wirelessly to your Bluetooth headphones.",
      "Media streamers: If you use devices like Roku or Apple TV, they often support Bluetooth connections for headphones, allowing you to listen privately through those devices instead.",

For those with mild to moderate hearing loss, products like the\u00a0AirPods Pro 2 can double as hearing aids with customizable sound settings designed to enhance speech clarity. These devices are particularly useful when paired with your TV\u2019s Bluetooth, allowing for a clear and immersive listening experience.",

      "The best hearing aids today feature\u00a0Bluetooth accessibility and user-friendly smartphone apps, allowing you to adjust settings, switch modes and even take calls directly through the device. Along with innovative technology, many options also come with access to expert support from licensed specialists, either in person or virtually, ensuring a personalized experience and ongoing assistance.",
      "Investing in a professional-grade hearing aid can significantly improve your ability to hear dialogue clearly, transforming your TV-watching experience into a more enjoyable and stress-free activity.",

      "If you find yourself straining to catch every word during your favorite shows, you're not alone. Many people struggle with audio clarity, but by implementing these simple fixes, you can significantly enhance your TV viewing experience.

      "Scambaiting is when someone interacts with a scammer to waste their time and resources. Some of these online experiences are entertaining and even hilarious to watch.

      "Why scambaiting matters",
      "So, why should we care about scambaiting? This creative strategy offers several compelling benefits. First and foremost, it effectively wastes scammers' time. Every minute they spend on the phone with Daisy is a minute they can't use to target real victims. By keeping them occupied, we can potentially prevent them from scamming someone else.",
      "In addition to wasting time, scambaiting raises awareness about common scams. It serves as an educational tool, helping others recognize and avoid falling prey to similar tactics. The more people understand how these scams operate, the less likely they are to become victims. Moreover, watching scammers get flustered sheds light on the lengths these criminals will go to and highlights the importance of staying vigilant against their schemes.",

      "Protecting yourself from robocall scams",
      "While scambaiting can be a fun way to fight back against scams, the best defense is simply not picking up and answering scam calls in the first place. One effective strategy is to consider investing in personal data removal services that wipe your information from public databases on the internet. By reducing your digital footprint, you can make it more difficult for scammers to contact you in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

However, there are some additional red flags beyond the ones we've already mentioned that can help you identify a fake email. Here are some of them:",
      "Check the sender\u2019s address and domain name. Fake emails often use spoofed or similar-looking addresses and domain names to deceive you. For example, an email from support@amaz0n.com or info@fedex.delivery.com is likely a phishing attempt. You'll notice in the Apple phishing email below the email address has just a bunch of letters and numbers. Always verify the sender\u2019s address and domain name before opening or responding to an email.",
      "Check the spelling and grammar. Phishing emails often contain spelling and grammar errors or use poor or unnatural language. For example, an email that says, \"Dear Customer, Your order has been shipped. Please confirm your delivery address by clicking here.\" It is suspicious because it does not address you by name, uses a generic greeting and asks you to click on a link. Always read the email carefully and look for any mistakes or inconsistencies.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Check the links and attachments. Fake emails often contain links and attachments that lead to malicious websites or download malware to your device. For example, an email that says, \"You have won a $100 gift card from Walmart. Click here to claim your prize.\" It is likely a scam. On a laptop or desktop, always carefully hover your mouse over the links and check the URL before clicking on them, and never open or download any attachments from unknown or suspicious sources.",
      "How to handle spam emails",
      "Use strong antivirus software: The first and most crucial step to protect yourself from accidentally clicking on fake links in spam emails is to have strong antivirus software installed on your device.

      "Do not open or reply to spam emails.\u00a0This can confirm your email address to the sender and encourage them to send you more spam. It can also expose you to malicious links or attachments that can harm your device or data.",
      "Mark spam email as junk or spam. Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources.\u00a0This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable or\u00a0email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "Use a personal data removal service: Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "If you realize that you have clicked on a link or opened an attachment from a fake email, don\u2019t panic. Here are some steps that you can take to minimize the damage and protect yourself:",
      "1. Disconnect your device from the internet.\u00a0This will prevent any further communication or data transfer between your device and the malicious website or\u00a0malware. You can do this by turning off your Wi-Fi or unplugging your ethernet cable.",
      "2. Scan your device for malware. Use a reputable\u00a0antivirus software to scan your device and remove any potential threats.

      "6. You should also\u00a0contact your bank or credit card company and inform them of the incident. You may need to cancel or freeze your cards or accounts to prevent any further fraud.",
      "7. Report the phishing email.\u00a0You should also report the phishing email to the sender\u2019s legitimate organization, such as your bank, retailer or delivery service, and to the authorities, such as the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the\u00a0Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG). This will help them to take action and prevent others from falling for the same scam.",
      "8. Use identity theft protection services\u00a0if you entered your personal information on any links you clicked on or websites that you were directed to. Identity theft protection companies can monitor your personal information (home title, Social Security number, phone number, email address) and alert you in the event they become breached. It can also alert you if any of these are being used to open an account.

      "Images of\u00a0four of the SpyLoan apps found on Google Play (McAfee)",
      "What is SpyLoan malware?",
      "SpyLoan is malware often hidden in apps that promise instant loans. These apps reel people in with offers of quick, hassle-free loans, boasting low rates and hardly any requirements. While they might look legit at first glance, their real goal is to gather as much personal info as they can.",
      "Once they have it, they use it to harass or pressure users into paying ridiculous interest rates. They also use shady tactics like countdown timers or \"limited-time\" offers to create a fake sense of urgency, pushing people to act fast without thinking it through. Instead of helping with finances, these apps trap users in a cycle of debt and invade their privacy.",
      "McAfee's mobile research team has\u00a0uncovered 15 apps on the Google Play Store packed with SpyLoan malware. These apps use the same code and systems, targeting users worldwide to steal data and send it to command-and-control (C2) servers. Many of them hide behind fake names and logos that mimic legitimate financial institutions, making them look trustworthy at first glance. You can find the names of these apps in the screenshot added below.",

      "We reached out to Google, and a rep confirmed that Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices.",
      "ANDROID BANKING TROJAN EVOLVES TO EVADE DETECTION AND STRIKE GLOBALLY",
      "How do these predatory apps work?",
      "The goal of these malicious apps is to gather as much data as possible from infected devices, which they then use to extort users. Victims are often coerced into repaying loans at sky-high interest rates, with some even being threatened for delays. In extreme cases, the app operators have harassed victims' families and sent death threats, using stolen personal photos as leverage.",
      "These apps request intrusive permissions, giving them access to system data, cameras, call logs, contacts, location, and SMS messages. They justify this data collection by claiming it's necessary for user verification and anti-fraud measures.",
      "Users signing up for these services are verified through a one-time password (OTP) to confirm their phone number is from the target region. They are also pressured to share additional details like ID documents, bank accounts, and employment information.",

      "4 ways to protect yourself from SpyLoan malware",
      "1. Have strong antivirus software: Android has its own built-in malware protection called Play Protect, but the SpyLoan malware proves it\u2019s not enough. Historically, Play Protect hasn\u2019t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any\u00a0phishing emails or\u00a0ransomware scams.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but the Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software.\u00a0However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "3. Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4. Take loans from legit institutions:\u00a0Always take loans from legitimate financial institutions like banks or well-known lenders. Avoid sketchy apps or services promising instant cash with minimal requirements. They\u2019re often too good to be true. Legit lenders are transparent about their terms, interest rates, and fees, and they won\u2019t demand access to your personal data or pressure you with scare tactics. If you\u2019re unsure about a lender, check reviews, verify their credentials, or consult a financial advisor before committing.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It can be tempting to use apps that promise instant loans, especially when you need the money. But they're often just trying to scam you and push you into a never-ending debt cycle. If you need a loan, go to a trusted bank or lender. Protecting yourself from malicious apps like those infected with SpyLoan malware starts with staying informed and cautious. Always scrutinize the apps you download, stick to trusted platforms, and think twice before sharing sensitive information.",

This means that any new vulnerabilities discovered in the operating system will not be patched, leaving your computer exposed to potential attacks.",
      "Since the start of 2023, 47 vulnerabilities have been discovered in Windows 7. Cybercriminals actively target outdated operating systems because they're more likely to be unpatched and vulnerable. Without official support, Microsoft is no longer compelled to disclose formal vulnerabilities, making it harder for users to stay informed about potential security risks.",

      "1) Upgrading your operating system or computer: While it\u2019s possible to continue using Windows 7 with a third-party antivirus, it\u2019s generally recommended to upgrade to a newer operating system for the best security.\u00a0If your current computer meets the system requirements, you could consider upgrading to Windows 10 or even Windows 11. However, if a new computer isn\u2019t in your budget right now, using a supported antivirus on your Windows 7 machine is a good step.",
      "2) Install strong antivirus software: If upgrading isn't possible immediately, install a strong, reputable, up-to-date antivirus software that's compatible with Windows 7. However, keep in mind that this is a temporary solution and doesn't address all the vulnerabilities in the operating system itself. There are several antivirus programs that continue to support Windows 7.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Consider a new computer: While it's understandable that you're on a fixed budget, investing in a new computer might be the most cost-effective solution in the long run.

But think about it this way: It's like insurance for your digital life. The headache and costs of dealing with a hacked computer? Trust me, that's way worse.

      "Imagine slipping on a pair of shorts that could make walking feel like a breeze, almost as if you've instantly shed 20 pounds. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, get ready to have your mind blown! Scientists at the Technical University of Munich have cooked up something that might just change the game for anyone who's ever wished walking was a little easier.",
      "They call it the WalkON system, a pair of high-tech shorts that's not your average gym wear. These bad boys can cut down the energy you need for a stroll or jog by up to 18%! Whether you're a spring chicken or in your golden years, these shorts could be a game-changer, especially if stairs have become your nemesis or long walks leave you winded.",

      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the robotic shorts work",
      "The WalkON system combines sensors, artificial tendons and smart motors to enhance your natural walking motion. It starts with advanced sensors embedded in the shorts that continuously monitor the stress on your tendons. These sensors are incredibly precise, picking up on subtle changes in your movement, including how fast you\u2019re walking and the angle of your hips.",
      "Connected to these sensors are two thin artificial tendons that extend from your thighs to a specially designed waist belt. These tendons play a crucial role in how the system assists you. When you start to walk, the shorts analyze your gait pattern and can even detect the moment you transition from standing to walking. As each leg enters the \"swing phase,\" the system knows exactly when to kick in.",
      "At just the right moment, small but powerful motors activate and gently pull on the artificial tendons. This action helps lift your thigh, reducing the effort needed by your hip flexor muscles, making it feel much easier to move. What\u2019s really impressive is how adaptable WalkON is; whether you prefer a slow stroll or a brisk jog, the system adjusts its level of assistance based on your speed and leg weight. All of this happens seamlessly, so you experience a natural enhancement to your movement rather than feeling like you\u2019re being pushed or pulled by a machine.",

      "The WalkON system significantly reduces energy expenditure by 18% for young people walking uphill. For older individuals walking on level ground, it decreases energy expenditure by 10%. This reduction in energy expenditure is equivalent to the feeling of instantly losing 22 pounds or 13 pounds, respectively. The system allows you to walk slowly or jog, providing versatility in movement. Participants in tests reported high satisfaction with the device, giving it a mean rating of 6 out of 7 for its ability to assist while maintaining a sense of control.",

Additionally, individuals weakened by illness can find significant advantages in using WalkON to enhance their mobility and independence. Furthermore, the device is designed for those looking to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle, making it a versatile solution for a wide range of users.",

      "WEARABLE EXOSKELETON CAN TURN YOU INTO A SUPERHUMAN ATHLETE",
      "Comparison to other exoskeletons",
      "Unlike traditional rigid exoskeletons, WalkON's soft, flexible design offers several advantages over its more cumbersome counterparts. Conventional exoskeletons often feature rigid frames that can be difficult and time-consuming to put on, limiting their practicality for daily use.",
      "In contrast, WalkON's soft robotic shorts can be put on quickly and easily, similar to regular clothing, and are more than a mechanical device. Professor Lorenzia Masia, the lead researcher, aptly compares WalkON to an electric bike for walking. This analogy highlights the system's ability to enhance natural movement without overpowering it, making mobility more accessible and appealing to a wider range of users. The lightweight, tendon-driven design of WalkON allows for a more natural range of motion, adapting to the user's movements rather than constraining them.",
      "Furthermore, WalkON's compact and unobtrusive nature addresses a common concern with exoskeletons: social acceptance. Its design allows it to be worn discreetly under regular clothing, potentially increasing user comfort in social situations. This feature, combined with its efficiency in reducing metabolic cost, positions WalkON as a more practical solution for everyday use compared to bulkier exoskeleton systems.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Availability and cost",
      "Given the current stage of development and testing, it's likely that WalkON could be available to you within the next three to five years, pending further research and regulatory approvals.",
      "While no exact price point is yet available, we can compare it to other assistive technologies. Current exoskeletons can cost anywhere from $40,000 to $100,000-plus. However, given WalkON's simpler design and intended widespread use, it's possible that it could be priced more affordably, perhaps in the range of $5,000 to $15,000 when it first hits the market. As with many technologies, the price could decrease over time as production scales up.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The WalkON system's potential to enhance mobility for people of all ages, particularly older adults and those with health challenges, is immense. By making movement easier and more efficient, WalkON could encourage more active lifestyles, potentially improving overall health and quality of life for many individuals. While questions about availability and cost remain, the development of WalkON is a promising sign that we're moving towards more accessible and user-friendly mobility assistance solutions.",

      "The exposure of sensitive personal info in this breach is a big deal for the people involved. The database has detailed data about them, and that\u2019s basically a jackpot for cybercriminals. This kind of leak can lead to various dangerous outcomes.",
      "For one, attackers could use this info to run phishing scams or social engineering tricks. If they know details like your job, family or even criminal history, they can send super convincing messages to trick you into sharing even more sensitive details, like your financial info. That\u2019s not all. Criminals could also use this leaked data to impersonate someone and apply for loans, credit cards or other services in their name.",
      "What really gets me, though, is that most people whose info got leaked probably won\u2019t even find out about it unless they\u2019re using a service to remove their data. A lot of them might not have even known they were being background-checked in the first place. For those with criminal records, this kind of leak could cause major reputational damage or lead to discrimination, even if the info is outdated or flat-out wrong.",

      "7 ways to protect yourself from data leaks",
      "1) Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0While no service can promise to completely erase your data from the internet, using a data removal service is one of the best steps you can take. They do the heavy lifting by actively scanning and removing your personal information from hundreds of websites. This helps protect you from scammers who may cross-reference data from breaches with other information they find on the dark web.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With your address exposed, bad actors could try to scam you through physical mail. They may impersonate companies or people you trust and send fake urgent letters about things like missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Be skeptical of unexpected communications and verify any claims before taking action.",
      "3) Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: The leaked data could lead to phishing attacks via email, phone calls or messages from unknown sources. Be on high alert for any requests for personal information, especially if they seem urgent or ask you to click on suspicious links. Always verify the legitimacy of any request before responding.",
      "To protect your devices from malicious links, make sure you have strong antivirus protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, it\u2019s crucial to start regularly reviewing your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts. Keep an eye out for any unauthorized transactions and report them immediately to your bank or credit card company to prevent further damage.",
      "5) Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex passwords for each of your online accounts and consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them securely.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement this extra layer of security on all accounts that offer it to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "7) Regularly update your software: Keep your operating system, apps and security tools\u00a0up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s alarming how many companies profit from collecting personal data, yet fail to protect it adequately. Recent breaches, including one exposing the sensitive information of 600,000 Americans, highlight this negligence. With unprotected databases containing everything from criminal records to addresses, cybercriminals have a treasure trove of information to exploit. This situation underscores the urgent need for you to take proactive steps to safeguard your privacy and demand better security practices from these data aggregators.",

      "Philip Holloway spoke to Fox News Digital about the search for CEO Brian Thompson's killer. (Peter Gerber/NYPD)",
      "\"Obviously, if the killer had any assistance before, during or after the murder, law enforcement would want to build a solid case against any such accomplice,\" the former police officer explained. \"If they are looking at anybody like that, they don\u2019t want to alert them of that fact.",

      "\"We don\u2019t want to release that now,\" Adams said. \"If we do, we are basically giving a tip to the person we are seeking, and we do not want to give him an upper hand at all.",

      "\"[It's] a process for hair, fibers [and] DNA,\" Duffey said Saturday. \"If he holds his hand against the strap and tightens the buckle like most of us do, that is where DNA most likely can be found. And zippers.\"",
      "2. A water bottle dropped at the scene",
      "After ambushing Thompson outside the Hilton Midtown at 57th Street and 6th Avenue, the gunman took off down an alleyway. Investigators are now testing a water bottle they believe he dropped there for DNA evidence.",
      "Still, Duffey said DNA will only be immediately useful if the killer has already been arrested within the United States and is in the national Combined DNA Index System (CODIS).",

      "\"If there's a genetic match, it's going to give you a family profile, but an investigator will [then] need drivers' licenses, photos, criminal backgrounds,\" Duffey said.",
      "A genealogical profile, Duffey said, likely won't come into play unless the other leads go cold.",
      "\"But let's just say that the family match that comes up is in Atlanta. That could be a start because we believe the bus arrived from Atlanta,\" Duffey said.",
      "3. A discarded cellphone",
      "A cellphone, believed to belong to the gunman, was also found in the alleyway he used to escape.",
      "Video has also emerged of the unidentified man with a cellphone to his ear less than 15 minutes before he opened fire.",
      "\"If indeed he was on a phone call right then \u2014 his phone was live \u2014 you can [collect data from] the cell tower. You are going to need the search warrant for that, and it\u2019s a ton of data,\" former NYPD inspector and Fox News contributor Paul Mauro previously told Fox News Digital.",
      "This undated photo provided by UnitedHealth Group shows UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. (AP Photo/UnitedHealth Group\u00a0)",
      "\"You've got the video. You have a pretty good place and time. So, what that does [is] it places that phone inside a particular cell grid, and you look in the data around when the call appears to have been made. And you look at the phone calls that were made there, and, by process of elimination, you are going to get not only the phone number that was assigned to that phone. You are going to get who he called,\" Mauro added. \"And now you got a real data point.\"",
      "But cracking into a cellphone can take anywhere from seconds to weeks, Duffey said.",
      "Some devices can be unlocked quickly using technology like Cellebrite, which plugs into a phone and \"allows everything in that phone to be downloaded in a fantastic, readable, usable product,\" Duffey said.",
      "But in other cases, like when biometric security is difficult to bypass, law enforcement needs to contact the service provider, which lengthens the process. Duffey said certain companies are more receptive to law enforcement than others because some prioritize their reputation for security and the integrity of their security measures over investigations.",
      "4. Shell casings with a message",
      "Three shell casings with the words \"deny,\" \"depose\" and \"delay,\" similar to a popular phrase within the health care industry \u2014 \"delay, deny, defend\" \u2014 were left behind at the scene.",
      "These casings could be scoured for DNA evidence, and the message left on them could point to a motive.",
      "An NYPD detective told Fox News Digital Thursday the words were \"clearly intentionally left to make a statement.\"",

      "\"This will help identify a motive and eventually the suspect,\" the detective said.",
      "Alternatively, former Washington, D.C., homicide detective Ted Williams told Fox News Digital the message could have been left behind to \"throw investigators off.\"",
      "5. A flirtatious exchange caught on camera",
      "A clear image of the suspect was captured at the AYH Hostel where he stayed Nov. 24-27. Although others in the hostel said the man wore his mask at all times, only pulling it aside to eat, he allegedly pulled it aside and smiled while chatting with a receptionist.",
      "Although facial recognition software has come a long way in the past two decades, Duffey said, the image is likely not clear enough to get a reasonably small pool of matches.",
      "\"Still shots are easily distorted from what that person really looks like,\" Duffey, who used earlier versions of facial recognition a decade ago in bank robbery cases, told Fox News Digital. \"There could be if there's the slightest bit of a distortion because that's not a good video shot.\"",
      "A screenshot from surveillance footage released by the NYPD shows a person of interest wanted in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Midtown Manhattan Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. (NYPD Crime Stoppers\u00a0)",
      "Duffey said there are certain \"points\" needed to match a photo to an existing driver's license or passport photo. He said that is why travelers can no longer smile in their passport photos.",
      "\"If you took a high school yearbook photo and submitted it, no glasses on, no covering, I guarantee that will hit off if that person has a driver's license or a passport photo in a state that allows law enforcement to use facial recognition technology,\" he said. \"Now you're taking a grainy photo. It's just not enough.\"",
      "However, he said, the image is likely good enough that a member of the public who recognizes the gunman could come forward.",
      "A screenshot from surveillance footage released by the NYPD shows a person of interest wanted in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Midtown Manhattan Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. (NYPD Crime Stoppers\u00a0)",
      "6. Surveillance footage",
      "The NYPD has access to more than 18,000 security cameras through its Domain Awareness System. But combing through that footage \u2014 in addition to pulling additional surveillance from businesses on the killer's path \u2014 could be a Herculean task.",
      "\"Digital video recovery teams [are] detectives that train, go out, collect all the surveillance video from doorbells, cameras, all the cameras by the city [to gather evidence] with whatever equipment they have. They're able to download it quickly, put it onto their forensic thumb drive, bring it back to a police department and have a quick and easy upload,\" Duffey said.",

      "\"That is tedious,\" he said. \"I've been a part of that, [and] you have to dedicate a full team that's watching [footage] probably 24/7.\"",

      "One such migrant shelter in Marlborough, Massachusetts, was managed by\u00a0Jon Fetherston\u00a0from November 2023 to July 2024, who\u00a0painted a chaotic picture of his time there with violence, wasteful spending and rape.",
      "\"There was a lot of violence,\" Fetherston told The Daily Wire of the crowded 550-person shelter at Holiday Inn at 265 Lakeside Ave. \"Unfortunately there was a gentleman in the hotel that impregnated his own daughter and got very violent when the state removed her from the shelter.\"",
      "A Maine Wire report from June appears to corroborate the claim, reporting that illegal immigrant Ronald Joseph allegedly raped his 14-year-old daughter numerous times on the journey to the U.S. \u2014 both before and after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The Dept. of Children and Families (DcF) interviewed the young girl before making the decision to remove her from her father\u2019s custody on an emergency basis,\" the document obtained by The Maine Wire states.",
      "Illegal migrants line the floors of a terminal at Boston Logan Airport as Massachusetts' shelters are overrun.\u00a0 (WBZ)",
      "Joseph was then given a taxpayer-funded Lyft ride to another shelter in Worcester, Massachusetts, after he started yelling and making threatening gestures at the shelter staff, The Maine Wire reports, citing Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities (EOHLC) records.",
      "\"They had me send them to Worcester County,\" Fetherston told the Daily Wire. \"And I, for the life of me, don\u2019t understand why he wasn\u2019t locked up. A man who admits he committed rape, you\u2019re just going to put in another shelter so he can rape again another day? It makes no sense.\"",
      "That shelter is also paid for by taxpayers and residents receive the full slate of benefits while staying there, according to The Maine Wire, which reports that the official report did not recommend that any criminal charges should be brought against Joseph.",
      "In another disturbing incident, Fetherston says that a 16-year-old female student says she was raped multiple times by a 29-year-old man.",
      "\"She told the police officer that she was raped multiple times. It was probably the most disturbing conversation I\u2019ve ever heard in my adult life,\" Fetherston told the Daily Wire.",

      "The man,\u00a0identified as Gladimy Rodene by The Maine Wire, was arrested, removed from the shelter and was reportedly issued an abuse prevention order, which forbade him from approaching the Marlborough Holiday Inn or the local High School where his victim is a student.",
      "Rodene reportedly sexually assaulted another girl, according to the Daily Wire, citing a report from a security guard recounting a statement from the original victim.",
      "A spokesperson for ICE told The Daily Wire that they do not have a detainer on either of the individuals.",

      "In August, ICE says it arrested 26-year-old Haitian national Cory Bernard Alvarez, accused of aggravated rape of a 15-year-old child in a Rockland migrant shelter.",
      "Fetherston also spoke about migrants fighting over microwave access and in one incident, a migrant drove a car into Fetherston\u2019s office, knocking him off his chair, in what he claims was retaliation for refusing to hand out diapers to migrants on government benefits.",
      "\"If you were receiving benefits and you were receiving those, then we were going to start scaling back on providing diapers, formula and wipes,\" Fetherston said. \"That did not go over well with the migrants. They thought that they were being attacked. A gentleman then drove his car into my office.\"",
      "Fetherston told the Daily Wire that his daily tasks included assisting migrants with enrolling in social services like food stamps and government health insurance. The migrants were given three meals a day from catering companies, and he purchased essential items such as toiletries, diapers, strollers and baby wipes for them.",
      "He also coordinated state-paid, same-day dry cleaning for the migrants and arranged Uber rides to work when needed. He added he was given an Amazon budget and other accounts to buy necessities for the migrants with no spending cap.",
      "\"They maybe have two days\u2019 worth of clothing on them and they have no toiletries, they don\u2019t have any IDs, they don\u2019t have anything,\" Fetherston told The Daily Wire. \"The state contract was that you provide everything that they would need. So a lot of the days you spent ordering.\"",

      "If Yoon one day enters a prison cell, it will likely shock no one in Korea. After all, the odds are not in his favor. Not counting Yoon, four of the last six democratically elected presidents of Korea have done jail time. Expressed as a percentage, that\u2019s more than 66%.",
      "Korean democracy looks storybook perfect, but consider this: Since World War II, the nation has had 13 heads of state. The first five were not paragons of democracy. Of those: one was forced to resign and flee the country, two were deposed in military coups, and one was assassinated by his close friend, who was also the head of South Korea's equivalent of the CIA.",
      "Out of the eight democratically elected presidents (which includes Yoon), all have been implicated in scandals. Even Kim Dae-jung, the late dissident-turned-president who won a Nobel Peace Prize, is now viewed less favorably after it emerged that he essentially bribed North Korea into holding an unprecedented inter-Korean summit meeting.",

      "So far, four elected Korean heads of state have served time in prison, two were impeached with one convicted and removed from office, one ex-president jumped off a 150-foot-high mountain cliff, dying by suicide in 2009 after his aides, relatives and even wife and son were investigated for bribery and other corruption charges. Since the country's founding, another two presidents have been sentenced to death but later pardoned.",
      "One would be forgiven for assuming the above were a script for a Korean TV drama series. Korea is a democratic, highly educated, extremely technologically advanced, conservative and deeply religious society. So, why do almost none of its ex-presidents end up enjoying a happy post-presidency?",

      "In South Korea, loyalty and deference to authority (alongside a host of other values, of course, such as hard work, thrift, and commitment to education) have created an economic powerhouse with electronics mega giant Samsung and rapidly growing carmaker Hyundai just two examples of globally respected Korean brands.

At the apex of the social hierarchy sits the president, who inhabits a bubble where questioning their judgment is a near taboo. As evidenced by the rap sheets, these leaders develop a strong tendency to see themselves as infallible, if not above the law.

      "Kittrie, who is also a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that \"accusers must prove Israel is killing Gaza civilians intentionally and simply because they are Palestinian rather than as an unfortunate consequence of Israeli self-defense against Hamas and its fighters.\"",

      "Adesnik, who has reviewed much of Amnesty International\u2019s writing on the post-Oct. 7 conflict, noted that there \"are only fleeting references to Hamas abusing civilian structures,\" such as \"schools, mosques, [and] UNRWA buildings.

      "Amnesty International\u2019s report alleges \"denial and obstruction of the delivery of essential services, humanitarian assistance and other life-saving supplies into and within Gaza\" by Israel.

      "The opinion shows a divergence from the position frequently pushed by president-elect Donald Trump, who has long championed an \"America first\" policy, which some fear could isolate the U.S. during a geopolitically turbulent time as Russia\u2019s aggression continues to ramp up in Europe, Iran remains a chief threat in the Middle East, and China continues to pose a threat politically, militarily and economically.",
      "\"I think it's really interesting to compare some of the campaign rhetoric that we saw, frankly, from both candidates, and see where that is and is not resonating with the American people,\" Rachael Hoff Policy Director at the Ronald\u00a0Reagan Institute, told Fox News Digital in reference to both Trump and his previous campaign challenger Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "The survey also found that since the annual poll began six years ago, \"a record high\" number of Americans support \"U.S. leadership and international engagement\" with a strong support for a global military posture.",

      "\"This represents a significant 15-point increase since just last year and a steady upward trend from a low-point in the early 2020s,\" the report said, noting that this shift was most prevalent among younger survey takers which saw a 32-point jump this year for those under the age of 30, along with a 19-point increase for those between the ages of 30 and 44.",
      "WHAT DOES PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP\u2019S WIN MEAN FOR US AMID WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA, UKRAINE?",
      "The drive for more U.S. involvement abroad particularly in East Asia, which includes areas like China and the Korean peninsula, the Middle East and Europe reflects the growing concern Americans have over not only the burgeoning alliance between Russia, Iran, North Korea and China, but on whether the U.S.\u00a0 military can stand up to these nations.",
      "While more than half of male survey takers, 59%, said they believe the U.S. could win a war against China, the female participants were more skeptical with only 45% expressing the same confidence, while 23% said they were unsure compared to 18% of male participants expressing the same.",
      "President Ronald Reagan waves to the crowd.",
      "More confidence in the U.S. military was displayed when asked if the U.S. could win a war against Russia, though again women signaled less confidence than their male peers, with 73% of male participants saying the U.S. would come out on top compared to only 56% of female survey takers.",
      "While it remains unclear why female participants were less confident in the U.S. military, the majority of survey takers collectively agreed that China is the U.S.\u2019s greatest threat, though Russia as the U.S.\u2019s chief enemy.",

      "\"One of the biggest trends that we've seen in the last three or four years in the poll is really the consensus growing that China is the is the greatest threat that we face \u2013 \u00a0that's really resonating with the American people, and it's something that clearly we've heard on a bipartisan basis from national security leaders in Washington,\" Hoff said. \u00a0That doesn't mean that Americans don't perceive Russia, Iran, North Korea, or even the cooperation between those malign actors as a threat.",

      "\"In fact, one interesting takeaway from our poll this year is that 85% of Americans, a huge percentage\u2026are concerned about the cooperation and collaboration between Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, and we're seeing that play out under the front lines in Ukraine,\" Hoff added. \"We're seeing it play out in the Middle East and it's something that Americans want our government to understand and to get after.\"",
      "Hoff explained that though the survey \u2013 which reflected information made clear in the lead up to and after the U.S. general election \u2013 showed Americans prioritize paying for domestic issues like healthcare, border security and social security above the military and foreign policy-based initiatives, national security and geopolitics remain a major issue for Americans.",
      "\"What we see from the poll across the board is that they don't see foreign policy and national security as something that they want to divest from,\" she said. \"When asked to sort of put those in competition with each other, that's where it gets really, really tough.",
      "\"But they clearly want their government to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,\" Hoff said. \"The perception that there's kind of a growing isolationist sentiment in this country really doesn't bear out in the data.",

And it turns out, when you ask the American people, that's simply not the case,\" Hoff said.",
      "\"They want America to lead from a position of strength. They want us to have a strong military,\" she continued. \"They want us to stand up for the values of freedom and democracy around the world.

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump has moved quickly to identify top officials for his next administration, but it hasn't all gone smoothly.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is building his second administration at a breakneck speed, announcing his choices for nearly all of the roughly two dozen top-tier nominations, including Cabinet posts, at earlier dates than he did when starting his first term. It\u2019s a sign not only that Trump\u2019s team has more experience than it did in 2016, but also that it has a much more defined sense of what it wants: loyalty.",
      "The expedited pace, however, has not come without setbacks and intrigue. Trump has long skipped the careful vetting of the backgrounds and financial records of potential picks that most incoming administrations undertake. This approach has led to surprise controversies and unexpected bumps for some of his more contentious choices.",
      "Trump has \u201cbotched up the nomination process pretty bad,\u201d a Republican senator said, adding, \u201cThey clearly aren\u2019t vetting these people.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also extensive jockeying between influential voices like Trump\u2019s sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and other transition staffers, including chief of staff Susie Wiles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 over there. I think Don Jr. has been trying to do things at times. It\u2019s like Susie will have a meeting and then Don Jr. will say something else,\" a transition source said, who said they were not implying there's any tension between the two, just that there are big personalities on the team. \"Some of it has been kind of weird.\u201d",
      "Trump Jr.\u2019s most overt influence to date was felt in his negative feedback of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for another administration role. Pompeo is now disliked by much of the MAGA base and faced direct pushback from Trump\u2019s eldest child.",
      "This account of the Trump transition effort is based on interviews with a dozen people familiar with or involved in the process. Many were granted anonymity to speak candidly or because they were not authorized to speak on the record.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump was re-elected by a resounding mandate from the American people to change the status quo in Washington. That\u2019s why he has chosen brilliant and highly-respected outsiders to serve in his Administration, and he will continue to stand behind them as they fight against all those who seek to derail the MAGA Agenda,\u201d Trump transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cAlongside his highly-qualified nominees, President Trump will shatter the Deep State and restore government that is controlled by the people.\u201d",
      "Though many of Trump\u2019s nominees appear poised for relatively easy confirmation, some of his highest-profile picks have become bogged down in controversy; two have already withdrawn their names from consideration, and others \u2014 most notably Pete Hegseth, Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary \u2014 may not have the votes to be confirmed. Trump also changed his mind and announced a new pick for White House counsel.",
      "For his first administration, Trump lost just one nominee. And even those who are moving forward this time have been the subject of, at times, internal fights among longtime Trump loyalists, family members and the newest \u2014 perhaps biggest \u2014 influence: tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\u201cI think he is around Musk more than anyone else,\u201d a Trump ally familiar with the transition said. \u201cThere are several of the traditional sort of transition tensions and fighting over picks, but Musk casts a huge shadow.\u201d",
      "Musk, who poured more than $250 million into helping Trump get elected, is not only co-chairing the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE \u2014 a nongovernmental entity that has promised to make $2 trillion in cuts to the federal budget \u2014 but he has also been a prominent voice on key picks, most notably Kash Patel, Trump\u2019s pick to be FBI director. Patel is a vocal backer who has spread baseless \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy theories, calling for the purge of perceived Trump enemies from within the FBI and to \u201cshut down\u201d the bureau\u2019s Washington headquarters on his first day in office.",
      "\u201cElon was the principal guy behind Patel,\u201d the Trump ally said. \u201cHe is a big reason he ultimately got picked.\u201d",
      "During Trump\u2019s first transition process, there was a tug of war between his MAGA movement and those seen as more traditional Republicans. This time, that\u2019s less the case. Not only are the voices in the president-elect\u2019s ear all generally philosophically aligned, but also Trump himself is taking a much more hands-on approach.",
      "\u201cNow he is coming in with a much clearer vision,\u201d the Trump ally said. \u201cHe has been in the job, so he knows exactly what the job is. And you know the No. 1 thing he wants is loyalty and competence.\u201d",
      "Another Trump ally, who notoriously views fighting among staff and decision-makers as a positive rather than a negative, said the president-elect is getting involved in more than just top-tier appointments.",
      "\u201cHe is not just interested in who the Cabinet secretaries are, but also looking at who the deputy secretary candidates are, as well as the assistant secretary candidates,\u201d the person said.",

      "\u201cI think you\u2019re seeing the campaign discipline translate to the transition,\u201d a transition source said.",
      "Among the most heated Cabinet fights is the one over Hegseth. The former Fox News host and Army National Guard veteran has been meeting with Republican senators over the past week in an attempt to alleviate concerns over allegations of drinking and his treatment of women.",
      "For many Trump supporters, the Hegseth nomination has become a litmus test for how loyal Republicans, specifically those in the Senate who would have to vote to confirm him, are to the president-elect\u2019s pledge to install people who will fundamentally remake key swaths of the federal government.",
      "Trump and his allies have already promised primary challengers for senators who do not vote to confirm Hegseth, including skeptics like Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who is a member of the Armed Services Committee and a veteran. MAGA adherents have turned their wrath on Ernst, believing that she wants the job for herself \u2014 even though she has not indicated so publicly.",
      "\u201cPeople in Iowa have a well-funded primary challenger ready against her,\u201d Charlie Kirk, founder of the influential conservative group Turning Point USA, wrote on social media. \u201cHer political career is in serious jeopardy.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has been defiant and pledged to keep fighting, and Trump has continued to back him, posting as recently as Friday morning that he \u201cis doing very well.\u201d",
      "But the Hegseth drama has spun off its own political intrigue, as a shortlist of potential replacements has been publicly discussed, including Ernst, Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty, former Trump administration Pentagon official Elbridge Colby, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt and most surprisingly, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "The DeSantis chatter has caught particular attention because he had an intense political rivalry with Trump during the 2024 Republican presidential primary and has a history of bad blood with several Trump staffers, including Wiles, who ran his 2018 gubernatorial campaign before the two had a falling out.",
      "\u201cWe have all advised him on the pros and cons here, and I think given him good advice,\u201d a Trump official said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, if he can get over it, why can\u2019t we.\u201d",
      "The emergence of DeSantis\u2019 name has also stirred up potential considerations for the 2028 presidential race. DeSantis is likely to once again consider a run for the White House, which many anticipate would put him on a collision course with Vice President-elect JD Vance, who is also expected to consider a run and would likely try to tap into the same pool of Trump voters DeSantis would need.",
      "Trump\u2019s transition team brushed off any concerns that potentially nominating DeSantis as defense secretary could elevate his presidential prospects.",
      "\u201cRon is not a full [Trump] convert, but he has a little star power, and that\u2019s something the president likes. There is media value there,\u201d a person involved in the transition said. \u201cAnd if we pull him in and hug him tight, he\u2019s part of our administration. He could not run against our administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen it becomes a personality test,\u201d the person added. \u201cJD wins that 100% of the time.\u201d",
      "The highest-profile defeat to date for Trump was around former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to be attorney general. Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration after it became clear an investigation into allegations of sex trafficking and sex with a minor would prevent him from getting enough votes to be confirmed. Gaetz was never charged and has denied the allegations.",
      "Six hours after Gaetz withdrew late last month, Trump nominated former two-term Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a longtime ally, as his replacement. Bondi\u2019s pick prompted some pushback over her past comments about prosecuting prosecutors who came after Trump, but she is widely considered to be a pick who will be able to secure Senate confirmation.",
      "Bondi did play an influential role in suggesting the other Trump pick who has withdrawn his name \u2014 Tampa-area Sheriff Chad Chronister, who was the president-elect\u2019s choice to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration, according to two sources familiar with the decision.",
      "Last week, Chronister posted on social media that he was pulling his name \u201cas the gravity of this very important responsibility set in,\u201d a claim quickly undercut by Trump himself. In his own post, Trump pointed to how Chronister handled the coronavirus pandemic, including a 2020 decision to arrest a Tampa-area pastor who flouted pandemic-era lockdown orders.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t pull out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI pulled him out, because I did not like what he said to my pastors and other supporters.\u201d",

      "But the speed at which things are moving and, at times, complicating some of Trump\u2019s nominations is part of an aggressive strategy that is by design.",
      "\u201cTrump is in a pretty aggressive mode of trying to shove the system as hard and as fast as he can,\u201d said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a staunch ally. \u201cIf 5% do not make it, he would regard that as a reasonable price for being as daring as he is and he will get 95%.\u201d",

      "At the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee meeting Thursday, Jim Jones, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for human foods, said it\u2019s been over a decade since the safety of the synthetic color additive Red No. 40 has been re-evaluated. \u201cWith Red 3, we have a petition in front of us to revoke the authorization board, and we\u2019re hopeful that in the next few weeks we\u2019ll be acting on that petition,\u201d he said.",
      "House Energy and Commerce Committee ranking member Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., also urged the FDA to ban Red No. 3, which is made from petroleum and gives food and drinks a bright cherry color.",
      "\u201cWith the holiday season in full swing where sweet treats are abundant, it is frightening that this chemical remains hidden in these foods that we and our children are eating,\u201d Pallone wrote in a letter to the agency. \u201cWhile food companies must ensure that the food they market is safe, they are also only required to ensure that their products meet FDA\u2019s standards. This means that thousands of products that contain this chemical can remain on the market.\u201d",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for health secretary, has claimed food dyes cause cancer, but has not said what he would do if confirmed to the Cabinet post \u2014 if anything \u2014 about artificial food dyes in American food.",
      "\u201cThere are some departments such as the nutrition departments in the FDA that have to go, that are not doing their job, they are not protecting our kids,\u201d Kennedy told NBC News in November.",
      "The FDA regulates more than three-quarters of the United States\u2019 food supply.",
      "All color additives must be approved by the FDA before they are used in food sold in the U.S. There are 36 FDA-approved color additives, nine of which are synthetic dyes. This includes the two red dyes facing federal scrutiny.",
      "Some of the same dyes that are used in food are also used in pharmaceutical drugs, but the dyes are approved separately for each use. In 1990, the FDA banned Red No. 3, also known as erythrosine, from cosmetics and topical drugs under the Delaney Clause, because the chemical was shown to be carcinogenic at high doses in tests on lab rats.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t believe there is a risk to humans,\u201d FDA\u2019s Jones said.",
      "Some of the dyes allowed in food in the United States are either banned or require a warning label in other countries. The European Union requires a warning label on products that contain three artificial food dyes approved in the U.S.:",
      "Yellow No. 5, also known as tartrazine.Red No. 40, also called E129 or Allura Red AC.Yellow No. 6, called sunset yellow or E110.",
      "Yellow No. 5, also known as tartrazine.",
      "Red No. 40, also called E129 or Allura Red AC.",
      "Yellow No. 6, called sunset yellow or E110.",
      "The required label warns that the additive \u201cmay have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is something called the precautionary principle, which is basically the thought that it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry,\" said Jerold Mande, an adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who is also a former FDA senior adviser and former deputy undersecretary for food safety at the Agriculture Department.\u00a0\u201cThe U.S. wears it as a badge of honor that we don\u2019t adhere to it.\u201d",
      "Other countries do not want to take a risk, even if data on potential harms is not conclusive, he said.",
      "\u201cThese food dyes only serve one function in food, to make them look pretty so you and I want to buy it, it\u2019s a marketing tool,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, principal scientist for food additives and supplements at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",

      "Some experts and consumer advocacy groups argue there is enough evidence showing some color additives may cause harm, particularly in children, to warrant a ban, but the FDA maintains that its approved artificial food dyes are safe when used in accordance with the agency\u2019s recommendations.",
      "An FDA advisory committee conducted a review of the possible link between artificial food dyes and hyperactivity in 2011 and determined that \u201ca causal relationship between exposure to color additives and hyperactivity in children in the general population has not been established.\u201d The agency revisited the issue in 2019 and maintained its stance. Regulatory agencies and scientists alike have reached conflicting conclusions about what research has found.",
      "\u201cThe most concerning is that we do so little science to understand the harms,\u201d Mande said, referring to research funded by the U.S. government.",
      "In a 2012 review of studies on artificial food dyes and ADHD symptoms, which included the research presented to the FDA in 2011, researchers concluded that artificial food colorings \u201care not a main cause of ADHD, but they may contribute significantly to some cases, and in some cases may additively push a youngster over the diagnostic threshold.\u201d",
      "The researchers also said that three landmark placebo-controlled studies conducted in children in the U.K., which have been cited as reason for banning or restricting the use of artificial dyes, \u201cwere barely sufficient to detect the statistically small but clinically important effects noted.\u201d",
      "The European Food Safety Authority also concluded in 2008 that the findings showed \u201ca lack of consistency.\u201d",
      "More than a decade later, officials completed the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, a 2021 review of all the available research that studied whether artificial food dyes may have an effect on human health. The conclusion: \u201cConsumption of synthetic food dyes can result in hyperactivity and other neurobehavioral problems in some children, and that children vary in their sensitivity to synthetic food dyes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe evidence now shows pretty conclusively that when some kids eat these, they will experience nervous system effects that look like ADHD,\u201d Galligan said. \u201cThere are 27 human clinical trials that show these dyes do in fact harm children\u2019s behavior.\u201d",
      "How the U.S. differs from Europe",
      "Red No. 40 was approved in 1971 and Red No. 3 and Yellow No. 5 were approved in 1969. At the time, the safety trials were conducted in animals, not people. Researchers have since tested safety in a mix of animal studies and a few placebo-controlled trials in children. \u201cWe really don\u2019t have the science we should have so these things are a little unclear, but these dyes and behavioral issues, there is an established connection,\u201d Harvard\u2019s Mande said.",
      "The government spends very little money researching synthetic food additives once they are approved, Mande said. Less than 5% of the National Institutes of Health\u2019s research budget goes to studying issues related to nutrition.",
      "Acute harms, such as poisoning, are well understood among FDA-approved products, Mande said, \u201cbut the effort to understand the effects in the long term or subtle things like behavior, we don\u2019t study that.\u201d",
      "The FDA lacks a formal way to review substances that are already in the food supply \u2014 known as a post-market review \u2014 which could allow unsafe additives to linger in the food system even as new research becomes available, said Jennifer Pomeranz, an associate professor of public health policy and management at the New York University School of Global Public Health.",
      "\u201cEven when there is an enormous amount of data, it can take decades to remove something that might be harmful from the food system,\u201d she said. \u201cThe FDA clearly needs more resources for post-market research because of these additives that have been in the food system for so long without any post-market review.\u201d",
      "This lack of follow-up sets the U.S. apart from Europe, Jones said at Thursday\u2019s committee meeting.",
      "\u201cThe biggest distinction between the U.S. and Europe is that they have been doing post-market review of chemicals for over 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe FDA, although we have authorization to do post-market review, there\u2019s no statutory mandate.\u201d",
      "That may change.",
      "In September, the FDA held a public meeting about proposed enhancements to re-evaluating chemicals that have been approved for use in food, including color additives. The agency also extended the public comment period to late January 2025.",
      "An FDA spokesperson said in an email that the food dyes it has approved are reviewed by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives.",
      "\u201cIn addition to evaluations and review by the FDA, the FDA supports and participates in the international risk assessments conducted under JECFA as a part of our post-market activities to ensure safety of substances added to food,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAll the colors listed have recently undergone assessments for safety in food by the JECFA and were found to be safe for use in food under current use conditions.\u201d",
      "States already banning the artificial food dyes",
      "States are already putting pressure on manufacturers to remove artificial dyes from food and beverages. In the last year, three states have introduced or passed legislation banning certain color additives.",
      "In October 2023, legislators passed the California School Food Safety Act. The law will ban six of the nine FDA-approved artificial food dyes \u2013\u2013 Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2 and Green No. 3 \u2013\u2013 in public school food and drinks by 2027.",
      "In April, Illinois lawmakers advanced legislation that would ban Red No. 3 in the state by 2028.",
      "New York legislators introduced a bill in February that would ban Red No. 3 in food and drinks in the state beginning in 2026.",
      "The moves, particularly in California, could push food manufacturers to remove the dyes from food nationwide, Mande said.",
      "\u201cThese food dyes are things that a lot of countries already don\u2019t allow. It\u2019s one thing to produce different foods for different countries, but to do it for different states is a nonstarter,\u201d he said.",
      "Some food manufacturers have already removed artificial dyes from their products.",
      "After years of pressure from the public, Kraft voluntarily removed synthetic dyes from its macaroni and cheese in 2015, replacing Yellow No. 5 and Yellow No. 6 with natural coloring. That same year, Nestl\u00e9 removed Red No. 40 and Yellow No. 5 from over 250 products, including candy bars.",
      "A ban on the federal level would be relatively simple, Center for Science in the Public Interest\u2019s Galligan said: \u201cThey just have to make the decision that it no longer meets the safety standard and issue a decision that it is no longer allowed in food.\u201d",
      "An FDA spokesperson told NBC News that it has reviewed the studies cited by California lawmakers in the California School Food Safety Act.",
      "\u201cThe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives, but some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email."

      "They were the soundtrack of the early 1990s.",
      "Swedish pop group Ace of Base took the world by storm with smash hits like \u201cThe Sign,\u201d \u201cAll That She Wants\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Turn Around.\u201d",
      "But just as quickly as they rose to fame, the group \u2014 consisting of siblings Jenny Berggren, Linn Berggren, Jonas Berggren and childhood friend Ulf Ekberg \u2014 all but disappeared from the spotlight.",
      "They have not performed together since the World Music Awards in May 1996.",
      "But now two band members are breaking their silence in a new three-part docuseries, \u201cAce of Base: All That She Wants,\u201d which premiered this week on Viaplay.",
      "\u201cWhat I wanted with the documentary is I wanted to tell the hardships, but I also wanted to tell how to get whole again,\u201d Jenny told NBC News NOW\u2019s \u201cTop Story\u201d in an exclusive interview.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a story that actually we made it really against all odds,\u201d Ekberg said. \u201cWhen nobody believed in us.\u201d",
      "Despite three Grammy nominations in 1995 and three times topping the Billboard Top 40 chart, Jenny said Ace of Base was never about becoming famous.",
      "\u201cMe, my sister, my brother are normal people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t go for fame. We didn\u2019t go for that money.\u201d",
      "As for why they went their separate ways, she explained, \u201cWhen you\u2019re wearing a crown that was big as a castle, it can be a bit tiring on the neck in the end.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the real story about Ace of Base has never really been told,\u201d Ekberg told NBC News. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a proper documentary made about us ... and the story behind it, and the ups and the downs.\u201d",
      "The docuseries, which was directed by Jens von Reis, features never-before-seen home video footage from before Ace of Base was a household name to the chaos that erupted when they became global superstars.",
      "\u201cI did have, like, 200 hours of film material from the early \u201990s until recent days, which I actually never watched,\u201d Ekberg recalled. \u201cBut [Reis] watched all the 200 hours and said, \u2018We have a gold mine here.\u2019\u201d",
      "Jenny hopes the docuseries will surprise longtime fans and even younger viewers who may not have heard of the band. Despite being a pop act, she said, \u201cWe had a message that there was so much darkness in the world, people were depressed, and we just knew that people wanted to have fun.\u201d",
      "A key interviewee in the series is music executive Clive Davis, who played a pivotal role in the band\u2019s American success.",
      "\u201cWithout [Davis], I\u2019m pretty convinced we would never have reached No. 1 in the U.S. So he definitely meant a lot for us,\u201d Ekberg said.",
      "Although Jonas Berggren was not interviewed for the series, he does appear briefly at the end. Linn, however, is the only member who does not make an appearance. She has deliberately remained out of the spotlight for more than two decades.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s living. She\u2019s leading her life,\u201d Jenny said of her sister. \u201cAnd she says, \u2018I want to be out of the eye. I want to be out of the tension.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite not having taken the stage together in decades, the group has experienced success on streaming platforms, with more than 11 million monthly listeners on Spotify.",
      "But does any of it mean a reunion could ever be possible?",
      "\u201cWe are doing different things. Everybody is on their own track. Everybody\u2019s over 50, and, as I say, the time they knock on my door, I got it all prepared,\u201d said Jenny, who\u2019s had a successful solo music career, including a new single released this week titled \u201cLion\u2019s Den.\u201d",
      "Ekberg wants a reunion and expressed hope that this docuseries could make the impossible a reality.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to push to make a reunion for the past 10 years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it has to work as well, and we have to be able to do a great performance for the fans that we can be proud of.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 11:48:00 GMT",
    "summary": "When the Michigan Wolverines hired Jim Harbaugh as their head coach in December 2014, the task was obvious: Beat Ohio State and return the school to national relevance.",
    "story": [
      "When the Michigan Wolverines hired Jim Harbaugh as their head coach in December 2014, the task was obvious: Beat Ohio State and return the school to national relevance.",
      "From 1997 until Harbaugh\u2019s hiring, the Wolverines had fallen behind their bitter rival, as the Buckeyes won two national championships and played for two others. Michigan, on the other hand, had no championship appearances. And from 2001 to 2019, the Wolverines had only two wins in 19 tries against Ohio State.",
      "Harbaugh would eventually get Michigan over the hump, beating the Buckeyes in each of his last three tries before winning a national championship after the 2023 season.",
      "Less than three weeks after winning his final game with the Wolverines, Harbaugh accepted the head coaching job with the Los Angeles Chargers. And now, his task is eerily the same: Beat the Kansas City Chiefs and return the Chargers to national relevance.",
      "While Los Angeles versus Kansas City isn\u2019t quite Ohio State versus Michigan, the Chiefs are the team standing in everybody\u2019s way in the NFL, but particularly their divisional opponents.",
      "For a stretch in the aughts, the Chargers were the elite of the AFC West. From 2004-09, they won the division in five out of six seasons. In the next three, they finished no worse than third.",
      "Since 2016, however, Kansas City has won the division every season. In that time, the Chiefs are also 12-3 against the Chargers, including five straight wins. (And for good measure, they\u2019ve also won three Super Bowls in five years.)",
      "Harbaugh, known for turning teams around dating back to his time as head coach at Stanford to his first NFL stint with the San Francisco 49ers, can\u2019t be expected to knock off Kansas City overnight. The whole league, after all, is searching for answers against quarterback Patrick Mahomes. But Sunday will be an interesting test to see how close Los Angeles is to its current chief rival.",
      "The Chiefs enter Sunday 11-1 and in first place in the AFC. At the same time, there are reasons to believe they are more vulnerable than in previous years.",
      "Only two of Kansas City\u2019s 11 wins have been by double digits. The team\u2019s last five wins have come by an average of 4 points. Even though they are tied for the NFL lead in wins, the Chiefs are only 11th in point differential \u2014 behind multiple five-loss teams.",
      "Mahomes, meanwhile, is averaging only 7.0 yards per attempt (tied with last season for a career low) and is on pace to throw the most interceptions he\u2019s ever had in a single season. His passer rating of 92.2 is also a career worst.",
      "Nobody is foolish enough to suggest Kansas City isn\u2019t actually good. But there\u2019s an argument to be made the Chiefs are more beatable than they have been in the last two seasons, both of which resulted in championships.",
      "After the Chargers finished last year 5-12, Harbaugh has the team on an 11-win pace this season. He has put less on the plate of phenom quarterback Justin Herbert \u2014 whose passing yards per game are at a career low \u2014 and instead leaned more on a physical rushing attack.",
      "The formula has worked so far, as Los Angeles is 8-4. It still needs to be proven against the best opponents, though, because the Chargers have only one win against a team currently over .500. And in the teams\u2019 first matchup earlier this season, Kansas City beat Los Angeles 17-10.",
      "Harbaugh is no stranger to big moments. He knocked off No. 1 USC as a 41-point underdog when he was coaching Stanford, beat Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers in the playoffs with San Francisco, and then finally found his way around Ohio State.",
      "Though not as quite high stakes as some of his previous wins, Sunday\u2019s game is the reason why Harbaugh will be on the Chargers\u2019 sideline."

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A plan to impeach South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived declaration of martial law has failed after members of his governing party left parliament on Saturday ahead of the planned vote.",
      "Lawmakers from the People Power Party (PPP) were shouted and cursed at as they left en masse after voting on a separate motion, leaving the 192 opposition lawmakers eight votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for the impeachment motion to succeed.",
      "Opposition lawmakers had said that if the impeachment motion didn't pass they would come back to it on Wednesday, amid simmering public anger over Yoon\u2019s bewildering order, which plunged the East Asian democracy and key U.S. ally into chaos.",
      "Earlier Saturday, Yoon apologized for his actions in a brief nationally televised address, saying they \u201cstemmed from the urgency\u201d\u00a0he felt as president but \u201ccaused anxiety and inconvenience to the public.\u201d",
      "\u201cI deeply regret this and sincerely apologize to the citizens who were alarmed,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI will not evade the legal and political responsibility regarding this declaration of martial law,\u201d Yoon continued, speaking for a total of just over two minutes before deeply bowing his head before cameras.",
      "He said he would not declare martial law a second time, a concern that had been expressed by some opposition lawmakers, and that his party would decide how long he should stay in office and how state affairs would be managed.",
      "Han Dong-hoon, the leader of the PPP, urged Yoon to step down, telling reporters after the address that it had become \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to carry out his normal presidential duties.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party and Yoon\u2019s rival in the 2022 presidential election, described the president\u2019s address as \u201cvery disappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Yoon\u2019s statement was completely out of touch with the public\u2019s expectations and further fueled a sense of betrayal,\u201d Lee said.",
      "\u201cThere is no other way but to leave office early.\u201d",
      "Six opposition parties began impeachment proceedings against Yoon this week. The opposition bloc holds 192 of the unicameral legislature\u2019s 300 seats, just under the two-thirds majority needed for the motion to pass.",
      "But the conservative PPP also remained formally opposed to a bill appointing a special prosecutor to investigate corruption allegations involving Yoon\u2019s wife. That bill was narrowly voted down on Saturday before PPP lawmakers left the chamber.",
      "Opposition lawmakers, by contrast, are adamant that Yoon be removed from office, as is much of the public. Large crowds of protesters have called for Yoon\u2019s ouster, while smaller ones have rallied in support of him.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t and cannot apologize only with words after attempting to stage martial law. The only way for President Yoon Suk Yeol to mean his apology is to resign now,\u201d Seoul resident Margie Kim\u00a0said after Yoon\u2019s address.",
      "A Gallup Korea poll released on Friday showed Yoon\u2019s approval rating at 13%, The Korea Times reported, down from 19% a week earlier.",
      "Lee, the Democratic Party leader, said Yoon\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional and illegal declaration of martial law\u201d had caused chaos and fear in the country of 50 million people, which spent decades under military-authoritarian rule before transitioning into a vibrant democracy and the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",
      "\u201cThe democracy of this nation that has been achieved through blood, sweat and tears is now being wrecked by an unruly power, and our people have suffered serious wounds to their national dignity and pride,\u201d he said Friday.",
      "Lee also expressed concern about how the martial law declaration might affect South Korea\u2019s relations with the U.S., noting that meetings of the U.S.-South Korea Nuclear Consultative Group that were planned in Washington this week had been postponed amid the turmoil.",
      "\u201cOur national credibility, as well as diplomacy, has been severely impacted,\u201d he said.",
      "Biden administration officials said they were not notified in advance that Yoon would declare martial law. But they have repeatedly reaffirmed the \u201cironclad\u201d nature of the U.S. alliance with South Korea, which it views as an important bulwark against North Korea, China and Russia, and which hosts almost 30,000 American troops.",
      "The U.S. relationship with South Korea \u201ctranscends any particular president or government on both sides of the Pacific Ocean,\u201d State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Thursday.",
      "Before his address on Saturday, Yoon, 63, a former chief prosecutor who took office in 2022, had not made any public appearances since lifting the martial law order early Wednesday after lawmakers defied a security cordon to enter the National Assembly building and voted unanimously to reject it.",
      "Since then, he has accepted the resignation of his defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who said he took full responsibility for what happened. Many other officials, including Yoon\u2019s chief of staff and all senior presidential secretaries, have also tendered their resignations.",
      "South Korean police and prosecutors are investigating claims of insurrection and treason against Yoon, Kim and Interior Minister Lee Sang-min.

      "The strategy led to \u201ca governor sowing intentional chaos against other states with no one stepping in to try and stop it,\u201d said Flores, an immigration policy advisor to the Biden and Obama administrations, who criticized the lack of federal intervention. \u201cThe cities\u2019 crisis eclipsed the border crisis, and it led to tremendous backlash.\u201d",
      "Other Texas efforts under Biden could serve as a model for what\u2019s to come under Trump, some experts said.",
      "\u201cTo the extent that there\u2019s coordination, or even cooperation, between the federal government and a state like Texas, it\u2019s possible that the sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d said Rick Su, a law professor at the\u00a0 University of North Carolina. \u201cThis may be the missing piece in what I think, at least for the Trump administration, what they intend to do.\u201d",
      "In 2021, Abbott declared a disaster at the border, opening the door to launch his Operation Lone Star to pay for the busing and provide $11 billion to deploy thousands of members in the Texas National Guard and Texas Department of Public Safety to the southern border and create new barriers, including 100 miles of razor wire and buoys in the Rio Grande.",
      "Earlier this year, Abbott signed an executive order requiring hospitals to ask about a patient\u2019s immigration status and track the amount of costs from treating undocumented immigrants.",
      "\u201cIt has been four years of advancing an agenda that we are very likely to see multiple states do the same under the Trump administration,\u201d Flores said. \u201cTexas has given us a preview of what was to come.\u201d",
      "The state also passed a law that challenged federal immigration authority and is \u201carguably one of the most unprecedented sort of modern laws with regard to immigration,\u201d Su said. The law, known as S.B. 4, would allow police officers to arrest migrants and impose criminal penalties. It would also empower state judges to order the deportation of people to Mexico. The measure\u2019s implementation has been on hold while it is challenged in court.",
      "But legal experts, including Su, are watching to see if Trump\u2019s Department of Justice backs off from that and other legal challenges on Texas\u2019 immigration policies that were undertaken by the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, that is just the beginning,\u201d Su said."

      "Predictably, Al's question sparked discourse in the comment section, which appeared divided on the topic.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought so when it was first out back in the day, but I do now!\u201d one Instagram user wrote in the comments. \u201cDie Hard brings the holiday vibes!\u201d",
      "In another comment, one user disagreed, writing, \u201cIt was originally released in the month of JULY\u2026that\u2019s not a Christmas movie !!\u201d",
      "Another user pointed out, \u201cThe movie literally takes place at a Christmas party,\u201d though another countered, \u201cSet during Christmas, but not a \u2018Christmas\u2019 movie.\u201d",
      "However, one commenter pointed out that the movie\u2019s star, Bruce Willis, has shared his own opinion on the question, writing, \"Bruce Willis said it himself, that it is NOT a Christmas movie, it\u2019s a Bruce Willis movie!\u201d",
      "Willis, who portrayed John McClane in the 1988 classic, revealed his side on the debate during the \u201cRoast of Bruce Willis\u201d in July 2018.",
      "At the time, Willis shared his motivation for participating in a roast, explaining, \u201cI did this roast for one reason and one reason only \u2014 to settle something once and for all.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow please, listen very carefully. \u2018Die Hard\u2019 is not a Christmas movie!\u201d Willis declared. \u201cIt\u2019s a g--damn Bruce Willis movie.\u201d",
      "In the decades since the action film premiered, many have weighed in on whether or not they put the movie in the Christmas category.",
      "Reginald VelJohnson, who portrayed Al Powell in the movie, hasn\u2019t necessarily shared his side of the argument but did tell TODAY in November 2018 that he\u2019s happy it\u2019s considered a holiday film.",
      "\u201cWhen we did it, we weren\u2019t thinking of it as a Christmas movie,\u201d he explained, before adding that his annual present from the film is a residual check. \u201cI\u2019m totally fine with it being one, though!\u201d",
      "Even Willis\u2019 wife, Emma Heming Willis, seemingly shared her opinion on the debate in December 2023.",
      "At the time, she shared an Instagram story filming the TV while watching \u201cDie Hard.\u201d In a simple caption to the video, she wrote, \u201cUs too.\u201d"

      "During every \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert, there comes a time that audiences are always waiting for: surprise-song o\u2019clock.",
      "This is when Taylor Swift sits down with just a guitar and a piano to play acoustic versions of two songs \u2014 sometimes mashups, sometimes not \u2014 that change between each show. And fans don\u2019t know what songs she\u2019s chosen that night until the surprise-song set starts.",
      "Swift kicked off the European leg of her \u201cEras Tour\u201d May 9 in Paris, fresh on the heels of releasing her 11th album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d on April 29. While the setlist saw some significant changes \u2014 including the addition of a new era \u2014 Swift upheld her tradition of performing surprise songs.",
      "After returning to the U.S. Oct. 18 for a run of shows in three more cities, Swift is currently closing out the \"Eras Tour\" in Canada.",
      "Last year, Swift said she\u2019d aim not to repeat surprise songs during the \u201cEras Tour,\u201d leaving fans to track each night\u2019s performances like detectives, watching their favorite songs get picked off in the lead up to their own concert date.",
      "But after Swift announced that she \u201creset\u201d the eligibility of all songs for 2024 and introduced twists, it\u2019s impossible to predict what she\u2019ll do next.",
      "Intrepid Swifties keeping record of all the songs Swift has performed have noted that, while there are several songs that have been played multiple times, there are some tracks from across her 11 albums that the singer has not sung at all during the \"Eras Tour.\" Those include:",

      "\u201cWe started making phone calls ... and reached out to as many former employees as we could find,\u201d she says. \u201cMany of them said, \u2018I\u2019ve been waiting for this call. Boy, do I have a story to tell you, and it\u2019s a wild one.\u2019 And at that point we were completely hooked.\u201d",
      "By the early 2010s, the Lisa Frank brand was fading. In 2013, its multicolored headquarters in Tucson, Arizona, which once employed hundreds of people, had just six remaining workers, according to the\u00a0Arizona Daily Star. Eventually, the factory was abandoned altogether.",
      "Lisa Frank has not disappeared, however. The brand\u2019s website still sells versions of its signature rainbow-hued backpacks, makeup kits and other accessories, and they are collaborating with brands including Crocs and Morphe.",
      "TODAY.com\u00a0has reached out to Frank for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "In response to producers\u2019 questions, Frank issued the following statement, which was shown at the end of each of the documentary\u2019s four episodes:",
      "\u201cI have loved art and have been an artist ever since childhood. Lisa Frank, Inc. is the result of that passion. I\u2019m incredibly grateful for the amazing artists and team members who helped bring my vision to life. I\u2019m so excited about the future, as the next generation takes the helm. Stay tuned \u2014 the best has yet to come!\u201d",
      "Who is Lisa Frank?",
      "Lisa Frank is the artist and entrepreneur who founded the Lisa Frank brand, which she launched in 1979.",
      "Frank, 70, was \u201ctotally a girly girl\u201d growing up, she said in an interview for Urban Outfitters\u2019 blog\u00a0in 2012.",
      "\u201cI was not a jock. When I was 12, my parents got me a loom, so I was a weaver. I loved to read, I loved to do artwork,\u201d she said.",
      "Frank realized the potential for turning her creativity into a business while studying art at the University of Arizona.",
      "\u201cOne day, I met a guy who said, \u2018Anything you draw I can have made,\u2019 so we started making things from my ideas,\u201d she told the Urban Outfitters blog. \u201cI also represented other people and sold their artwork, and then we realized that I was the one with the commercial sense, because if I said \u2018Make a teddy bear or a unicorn,\u2019 that was what sold.\u201d",
      "One of her earliest businesses was a brand called Sticky Fingers, which Frank described as \u201cjewelry all made up of plastic that I glued together with glue gun.\u201d",
      "Eventually, she rebranded Sticky Fingers using her own name, and Lisa Frank, Inc. (LFI) was born. The company was established in 1979, according to public records.",
      "The company boomed, bringing in more than $1 billion in retail sales between 1990 and 2005, the\u00a0Tucson Citizen reported in 2005.",
      "In 1994, Frank married James Green, an in-house illustrator hired in 1982 who later became the company\u2019s president and CEO in 1992,\u00a0per court documents, and gifted him 49% of LFI\u2019s shares, according to the same\u00a0court documents.",
      "Green, in the documentary and on his social media pages, has taken credit for \u201cestablishing the look and feel\u201d of Lisa Frank\u2019s signature art, which persists to this day. \u201cI am not the head artist. I am\u00a0the\u00a0artist,\u201d he said in an Instagram video posted after the\u00a0documentary aired.",
      "TODAY.com\u00a0has reached out to Green for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "Frank and Green have two sons, Hunter and Forrest. Their names were inspired by two characters from the Lisa Frank universe: Hunter the leopard and Forrest the tiger cub.",
      "\u201cWe had created both characters before the boys were born, and then when they were born, we thought, \u2018Oh my gosh, they really do fit their personalities!\u2019\u201d Frank told Urban Outfitters in 2012.",
      "Frank filed for divorce against Green in 2005, marking the beginning of a years-long legal saga involving the former couple and other Lisa Frank associates, including former executive vice president Rhonda Rowlette.",
      "Frank sued Green in 2005 to remove him as director, president and chief operating officer of LFI, and buy back his shares. The case went to trial in 2007 and ruled in favor of LFI, terminating\u00a0Green as director, per a 2009 appeal.",
      "\u201cI lost my titles, I lost my business, I lost my building, I lost everything else ... She owns everything. She owns my life\u2019s work,\u201d Green said in the documentary.",
      "Meanwhile, Frank fired Rowlette, who in turn sued her in 2006 for $2 million plus damages, saying that Frank had promised her that amount in the event that her job was terminated. LFI denied making any such promises and the claim was settled, per a\u00a0court filing.",
      "The docuseries also includes interviews with several former employees about their experiences at LFI. Many share anecdotes about times both Frank and Green allegedly treated them harshly.",
      "\u201cThey definitely felt like they were trying to break my spirit,\u201d Tony De Luz, an illustrator at LFI from 1996 to 2000, said in the documentary. \u201cI think that was the way they operated, was that they wanted people who took whatever s--- they piled on them.\u201d",
      "Green, in the documentary, denied treating employees unfairly and calls the allegations a \u201ccrock of s---.\u201d He said his ex-wife was the \u201ctyrant,\u201d not him.",
      "Why is Lisa Frank not in the \u2018Glitter & Greed\u2019 documentary?",
      "Frank is notoriously private. There are few photos available of her publicly, she seldom gives interviews and when she agreed to speak to Urban Outfitters on camera in 2012 in conjunction with LFI\u2019s former collaboration with the brand, she asked for her face to be obscured.",
      "She doesn\u2019t appear in \u201cGlitter and Greed: The Lisa Frank Story,\u201d which explores the inner workings of Lisa Frank, Inc and suggests that the behind-the-scenes reality of the company was anything but rainbows and unicorns.",
      "Director Arianna La Penne says they reached out to Frank multiple times, but she declined to be interviewed.",
      "\u201cI thought about Lisa Frank every day that I was making this ... I really wanted her to participate,\u201d La Penne says, but added she has \u201cno judgment\u201d about the media-shy Frank declining to take part.",
      "La Penne says if she did have a chance to speak to Frank, the first question she would ask her would be, \u201cWas it all worth it?\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the sense of, is she happy now with where she landed?\u201d La Penne says. \u201cBecause in this company\u2019s life, the personal and the professional were completely intertwined, so it\u2019s all connected and related. And I really would love to know what it\u2019s like in her head.\u201d",
      "Where is Lisa Frank now?",
      "Frank does not appear to have given an interview in years.",
      "However, her brand has an online presence. The Lisa Frank website continues to sell merchandise, including backpacks, wallets, makeup palettes and laptop cases, all in Frank's signature style.",
      "The website also highlights Lisa Frank\u2019s collaborations with brands including Crocs, Morphe, Casetify and Hotels.com.",
      "The brand\u2019s TikTok page, which has more than 739,000 followers, has been hinting at a Lisa Frank renaissance for a while now.",
      "One post from November 2023 shows two Lisa Frank mascots standing in front of what appears to be the revitalized rainbow-painted Lisa Frank headquarters in Tucson, Arizona.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re baaaack!\u201d reads the caption.",
      "\u201cWhen we casually make a major comeback,\u201d the brand captioned a similar TikTok post in April.",
      "One key figure in Lisa Frank\u2019s new chapter is her son, Forrest Green, who has served as Head of Brand and Chairman of LFI since 2018, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "Forrest Green has worked closely with his mother from a young age, according to a 2021 Bustle profile. Frank was not interviewed for the article, but Forrest Green, then 21, said on the record he was behind the brand's recently revitalized Instagram.",
      "Forrest Green said his mother used to pull him out of elementary school to sit in at meetings at LFI.",
      "\u201cOne time when I was probably 8 or 9, I closed the meeting like, \u2018All right, guys, this was awesome; what are the next steps?\u2019\u201d he told Bustle. \u201cThe licensing agent at the time looked at me and said, \u2018Well, I guess Forrest closed the meeting!\u2019\u201d",
      "In recent years, Forrest Green has worked to build the brand\u2019s social media following. He has said one of his goals is to tap into \u201890s nostalgia while redefining the Lisa Frank brand for the 21st century.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just so much possibility. More than just people saying, \u2018Make some folders again, make some stickers again,\u2019\u201d he told Bustle. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely part of the plan, but it\u2019s like people don\u2019t even know who we are at this point. Lisa Frank is a lifestyle and it needs to be treated as such.\u201d",
      "The story of Lisa Frank is no doubt complex but for Robertson, working on the documentary ultimately increased her appreciation for the brand.",
      "\"I love the Lisa Frank work now more than ever after having spent several years deep, deep, deep in the story, and after having become aware of a really complicated reality that existed behind the scenes at the company,\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "After interviewing several former Lisa Frank employees, Robertson says when she thinks of Lisa Frank, she sees the \"passions of all these people who left a part of themselves in it. And they want us to love that work. They want it to endure through the ages.\"",
      "As for the brand's future, Robertson says she has witnessed first-hand the ability of Lisa Frank designs to captivate a new generation.",
      "\"I think they have timeless appeal,\" she says. \"I remember as a girl, the attachment and attraction that I felt towards these objects and designs. And now I have a 6-year-old daughter, and she goes absolutely nuts for them.\""

    "summary": "The \"loathing\" dance is viral! \"Wicked\" choreographer Christopher Scott reacts to \"What Is This Feeling?\" taking over TikTok and the meaning behind the choreography.",
    "story": [
      "College dance teams, dance companies, organizations, even Frankie Grande have all put their own spin \u2014\u00a0literally \u2014 on a moment from \"Wicked.\u00a0\"",
      "The choreography from \u201cWhat Is This Feeling?\u201d is being re-created all over social media, and the trend doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s blowing my mind,\u201d Christopher Scott, the film\u2019s choreographer, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Now, Scott is helping viewers with their dancing skills. He recently posted a tutorial on how to perform the breakdown from the song's outro, recognized by the repeated refrain of \"loathing.\"",
      "The musical sequence, and perhaps one of the most widely circulating clips online, sees Glinda (Ariana Grande) and Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) express the depths of their disdain for each other during their early days at Shiz University.",
      "In the dance flooding TikTok, Glinda \u2014\u00a0then known as Galinda \u2014 marches with her school pals flanked behind her.",
      "Scott says it was one of the first group scenes filmed, as the movie was primarily choreographed in sequential order. When he initially showed the moves to his team of dancers, they loved it. Grande gave her blessing, too, he says.",
      "\u201cShe was like, \u2018Oh, my God!\u2019 That was one of the first things she\u2019s seeing of the work \u2014 which was pressure on me, because I want her to feel taken care of in this film,\" he says. \"So if she thinks the choreography is not strong, and she\u2019s a part of it, it can mess with people. So it\u2019s important to deliver for them.\"",
      "The dance is meant to physically invoke feelings of frustration, he says. The 25 seconds of viral choreography comes at the very end of the song, as Glinda and Elphaba's \"loathing\" reaches a fever pitch.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re slapping on the books. The way that they twist their body, because they\u2019re irritated by this woman. The thought of Elphaba is making them cringe,\u201d Scott says of the sharp, staccato dance moves.",
      "\"Wicked\" is filled with memorable dance sequences, including the tear-jerking Ozdust Ballroom duet, in which Glinda and Elphaba finally move from enemies to friends.",
      "So why did this section go so viral?",
      "\u201cI think a big part of it is because it came from a place of being connected to the music,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI do think that tapping on the books gave a rhythm for people to become kind of musicians. And I think that level of fun is all part of it.",
      "\"When you're watching it, it\u2019s like, 'I want to play in that space. I want to be one of those people in Glinda\u2019s crew. And I want to become a part of the movie,'\" he adds.",
      "One of Scott\u2019s favorite interpretations that he\u2019s seen so far has fittingly been from the Broadway cast of \"Wicked.\" The stage musical that inspired the 2024 and 2025 films has been running at the Gershwin Theatre since 2003 and currently stars Mary Kate Morrissey as Elphaba and Alexandra Socha as Glinda.",
      "\u201cWatching them re-create the choreography from the film that was a re-creation of what they created made me feel like I\u2019m part of the family of \u2018Wicked\u2019 and not just the outsider that got to do the film,\u201d Scott says.",
      "Scott started working with \"Wicked\" director Jon M. Chu 15 years ago, including most recently on 2021's \"In the Heights,\" based on Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical of the same name.",
      "Scott choreographed the show-stopping number \u201c96,000,\u201d which featured dancers performing styles of dance inspired by Busby Berkeley, ballet, bone-breaking and more \u2014 all in a swimming pool.",
      "Scott recalls the memorable way Chu asked him to be a part of \"Wicked.\" In March 2022, Chu surprised Scott with a hat from the Broadway musical and said, \u201cYou ready to choreograph 'Wicked'?\u201d",
      "Then it was time to get to work on the monumental task at hand, Scott says.",
      "Here's how he pulled off some of the film's most memorable dance sequences.",
      "'Dancing Through Life'",
      "Scott says he leaned into each actors\u2019 strengths. For instance, once he learned Jonathan Bailey, who plays Fiyero, did gymnastics as a kid, Scott incorporated the actor's exceptional front walkover into the introduction of \u201cDancing Through Life.\u201d",
      "That number, set in a library at Shiz University, features a physical wheel, known as a tornado wheel, that the actors dance on, slide off, climb up and more throughout the song.",
      "\u201cThere was actually a question on whether or not they were going to let the actors in the space, because for insurance purposes,\" Scott says.",
      "For Ethan Slater\u2019s role as Boq, Scott used the actor's existing climbing skills from starring in Broadway's \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" in the \"Dancing Through Life\" choreography.",
      "\"If (Slater) auditioned as a performer going into the tornado wheel, he would have booked the job,\" he says. \"It\u2019s very rare you have an actor that can do all of that stuff, to music and the timing.\"",
      "Ozdust Ballroom duet",
      "\"Dancing Through Life\" smoothly transitions into a party scene set off-campus at the \"scandalocious\" Ozdust Ballroom. While Glinda and Fiyero dance the night away, Elphaba arrives wearing a pointy black hat that Glinda had encouraged her to wear, becoming the laughingstock of the party.",
      "Putting on a false confidence, Elphaba starts to dance alone in the middle of the room, before Glinda hesitantly joins her, learning the moves as they go. And with the popular girl's buy-in, the rest of the attendees start dancing, too.",
      "The secret sauce for the scene was to not teach the dancers the choreography that Elphaba and Glinda do in the center of the dance floor to make the moment feel organic.",
      "\u201cI want to make it believable. I hate when a movie in five seconds, someone does a move and everyone knows the move,\u201d he says.",
      "Erivo had been practicing the choreography for days. Grande, however, was introduced to it briefly.",
      "\u201cWe taught her a very little bit of the movement. Then we just follow along. And she just went with it,\u201d Scott says.",
      "'A Sentimental Man'",
      "For those wondering, yes, it is indeed Jeff Goldblum tap dancing before his song \u201cA Sentimental Man.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe knows how to tap. He\u2019s a jazz musician. He\u2019s a mover. That man is musically brilliant. I have video. It\u2019s one of my favorite things I own, and I am going to keep it in my little vault,\u201d Scott says.",
      "To first learn just how Goldblum could move, Scott put on a Frank Sinatra track and freestyled with Goldblum in the room.",
      "\u201c\u2018You got to give the people \u2014\u00a0rat-a-tat-a-tat \u2014 what they want.\u2019 That\u2019s him (tapping),\" Scott says of Goldblum's mini song and dance at the Emerald City palace.",
      "\"We got to set the record straight. And that\u2019s him behind the curtain,\u201d Scott adds. \u201cThat is 100% Mr. Goldblum, national treasure at its finest, dancing his face off.\u201d"

      "\"I've been kind of doing this in front of the public and kind of been, you know, a specimen in a petri dish, really, since I was 16 or 17,\" Grande explained, adding that commentary about her appearance has been a constant presence in her life. \"I've heard every version of it, of what's wrong with me, and then you fix it, and then it's wrong for different reasons.\"",
      "This isn't the first time Grande has spoken on this topic. In April 2023, she addressed the mounting speculation she faced about her health and body with a post on TikTok.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to address your concerns about my body and talk a little bit about what it means to a person with a body and to be seen \u2026 to be paid this close attention to,\u201d she explained.\u00a0 \u201cI think we should be gentler and less comfortable commenting on people\u2019s bodies, no matter what.\u201d",
      "In her interview with Sally, Grande acknowledged that the experience of such criticism isn't isolated to just celebrities.",
      "\"Even just the simplest thing, your appearance, you know, you're young, and you're hearing all kinds of things, it's hard to protect yourself from that noise,\" she said. \"Even if you go to Thanksgiving dinner and someone's granny says, 'Oh, my God, you look skinnier, what happened?' or 'You look heavier, what happened?' It's like, that is something that is uncomfortable and horrible no matter where it's happening, no matter the scale it's happening on.\"",
      "The Grammy winner underlined the dangers of this tendency to take it upon ourselves to comment on others' appearances.",
      "\u201cIn today\u2019s society, there\u2019s a comfortability that we shouldn\u2019t have at all, commenting on others\u2019 looks, appearance, what they think is going on behind the scenes, or health, or how they present themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a comfortability that people have commenting on that that I think is really dangerous.\u201d",
      "She went on to\u00a0credit her personal support system for keeping her grounded and confident.",
      "\"I'm really lucky to have the support system that I have and to just know and trust that I'm beautiful,\" she said. \"I know what the pressure of that noise feels like. It's been a resident in my life since I was 17, and I just don't invite it in anymore. It's not welcome.\"",
      "The singer also took some credit for herself, noting that she's learned how to focus on what matters to her most when the pressure becomes too loud.",
      "\"I have work to do. I have a life to live. I have friends to love on. I have so much love, and it's not invited, so I don't leave space for it anymore,\"\u00a0she said before encouraging others to do the same for themselves. \"You keep yourself safe, because no one has the right to say shit.\""

      "He revealed that his last day on set included a scene with Marisa Ramirez, who has played Detective Maria Baez since Season Three, and Moynahan, who portrays Erin Reagan. Wahlberg said Selleck also decided to go to set that final day even though his character, Frank Reagan, rarely shares scenes with Wahlberg\u2019s Danny.",
      "\u201cHe was there watching and I looked across the room and saw him standing there. And Tom, you know, he\u2019s a really serious, focused man. He likes to cover up his emotions. He doesn\u2019t like to show vulnerability,\u201d Wahlberg explained. \u201cAnd I looked across and he had tears in his eyes.\u201d",
      "Wahlberg started to tear up as he continued, \u201cThat memory for me still brings up a lot for me. Because it kind of made me reflect on not just the 14 years of the show, but my whole life\u2019s journey.\u201d",
      "The New Kids on the Block member said he grew up watching Selleck on television and that that interaction filled him with \u201ctremendous humility.\u201d",
      "He didn\u2019t just take memories from the \u201cBlue Bloods\u201d set. Wahlberg recently told People that he decided to snag a few sentimental items, as well.",
      "\u201cI took my two Danny Reagan costumes \u2014 my blue suit and my dress blues,\u201d he shared. \u201cI put them on mannequins and put them in a Wahlburgers.\u201d",
      "He added that he took the Reagan family\u2019s famous dining table, which has been featured in every episode, too.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ll set it up where fans can sit at the table and take pictures,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m going to raffle it probably for charity for the DEA, the Detectives Endowment Association, for the Widows and Children\u2019s Fund.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 18:35:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Inspired by Rachel Yoder\u2019s novel, \"Nightbitch,\" recently adapted to a film starring Amy Adams, I transformed into a dog named Sparkles to connect with my son.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 2023 two seemingly unrelated events happened to me: I hit a rough patch with my then 4-year-old, and I picked up the novel \u201cNightbitch\u201d by Rachel Yoder. Usually I resisted what I deemed \u201cmommy lit\u201d (obviously a mistake on my part related to ingrained internalized misogyny), but the raw slab of steak on the novel\u2019s cover called to me. At the time I was struggling externally with my son\u2019s behaviors and internally with my identity as a parent.",
      "\u201cMother\u201d wasn\u2019t a label I clamored to claim.",
      "When my firstborn arrived, I was struck by the obvious: overwhelming love, anxiety and a newfound sense of responsibility. Within hours of my son\u2019s birth, another more bizarre feeling cropped up: the urge to hide from my new title of mother. This was likely due to the well-worn knowledge that the label \u201cmother\u201d was the fastest way to detach a woman from herself, more disconnecting even than \u201cwife.\u201d All women, whether or not they are married or have children, are brought up to outstrip themselves from their natural selves. We are taught to adjust our emotions, looks and desires to fit within societal boxes. This push to conform is even more compounded for mothers.",
      "Personal history and pop culture had taught me that mothers were not fully formed people, but rather caricatures with hardened truths. Mothers were supposed to be instinctual,\u00a0self-scarifying, pleasant, asexual and fully devoted at all times.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want to be or be seen as a reduction of a person, so I kept my distance from mommy-related tropes and hoped my friends without children didn\u2019t see me as \u201cone of those\u201d moms.",
      "I didn\u2019t want to be or be seen as a reduction of a person, so I kept my distance from mommy-related tropes and hoped my friends without children didn\u2019t see me as \u201cone of those\u201d moms.",
      "Other women I knew were also fighting the overshadowing title of \u201cmommy.\u201d One friend confided in me that she didn\u2019t allow her cycling instructor to become Instagram friends with her because she didn\u2019t want him to know she was a mom. She revered this 50-minute space where once a week someone thought she was a mysterious, possibly sexy, unattached woman out in the world. Instinctively she knew his knowledge of her full identity would dissolve this.",
      "And then came \u201cNightbitch.\u201d",
      "I read along as the mother narrator struggled with her own feral son. In the book, it was taking her hours to put him to bed, which brought about a nighttime rage in her that at times turned her so dissimilar and intense that it frightened her son and husband. I was intimately familiar with that particular rage and had never seen it discussed anywhere or with any of my mom friends. I relayed this matching sensation to my wife, who then happily referred to me as Nightbitch during my own bouts of evening anger. In the novel, I read as the nameless mother struggled with feeling disconnected from her old creative self, and with the push and pull of wanting to be with her child while simultaneously far away from the domestic. While it wasn\u2019t a life-changing read at first, I welcomed seeing the reflection of the mundane and exhausting mirrored back.",
      "In my own home, nothing was making my kid happy. Seemingly overnight everything according to him was \u201cstupid\u201d or \u201cboring,\u201d and worse, he was resistant to everyday routines. At night he chucked his toothbrush across the bathroom and screamed in protest, and in the morning he greeted my singsong wake-ups with animal howls (and hurling stuffed animals). I attempted reward charts, talking to him man-to-man, and yelling (and then apologizing because I\u2019m a millennial gentle parent). Finally I gave up hoping it was a phase.",
      "But I kept reading. One night as we sat side by side on the couch, him watching \u201cPeppa Pig,\u201d me consuming \u201cNightbitch,\u201d the following passage jumped out at me: \u201cShe likes the idea of being a dog. She can run free if she wants. She can be a body and instinct and urge. She can be hunger and rage, thirst and fear, nothing more.\u201d",
      "I put down the book and thought about what it would feel like to crawl around on all fours. To bark. To not communicate through words. To not resist hunger, or tamper my rage. Like a dog, what would it be like to allow all the parts of myself to just be, without twisting them into a more presentable package? After all, this was the issue with motherhood (and womanhood, really): We are expected to hide our mess. It might feel great to be an animal \u2014 all id, no ego, I thought. But how silly would that be? I wrangled my kid to bed while the lingering thoughts of trotting around my apartment on my hands and knees played in the backdrop of my mind.",
      "The next morning, with nothing to lose, I decided to go full Nightbitch. When I went into my son\u2019s room, I didn\u2019t sing or give the typical good morning salutation. I turned on the light, dropped to the ground and crawled inside, making high-pitched barking sounds. His sleepy eyes opened. He stared at me, confused, but not mad.",
      "\u201cRuff, ruff,\u201d I barked, climbing into his bed, licking his face and nuzzling him awake. Of course, he was thrilled. I proceeded to carry him his clothes piece by piece using my mouth, and maintained barking sounds as encouragement while he got dressed.",
      "Without questioning what happened to his mom, my son happily pet me. \u201cSparkles,\u201d he quickly decided, inventing my dog name.",
      "The more I read \u201cNightbitch,\u201d it was illuminated that as the narrator mother leaned into her nature, hunger and desires, the more she felt like herself, even with her updated mother identity. Leaning in caused her to feel better. She mothered better. In a favorite scene, Nightbitch and her son sloppily chow down on chunks of raw meat at the playground in front of gobsmacked parents. Finally, they are a team \u2014 a pack. I realized that while I can\u2019t always throw societal norms out the window, the idea of connecting with myself and my kid in ways that felt natural was a good place to start."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear an unusual case in which Congress intervened to help victims of terrorism sue Palestinian entities.",
      "At issue is whether the 2019 law, called the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, unconstitutionally violates the due process rights of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA).",
      "Congress, which rarely gets involved in specific cases, stepped in twice after the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said U.S. courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the claims.",
      "The underlying lawsuits are brought under a law called the Anti-Terrorism Act by various victims, including the family of Ari Fuld, an American citizen who was killed by a Palestinian terrorist at a West Bank shopping mall in 2018. Other plaintiffs involved in the litigation had previously won a $655 million judgment that the lower court threw out.",
      "The legal question is a technical one on whether the defendants \"consented\" to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. Congress forced their hand in the 2019 by saying it was assumed they had consented if two conditions were met.",
      "One condition is that the defendants paid a terrorist convicted of or killed while committing a terrorist attack. The other is that the organization in question conducted any activity within the U.S. within 15 days after the law was enacted.",
      "The PLO represents the Palestinian people internationally, while the PA exercises domestic government authority.",
      "At the heart of the PLO and PA arguments is that Congress inappropriately forced them to consent to be sued, thereby violating their due process rights, and that the law is therefore unconstitutional.",
      "The Biden administration asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, with Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar writing in court papers that the lower court rulings undermine Congress' conclusion that the 2019 law was \"an important measure to further U.S. interests and protect and compensate U.S. nationals.\" The victims of terrorist attacks filed a separate petition.",
      "Lawyers for the PLO and PA said in response that both defendants \"have consistently objected\" to being hauled before U.S. courts for more than a decade."

      "JERUSALEM \u2014 The ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah appeared on the verge of collapse this week \u2014 something that is not a surprise to many Israelis.",
      "Both sides accused the other of violating last week\u2019s ceasefire arrangement. On Monday night, Israeli strikes on two southern Lebanese villages killed at least 10 people, Lebanon\u2019s Public Health Ministry said. That was a response to an earlier Hezbollah attack on Israeli military positions in the disputed Shebaa Farms, which itself was in retaliation for what the militant group said were multiple ceasefire violations.",
      "While Israel says it has achieved its military goals of weakening Hezbollah, the ceasefire that went into effect Nov. 27 did not resolve, from its perspective, a major systemic issue: how to make sure Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s most powerful proxy group, does not threaten Israel with an incursion like Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were kidnapped.",

It also comes as another blow to Israel\u2019s contention that its conduct has been justifiable.",

      "Rebel forces entered the Syrian city of Hama and forced out government troops Thursday in a development that may have significant consequences in the country's 14-year-long civil war.",
      "Both the Syrian Defense Ministry and an official from the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, known as HTS, said that insurgents had gained access to the country\u2019s fourth-biggest city and that despite fierce fighting, the troops of the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had left the city.",
      "Hassan Abdul-Ghani, senior commander of the HTS-led forces, told NBC News that tanks had been used during the incursion and that fighters had \u201centered the Hama Central Prison and freed hundreds of unjustly imprisoned individuals.\u201d",
      "In a statement on Facebook, the Syrian Defense Ministry said that rebel groups \u201cmanaged to penetrate several positions within the city and enter it\u201d and that \u201cto safeguard the lives of the civilian population in Hama and to avoid involving them in urban combat, the military units stationed there have redeployed and repositioned outside the city.\u201d",
      "NBC News was unable to independently confirm claims by either side because independent journalism is very difficult in Syria, owing to the rapid changes in territory held by different groups and the repression of media by the official government.",
      "Syria\u2019s civil war has dragged on for almost 14 years but had died down since 2020, when battle lines between Assad's forces and a patchwork of insurgent groups became solidified.",

      "\u201cIt was really surprising that they managed to make it into Aleppo,\u201d said Samuel Ramani, an associate fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute think tank. \u201cThis is certainly beyond anyone\u2019s expectations \u2014 Hama\u2019s a critical logistical area between Aleppo and Damascus.\u201d",
      "The taking the city of Hama by HTS-led forces could prove pivotal in shifting the balance of the civil war. The city has never before been in rebel hands and has been the site of more than one bloody crackdown by both Assad's regime and that of his father, Hafez al-Assad.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge humiliation for Assad, and it comes at a time when he was confident in his long-term position, focusing on doing a deal with the Trump administration and guarding from spillovers from the Gaza and Lebanon wars \u2014 neither Damascus nor Moscow expected a second Syrian civil war,\u201d added Ramani, who is also an international relations lecturer at the University of Oxford.",
      "Charles Lister, the director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said in an interview that if Hama were to fall to the rebels, their next target will be the strategically important and central city of Homs, which is around 30 miles south of Hama.",

    "story": [
      "In the messy patchwork of conflicts raging across the Middle East, one country has been absent from the spotlight: Syria.",
      "A civil war that dominated international headlines for more than a decade has now been reignited after a coalition of Syrian rebels launched a lightning offensive last week, seizing Aleppo, the country\u2019s second-largest city, from President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime.",
      "The rebels took only hours to recapture territory that Assad\u2019s forces had spent years reclaiming. Fighter jets from Syria and its ally Russia soon began bombing the area \u2014 killing hundreds of the rebels but civilians, too, according to a leading monitoring group.",
      "\u201cThis is a very unstable situation with a huge amount of flux,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "Some anti-Assad activists hope it could herald the crumbling of a depleted regime; others fear the brutality of the Russia-Syrian response \u2014 as well as the hard-line ideology of the Islamist rebels themselves.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear how this may affect the 900 or so American troops still in the region, or the remnants of the Islamic State terror group that they are there to fight and that the Pentagon has warned may be regrouping.",
      "Here\u2019s what we do know:",
      "What happened?",
      "With little warning last Wednesday, a coalition of Syrian rebels launched a rapid assault that soon seized Aleppo as well as towns in the nearby Idlib and Hama provinces, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group.",
      "The rebels are being led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which grew out of a former al Qaeda affiliate called Jabhat al-Nusra and is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the United Nations and others.\u00a0The State Department has a $10 million bounty for information about its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani.",
      "However, some analysts say the group has \u201cgreatly moderated\u201d its positions, as Robin Yassin-Kassab, author of \u201cBurning Country: Syrians in Revolution and War,\u201d wrote this week. \u201cIt\u2019s still an authoritarian Islamist militia\u201d but \u201chas a much more positive policy towards sectarian and ethnic minorities than ISIS,\u201d he said.",
      "For these anti-Assad observers, the group presents an opportunity to topple the brutality of his regime and its Russian and Iranian benefactors.",
      "But after the rebels\u2019 offensive, Syrian and Russian fighter jets responded by launching airstrikes on the rebel-held areas, with Assad\u2019s government claiming to have killed more than 400 of the \u201cterrorists.\u201d",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the number of rebels killed in five days of fighting at 244, with 61 civilians killed alongside 141 government troops.",
      "Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered his full support to Assad and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would do likewise. And on Monday, Iran-backed militias based in Iraq crossed the border into Syria to support the government there, according to the Observatory.",
      "Why is this happening now?",
      "Syria\u2019s time on the back burner of international attention is also one  reason it has roared back into prominence, some experts say.",
      "Assad once looked like he might be toppled by the diverse group of rebels that rose up against him after the Arab Spring of 2011. That he has survived was largely because of the intervention of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s Lebanon-based proxy.",
      "Russia\u2019s indiscriminate bombing, in particular, turned the tide against the rebels. It also transformed then rebel-held cities such as Aleppo and Homs into moonscapes of rubble and rebar. In all, the U.N. has documented more than 350,000 deaths but says this is \u201ccertainly an undercount.\u201d",
      "Today, however, Russia, Iran and Lebanon are distracted and depleted.",
      "Russia\u2019s primary focus is on the war in Ukraine, where it is locked in an attritional battle of trenches, tanks and mud with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Washington-backed government in Kyiv. In recent years Moscow has withdrawn assets from Syria, potentially weakening Assad\u2019s grip on power, experts say.",
      "Likewise, Iran has taken a hit at the hands of Israel, which has gutted Hezbollah\u2019s leadership and targeted its missile arsenal, while also fighting Hamas in Gaza.",
      "\u201cIranians have also shown that their forces are stretched and perhaps not as powerful as people get them credit for,\u201d said Hellyer, the Russia analyst who was speaking from Cairo. All of this \u201cputs Assad in a much weaker position.\u201d",
      "But \u201cthe Syrian regime, in coordination with the Russians and less so the Iranians, will hit them with everything they\u2019ve got,\u201d he added.",
      "Washington and ISIS",
      "Less clear is what role, if any, the U.S. may play.",
      "As well as the American troops based in Syria, there are another 2,500 in neighboring Iraq that are part of a residual 80-country coalition to prevent ISIS from regrouping.",
      "However, it\u2019s far from certain these forces will remain there after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. He twice threatened to withdraw these troops during his first term.",
      "But the ISIS threat has not gone away, despite the group being purged in 2017 from the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq over which it had governed.",
      "In July, the Pentagon warned ISIS attacks were on track to double year-on-year.",
      "If HTS were to seize the city of Deir el-Zour \u2014 a former ISIS stronghold \u2014 then ISIS could be freer to expand its influence across the east of the country, some analysts believe.",
      "\u201cAs Assad\u2019s regime moves resources to the northwest\u201d to try to fight off the rebels, \u201cISIS will reap the rewards, filling vacuums\u201d elsewhere,  Charles Lister, director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said in a post on X.",
      "If Assad were to fall altogether, Iran may no longer be able to use Syria as a pipeline of weapons and other supplies to Hezbollah, the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington-based think tank, said in a briefing.",
      "However, any hopes for Assad's ouster should be tempered by who or what might replace him.",
      "\u201cMuch as I oppose the Assad regime, its atrocities and abuses, what is happening in Aleppo right now is terrifying. Many will die,\u201d Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, posted on X. \u201cIf there was a chance of a lovely peaceful outcome to the benefit of Syrians, I will be thrilled.

But the country of 50 million people spent decades under military-authoritarian rule, with martial law frequently declared and those who resisted it sometimes killed.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of people were concerned about what soldiers on duty who were being deployed to implement martial law were going to do,\u201d said Eun A Jo, a postdoctoral fellow at the\u00a0Dickey Center for International Understanding\u00a0at Dartmouth College. \u201cAnd thankfully, this time around, we didn\u2019t see any bloodshed.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe division that was deployed were the folks who are trained to basically implement some of the hardest tasks vis-a-vis North Korea,\u201d which South Korea technically remains at war with, Jo said. \u201cSo I think when they were deployed, they were under the impression that this had something to do with that. But then they ended up at the National Assembly.\u201d",
      "Their job was to prevent lawmakers from entering, since the legislature\u2019s operations had been banned under the martial law proclamation.",

      "As the initial shock of the events has worn off, South Koreans have called for Yoon to resign or be impeached, with tens of thousands of people expected to rally in Seoul on Saturday. A vote to impeach him was in doubt on Saturday after lawmakers from Yoon\u2019s governing People Power Party left parliament en masse.",
      "A long road to democracy",
      "South Korea, which was founded in 1948 after the division of the Korean Peninsula into the Soviet-occupied north and the U.S.-occupied south, experienced martial law multiple times under its first president, Syngman Rhee, who used it to suppress communists.",
      "Anti-corruption protests forced Rhee to step down in 1960. His successor, Yun Bo-seon, was ousted the following year by South Korean army officer Park Chung-hee, who was also fond of using martial law to crack down on dissent.",
      "Park was assassinated in 1979. His successor, Choi Kyu-hah, was ousted in a military coup by Chun Doo-hwan, who ruled for eight years.",
      "The last time martial law was declared in South Korea was by Chun in 1980. In response, a pro-democracy uprising led by students and civilians broke out in the southern city of Gwangju.",
      "Hundreds of people are estimated to have been killed in the military crackdown that followed.",
      "The uprising was a pivotal moment in South Korean history, Jo said, that marked the country\u2019s last attempt at democratization before it was achieved in 1987.",
      "\u201cThe history of Gwangju is something that we grow up with,\u201d she said.",
      "The difference between the soldiers who were deployed to enforce martial law in the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s and the ones deployed this week, Jo said, \u201cis that these soldiers are of a different generation, and they know the history of South Korean dictatorship far better.\u201d",
      "Yoon may have taken a different lesson from South Korean history, said Rob York, director for regional affairs at\u00a0Pacific Forum, a foreign policy research institute in Honolulu.",
      "During South Korea\u2019s period of military dictatorship, \u201cthere were a couple of coups that took place that were designed to break gridlock, I guess you could say, and take decisive action to shore up the country\u2019s future,\u201d York said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what Yoon was trying to replicate.\u201d",
      "But unlike the architects of past coups, Yoon \u201cdid not really understand that he didn\u2019t have the kind of hold on the military,\u201d York said, \u201cand didn\u2019t even have a hold on his own party in that regard.\u201d",
      "Yoon, who accused opposition lawmakers of obstructing the government and sympathizing with North Korea, appeared to expect that the South Korean military and the country\u2019s anti-communist elements \u201cwould coalesce around him the way that they did for Chun Doo-hwan and Park Chung-hee before him,\u201d York said.",
      "Instead, protesters rushed to the National Assembly, with viral videos showing people confronting soldiers over their actions.",
      "\u201cI think it came as a surprise to Yoon and his supporters how quickly the Korean public turned against their decision and fought back,\u201d York said. \u201cThat, I would say, demonstrates the determination of the Korean public not to go back to that period in history.\u201d",
      "The U.S. role in military rule",
      "Among those caught off guard this week was the Biden administration, which said it was not notified about Yoon\u2019s plans in advance.",
      "Throughout the week, U.S. officials have repeatedly reaffirmed the \u201cironclad\u201d nature of the U.S. alliance with South Korea, which it views as an important bulwark against North Korea, China and Russia, and which hosts almost 30,000 American troops.",
      "The U.S. military has had an almost continuous presence in South Korea since the end of World War II, even ruling the country from 1945 to 1948. The American troops there today serve as a deterrent against aggression from nuclear-armed North Korea.",
      "Over the years, the U.S. has been accused of siding with South Korean dictators over democrats.",
      "Historically, \u201cwhenever South Korean authoritarian leaders wanted to declare martial law, they typically sought at least some kind of tacit approval from Washington,\u201d Jo said.",
      "Historians say the U.S. stood by during the deadly South Korean military response to the 1980 Gwangju uprising, for example, for fear that the protests might spread to other cities and invite North Korean intervention.",
      "In 1964, Jo said, when there were nationwide demonstrations against the normalization of relations with Japan, the U.S. agreed to release command of an infantry division that was deployed to enforce Park\u2019s martial law, according to declassified documents.",
      "The events in South Korea this week also brought to mind more recent history, said Jean H. Lee, an adjunct fellow and northeast Asia expert at the East-West Center research organization in Honolulu.",

She was later sentenced to 24 years in prison on corruption and other charges before being pardoned in 2021 by Yoon\u2019s predecessor, President Moon Jae-in.",
      "South Koreans \u201chave a long culture and a long history of demonstration,\u201d Lee said, \u201cand they saw in 2016 that they can have an impact and sweep a president out of power.\u201d",

      "The PPP, which repudiated Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration, had asked him to leave the party but said earlier that it opposed the impeachment motion. Before Han changed his position, at least eight lawmakers from the PPP would have had to break with their party in order for it to pass.",
      "Six opposition parties had proposed impeaching Yoon over the martial law order, which banned political activity and censored the media. If Yoon is impeached, he will be suspended from office until the Constitutional Court decides whether to uphold the motion, with a deadline of 180 days.",
      "South Korean police and prosecutors are also investigating claims of insurrection and treason against Yoon, former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, whose resignation Yoon accepted on Thursday, and Interior Minister Lee Sang-min.",
      "The deeply unpopular Yoon, 63, whose approval rating was already at 19% before the emergency martial law, had blamed opposition lawmakers in his declaration, accusing them of paralyzing the government by seeking the impeachment of multiple government officials and slashing critical funding from next year\u2019s national budget.",
      "He also accused his opponents of sympathizing with nuclear-armed North Korea, a reclusive communist state with which the South technically remains at war.",
      "Yoon has not made any public appearances since lifting the martial law order on Wednesday. On Friday, lawmakers at the National Assembly, which was swarmed by almost 300 martial law troops on Tuesday after Yoon declared martial law in a surprise late-night TV address, linked arms to block the entrance amid concerns that he might visit.",
      "Opposition lawmakers have expressed concern that Yoon might declare martial law a second time if he is impeached or even earlier.",
      "\u201cI feel that danger is imminent tonight,\u201d Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, said Friday. \u201cI have a gut feeling that something might happen again tonight or early morning tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Acting Defense Minister Kim Seon-ho dismissed such concerns and said that even if Yoon made such an attempt, the Ministry of Defense and the South Korean military \u201cwould categorically reject it.\u201d",
      "Yoon\u2019s special forces commander, Kwak Jong-keun, also said Friday that it would be impossible for Yoon to declare martial law again \u201cbecause I will refuse to comply with any such order.\u201d",
      "Kwak was among three officers the Ministry of National Defense suspended from duty on Friday, along with Lt. Gen. Lee Jin-woo, head of the Capital Defense Command, and Lt. Gen. Yeo In-hyung, head of the Defense Counterintelligence Command.",
      "The ministry also said it had requested overseas travel bans for 10 active-duty officers, including Kwak, Lee, Yeo and Gen. Park Ahn-soo, who as army chief of staff was named martial law commander. All four are accused of treason, the ministry said, adding that three brigadier generals and three commanders who were confirmed to have deployed soldiers made up the other six.",
      "In a call Thursday with his South Korean counterpart, Cho Tae-yul, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed \u201cdeep concerns\u201d about the martial law declaration and welcomed the lifting of the order.",
      "\u201cThe Secretary conveyed\u00a0his confidence in the democratic resilience of the ROK during this period, and noted he expects the ROK\u2019s democratic process to prevail,\u201d the State Department readout said, using an abbreviation for South Korea\u2019s formal name, the Republic of Korea.",
      "Blinken also reaffirmed the \u201cironclad\u201d nature of the U.S. alliance with South Korea, which it views as an important bulwark against North Korea, China and Russia, and which hosts almost 30,000 American troops.",
      "The U.S. confirmed Thursday that meetings of the U.S.-South Korea Nuclear Consultative Group and related tabletop military exercises that were planned in Washington this week had been postponed amid the turmoil in South Korea.",
      "Politicians ordered arrested",
      "Meanwhile, more details emerged of the chaotic hours between Yoon\u2019s declaration of martial law around 10:30 p.m. local time Tuesday and the lifting of the order around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "Hong Jang-won, deputy director of the National Intelligence Service (NIS), told lawmakers on the National Assembly\u2019s Intelligence Committee that Yoon had told him to arrest key politicians, Democratic Party lawmaker and committee member Kim Byeong-gi told reporters.",
      "They included Lee Jae-myung, the party\u2019s leader, and Yoon\u2019s rival in the 2022 presidential election; Woo Won-shik, speaker of the National Assembly; Han, the leader of Yoon\u2019s own People Power Party; and Kim Ou-Joon, a journalist who has been critical of Yoon, along with other opposition leaders, a former Supreme Court justice and a former Supreme Court chief justice.",
      "\u201cHong said that such a directive was ridiculous,\u201d Kim said, \u201cand although the key leadership meeting at the NIS was held, the meeting ended without a conclusion.\u201d",
      "Hong was later contradicted by his boss, NIS director Cho Tae-yong, who told reporters that Yoon gave no such direct order.",
      "Yoon\u2019s office has not commented on the allegations.",
      "The accounts by military officers and government officials may have played a role in the PPP\u2019s changing position, said Eun A Jo, a postdoctoral fellow at the\u00a0Dickey Center for International Understanding\u00a0at Dartmouth.",
      "\u201cI think given that kind of evidence, it\u2019s difficult for the ruling party to protect Yoon,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you are seeing more people kind of turning their backs.\u201d",
      "South Korea\u2019s National Election Commission said Friday that after the martial law declaration on Tuesday, about 300 troops infiltrated its headquarters and related facilities in what the commission called \u201ca clear violation of the Constitution and the law.\u201d",
      "The soldiers confiscated the mobile phones of five people on duty and restricted access to the premises, the commission said, occupying its headquarters for about 3 hours and 20 minutes.",
      "\u201cWhile it has been confirmed that no internal materials were taken by the troops thus far, a thorough and continuous review will be conducted to verify any potential damages,\u201d the commission said in a statement.",
      "Kwak, the special forces commander, said some units at the National Election Commission stayed in their vehicles while others \u201csecured and guarded the external perimeter as instructed.\u201d",
      "He said they were in the area for about 20 minutes and then moved to withdraw when Kwak issued an order to halt operations at 1:09 a.m., around the same time lawmakers voted to reject the emergency martial law and ordered soldiers to leave the legislature in central Seoul.",
      "Kwak said that no one entered the premises, and that there were no plans to detain or obstruct commission personnel.",
      "\u201cBasically, I halted the mission before any actions were carried out,\u201d he said.",
      "Brig. Gen. Lee Sang-hyun, commander of the Special Warfare Command\u2019s 1st Airborne Special Forces Brigade, told South Korean media that his unit had been ordered to enter the premises of the National Assembly and evacuate personnel \u201cwithout knowing whether this was a military situation or a terrorist threat.\u201d",
      "Lee said he concluded it was unlikely to be a terrorism scenario and told his troops not to carry live ammunition.",
      "He said his unit had \u201cworked tirelessly to shed the stigma\u201d of past military intervention in politics, including its role in a 1979 insurrection.",
      "\u201cAre we to bear the disgrace and stigma of such dishonor once again?\u201d he said.",
      "Stella Kim reported from Seoul and Jennifer Jett from Hong Kong."

      "Three climbers from the U.S. and Canada who went missing five days ago on New Zealand\u2019s tallest mountain are presumed dead, authorities said.",
      "The two Americans and a Canadian climber were planning to summit Aoraki by using the Zurbriggen Ridge, but they never met their flight out Monday as planned, police said.",
      "The search, which began the same day, has been hampered by poor weather, Aoraki Area Commander Inspector Vicki Walker said in a statement Friday afternoon local time.",
      "Searchers in a helicopter spotted a jacket and an ice ax believed to belong to the men. Footprints and other evidence of where the group planned to traverse slopes beneath Zurbriggen Ridge have also been found, she said.",
      "\u201cAfter reviewing the number of days the climbers have been missing, no communication, the items we have retrieved, and our reconnaissance today, we do not believe the men have survived,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe believe they have taken a fall.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is certainly not the news we wanted to share today,\u201d Walker said in the statement.",
      "The trio \u2014 Kurt Blair, 56, of Colorado, and Carlos Romero, 50, of California, as well as a Canadian who has not been publicly identified pending notification of next of kin \u2014 arrived on a flight Saturday, police said.",
      "They were supposed to fly out at 8:30 a.m. Monday. When they did not arrive, they were reported overdue and a search was launched, Walker has said.",
      "Aoraki, also called Mount Cook, is 12,218 feet tall and part of the Southern Alps on New Zealand's South Island.",
      "Police will consider whether a recovery operation is feasible, and the search could be restarted if there is more information or there are sightings, like from the climbing community, Walker said.",
      "\"I would like to thank the teams who have given their all to this search,\" Walker said. \"We all wanted this operation to be a success.\""
