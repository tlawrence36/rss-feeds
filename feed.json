      "When Lucy Walker debuted her harrowing documentary about California wildfires, \u201cBring Your Own Brigade,\u201d at Sundance in 2021, it was during peak COVID",
      "NEW YORK -- When Lucy Walker debuted her harrowing documentary about California wildfires, \u201cBring Your Own Brigade,\u201d at Sundance in 2021, it was during peak COVID. Not the best time for a film on a wholly different scourge.",
      "\u201cIt was really hard,\u201d the Oscar-nominated filmmaker says now. \u201cI didn\u2019t blame people for not wanting to watch a film about the fires in the middle of the pandemic, because it was just too much horror.\"",
      "And so the film, though acclaimed \u2014 it was named one of the 10 best films of the year by the New York Times \u2013 didn\u2019t reach an audience as large as Walker had hoped, with its urgent display of the human cost of wildfires and its tough, crucial questions for the future.",
      "That could change. Walker thinks people may now be more receptive to her message, given the devastating wildfires that have wrought havoc on Los Angeles itself the past week. Firefighters were preparing on Tuesday to attack new blazes amid warnings that winds combined with severely dry conditions created a \u201c particularly dangerous situation.\"",
      "\u201cThis is probably the moment where it becomes undeniable,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "She added: \"It does feel like people are now asking the question that I was asking a few years ago, like, 'Is it safe to live in Los Angeles? And why is this happening, and what can we do about it? And the good news is that there are some things we can do about it. What\u2019s tricky is that they\u2019re really hard to accomplish.\u201d",
      "In \u201cBring Your Own Brigade\" (available on Paramount+), Walker portrays in sometimes terrifying detail the devastation caused by two wildfires on the same day in 2018, products of the same wind event \u2014 the Camp Fire that engulfed the northern California city of Paradise and the Woolsey fire in Malibu, two towns on opposite ends of the political and economic spectrum.",
      "She embeds herself with firefighters, and explores the lives of locals affected by the fire. She shares harrowing cellphone footage of people driving through exploding columns of fire as they try to escape, crying out \u201cI don\u2019t want to die!\u201d She plays 911 calls in which people plead vainly for rescue as fire laps at their backyards or invades their homes.",
      "And she conveys a layered message: Devastating fires in California are increasingly inevitable. Climate change is a clear accelerating factor, yes, but it\u2019s not the only one, and therein lies an element of hope: There are things people can do, if they start to make different (and difficult) choices \u2014 in both where and how they choose to live.",
      "But first, complacency must be vanquished.",
      "\u201cComplacency sets in when there hasn\u2019t been a fire for a few years and you start to think, it might not happen again,\u201d Walker says.",
      "It even affected Walker herself a few months ago. A British transplant to Los Angeles, she had chosen to live on the Venice-Santa Monica border \u2014 too scared, she says, to live in the city's lovely hilly areas with small winding roads, surrounded by nature and vegetation, near the canyons that wildfires love.",
      "But a few months ago, she started wondering if over-anxiety about wildfires had incorrectly influenced her choice. And then, of course, came the Palisades catastrophe \u2014\u201cthis God awful reminder that it only takes one event,\u201d she says.",
      "Walker became interested in making a film about wildfires after she arrived in the city and wondered if she was safe. \u201cWhy is the hillside on fire?\u201d she says she wondered. \u201cWhy do people just keep on driving?\u201d She had considered such fires \u201ca medieval problem.\"",
      "One thing she learned while filming: Firefighters were even more impressive and courageous than she'd thought. \u201cIf you want to watch a firefighter have their heart broken, it\u2019s when they want to do more,\u201d she says. \"I was just absolutely wowed by how incredibly selfless and brilliant they were.\u201d",
      "Not that the public wasn\u2019t angry at them \u2014 her film depicts angry residents of Malibu, for example, chastising firefighters for not doing enough.",
      "One of the most stunning parts of \u201cBring Your Own Brigade\u201d \u2014 the title is a reference to the economic inequity of wealthy homeowners or celebrities like Kim Kardashian hiring private firefighters \u2014 is watching the reaction of firefighters at a town meeting in Paradise, where 85 people had been killed in the fire. They've convened to discuss adopting safety measures as they rebuild. One by one, measures are rejected \u2014 even the simplest, requiring a five-foot buffer around every house where nothing is flammable. Safety takes a back burner to individual choice.",
      "\u201cIt was very shocking to be at that meeting in particular, given that people had died in the most horrible way in that community. And you have firefighters with tears in their eyes saying, 'This is what we need to have happen to keep us safe, and then (they) get voted down.\"",
      "Walker is not the only filmmaker to have made a film about Paradise. In 2020, Ron Howard directed \u201cRebuilding Paradise,\u201d focused on the effort to rebuild, and the resilience of residents. Walker says she looked at the same set of facts and arrived at different takeaways.",
      "Townspeople were indeed amazing and resilient, Walker says. \u201cBut are we right to be building back without a real rethink? Because the tragedy is that these fires are predictably going to be repeating and against the backdrop of climate change, they're getting worse, not better.\u201d",
      "That rethink involves making hard calls about where people should live. \u201cThe population is overwhelmingly moving into these wildland urban interface areas,\u201d Walker says, referring to areas where housing meets undeveloped wildland vegetation \u2014 exactly the areas most likely to burn.",
      "In California, some of these places are very expensive \u2014 like Palisades and Malibu \u2014 but others are in more affordable areas. With the great pressure on housing, more people are moving into such areas, she says. But the \u201cbraking mechanism\u201d could be that insurance companies \u201care doing the math, and it\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d",
      "It's not only a question of where people live.",
      "\u201cWhat does a fire-hardened home look like?\u201d Walker asks. \u201cDesign-wise, that that does dictate certain things.\u201d For example: \u201cThis lovely wood is going to require tremendous firefighting.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s too early to know, but Walker thinks she may be hearing something different now from those who've lost homes, of whom she knows many.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from people is not just \u2018I can\u2019t wait to rebuild. Let me rebuild,'\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s: 'How could we go through that again?'\u201d"

      "Trump\u2019s second inauguration is expected to be a much different affair than the last time America got a new president. Trump, who refused to accept his 2020 loss, did not attend Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol, where there were still visible reminders of the violent Jan. 6, 2021 siege on the building by Trump\u2019s supporters.",

      "Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind Benetton\u2019s provocative ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s who later broke with the Italian knitwear brand under controversy, has died at age 82",
      "MILAN -- Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind Benetton\u2019s provocative ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s who later broke with the Italian knitwear brand amid controversy, died Monday at age 82.",
      "Toscani disclosed last year he had a rare disease. \"It is with immense pain that we announce that our beloved Oliviero has undertaken his next journey,\" his wife, Kirsti, and their three children said in a statement. He died at a hospital in Livorno, Tuscany, the news agency ANSA reported.",
      "Toscani had amyloidosis, a disease characterized by a buildup of abnormal protein deposits in the body. He told Corriere della Sera in August he had lost 40 kilograms (nearly 90 pounds) in a year, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I have left to live, but I\u2019m not interested in living like this anyway.\u201d",
      "Toscani also said he would like to be remembered \u201cnot for any one photo but for my whole work, for the commitment.\u201d",
      "Toscani was the creative force behind shock ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s that featured images such as the pope kissing an imam on the lips, which angered the Vatican.",
      "Other images promoting the United Colors of Benetton depicted a priest embracing a nun, a newborn baby with its umbilical cord and a black woman breastfeeding a white baby, part of the brand\u2019s advocacy for diversity, religious tolerance and environmental messages.",
      "During a 1997 shoot of a Benetton campaign featuring Jews and Arabs living peacefully together in Israel, Toscani told The Associated Press, \u201cAny picture is a political image, so we make our choice and we go for the real thing.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cYou might have to face criticism. A lot of people don\u2019t like things that are different. Everybody likes to conform. We don\u2019t conform.\u201d",
      "His decadeslong relationship with Benetton was severed in 2020 after Toscani outraged relatives of victims of the deadly 2018 Genoa bridge collapse, telling RAI television, \u201cWho cares about a bridge collapse?\u201d He was responding to an outcry over a photograph of founding members of a political protest movement alongside key members of the Benetton family, which controlled the company that maintained the bridge.",
      "Toscani apologized in an interview with La Repubblica, saying: \u201cI am sorry. More: I am ashamed to apologize. I am humanly destroyed and deeply pained.\u201d But the damage was done, and Benetton ended a relationship that had flourished from 1982-2000 and been rekindled in 2018.",
      "Benetton remembered Toscani in a social media post: \u201cFarewell, Oliviero. Keep on dreaming,\u2019\u2019 beneath Toscani's 1989 photo of a hand offering a bouquet of flowers.",
      "Toscani was born in Milan on Feb. 28, 1942, the son of a photojournalist for Corriere della Sera. He studied photography and graphics at the University of the Arts in Zurich from 1961-65, and worked with the newly founded Vogue Italia and other major fashion publications.",
      "Over the years, he shot campaigns for such brands as Chanel, Robe di Kappa, Fiorucci and Esprit. But he was probably best known for his work for the United Colors of Benetton, with images that carried messages promoting equality and diversity while denouncing anorexia, homophobia, the death penalty and racism.",
      "His work for United Colors of Benetton, a brand then known most for its colorful knitwear, raised its global profile. In the early 1990s, he conceived and directed \u201cColors,\u201d a global publication distributed in Benetton stores, and created along with Luciano Benetton the research center Fabrica in Benetton\u2019s home city of Treviso that supported and launched many fashion industry careers.",
      "Toscani tackled the AIDS crisis in the early 1990s with a colored condom campaign, during which Benetton sold a range of colored condoms, and used a colorized version of a portrait of AIDS activist David Kirby surrounded by family as he was dying.",
      "In 2007, Toscani\u2019s \u201cNo Anorexia\u201d campaign for the Italian fashion brand Nolita sparked fresh discussions about the illness and its relationship to the fashion industry. Toscani\u2019s photograph with skeletally thin model Isabelle Caro was revealed on giant billboards and in newspaper ads during Milan Fashion Week and received worldwide attention.",
      "He was also involved in projects addressing problems such as road safety, violence against women and stray dogs.",

      "ATLANTA -- Reality TV star Chase Chrisley is accused of slapping the manager of a popular sports bar in Atlanta after refusing to leave.",
      "Chrisley, who gained fame on the \u201cChrisley Knows Best\u201d show that featured his parents and close-knit family, was allegedly drunk at a Twin Peaks restaurant on Jan. 6 and refused to leave when asked by the manager, according to an Atlanta police report. He allegedly slapped the manager twice in the face, including once while he was on the phone with 911, according to audio of the call that was released.",
      "Chrisley was arrested Thursday on suspicion of simple battery and later released on a $10,000 bond. A public relations representative Chrisley lists on his Instagram account didn't immediately respond to an inquiry Sunday about the incident.",
      "An Atlanta police report said the manager told officers that the 28-year-old Chrisley was acting \u201cvery disrespectful and belligerent.\u201d He refused to leave several times and his behavior got worse \u2014 culminating in the slapping.",
      "Chrisley left with his driver before officers arrived. The restaurant shared security footage of the incident with police.",
      "Chrisley's parents, Todd and Julie Chrisley, are both in prison on bank fraud and tax evasion charges. A jury in 2022 found them guilty of conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30 million in fraudulent loans. The older Chrisleys were also found guilty of tax evasion by hiding their earnings."

      "NEW YORK -- On a quiet weekend in movie theaters, while much of Hollywood\u2019s attention was on the wildfires that continue to rage in Los Angeles, Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cDen of Thieves 2: Pantera\u201d debuted atop the box office with $15.5 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Mid-January is often a slow moviegoing period, and that was slightly exacerbated by the closures of about 10 theaters in Los Angeles, the country\u2019s top box-office market.",
      "A sequel to the Gerard Butler 2018 heist thriller, \u201cDen of Thieves 2\u201d performed similarly to the original. The first installment, released by STX, opened with $15.2 million seven years ago. O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr. co-stars in the sequel, which debuted in 3,008 North American theaters.",
      "Butler's films are becoming something of a regular feature in January. He also starred in \u201cPlane,\u201d which managed $32.1 million after launching on Jan. 13 in 2023.",
      "\u201cDen of Thieves 2,\u201d made for about $40 million, was a bit more costly to make. Audiences liked it well enough, giving it a \u201cB+\u201d CinemaScore. Reviews (58% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) weren\u2019t particularly good. But it counted as Lionsgate\u2019s first No.1 opening since \u201cThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\u201d in November 2023.",
      "Also entering wide release over the weekend was the Robbie Williams movie \u201cBetter Man,\u201d one of the more audacious spins on the music biopic in recent years. Rather than going the more tradition routes of Elton John (\u201cRocketman\u201d) or Elvis Presley (\u201cElvis\u201d), the British popstar is portrayed by a CGI chimpanzee in Michael Gracey\u2019s film.",

It tanked, with $1.1 million in ticket sales from 1,291 locations. Gracey\u2019s previous feature, 2017\u2019s \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d ($459 million worldwide), fared far better in theaters. Reviews, however, have been very good for \u201cBetter Man.\u201d",
      "It was bested by \u201cThe Last Showgirl,\u201d the Las Vegas drama starring Pamela Anderson. The Roadside Attractions release expanded to 870 theaters and collected $1.5 million.",

      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \u201ccall and response\u201d of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music\u2019s most enduring hits, which also included \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Like I Know,\u201d \u201cWhen Something is Wrong With My Baby\u201d and \u201cI Thank You.\u201d",

      "Like many \u201960s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \u201cSoul Man\u201d hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \u201cSoul Men\u201d depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",

      "Moore wrote the song \u201cDole Man,\u201d modeled on \u201cSoul Man,\u201d for Republican Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama\u2019s campaign used the song \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin\u2019.\u201d",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s, but didn\u2019t meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label\u2019s Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band\u2019s troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "\u201cI did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",

I\u2019m laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\u201d",

But the actor-producer still struggled to reconcile his relief with the haunting sight of his ravaged, once lavish community.",

He has helped move cars to clear the street, handed out food and assisted neighbors from out their homes.",
      "\"All these houses behind me burned to the ground where their families enjoyed wonderful times together with their friends and family,\" said Guttenberg while pointing at one charred home before dropping his head in sadness. \u201cThere's really a lot of pain going on right now. I'm doing whatever I can to help alleviate it.\u201d",
      "For those looking to help, Guttenberg suggested starting with a simple call or text to ask displaced neighbors what they might need like food, supplies or emotional support. He also encouraged those who can return to their homes, if safe, to check on their property and assist others in assessing the damage.",
      "Guttenberg, the star of films like \u201cShort Circuit,\u201d \u201cPolice Academy and \u201dThree Men and a Baby,\" is unsure how the film and TV industry will able to help during the beginning of awards season.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s gonna do what regular people do: Help each other, give each other food and water, help each other in their backyards, in their front yards,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though somebody\u2019s an actor, producer, writer, director, we\u2019re all just people. .. Maybe people can donate at one point to some sort of fund. But I just think, be a good neighbor right now.\u201d",

      "Schenk lived in Austria, and his death was announced by the Vienna State Opera.",
      "He created 31 productions there, starting with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s \u201cJen\u016ffa\u201d in 1964 and ending with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s \u201cThe Cunning Little Vixen\u201d in 2014. Many of his creations remain in use, including a 1979 version of Johann Strauss II's \u201cDie Fledermaus\u201d that was streamed around the world on New Year's Eve.",
      "\u201cOtto Schenk is an essential, unforgettable chapter in the history of our theater,\u201d Vienna State Opera Director Bogdan Ro\u0161\u010di\u0107 said in a statement. \u201cBut he was also an artist who shaped the world of theater for half a century like few others. As sacred as the theater was to him, he approached the works naturally and fearlessly, drawing on an immense knowledge. An infinite love for the singers went hand in hand with hard, uncompromising rehearsal work and honesty. \u201d",
      "Schenk led 16 productions at New York's Metropolitan Opera, starting with Puccini's \u201cTosca\u201d in 1968 and ending with Donizetti's \u201cDon Pasquale\u201d in 1996. His staging of Wagner's four-work \u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen\u201d premiered from 1986-89 and was shown in 20 full cycles from 1989 to 2009 and broadcast on public television in 1990. Schenk received a huge ovation when he took a curtain call after an April 18, 2009, performance of \u201cSiegfried.\u201d",
      "His romantic, realistic staging had set designer G\u00fcnther Schneider-Siemssen create images of a river, forest and mountains dominated by greens and oranges, and costumes by Rolf Langenfass that evoked the original Ring of the 1876 Bayreuth Festival. It was in a way a response to Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's centennial Ring at Bayreuth in 1976, set in an industrial age Ring and interpreted by some as Marxist.",
      "\u201cI wanted to tell a romantic old story, like starting with \u2018Once upon a time,\u2019\u201d Schenk said during a 1989 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAll the secrets of Wagner\u2019s Ring should be guessed by the audience or found by the audience.\u201d",

He continued to act and performed 237 times at the Salzburg Festival from 1950-97, becoming head of drama there from 1986-88.",

      "\u201cAt a time when many new productions of `Der Ring des Nibelungen' might be more aptly entitled `Der Ringling des Barnum und Bailey,' the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s staging of Wagner\u2019s epic has cast a vote for the notion that maybe, just maybe, the composer knew best,\" New York Times critic Donal Henahan wrote in 1989. \u201cThe Metropolitan\u2019s trend-bucking project has aroused widespread suspicion, even resentment. `Traditional,' `conventional,' `regressive' and `childishly representational' were some of the nicer epithets thrown about in lobbies and in print. ... Even granting the possibility that radical rethinking of Wagner\u2019s works might occasionally stimulate thought about their everyday relevance, a staging that pays honor to the original is a useful counterbalance.\u201d",
      "Met presentations were long dominated by Schenk and Franco Zeffirelli, who had 11 stagings that premiered from 1964-98. Schenk said he did not look for hidden meanings.",

      "The Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world two decades ago",
      "LONDON -- Two decades ago, the Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world. They waltzed in stripped-shirts and quickly became global icons for their deliriously hooky songs, hitting a critical mass in the chant-along singles \u201cTake Me Out\u201d and \u201cDo You Want To.\u201d A lot has changed in that time, but the band never wavered in their dedication to 2000s indie ebullience. Over the last few years there's been a bit of an indie music resurgence, but for Franz Ferdinand, it never went away.",
      "On Friday, they will release \"The Human Fear,'' their sixth studio album and the first in seven years, making the end of the longest break between full lengths in their career.",
      "Frontman Alex Kapranos says the album tackles relationships forming and breaking down. \u201cThe title is a clue to the scene,\u201d he teases. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t written to the theme, at least not consciously.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press in London, Kapranos and Franz Ferdinand bassist Bob Hardy discussed about \u201cThe Human Fear,\u201d the resurgence of indie music and the band's love for Chappell Roan and Charli XCX. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "KAPRANOS: The last song that was written, the last lyrics that were written was (for) the song \u201cHooked.\u201d It starts off with the line, \u201cI\u2019ve got the fear / I\u2019ve got the human fear.\u201d And I realize that so many of the songs had an underlying theme of fear to them. But not necessarily succumbing to fear, but more like overcoming fear.",
      "\u201cThe Doctor\u201d is about the fear of leaving an institution, and \u201cBar Lonely\u201d is the fear of leaving a relationship. \u201cNight or Day\u201d is the fear of committing to a relationship. But fear is fascinating because fear is universal. We all experience fear. We all experience the same fears. But how we respond to it is individual. And that\u2019s how we find who we are, our personalities. And overcoming fear feels good. That\u2019s why we watch horror films or ride rollercoasters \u2014 because you overcome fear and then feel very alive for having done so.",
      "KAPRANOS: The song starts off addressing that feeling that we all have sometimes, which is, you know, you feel that your life is collapsing around about you for one reason or another. It could be a relationship that is disintegrating. Often, it'll go that things tend to happen to you (all) at once. The relationship starts going south as well as your professional life. And then you realize that the washing machine leaked and your basement\u2019s flooded and just all that kind of annoying stuff. Your phone gets nicked or whatever. And it can be overwhelming. And you just, you have this sense of fear that, \"Gosh, everything\u2019s collapsing.\"",
      "I guess I was feeling a little bit like that when I was writing the song for one reason or another. And I thought, \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d ... I\u2019m just going to do something astonishingly audacious. I\u2019m going to go into it with an audacious attitude and get through it that sort of way. And don't blame anybody else for it as well. Like, own the responsibility of overcoming the fear myself.",
      "KAPRANOS: We\u2019re not one of these kinds of bands that will sit down and say, \u201cRight, we\u2019ve got two months to write an album. \u201d For me, you\u2019re always writing, you\u2019re always coming up with ideas. And so, on this album, there\u2019s ideas that were written in the studio literally the day before it was sent off to be mastered. And there\u2019s also ideas \u2026 I think the oldest idea is the bassline (of) one of the songs, which is from 1995.",
      "I think the way my brain works is like if you imagine going into the office of a university\u2019s eccentric professor that\u2019s scattered with bits of paper. It's all kind of like catastrophic, organizational hell, but they know exactly where everything is. That\u2019s what my brain is like with bits of ideas and bits of songs and stuff like that. I know where they are, and when I need to use them, they\u2019ll come out.",
      "HARDY: And the show has become the reward for making records, to me. It all kind of focuses playing it live in front of an audience and seeing people react to it in the moment. When you release a record, you don\u2019t see people listen to it at home. You know, the way you kind of get the reaction is these live shows.",
      "HARDY: It's never gone away.",
      "KAPRANOS: There was a period in the late-2000s where there was point of saturation where, like, you turned on any mainstream radio show and you heard nothing but indie bands. And when it becomes that saturated, maybe the quality control goes down slightly. And then when that happens, there\u2019s always a reaction to it. And I think over the last decade, there\u2019s been a bit of, \u201cRight, okay, so we\u2019re going to listen to like pure pop instead.\u201d And of course, there\u2019s some brilliant stuff like Charli XCX. Amazing. Chappell Roan (is) incredible. But there\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s maybe not quite premier tier as well. And I think there's been maybe a little bit of a reaction to that.",
      "I think from our perspective, just, yeah, make the thing that you love and then you\u2019re not really going to go wrong."

      "The upcoming season will focus on lessons in emotional well-being. It debuts Jan. 16 on MAX with new episodes releasing every Thursday. \u201cSesame Street\u201d will also be available on PBS stations and to stream on PBS Kids in the fall.",
      "No one is more excited than Elmo himself.",
      "\u201cThere's a lot to learn from music \u2014 yeah, timing and harmonies and melody and different styles and different cultures,\u201d the 3 1/2-year-old monster told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's really cool! We've got a lot of wonderful people come and do some music with us on \u2018Sesame Street,' like Miss Rene\u00e9 Rapp and SZA! Chris Stapleton, Noah Kahan, Samara Joy \u2014 lots of great people!\u201d",
      "Songs double as life lessons on \u201cSesame Street,\u201d from an alt-R&B-pop track about gratitude with SZA to an acoustic number about feelings with Rapp.",
      "\"SZA is really cool \u2014 really talented. And \u2018gratitude\u2019 was a new word for Elmo, too. So, Elmo learned all about gratitude with SZA,\u201d he said.",
      "\"Elmo was feeling really, really happy after his playdate with Miss Rene\u00e9. It was a really beautiful song. She's got a great voice and Elmo hopes she comes back soon.\u201d",
      "As for the secret to a great \u201cSesame Street\u201d song? According to Tony - and Grammy-winning composer, producer and \u201cSesame Street\u201d music director Bill Sherman, its \u201cearworms on earworms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the verse is an earworm, so is the chorus. Mostly in pop music, the chorus is the earworm, and the verses are just a bunch of jumble.\u201d The difference, he explains, is that pop songs are about three and a half minutes long. Children's music is about a minute and a half. \u201cYou only have a very finite amount of time to do what you got to do.\u201d",
      "Usually, writers on the show provide Sherman and his team of songwriters with a script and lyrics detailing the lesson of each episode, as well as the name of the musical guest. Then they get to work, composing music true to the genre and spirit of each artist.",
      "Those musical guests take different levels of involvement, but the result is always awe-inspiring.",
      "Other highlights from this season include Kahan performing a foot-stomping folk song about music and feelings, Joy using jazz improvisation to teach a lesson in taking turns and a country ode to music and friends courtesy of Stapleton.",
      "\u201cChris Stapleton really wanted to write his own song,\u201d says Sherman, and so the pair hopped on a Zoom and wrote a song together, Stapleton with his guitar in tow, ideas flowing. \u201cIt was really one of the most surreal two-hour Zooms that I really ever had in my life.\u201d",
      "Joy took a different approach. \u201cSamara Joy insisted on singing live,\" says Sherman. \u201cIt very rarely happens on \u2018Sesame Street.\u2019 I can only count, like, a few times. So, there was like Stevie Wonder back in the day, which is a classic. And there\u2019s like Billy Joel, there\u2019s John Legend, there\u2019s a couple people that actually sing live. But Samara insisted on it.\u201d",
      "Her reasoning was simple. \"She said, \u2018Well, this whole episode is about improvisation and thinking on your toes. And so, if it\u2019s prerecorded, that\u2019s the opposite of what we\u2019re trying to teach.\u2019\"",
      "If there is a theme that connects all these performances to one another, it's a spirit of connection. At least, that's Elmo's theory: \u201cElmo thinks that music brings people together, you know? And some people who like some things and some people who like other things can kind of come together because they like the same kind of music. And that's kind of cool!\u201d",
      "\u201cSesame Street,\u201d designed by education professionals and child psychologists, is shown in more than 150 countries, has won over 200 Emmys, 11 Grammys, two Peabody Awards and received a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime artistic achievement, the first time a television program got the award.",
      "There've been no shortage of great musical guests across the show's five decade run. So, who would they like to see pay a visit in the future? \u201cMiss Taylor Swift! Maybe she could revisit her \u2018Red\u2019 era?\u201d chimes in Elmo. That's his favorite of her albums.",
      "\u201cBut also, Elmo would love to sing with Miss Beyonc\u00e9. Destiny's Child was on \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 so Elmo would love to have her back.\u201d"

In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates.",

      "",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about half of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",

The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",

      "To age well, geriatricians say one underappreciated key is maintaining good balance",
      "Taking a shower. Grocery shopping. Moving around the kitchen. Getting dressed. The underappreciated link between these mundane activities is good balance, which geriatricians say is key to maintaining an independent lifestyle as we age.",
      "Lacking balance can be dangerous. In the U.S., 3 million older people seek medical care for fall-related injuries each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. But falls are not inevitable, said Roopa Anmolsingh, a geriatrician who created the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s balance classes.",
      "\u201cSome people have a misconception that part of getting old is, you\u2019re going to fall. That\u2019s not true,\u201d Anmolsingh said. \u201cYou can control how you fall, or if you fall.\u201d",
      "To prevent falls, geriatricians say people should start asking themselves questions about their balance as early as 50 years old.",
      "Besides muscles and bones, other systems in the body can affect balance, so it\u2019s important to have a doctor check you if you ever feel unsteady, even if only occasionally. The cause could be related to blood pressure, a medication, inner-ear function, a nervous system issue or countless other potential problems.",
      "Even if unsteadiness is not an issue, you can determine whether you still might need an intervention with an easy at-home assessment.",
      "Standing next to a wall or something that can lend support if needed, raise one leg. If you can balance on each leg for 10 seconds, you should be fine, said Greg W. Hartley, a University of Miami professor of physical therapy specializing in geriatrics.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, then you should probably go see a physical therapist,\u201d he said.",
      "Another assessment, which Hartley recommended doing supervised, is called TUG, for \u201ctimed up and go.\u201d Sit in a chair and start a timer when you stand. Walk 10 feet (3 meters), come back and stop the timer upon sitting back down. If it takes longer than 15 seconds, the risk for a fall is very high. Twelve seconds or less, the likelihood of a fall is almost zero.",
      "The National Council on Aging offers an online resource to assess the risk of a fall with questions about medications, whether you worry about falling and if you have trouble stepping over a curb, among others.",
      "Because muscle mass begins to decline in most people during their 30s, geriatricians say the best way to preserve good balance is to stay physically active throughout life. But it\u2019s never too late to start prioritizing it, Anmolsingh said.",
      "Tai chi and yoga are particularly good for older adults because they involve controlled movements while shifting body weight. There also are individual exercises people can work into their everyday lives.",
      "Anmolsingh recommended standing on one foot while waiting in line at the grocery store. At home, try sitting up and down from a chair several times without using arm rests. While holding onto a chair or the wall, do three-way leg lifts on each side, lifting a leg to the front, side and then back. At the kitchen counter, take a few steps to the side in each direction.",
      "For general physical activity, which will improve balance as well as mood and overall health, the National Institute of Aging recommends at least 150 minutes per week. That should include a mixture of stretching to improve flexibility, an aerobic activity increasing the heart rate and strength training with weights or resistance bands.",
      "For balance-specific exercises, it\u2019s particularly important to do them regularly because it takes at least 50 hours of training to have a measurable impact, Hartley said. Besides strengthening the associated muscles, doing exercises repetitively for extended periods trains the brain to react properly when you slip or trip.",
      "\u201cJust like an athlete needs to do repetition to train for a sport, you\u2019re doing repetition to train for everyday balance activities,\u201d he said.",

      "The week began with a biting cold snap that hammered much of the U.S., the product of a jet stream that slips out of its usual path more often these days",
      "It was a week of fire and ice.",
      "It began with millions of people across the U.S. shivering amid blizzard conditions and frigid air that lasted for days, thanks to a jet stream that slips out of its usual path more often these days. Then, catastrophe in California, with wind-whipped flames taking off in a landscape parched by months of drought to become Los Angeles' worst-ever wildfires.",
      "To cap it off, major weather monitoring agencies confirmed 2024 as the hottest year in global history. Even more dire, four of the six agencies said it was the first full year Earth went beyond a warming threshold seen as critical to limiting the worst effects of climate change.",
      "Welcome to one wild week of the climate crisis, scientists say. There will be more.",
      "\u201cFor the average person, this means the changes you\u2019re experiencing \u2014 more extreme weather, rising costs due to climate impacts, threats to food and water security \u2014 aren\u2019t anomalies,\u201d said Victor Gensini, a meteorology professor at Northern Illinois University. \u201cThey\u2019re the new normal unless we take action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last week of weird weather has been alarming,\u201d said Natalie Mahowald, chair of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not a sign of things to come, because we\u2019ve barely seen any climate change compared to what we are going to get unless we radically cut CO2 emissions.\u201d",
      "Here's how the week unfolded.",
      "The cold came first.",
      "The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, which means the difference between temperatures up north and down south are shrinking \u2014 along with sea ice that releases more heat into atmosphere. That means more energy bouncing off and warping or moving the polar vortex, scientists say. And climate change is also messing with the jet stream, the air currents that circle the globe.",
      "The result? More frequent blasts of intense cold in winter even as global temperatures heat up overall.",
      "The blizzard dumped more snow in some parts of Kansas than they usually get in a year, one Kansas State University meteorologist said. Ice-coated trees downed power lines in eastern Kentucky, and a U.S. Olympian skied on the National Mall in Washington.",
      "Farmers rushed to move cows to keep them from freezing to death and to feed and water them as rural roads became impassable. Travel stalled as multiple states warned motorists not to chance the treacherous snow and ice.",
      "About 200 people, many homeless, sheltered at a roller rink in Cincinnati. The alternative was frostbite or worse in exposure to temperatures that were expected to slip from freezing to sub-freezing overnight.",
      "Out West, wildfire took hold.",
      "The Palisades Fire erupted in the Santa Monica mountains and moved quickly on Santa Ana winds gusting to 100 mph \u2014 much faster than normal. The winds were so strong they grounded airplanes normally used to drop water on the flames.",
      "The blaze reached near the Getty Museum and by the end of the day, several celebrities, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, had lost homes. Less than 72 hours before, many stars had convened to walk the Golden Globes\u2019 red carpet.",
      "The Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, killing 2 people and closing about 10 school districts.",
      "Climate change laid the groundwork for California\u2019s megafires. Atmospheric rivers dumped huge amounts of water on the region that caused plenty of plant growth. Then, a fast onset of drought dried them out, providing plenty of fodder for the flames.",
      "The water system used to fight the Palisades fire in Los Angeles buckled in the morning, as some hydrants ran dry as they were overstressed without assistance from firefighting aircraft.",
      "The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was pumping from aqueducts and groundwater into the system, but demand was so high that it wasn\u2019t enough to refill three 1-million gallon tanks in hilly Pacific Palisades. At least 1,000 buildings were engulfed in flames.",
      "The Sunset Fire started, too, threatening the Hollywood Hills and forcing mandatory evacuations in Hollywood.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump criticized state and local officials' water management policies. But experts said critics were connecting unrelated issues and spreading false information during a crisis.",
      "By the afternoon, calmer winds aided firefighters in making some headway, though by that point at least five fires were still active and some burned out of control in the L.A. area.",
      "Scenes of the destruction started to emerge. Recovery crews pulled a body from the rubble of a beachfront residence in Malibu.",
      "AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, estimated the overall wildfire damage could reach $57 billion, though much of the destruction remains to be surveyed.",
      "At the same time, another winter storm bore down on the South, with warnings and advisories for at least 20 states. Many had gone through the same thing just days earlier.",
      "Major weather monitoring agencies said 2024 was the hottest since record-keeping began, easily passing 2023.",
      "Even more significant: 2024 was the first year with a global average that broke the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s that was set as a goal by the 2015 Paris climate agreement.",
      "Extreme weather like this week's is \u201caffecting so many more people all at one time,\u201d said Barbara Hofer, a professor emerita of psychology at Middlebury College. \u201cIncreasingly, the scale is changing. The loss is mounting.\"",
      "Hofer said the growing impact may make some people deny climate change, ignore it or become numb to it as \u201ca way to avoid what's psychologically uncomfortable.\"",
      "Such a week can also energize positive change, she said. But Hofer said she thinks that will be harder, at least in the U.S., as Trump takes office. He's promised to halt federal climate action and repeal existing legislation aimed at the problem.",
      "\u201cI worry about the denial, the misinformation, and the forces that are feeding that denial,\" she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have to address.\u201d",

      "A California man says his two cats died and a third was hospitalized after he fed them raw milk recalled for bird flu risk",
      "A California man whose two cats died after drinking raw milk recalled for bird flu risk says he meant to keep his beloved pets healthy, but his efforts tragically backfired.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible when you realize that you\u2019re the one that actually gave them the milk that killed them,\u201d said Joseph Journell, 56, of San Bernardino.",
      "Journell lost his 14-year-old tabby, Alexander, and Tuxsie, a 4-year-old tuxedo cat, in late November. A third cat, 4-year-old Big Boy, was hospitalized for a week before tests showed the animal was infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus.",
      "The cats drank unpasteurized milk from lots recalled by Raw Farm, of Fresno, whose dairy products were pulled from California store shelves in December after health officials found the virus in milk for sale, he said. The animals' deaths were confirmed by state and county health officials. The cats were kept indoors, with no access to potentially infected birds, and ate conventional, not raw, pet food, the owner said.",
      "Journell said he had been drinking Raw Farm milk himself for several months because he heard it had \u201cbetter immunity and healing properties\u201d than pasteurized milk. He thought it might be able to help Alexander, who had been losing weight.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make him healthier and make him live longer,\u201d Journell said.",
      "Instead, Alexander died on Thanksgiving Day. Tuxsie followed two days later.",
      "Big Boy was hospitalized and treated with antiviral medications, Journell said. The veterinary team collected urine samples from the cat, which were confirmed positive for H5N1 at labs run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and Cornell University, records show.",
      "Big Boy returned home blind and without the use of his back legs, though he is recovering, Journell said. A fourth cat, Cleo, didn\u2019t drink the milk and remained healthy.",
      "Journell has demanded that Raw Farm owner Mark McAfee compensate him for the more than $12,000 he spent treating the cats, according Seattle food safety lawyer Ilana Korchia, who is representing him.",
      "In an interview, McAfee disputed that the virus was capable of sickening the animals days after it was bottled and sold, citing preliminary research.",
      "But Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said flu virus survival likely varies widely in different lots of milk. Experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed that cats that drank raw milk from infected cows developed neurological disease and died.",
      "\u201cI think the poor cats are the best indicator!\u201d Webby wrote in an email.",
      "Nearly a dozen cats in California have died since early December after consuming raw milk or raw pet food contaminated with bird flu, health officials have said.",
      "The infections have followed a massive outbreak of the bird flu virus in dairy cows, which has affected in more than 900 U.S. dairy herds in 16 states. About 80% of those herds are in California.",
      "Federal and state health officials have warned people not to drink raw milk because of the potential for infection with bird flu and a host of other germs. Officials also have cautioned pet owners to avoid feeding unpasteurized milk and raw meat diets to their animals.",
      "\u201cCats should not be fed any products from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to kill the virus,\u201d the FDA warned last month.",
      "After the cats got sick, Journell said he fell ill himself and sought care at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Fontana, Calif. He said he wasn't checked for bird flu, despite his known exposure to the virus, because medical staff didn't have tests available to detect it.",
      "A Kaiser spokesperson declined to comment on Journell's case specifically, but said the hospital system is following CDC guidelines for screening for bird flu.",
      "Journell has recovered physically but said he's still suffering from the \u201cmental anguish\" of losing his pets. Despite the ordeal, he said he still thinks raw milk offers some health benefits.",
      "Nevertheless, he won't be drinking it any time soon.",
      "\u201cNot right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not in the foreseeable future.\u201d",

      "",
      "\"We would prefer to provide your care ourselves, but Providence executives' refusal to continue meeting with caregivers has forced us onto the picket line to advocate for you, our communities, and our colleagues,\" the statement continued. \"Going into a hospital or clinic to get the care you need is not crossing our strike line.

    "summary": "The District of Columbia is suing the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, hoping it will lead to a cleanup of the urban waterway",
    "story": [
      "The District of Columbia is suing the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, hoping it will lead to a cleanup of the urban waterway",
      "The District of Columbia on Friday filed a lawsuit against the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, arguing it has inflicted \u201ccatastrophic harm\u201d on the mostly poor and minority communities living along the urban waterway.",
      "The lawsuit argues that federal government, which owns and controls the riverbed, has since the 1800s dumped toxic waste, heavy metals and chemicals including carcinogenic PCBs in the river and refused to clean it up. The 9-mile (14-kilometer) river flows through Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland. For decades, it was treated as a municipal dumping ground for industrial waste, storm sewers and trash. That contamination largely affected communities of color.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that PCBs from the Washington Navy Yard were dumped in the river along with hazardous chemicals from the Kenilworth Landfill and chemical waste from federal printing facilities. It also blamed the federal government for poorly managing the District of Columbia's sewer system, which led to the dumping of raw sewage and toxic waste into the river.",
      "That pollution has led to swimming bans and warnings about fishing along the river, the lawsuit alleges, calling the federal government its biggest polluter.",
      "\u201cIt has systematically contaminated the River through the indiscriminate dumping and release of hazardous substances and through destructive dredge and fill operations,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said pollutants in the river don't break down and cause long-lasting harm to the environment, aquatic wildlife, and human health, including cancer, neurological and developmental disorders and birth defects.",
      "The District of Columbia is demanding that the federal government pay for the river's cleanup.",
      "The lawsuit comes as the District of Columbia has made progress in cleaning up the river and returning to a time where residents fished and boated and wildlife including bald eagles, osprey, cranes, kingfishers and eel thrived there.",
      "A $3.29 billion sewer upgrade, including a series of tunnels drilled under the city to capture storm and sewage water, has reduced overflows into the river by 91%, according to DC Water, the city\u2019s water utility. The final section of the Anacostia Tunnel System went online in 2023, and the overall system is expected to reduce overflows by 98%.",
      "Pepco, the city\u2019s utility, also reached an agreement with the District of Columbia to pay more than $57 million for discharging hazardous chemicals from their power plants into soil, groundwater and storm sewers for decades that polluted the Anacostia and other areas. The settlement was believed to be the largest in the utility\u2019s history.",
      "The payments will be used in part to clean up the river. Other measures the city government instituted like a fee on plastic bags since 2009 have also helped keep trash out, experts say.",
      "Still, the Anacostia remains polluted. It received a failing grade for the third time in six years in 2023 from a nonprofit that grades the river\u2019s health based on its fecal bacteria content and the state of its aquatic vegetation.",

      "Setting boundaries at work can be tricky",
      "NEW YORK -- When Justin Stewart started his career, he juggled several jobs to make ends meet. He poured himself into his full-time role as a news show production assistant from 3 a.m. until noon. Then he rushed to the airport where he rented cars or to the big box stores where he pulled retail shifts.",
      "Sometimes, he slept in his car between jobs. Then he was hospitalized for exhaustion and a staph infection.",
      "\u201cWhile people around me praised my hustle, I eventually paid the price,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe doctor looked at me and said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what lifestyle you\u2019re living, but you\u2019re too young to be this stressed. You\u2019re going to have to quit something.'\"",
      "So Stewart, now 36, began setting boundaries. He gave up the side jobs, deciding he could survive without extra income. If people from the news show texted him after-hours, he let them know he was off-duty and where else to call.",
      "Setting boundaries at work, and in life, can be tricky. Many people find it difficult to say no, especially to a manager. Some get a sense of satisfaction from being needed or pleasing others.",
      "But learning to turn down a request or invitation is essential for protecting our physical and mental health, experts say. And as with any new skill, drawing boundaries gets easier with practice.",
      "Experts in well-being and organizational behavior, along with other workers, shared strategies for setting limits.",
      "Adding tasks to your calendar may seem counterintuitive if scaling back is the goal, but can provide more control over your time.",
      "Bobby Dutton, the founder of event production company GBM6, uses a technique he calls \u201caggressive calendering.\u201d He schedules the task he\u2019s most likely to procrastinate on, such as handling contracts and invoices, for every Monday at 2 p.m. To keep his calendar from becoming overloaded, he also books time for recurring routine tasks like making coffee, walking the dog and eating lunch.",
      "If you\u2019re unaccustomed to saying no, you can write down what you\u2019re going to say beforehand and rehearse it. Stewart worked on letting colleagues know when his assignment load began feeling too heavy with phrases like \u201cHey, this is a lot for me\" or \"You gave me seven stories, I think I can get four or five done.\u201d",
      "Cara Houser, a workplace engagement coach, says you don\u2019t have to explain yourself when declining a request. You can simply say you\u2019re not available at that time, followed by \u201cThanks for asking, and I hope to have more capacity next time.\u201d",
      "If the recipient of your \u201cno\u201d tries to argue, you can respond, \u201cI hear you feel that way. But for me, this is what I\u2019ve decided to do for that day,\u201d Houser said.",
      "Entrepreneur Amber Krasinski grew up in a working-class environment where saying no to a boss could mean losing a paycheck. As the founder of marketing company IvyHill Strategies, Krasinski worries she'll lose clients if she turns down a project. \u201cNot yet\u201d is her go-to phrase when one more project is too much.",
      "\u201cThat phrase has helped me through a lot of situations,\u201d she said.",
      "It can be tempting to agree immediately when we're asked to chip in. But there may be times when we're better off demurring. When faced with a new work request, take five minutes to assess your workload, energy level and priorities before responding, suggests Israa Nasir, a psychotherapist in New York.",
      "Nasir says a former boss frequently texted work-related questions at 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. \u201cI didn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t text me,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2019Can we check in on Fridays before the weekend? So everything that\u2019s on your mind, you can (tell me) and then I can plan my time accordingly.\u201d",
      "Pay attention to the activities and interactions that leave you feeling drained or overwhelmed, Nasir said. Put those kinds of events on a \u201cNo List.\" The list doesn't mean you decline every time you're asked, but don't say yes right away, she advises.",
      "Mobile devices make it easier to work from anywhere, and harder to draw boundaries. But there are ways to adjust our devices so they're less distracting.",
      "After noticing that she checked email far too frequently on weekends, Nasir starting moving the Gmail app from her iPhone\u2019s homepage to the second page from Friday night to Sunday night.",
      "An email signature is another tool you can use to manage expectations, by publishing working hours or upcoming vacation schedules, said Candice Pokk, a senior consultant in organizational effectiveness at Segal Consulting.",
      "Pokk includes a \u201cWell Being Notice\u201d at the bottom of her emails which reads, \u201cReceiving this email outside normal working hours? Managing a work-life balance is unique for everyone. I have sent this email at a time that works for me. Please respond at a time that works for you.\u201d",
      "With the popularity of online meeting software, it's easy for others to overload your calendar with invitations. Accepting every one can leave little time for other work.",
      "Janine Pelosi, CEO of Oslo-based video technology company Neat, thinks workers should be able to leave a meeting that's not relevant to them, if it's an environment where that's accepted.",
      "If you're unsure it's worthwhile to attend, you can request an agenda in advance, or ask what is the desired outcome, she said.",
      "Publisher Lori Perkins, 65, was working 12 to 16 hours daily when a cancer diagnosis halted her routine. During chemotherapy, she could only muster up enough energy to put in four hours a day, and even then felt like she was working \u201cin a vat of molasses.\u201d",
      "After treatment, \"I realized I was going to live, and then I said to myself, \u2018Do I want to continue doing this?\u2019\u201d Perkins said.",

      "She practices saying \u201cno\u201d in her head and in her journal, where she also chronicles what happened after she said it. She's gained time to visit museums, friends and the theater.",

      "An annual U.S. government report on \u201cnotorious markets\u201d known for counterfeiting and other violations of intellectual property says that nearly all 35,000 online pharmacies around the world are being run illegally",
      "BANGKOK -- Nearly all of the world\u2019s 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report on \u201c notorious markets.\u201d The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.",
      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

    "story": [
      "If the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal goes according to the current draft, then fighting will stop in Gaza for 42 days, and dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be freed",
      "CAIRO -- If the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal goes according to the current draft, then fighting will stop in Gaza for 42 days, and dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be freed. In this first phase Israeli troops will pull back to the edges of Gaza, and many Palestinians will be able to return to what remains of their homes as stepped-up aid flows in.",
      "The question is if the ceasefire will survive beyond that first phase.",
      "That will depend on even more negotiations meant to begin within weeks. In those talks, Israel, Hamas, and the U.S, Egyptian and Qatari mediators will have to tackle the tough issue of how Gaza will be governed, with Israel demanding the elimination of Hamas.",
      "Without a deal within those 42 days to begin the second phase, Israel could resume its campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas \u2013 even as dozens of hostages remain in the militants\u2019 hands.",
      "Hamas has agreed to a draft of the ceasefire deal, two officials confirmed, but Israeli officials say details are still being worked out, meaning some terms could change, or the whole deal could even fall through. Here is a look at the plan and potential pitfalls in the draft seen by the Associated Press.",
      "During the first phase, Hamas is to release 33 hostages in exchange for the freeing of hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. By the end of the phase, all living women, children and older people held by the militants should be freed.",
      "Some 100 hostages remain captive inside Gaza, a mix of civilians and soldiers, and the military believes at least a third them are dead.",
      "On the first official day of the ceasefire, Hamas is to free three hostages, then another four on the seventh day. After that, it will make weekly releases.",
      "Which hostages and how many Palestinians will be released is complicated. The 33 will include women, children and those over 50 \u2014 almost all civilians, but the deal also commits Hamas to free all living female soldiers. Hamas will release living hostages first, but if the living don\u2019t complete the 33 number, bodies will be handed over. Not all hostages are held by Hamas, so getting other militant groups to hand them over could be an issue.",
      "In exchange, Israel will free 30 Palestinian women, children or elderly for each living civilian hostage freed. For each female soldier freed, Israel will release 50 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 serving life sentences. In exchange for bodies handed over by Hamas, Israel will free all women and children it has detained from Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Dozens of men, including soldiers, will remain captive in Gaza, pending the second phase.",
      "During the proposed deal's first phase, Israeli troops are to pull back into a buffer zone about a kilometer (0.6 miles) wide inside Gaza along its borders with Israel.",
      "That will allow displaced Palestinians to return to their homes, including in Gaza City and northern Gaza. With most of Gaza\u2019s population driven into massive, squalid tent camps, Palestinians are desperate to get back to their homes, even though many were destroyed or heavily damaged by Israel\u2019s campaign.",
      "But there are complications. During the past year of negotiations, Israel has insisted it must control the movement of Palestinians to the north to ensure Hamas does not take weapons back into those areas.",
      "Throughout the war, the Israeli military has severed the north from the rest of Gaza by holding the so-called Netzarim Corridor, a belt across the strip where troops cleared out the Palestinian population and set up bases. That allowed them to search people fleeing from the north into central Gaza and bar anyone trying to return.",
      "The draft seen by the AP specifies that Israel is to leave the corridor. In the first week, troops would withdraw from the main north-south coastal road \u2014 Rasheed Street \u2014 which would open one route for Palestinians returning. By the 22nd day of the ceasefire, Israeli troops are to leave the entire corridor.",
      "Still, as talks continued Tuesday, an Israeli official insisted the military will keep control of Netzarim and that Palestinians returning north would have to pass inspections there, though he declined to provide details. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss closed negotiations.",
      "Working out those contradictions could bring frictions.",
      "Throughout the first phase, Israel will retain control of the Philadelphi Corridor, the strip of territory along Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt, including the Rafah Crossing. Hamas dropped demands that Israel pull out of this area.",
      "In the first phase, aid entry to Gaza is to be ramped up to hundreds of trucks a day of food, medicine, supplies and fuel to alleviate the humanitarian crisis. That is far more than Israel has allowed in throughout the war.",
      "For months, aid groups have struggled to distribute to Palestinians even the trickle of aid entering Gaza because of Israeli military restrictions and rampant robberies of aid trucks by gangs. An end to fighting should alleviate that.",
      "The need is great. Malnutrition and diseases are rampant among Palestinians, crammed into tents and short on food and clean water. Hospitals have been damaged and short of supplies. The draft deal specifies that equipment will be allowed in to build shelters for tens of thousands whose homes were destroyed and to rebuild infrastructure like electricity, sewage, communications and road systems.",
      "But here, too, implementation could bring problems.",
      "Even before the war, Israel has restricted entry of some equipment, arguing it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. Another Israeli official said arrangements are still being worked out over aid distribution and cleanup, but the plan is to prevent Hamas from having any role.",
      "Further complicating matters, Israel's government is still committed to its plan to ban UNRWA from operating and to cut all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. The UN agency is the major distributor of aid in Gaza and provides education, health and other basic services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the region, including in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
      "If all of that works out, the sides must still tackle the second phase. Negotiations over it are to begin on Day 16 of the ceasefire.",
      "Phase two's broad outlines are laid out in the draft: All remaining hostages are to be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a \u201csustainable calm.\u201d",
      "But that seemingly basic exchange opens up much bigger issues.",
      "Israel has said it will not agree to a complete withdrawal until Hamas\u2019 military and political capabilities are eliminated and it cannot rearm \u2014 ensuring Hamas no longer runs Gaza. Hamas says it will not hand over the last hostages until Israel removes all troops from everywhere in Gaza.",
      "So the negotiations will have to get both sides to agree to an alternative for governing Gaza. Effectively, Hamas has to agree to its own removal from power \u2014 something it has said it is willing to do, but it may seek to keep a hand in any future government, which Israel has vehemently rejected.",
      "The draft agreement says a deal on the second phase must be worked out by the end of the first.",
      "Pressure will be on both sides to reach a deal, but what happens if they don\u2019t? It could go in many directions.",
      "Hamas had wanted written guarantees that a ceasefire would continue as long as needed to agree on phase two. It has settled for verbal guarantees from the United States, Egypt and Qatar.",
      "Israel, however, has given no assurances. So Israel could threaten new military action to pressure Hamas in the negotiations or could outright resume its military campaign, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened.",
      "Hamas and the mediators are betting the momentum from the first phase will make it difficult for him to do that. Relaunching the assault would risk losing the remaining hostages \u2014 infuriating many against Netanyahu \u2014 though stopping short of destroying Hamas will also anger key political partners.",
      "The third phase is likely to be less contentious: The bodies of remaining hostages would be returned in exchange for a 3- to 5-year reconstruction plan to be carried out in Gaza under international supervision."

    "story": [
      "Britain's Princess of Wales says that her cancer is in remission following a visit to the hospital where she received treatment",
      "LONDON -- The Princess of Wales said Tuesday that her cancer is in remission after she spent the day supporting other cancer patients at the hospital where she received treatment.",
      "In a statement on social media, she offered her thanks to everyone who helped her and her husband, Prince William, as they navigated the ups and downs of treatment and recovery. Earlier, the princess, usually known simply as Kate, hugged patients at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London and described her own treatment as \u201cexceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is a relief to now be in remission and I remain focused on recovery,\u2033 the princess, 43, wrote in a note signed with her initial, C. \u201cAs anyone who has experienced a cancer diagnosis will know, it takes time to adjust to a new normal.\u2033",
      "Remission is good news, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean cancer has been cured. It could mean that treatment has knocked out all the cancer that can be measured. That\u2019s called complete remission. Or it could mean that treatment has eliminated at least half the cancer. That\u2019s called a partial remission.",
      "The American Cancer Society says reduction in the tumor\u2019s size must last at least a month for it to be considered in remission.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s announcement marked the first official update on her condition since September, when Kate said she had completed chemotherapy. The princess still hasn\u2019t revealed what type of cancer she was treated for.",
      "During her solo engagement at the Royal Marsden, a world-leading cancer center known for its pioneering research, Kate thanked the medical team for their support and spoke with other patients receiving chemotherapy and immunotherapy.",
      "The princess hugged Tina Adumou, who wept as she told Kate that her 19-year-old daughter is in the intensive care unit. Putting an arm around her, Kate offered sympathy and told Adumou that her daughter was in the best possible place.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I wish there was more I could do to help,\u201d Kate said. \u201cI wanted to come and show my support for the amazing work that\u2019s going on here, and for those who are going through treatment and having such a hard time.\u201d",
      "But then she offered encouragement.",
      "\u201cThere is light at the end of that tunnel,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cVery nice to meet you and best of luck. You are in the best of hands.\u201d",
      "The princess also shared her experiences with Katherine Field, 45. Gesturing to her arm and chest, she discussed the port mechanism through which drugs were flowed.",
      "\u201cI got so attached to it,\u201d Kate said, joking that she had been almost reluctant to have hers removed when told she no longer needed it.",
      "The princess\u2019s office at Kensington Palace stressed that even though her cancer is in remission she would continue her gradual return to public-facing engagements. The palace described the visit as reflecting her \u201cown personal cancer journey.\u2019\u2019",
      "Tuesday\u2019s announcement was a welcome sign of goods news for the royal family, which was buffeted by health concerns last year. The medical odyssey began last January when royal officials announced that King Charles III would receive treatment for an enlarged prostate and Kate would undergo abdominal surgery.",
      "In February, Buckingham Palace announced that Charles was receiving treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer. Six weeks later, Kate said she, too, was undergoing treatment for cancer, quieting the relentless speculation about her condition that had circulated on social media since her surgery.",
      "The strain on the royal family was severe. With two of the most visible royals out sick \u2014 and Prince William taking time off to support his wife \u2014 the other members of the house of Windsor had to take care of the never-ending whirl of public appearances that the British public demands.",
      "But Charles, 76, and Kate slowly returned to duty after receiving treatment.",
      "The princess announced in September she had completed chemotherapy, appearing alongside her husband and children in a video in which she expressed \u201crelief\u2019\u2019 at the turn of events.",
      "\u201cLife as you know it can change in an instant, and we have had to find a way to navigate the stormy waters and road unknown,\u2019\u2019 she said in the video, which was shot in a woodland near the family\u2019s summer home in Norfolk.",
      "Though she stepped away from most public duties during her treatment, Kate made a handful of appearances last year, including at the king\u2019s birthday parade in June, known as Trooping the Colour, and later at the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon in July, where she received a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cTo all those who are continuing their own cancer journey \u2014 I remain with you, side by side, hand in hand,\u201d Kate said.",
      "The hospital visit comes just days before the 1st anniversary of Kate\u2019s admittance to the London Clinic for major abdominal surgery on Jan. 16, 2024. She recuperated for two weeks in the hospital, and was at home recuperating when she was told she needed to begin chemotherapy.",
      "William described 2024 as \u201cbrutal\u201d and probably \u201cthe hardest year\u201d of his life.",
      "\u2014\u2014-",

      "JERUSALEM -- Argentinian President Javier Milei has been awarded Israel\u2019s prestigious 2025 Genesis Prize in recognition of his support of Israel, organizers announced Tuesday.",
      "During his year in office, Milei has announced he will move the embassy to Jerusalem, joining a small group of countries that recognize the contested city as Israel's capital. He has supported Israel at the United Nations and pledged to bring justice for bombings of Israeli and Jewish sites in Argentina in the 1990s.",
      "Milei said he was honored to receive the prize and praised what he said was the resilience of the Jewish people. \u201cThis spirit is a cornerstone of the relationship between Argentina and Israel, and I will work to further strengthen our ties.\u201d",
      "The $1 million award is granted each year to a person for their professional achievements, contributions to humanity and commitment to Jewish values. Previous recipients have donated the prize to philanthropic causes. Milei said he would donate the funds to causes that fight antisemitism in Argentina and around the world.",
      "Last month, Milei finished his first year in office. Initially, his inexperience, unkempt hairdo, sexual boasts and devotion to his dead dog, the Rolling Stones and the free market didn\u2019t inspire much confidence in a country with a history of failed economic reforms.",
      "Milei\u2019s implementation of harsh austerity measures have led to higher unemployment, and poverty has surged. But Argentina\u2019s soaring inflation is starting to subside and Milei\u2019s approval rating hovers over 50%.",
      "The Genesis Prize organizers said it is the first time a prize is being awarded to a head of state. \u201cDespite the enormous challenges in his home country, he made it his top priority to stand by Israel at its most difficult hour,\u201d said Genesis Prize Chairman Stan Polovets. Milei has also expressed a deep affinity for Judaism and has suggested he may convert in the future.",
      "The prize is usually awarded at a gala event in Jerusalem each June attended by Israel\u2019s prime minister.",
      "Previous winners have included businessman and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, actor Michael Douglas, violinist Itzhak Perlman, sculptor Sir Anish Kapoor, filmmaker Steven Spielberg; New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, former Soviet political prisoner Natan Sharansky, and actress Barbara Streisand.",

      "Artist Mikael Genberg says he has been wanting to put his typically Swedish-looking miniature house on the moon for 25 years.",
      "It was \"a crazy, maybe idiotic, but at the same time, in my mind, really poetic thought to put a red house with white corners on the surface of the moon,\" Genberg said in a video posted on Facebook. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose? It\u2019s it\u2019s art,\" he added.",

      "\u201cIt's small on this planet, but it will be big on the moon \u2014 there's nothing like that in space,\u201d he told The Associated Press in a phone interview.",
      "The house is made out of aluminum and daubed with a special, space-certified paint. It's 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) long, 8 cms (3.1 inches) wide and 10 cms (3.9 inches) tall.",

      "While it was Genberg's idea to put the house on the moon with the help of lunar rover Tenacious, about 70 people donated some 7 million - 10 million Swedish kronor ($620,000 - $888,000) for the project, which also includes the flight, he said.",
      "\u201cThe vision of the artwork merges with our own; to expand our planet and future, and to extend the sphere of human life into space,\u201d Julien-Alexandre Lamamy, the CEO of ispace Europe, said in a statement.",
      "If the launch is successful, Genberg says that once the rover lands on the moon in about four months, \u201cit should release the house, take some pictures and leave it alone standing there for thousands and thousands and maybe millions of years.\""

The activist was facing charges including defamation, assault and inciting an unauthorized demonstration.",

In places already lacking the infrastructure of the country's rapidly developing coastal cities, it damaged more than 60,000 homes and at least 585 schools, according to government estimates. Morocco has pledged more than $11.5 billion to aid in recovery and reconstruction over the next five years, allocating funds to rebuild households and offer cash aid to displaced families.",

      "\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake here is not just hunger, and hunger is big enough. But it\u2019s about the future of this country and how it moves forward into this next phase,\u201d McCain said in an interview with The Associated Press in her first visit to Syria after she met with the de facto government\u2019s Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani.",
      "Syria for over a month has been under a new de facto government led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, which led a lightning insurgency in December that overthrew Assad following nearly 14 years of conflict.",
      "Humanitarian agencies including the WFP for years have decried budget cuts to programs giving aid to millions of people of Syria, where the U.N. estimates 90% of its population live in poverty, and more than half of its people - over 12 million - don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from. The country\u2019s critical electricity and water infrastructure is also battered by the war. The agencies have cited shrinking budgets and donor fatigue that worsened after the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.",
      "Last year, WFP ended its main assistance program which helped feed millions of Syrians, and has been gradually cutting programs that fed millions of Syrian refugees in neighboring countries.",
      "The war-torn country, under the rule of HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, now is undergoing a transition that regional and international governments hope will bring about a new constitution, elections, and an inclusive political system.",
      "McCain said she and al-Shibani discussed the urgent need to feed more people, as well as to make the country's own food production more sustainable, including by improving its crippled water supply and boosting wheat farming.",
      "\u201cI think the government certainly is willing to work on that at least in the talks that I\u2019ve heard today,\u201d she said.",
      "But funding remains a major issue.",
      "With funds from Western countries shrinking, humanitarian organizations have increasingly turned to Arab governments, notably wealthy Gulf nations, for funding. While those countries have been quick to establish diplomatic ties with Syria\u2019s new rulers, McCain said donors remain hesitant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important that the Gulf countries particularly pay attention because this is their back yard,\u201d said McCain. \u201cWe would like to see them more active in not just the short-term emergency needs but the long-term needs as well.\u201d",
      "Those governments and some aid agencies have also called for the lifting of Western-led sanctions in various parts of Syria that have restricted development work beyond aid handouts. Though most of the sanctions were on Assad and his associates, HTS and al-Sharaa are also sanctioned by Washington, Europe, and the UN.",
      "Washington earlier this month eased some restrictions on Syria\u2019s de facto government, including on some energy sales, for six months. The EU later this month is set to discuss the possibility of easing sanctions in moves tied to progress in Syria\u2019s political transition.",
      "McCain warned that the reluctance among donors to meet the needs of millions in poverty and food insecurity in Syria could have dire consequences, as the country goes through a critical phase.",
      "\u201cFood security is national security no matter where you\u2019re at,\u201d said McCain. \u201cHunger does not breed good will. We want to make sure people are fed and that their children have their ability to not just eat, but also go to school, and all the other things we want for a good society.\u201d"

      "Authorities launched an operation in November to force out the men who were mining illegally at the closed Buffelsfontein Gold Mine by cutting off their food and water supplies from the surface. Police say the miners can come out but are refusing for fear of being arrested.",
      "But groups representing the miners dispute that and say they are trapped up to 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) below the surface in one of the country's deepest mines and a proper rescue operation should have started months ago.",
      "One group says more than 100 have died and 500 others are still trapped, with many ill and starving.",
      "It's not clear exactly how long the miners have been underground near the town of Stilfontein, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Johannesburg. But it's certain they have been there since at least November, when police first tried to force them out. Some members of the local community say their relatives have been trapped for nearly six months, since July.",
      "Illegal mining is common in parts of gold-rich South Africa where companies close down mines that are no longer profitable, leaving informal miners to illegally enter them to try and find leftover deposits. Large groups often go underground for months to maximize their profits, taking food, water, generators and other equipment with them, but also relying on others on the surface to send down more supplies.",
      "Police tried to force the miners out last year by cutting of their supplies and dismantling ropes they used to climb down into the mine and a pulley system used for supplies. A Cabinet minister said the aim was to \u201csmoke them out\u201d and the government would not send help because they were \u201ccriminals.\u201d",
      "That tactic is now being fiercely criticized by rights groups. Some of them won a court case in December forcing police and provincial authorities to allow food, water and medicine to be sent down to the miners again. But they say the supplies are not enough for all those who are trapped.",
      "Some miners have emerged in the last two months and been arrested. Police says that shows they can come out. But a spokesman for the Mining Affected Communities United in Action group, which is representing the miners and their families, said the miners who did escape undertook a treacherous days-long journey underground to a different shaft, and many are too weak to do that.",
      "The police operation at Stilfontein last year was part of a countrywide crackdown on mining gangs known as \u201czama zamas,\u201d or hustlers in the Zulu language, that have long been a problem in South Africa. The government estimates that there are about 6,000 abandoned mines and that close to $1 billion is lost annually in revenue due to illicit mining.",
      "A community-led rescue effort began bringing survivors and bodies out of the Buffelsfontein mine on Friday, while authorities started an official rescue and recovery effort using a cage lowered into the mine.",
      "More than 20 bodies have been recovered and more than 30 survivors have been brought out, police said.",
      "But it could take weeks to rescue survivors and bring bodies out as the cage can fit less than 10 people. Authorities have also said no official rescue personnel will go down into the mine because it is extremely dangerous. A volunteer from the community who is familiar with the mine has been handling the cage as it is dropped deep underground.",

      "Lebanon\u2019s prime minister-designate has vowed to rebuild the country following years of economic meltdown and a 14-month war between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group",
      "BEIRUT -- Lebanon\u2019s prime minister-designate vowed Tuesday to work on building a modern state in the crisis-hit country, saying his priorities will be to rebuild the destruction caused by a yearlong war with Israel and work on pulling the small nation out of its historic economic meltdown.",
      "Nawaf Salam spoke after meeting with Lebanon's new President Joseph Aoun, who himself took office last week. With the nomination of Salam and confirmation of Aoun, Lebanon, which has been run by a caretaker administration, now has a new government in waiting for the first time in two years.",
      "After the meeting, Salam said he will not marginalize any side in Lebanon, an apparent reference to the Hezbollah militant group, which in past years opposed his appointment as prime minister and this year indicated its preference for another candidate.",
      "Hezbollah has been weakened by its 14-month war with Israel, which ended in late November when a U.S.-brokered 60-day ceasefire went into effect. The war left 4,000 people dead and more than 16,000 wounded and caused destruction totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.",
      "Salam, who is currently the head of the International Court of Justice, said that he will work on spreading the state\u2019s authority on all parts of the country. On Monday he won the support of a majority of legislators, after which Aoun formally asked him to form a new government.",
      "Over the past years, Hezbollah and its allies have blocked Salam from becoming prime minister, casting him as a U.S.-backed candidate.",
      "\u201cThe time has come to say, enough. Now is the time to start a new chapter,\u201d Salam said adding that people in Lebanon have suffered badly because of \u201cthe latest brutal Israeli aggression on Lebanon and because of the worst economic crisis and financial policies that made the Lebanese poor.\u201d",
      "Decades of corruption and political paralysis have left Lebanon\u2019s banks barely functional, while electricity services are almost entirely in the hands of private diesel-run generator owners and fuel suppliers. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic further battered the economy, and the Beirut port explosion, one of the largest non-nuclear blasts ever recorded, badly damaged several neighborhoods in the heart of the capital.",
      "Salam vowed to fully implement the U.N. Security Council resolution related to the Israel-Hezbollah war which states that Israel should withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon and Hezbollah should not have an armed presence close to the border with Israel.",
      "The premier added that he will work on spreading state authority on all parts of Lebanon through \u201cits forces.\"",
      "Salam said he will work on putting a program to build a modern economy that would help the country of 6 million people, including 1 million Syrian refugees, out of its economic crisis that exploded into protests in October 2019.",
      "Since the economic crisis began, successive governments have done little to implement reforms demanded by the international community that would lead to the release of billions of dollars of investments and loans by foreign donors.",
      "\u201cBoth my hands are extended to all of you so that we all move forward in the mission of salvation, reforms and reconstruction,\u201d Salam said.",
      "Neither Salam nor Aoun, an army commander who was elected president last week, is considered part of the political class the ruled the country after the end of the 1975-90 civil war."

      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced the plan this week which will tackle housing affordability and high rents in the Southern European nation. He said the overall goal was to provide \u201cmore housing, better regulation and greater aid.\u201d",
      "However, it remains unclear if the plan put forth by S\u00e1nchez\u2019s minority coalition would pass in Parliament.",
      "Here's a look at what's happening:",
      "Like most rich countries, Spain is in the throes of a growing housing affordability problem. Skyrocketing rents are particularly acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for young people. Housing prices are also steadily rising, especially in cities and coastal areas.",
      "Rental prices have also been driven up by short-term rentals mainly offered for tourists. Spain receives more tourists than almost any country in the world with more than 88.5 million people having visited the country in 2024.",
      "The negative side to tourism, or \u201covertourism,\u201d has at times sparked tension between visitors and residents concerned about rising rental prices, the proliferation of short-term rentals on platforms, like AirBnB, and water supplies that can be stretched in some parts of the country, including the popular Canary and Balearic islands.",
      "Last year, protestors took to the streets on various occasions across the country to raise concerns about the growth of tourism and high rental prices. Barcelona\u2019s town hall has pledged to completely eliminate all short-term rentals to tourists in the coming years.",
      "Spain plans to limit the number of homes foreigners purchase by raising taxes on homes bought by non-European Union residents by up to 100%.",
      "Non-EU residents bought 27,000 properties in Spain in 2023, S\u00e1nchez said while announcing the plan, \u201cnot to live in\u201d but \u201cto make money from.\"",
      "S\u00e1nchez did not provide a timeline or details on how he plans to implement the tax.",
      "Other measures proposed include higher taxes on holiday rentals and a tax break for landlords who provide affordable housing in high-rent areas.",

      "But as one of Europe\u2019s leading Socialist politicians, the housing crunch is a crucial question for S\u00e1nchez to resolve as he tries to keep his left-wing minority coalition afloat after winning four-year another term in 2023.",

      "Besigye, 68, has faced arrest and assault many times in his political career. But he\u2019s never been convicted of a crime.",
      "Amnesty International has called for Besigye\u2019s release, saying his \u201cabduction clearly violated international human rights law and the process of extradition with its requisite fair trial protections.\u201d",
      "Besigye\u2019s trial is \u201cthe latest example of Uganda\u2019s authorities misusing military courts and military-related charges to clamp down on the opposition,\u201d according to Human Rights Watch.",
      "The unfolding trial of Besigye is being watched closely by Ugandans anxious over political maneuvers ahead of presidential elections. Although Yoweri Museveni, who has held power since 1986, is expected to seek re-election, some observers believe he may step aside.",
      "Museveni has no obvious successor within the ranks of the ruling National Resistance Movement party, one reason for widespread fears over an unpredictable political transition.",
      "Besigye, a qualified physician who retired from Uganda\u2019s military at the rank of colonel, is a former president of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, or FDC, party. With Besigye at its helm, the FDC was for many years Uganda\u2019s most prominent opposition group. He is a fierce critic of Museveni, for whom he once served as military assistant and personal doctor before they fell out in the 1990s over what Besigye said was Museveni\u2019s slide into authoritarianism.",
      "Museveni has long been criticized by human rights groups over alleged violations against opposition figures.",
      "Uganda has not witnessed a peaceful transfer of power since independence from British colonial rule in 1962."

      "Rescuers have sent a cage-like structure into one of South Africa\u2019s deepest gold mines to bring out survivors among hundreds of illegal miners trapped for months in an abandoned shaft",
      "STILFONTEIN, South Africa -- Rescuers sent a cage-like structure down into one of South Africa\u2019s deepest gold mines on Tuesday to bring out survivors among hundreds of illegal miners trapped for months in an abandoned shaft. More than 100 are believed to have died of starvation or dehydration.",
      "Civic organizations and groups representing the miners say that at least 24 bodies and 34 survivors have been brought out of the Buffelsfontein Gold Mine since Friday, but more than 500 miners are still believed to be underground, many of them ill and starving. Police said they are uncertain how many remain, but it is likely to be hundreds.",
      "Six of the bodies and eight survivors were recovered early Tuesday, said Mzukisi Jam, the regional chairperson of the South African National Civics Organization, an umbrella for civic and rights groups. Jam was at the mine.",
      "The mine near the town of Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg, has been the scene of a tense standoff between police, miners and members of the local community since November, when authorities first launched an operation to try and force the miners out. Relatives of the miners say some of them have been underground since July.",
      "Authorities say the miners are able to come out and are refusing, but that has been disputed by rights groups and activists, who have fiercely criticized police tactics in cutting off the miners' food and water supplies from the surface in an attempt to force them out. The rights groups say many of the miners are dying of starvation and unable to climb out because the shaft is too steep and the ropes and pulley system they used to enter have been removed.",
      "\u201cWe are happy that this (rescue) operation is happening, even though we believe that if it was done earlier, we wouldn\u2019t even have one dead person,\u201d Jam said.",
      "Illegal mining is common in parts of gold-rich South Africa where companies close down mines that are no longer profitable, leaving groups of informal miners to illegally enter them to try and find leftover deposits.",
      "Large groups of illegal miners often go underground for months to maximize their profits, taking food, water, generators and other equipment with them, but also relying on others in their group on the surface to send down more supplies.",
      "Some have escaped from the mine since November and been arrested, authorities have confirmed, although the exact number is not clear. Police say the miners are afraid of being arrested if they come out.",
      "Rights activists said the only way out is for miners to make a dangerous trek to another shaft, which can take days, and crawl out there. They said many of the miners are too weak or ill to climb out. The mine is 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) deep and has multiple shafts, many levels and is a maze of tunnels, and the community mining group said there are numerous groups of miners in various parts of the mine.",
      "Residents have gathered near the mine desperately waiting for news on family members. The community organized its own rescue operation on Friday before the official one by authorities began Monday.",
      "\u201cThe last time I spoke to my brother was in July, when he told us that he is going underground,\" said Zinzi Tom, a sister of one of the miners who remained underground. \"We had not heard anything from him, but yesterday one of the miners who surfaced said he saw him about two weeks ago. Apparently he is very sick and he is struggling to survive.\u201d",
      "The Mining Affected Communities United in Action group, which took authorities to court in December to force them to allow food, water and medicine to be sent down to the miners, released two cellphone videos which they said were from underground and showed dozens of dead bodies of miners wrapped in plastic. A spokesman for the group said \u201ca minimum\u201d of 100 miners had died.",
      "The cellphone videos purportedly from the depths of the mine are filmed by a man who can be heard saying, \u201cThis is hunger. People are dying because of hunger,\u201d as he records emaciated-looking men sitting on the damp floor of the mine. He adds: \u201cPlease help us. Bring us food or take us out.\u201d",
      "South Africa's minister of police and minister of mineral resources were due to visit the mine on Tuesday, while authorities have come under scrutiny for their tactics.",
      "South African Cabinet Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told reporters in November that the government would not help the miners, which they considered \u201ccriminals.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are not sending help to criminals,\" she said, according to local media. \u201cWe are going to smoke them out. They will come out.\u201d",

      "A Philippine security official says China is \u201cpushing us to the wall\u201d with growing aggression in the disputed South China Sea and warned that \u201call options are on the table\u201d for Manila\u2019s response, including new international lawsuits",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- A Philippine security official said Tuesday that China is \u201cpushing us to the wall\u201d with growing aggression in the disputed South China Sea and warned that \u201call options are on the table\u201d for Manila's response, including new international lawsuits.",
      "On Tuesday, a large Chinese coast guard ship patrolled hotly disputed Scarborough Shoal and then sailed toward the northwestern coast of the Philippines, coming as close as 77 nautical miles (143 kilometers), Philippine officials said in a news conference.",
      "\"The presence of the monster ship in Filipino waters \u2026 77 nautical miles from our shoreline, is unacceptable and, therefore, it should be withdrawn immediately by the Chinese government,\u201d Jonathan Malaya, assistant director-general of the National Security Council, said at the news conference alongside senior military and coast guard officials.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re pushing us to the wall,\u201d Malaya said of China.",
      "Two Philippine coast guard ships, backed by a small surveillance aircraft, repeatedly ordered the 165-meter (541-foot) Chinese coast guard ship to withdraw from the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, a 200-nautical mile (370-kilometer) stretch of water, Philippine coast guard Commodore Jay Tarriela said.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing there is, hour-by-hour and day-to-day, (we're) challenging the illegal presence of the Chinese coast guard for the international community to know that we\u2019re not going to allow China to normalize the illegal deployment,\" Tarriela said.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Chinese officials. In the past, they have repeatedly accused the Philippines and other rival claimant states including Vietnam and Malaysia of encroaching on what they say are \u201cundisputed\u201d Chinese territorial waters.",
      "Under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office in mid-2022, the Philippines has aggressively defended its territorial interests in the South China Sea, a key global trading route. That has brought Philippine forces into frequent confrontations with China\u2019s coast guard, navy and suspected militia boats and sparked fears that a bigger armed conflict could draw in the United States, the Philippines\u2019 longtime treaty ally and China\u2019s regional rival.",
      "The lopsided conflict has forced the Philippines to seek security arrangements with other Asian and Western countries, including Japan, with which it signed a key agreement last July which would allow their forces to hold joint combat training. The pact, which must be ratified by lawmakers of both countries before it takes effect, was the first such agreement to be forged by Japan in Asia.",
      "China surrounded Scarborough Shoal with its coast guard and other ships after a tense territorial standoff with the Philippines in 2012. The Philippines responded by bringing its disputes with China to international arbitration in 2013 and largely won three years later when an arbitration panel in The Hague invalidated China\u2019s expansive claims in the busy sea passage under the 1982 United Convention on the Law of the Sea.",
      "China has rejected the 2016 arbitration ruling and continues to openly defy it.",
      "\u201cWill this lead to another case?\u201d Malaya said. \u201cAll options are on the table because the closer the monster ship is in Philippine waters, the more it makes tensions high and the more that the Philippine government contemplates things it was not contemplating before.\u201d",
      "China has warned the Philippines from pursuing another legal case in an international forum after the arbitration, preferring bilateral negotiations, which give Beijing an advantage because of its size and clout, a senior Philippine official has said on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss such sensitive issues publicly.",
      "The two countries have also been discussing their territorial conflicts under a bilateral consultation mechanism to avoid an escalation of the disputes. The next round of talks will be hosted by China, the official said."

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s new prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, is facing his first major test at parliament on Tuesday as his government has no majority amid unprecedented political instability.",
      "Bayrou will address lawmakers through a general policy speech meant to outline his top priorities, including key budget decisions, one month after he was appointed by President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "Bayrou urgently needs to pass a budget bill for 2025. Following the collapse of the previous government, an emergency law has been approved to enable the state to levy taxes from Jan. 1, pay basic expenses and avoid a shutdown.",
      "But only a proper budget would help reduce France\u2019s deficit and allow key expenses such as defense measures needed amid the war in Ukraine or aid promised to angry farmers.",
      "Financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission are pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt and keep France\u2019s borrowing costs from spiraling. That would threaten the prosperity of eurozone countries.",
      "France's deficit is estimated to reach 6% of its gross domestic product in 2024. Finance Minister \u00c9ric Lombard said last week the government is \u201caiming for a deficit of between 5 and 5.5%\u201d this year.",
      "When he took office, Bayrou said that \u201cno one knows the difficulty of the situation better\u201d than he does, comparing the challenges faced to an \u201cHimalaya.\u201d",
      "Bayrou\u2019s Cabinet relies on a fragile deal between Macron\u2019s centrist allies and conservatives of The Republicans party who even together have no parliamentary majority.",
      "The previous government was in place for only three months before being brought down by opposition lawmakers from both the left and the far right amid a budget dispute.",
      "To avoid a repetition of that scenario, Bayrou seeks to secure a nonaggression pact with the Socialists so that they wouldn\u2019t support any future move to topple the new government.",
      "The Socialists said they are open to talks on the condition that they would include negotiations on Macron's unpopular pension reform that passed two years ago.",
      "However, the possibility of another no-confidence vote is still looming.",
      "The hard-left France Unbowed party refused to enter into talks with the government and already announced it would file a no-confidence motion.",
      "A vote later this week would have little chance of succeeding as the far right appears unwilling to support such move in the immediate term.",
      "Yet the question could be raised again during the future budget debate at parliament, with more uncertainty on the result.",
      "Macron\u2019s plan to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 unleashed months of mass protests from January to June 2023 that damaged his leadership. The legislation, which has gradually started being implemented, also requires people to work 43 years to receive a full pension.",
      "The Socialists are now urging Bayrou to announce a \u201csuspension\u201d of the reform in order to provide time to renegotiate it, with the aim of backtracking on the age of 64 and introducing specific measures for those who have long careers and certain professions considered to be hard work.",
      "A suspension, if it was to be announced, would prompt anger on the other side of the political spectrum, possibly weakening Bayrou\u2019s government even further.",
      "The conservative Senate president, G\u00e9rard Larcher, warned that the pension measures shouldn't be suspended or rescinded.",
      "\u201cIf we were to repeal the pension reform, the cost would be 3.4 billion euros ($3,47 billion) in 2025 and almost 16 billion ($16.3 billion) in 2032,\u201d he said.",
      "Far-right leader Marine Le Pen \u2014 Macron\u2019s fiercest rival \u2014 was instrumental in ousting the previous government.",
      "Bayrou consulted her when forming the new government, and Le Pen remains a powerful force. Her National Rally party has the largest single group in the National Assembly, France's powerful lower house of parliament.",
      "In recent days, Bayrou's government sought to sideline Le Pen by negotiating instead with the Socialists, the Greens and the Communists on budget issues.",
      "The president of the National Rally, Jordan Bardella, criticized those talks and warned Monday that his party would oppose any budget that would raise the cost of medication, provide more health care for migrants staying illegally in the country and impose new taxes on businesses. Such measures would justify a no-confidence vote, he said.",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- On Dutch Openness Day, this year\u2019s release of secret documents from state archives suddenly left Peter Baas with fundamental questions about his father\u2019s stature as a World War II resistance fighter.",
      "While many were cleaning up the mess from New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks on Jan. 1, hundreds of thousands of others in the Netherlands looked for their relatives in a new database containing the names of some 425,000 people investigated for collaboration with the Nazis from 1940-45.",
      "Some looked out of curiosity, others out of concern.",
      "One of those names was Ludolf Baas, a resistance fighter who taped microfilm of Nazi atrocities to his body and smuggled it over enemy lines. \u201cWhen I saw my father\u2019s name, I was shocked,\u201d Peter Baas told The Associated Press. He wondered if his father\u2019s legacy was a lie and needed to find out if one of society's ugliest stigmas would also stick to him.",
      "\u201cThe publication of the list of names has caused great social unrest,\u201d the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies, said in a statement Friday. The research organization, founded days after the Netherlands was liberated, has called for the government to intervene.",
      "Nazi collaboration is a controversial topic in the Netherlands and much of Europe and is often shrouded in family mystery and stifled under a cloak of silence. Initially, the Netherlands was long seen as a welcoming safe haven for persecuted groups. Many Jewish families, like that of famed diarist Anne Frank, fled Germany in the 1930s for the relative safety of their Dutch neighbors.",
      "That changed when the Dutch surrendered to the Germans in 1940. Only 27% of the Dutch Jewish population survived the war, significantly less than the survival rate in France and Belgium and collaboration made persecution easier.",
      "Eight decades after the war ended, many still worry about what that legacy means.",
      "\u201cYou see the bullying even now,\u201d Holocaust historian Aline Pennewaard says. She described social media posts denouncing Dutch politicians as Nazis because they shared a surname with someone on the list.",
      "Plans to fully open the archives would have provided answers but Baas, who lives in France, found out he would not be able to easily obtain detailed information about his father's case.",
      "Originally, the National Archive wanted to make much more than just the names of suspects public. The organization had been working to digitize and publish all 30 million pages of materials, from secret police records to witness statements, on a newly created website.",
      "Just before Christmas though, after a formal warning from the Dutch privacy watchdog that releasing the records would violate EU privacy rules, Dutch education minister Eppo Bruins intervened. Now, only the names and corresponding file numbers are immediately available.",
      "To see his father\u2019s dossier and understand why and how he was investigated, Baas would have to request to make an appointment with the archive and travel to The Hague, a 650-kilometer (404-mile) drive, to read his father's file.",
      "\u201cThis is a very complicated way to get your family history,\u201d Baas said.",
      "Despite such complications, the Dutch are lining up.",
      "\u201cThe interest has been incredible,\u201d Werner Zonderop, who works at the archive, told AP. Slots for the reading room are booked until the end of February. Every day, new appointment times open at midnight and fill up within minutes.",
      "Documentary filmmaker Marieke van der Winden knows what it is like to confront the dark truth about family history. Her 2022 film \u201cThe Great Silence\u201d showcases how taboo the subject of collaboration is for many.",
      "Van der Winden found out at her mother\u2019s funeral that her grandfather had worked with the Germans. After doing her own research, she discovered her grandparents, great-grandparents and several other family members had collaborated. \u201cIt was a family affair,\u201d she told the AP.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. watchdog is suing Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts \u2014 and \u201ccheating\u201d customers out of more than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result",
      "NEW YORK -- A U.S. watchdog is suing Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts \u2014 and \u201ccheating\" customers out of more than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result.",
      "In a complaint filed Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took aim at Capital One's promises and handling of its \u201c360 Savings\u201d accounts. Despite promoting 360 Savings as an account that provides one of nation's highest interest rates, the CFPB alleges that Capital One froze its rate at a low level for at least several years, even as rates rose nationally.",
      "At the same time, the CFPB adds, the bank created \u201c360 Performance Savings,\" which saw a much higher rate grow. But the agency says that Capital One did not notify 360 Savings accountholders about this new offering and \u201cinstead worked to keep them in the dark\" \u2014 alleging that the company marketed the products similarly to obscure their distinction and forbade employees \"from proactively telling\u201d those with 360 Savings accounts about 360 Performance Savings.",
      "These actions mean Capital One \u201cillegally avoided paying billions in interest to millions of consumers,\u201d the CFPB wrote in its Tuesday complaint. The agency says it\u2019s seeking to impose civil penalties and provide financial relief to those impacted.",
      "\u201cBanks should not be baiting people with promises they can\u2019t live up to,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a prepared statement.",
      "In response, Capital One said that it strongly disagreed with the CFPB's allegations and plans to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d itself in court. The banking giant added that it was \u201cdeeply disappointed to see the CFPB continue its recent pattern of filing eleventh-hour lawsuits ahead of a change in administration.\u201d",
      "Capital One also maintained that all of its 360 banking products \u201coffer great rates\u201d \u2014 and have \u201calways been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions.\u201d",
      "According to disclosures on the Capital One's website, 360 Savings accounts currently carry an interest rate of just under 0.50%. 360 Performance Savings accounts have an interest rate of about 3.74%.",
      "That means the rate for 360 Performance Savings is nearly 7.5 times higher than that of 360 Savings today. But the CFPB says they've been farther apart in the past. In July 2024, the agency notes in Tuesday's complaint, the 360 Performance Savings rate was more than 14 times that of 360 Savings.",
      "The CFPB alleges that Capital One kept the rate for its 360 Savings accounts at 0.30% between December 2020 through at least August 2024. The rate for 360 Performance Savings, by contrast, climbed from 0.40% in April 2022 to as high as 4.35% at the start of 2024 \u2014 falling slightly to 4.25% by August, the agency noted Tuesday.",
      "The CFPB's complaint against Capital One comes less than one week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Despite the change in administration, some say this litigation could still survive. Analyst commentary from TD Cowen on Tuesday noted that the CFPB still brought enforcement actions under Trump's first term, for example, although such litigation may also be easier to settle under the incoming administration."

Last May, one inspector documented \u201cgeneral filth\u201d in a room at the Indiana plant.",
      "The U.S. Agriculture Department released the inspection records in response to Freedom of Information Act requests from The Associated Press and other news organizations.",
      "The problems documented at the three factories echo some of the violations found at the Jarratt, Virginia, plant linked to the food poisoning outbreak. The newly released reports describe:",
      "\u2014 Equipment \u201ccovered in meat scraps\u201d in 2019.",
      "\u2014 \u201cDry crusted meat from the previous day's production\u201d and \u201cdark, stinky residue\u201d left behind in 2020.",
      "\u2014 A doorway covered in \u201cdried meat juices and grime\u201d in 2021.",
      "\u2014 Green mold and flaking paint in 2022.",
      "\u2014 \u201cUnidentified slime\u201d and \u201can abundance of insects\u201d in 2023.",
      "\u2014 A puddle of \u201cblood, debris and trash\u201d in 2024.",
      "Boar's Head officials said in an email Monday that the violations documented in the three factories \u201cdo not meet our high standards.\u201d The company's remaining plants continue to operate under normal USDA oversight, they added. The Sarasota, Florida-based company has marketed itself for decades as a premier provider of deli meats and cheeses, advertising \u201cexcellence that stands apart in every bite.\u201d",
      "Records from a fourth Boar\u2019s Head plant in Holland, Michigan, do not show similar problems.",
      "Boar's Head stopped making liverwurst and shuttered its Jarratt, Virginia, plant in September after listeria poisoning tied to the product sickened more than 60 people in 19 states, including 10 who died.",
      "Health officials in Maryland initially discovered listeria contamination in a package of unopened liverwurst. The company recalled more than 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat deli meat and poultry sold nationwide. About 2.6 million pounds was eventually recovered, according to the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.",
      "The conditions revealed at the other Boar's Head plants are \u201creally concerning,\u201d said Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "\u201cIt's reasonable for some people to decide they don't want to eat deli meat,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies like Boar's Head, they should have to earn consumers' trust.\u201d",
      "Boar\u2019s Head faces multiple lawsuits connected to the outbreak.",
      "\u201cThis makes me extremely angry and sad,\u201d said Garett Dorman, whose mother, Linda Dorman, 73, of Oxford, Pennsylvania, died in July after eating Boar\u2019s Head liverwurst. She had cancer, and liverwurst was one of the few foods she would eat, he said. He is suing the company, according to court documents filed by Marler Clark, a Seattle law firm.",
      "\u201cI believe Boar\u2019s Head needs to completely revamp their program at all of their facilities,\" Dorman said in an email. \"Boar's Head needs to put the welfare of people as their highest priority.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers including Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Rosa DeLauro have sharply criticized USDA officials for not taking stronger action against the company, despite documentation of repeated problems. The USDA inspector general is reviewing the agency's handling of the situation. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether criminal charges are warranted.",
      "\u201cThe new records released by FSIS should be considered by the DOJ, especially as they potentially point to a wider, systemic problem,\u201d the lawmakers said in a statement. \u201cThese reports make clear that there is a culture of noncompliance of critical safety and sanitary protocols.\u201d",
      "In a report released Friday, USDA officials said \u201cinadequate sanitation practices\u201d at the Jarratt plant contributed to the outbreak. Product residue, condensation and structural problem in the buildings were key factors, the agency found. State inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.",
      "USDA officials have promised new measures to control listeria in plants that make ready-to-eat foods, including broader testing, updated training and tools, increased inspections, more food safety reviews and stronger oversight of state inspectors who act on behalf of the agency.",
      "Boar's Head is hiring a \u201cfood safety culture manager,\u201d according to Frank Yiannas, a former official at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration who is now advising the company.",

      "Spirits giant Brown-Forman Corp. says it\u2019s reducing its global workforce by about 12% and closing its barrel-making plant in Louisville",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Spirits giant Brown-Forman Corp. said Tuesday it's reducing its global workforce by about 12% and closing its hometown barrel-making plant in Louisville. The cost-cutting moves come as American whiskey producers face stiff challenges from changing consumer trends and renewed tariff threats.",
      "The actions are projected to produce about $70 million to $80 million in annualized cost savings, a portion of which is expected to be reinvested as part of the company's growth strategy, said Louisville-based Brown-Forman, whose flagship brand is Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey.",
      "The company's cooperage, where barrels are made to store and age its spirits, will close by April 25, affecting about 210 hourly and salaried employees, it said. The closure is part of the overall 12% reduction in the company's 5,400-employee global workforce. Brown-Forman said it will source barrels from an external supplier and expects to receive more than $30 million from selling cooperage assets.",
      "Laid-off workers will receive severance, outplacement services and other benefits, the company said.",
      "Brown-Forman also announced changes in its executive team, including the appointment of Jeremy Shepherd as chief marketing officer. Shepherd previously led its USA & Canada commercial division.",
      "The actions reflect the venerable company's \"relentless focus on evolving our strategy, our portfolio and our organization to grow and thrive,\u201d said Brown-Forman President and CEO Lawson Whiting. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement will ensure we have the structure and teams in place to continue on this path, while also making investments that we believe will facilitate growth for generations to come.\u201d",
      "Last month, Brown-Forman reported a 5% decline in net sales for the first six months of its fiscal year compared to the year-ago period. The decline was largely due to its Finlandia and Sonoma\u2011Cutrer divestitures, the company said. Whiting said the results came amid \u201cchallenging economic conditions\u201d but he predicted a stronger performance in the second half of the year. Brown-Forman's many brands also include Woodford Reserve and Old Forester bourbons and Herradura and el Jimador tequilas.",
      "The company's cutbacks come as the overall American whiskey sector faces headwinds that coincide with massive inventories of aging whiskeys that will someday reach the market. In Kentucky, a record 14.3 million barrels of bourbon are aging, the Kentucky Distillers\u2019 Association said last month.",
      "Industrywide challenges include indications that younger adults are drinking less alcohol and the threat of American whiskey getting entangled in another trade war. Meanwhile, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said recently that Americans should be better informed about the link between alcohol and cancer. The risk should be clearly labeled on drinks Americans consume, Murthy proposed.",
      "Republican President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose new tariffs with his return to the White House. During Trump's first term, American whiskey distillers got caught up in a trans-Atlantic trade fight, causing deep drops in exports to the European Union \u2014 the industry\u2019s biggest overseas market. The EU imposed a retaliatory tariff on those spirits in 2018 in response to Trump\u2019s decision to slap tariffs on European steel and aluminum. A 2021 deal suspended those tariffs on American spirits, and U.S. distillers began clawing back lost market share in the EU.",
      "However, the EU is set to reinstate tariffs on American spirits at a 50% rate in March if nothing is done to head it off, the Kentucky Distillers' Association said. Retaliatory tariffs from the EU and other countries have cost Kentucky's bourbon industry a half-billion dollars in exports since 2018, it said. Kentucky and Tennessee, where Jack Daniel's is crafted, overwhelmingly backed Trump in last year's election.",
      "\u201cWe are up against a triple threat of back-breaking tariffs, snowballing taxes and shifts in consumer trends that have slowed sales,\u201d Eric Gregory, president of the distillers\u2019 association, said recently."

      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced the plan this week to tackle housing affordability and high rents in the Southern European nation. He said that the overall goal was to provide \u201cmore housing, better regulation and greater aid.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe West faces a decisive challenge: To not become a society divided into two classes, the rich landlords and the poor tenants,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said as he announced the plan.",
      "However, it remains unclear if the plan put forth by S\u00e1nchez\u2019s minority coalition will pass in parliament. Here's a look at what's happening:",
      "Like most rich countries, Spain is in the throes of a growing housing affordability problem. Skyrocketing rents are particularly acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for young people. Housing prices are also steadily rising, especially in cities and coastal areas.",
      "Rental prices have also been driven up by short-term contracts mainly offered for tourists. Spain sees more tourists than almost any country in the world, having received more than 88.5 million visitors in 2024. Tourism is one of the country's key economic drivers.",
      "The negative aspects of mass tourism have caused tension at times between visitors and residents concerned about rising costs, the proliferation of short-term rentals on platforms like Airbnb, and water supplies that can be stretched in some parts of the country, including the Canary and Balearic Islands.",
      "Last year, protesters took to the streets on various occasions across the country to express their frustrations about the growth of tourism and high rents. Barcelona\u2019s town hall has pledged to completely eliminate all short-term rentals to tourists in the coming years.",
      "\u201cWhat citizens expect from us here is action,\u201d Spanish housing minister Isabel Rodr\u00edguez told reporters on Tuesday about the plan.",

      "Non-EU residents bought 27,000 properties in Spain in 2023, \u201cnot to live in\u201d but \u201cto make money from,\" S\u00e1nchez said. He didn\u2019t provide a timeline or details on how he plans to implement the tax.",
      "\u201cThis would be massive,\u201d said Sarah Conroy, an English real estate agent who has been working in realty in the upscale Marbella market in southern Spain for over three decades. She didn't give figures on how many non-EU clients she had, but said they included post-Brexit British buyers as well as clients from Saudi Arabia ad Dubai.",
      "\u201cThey need to do something because the people living here can't really rent anything because it is so expensive,\" Conroy said. \"Personally speaking, around 80% of the people I sell to are buying second homes.\u201d",
      "Spain plans to build more public housing and allocate around 2 million square meters (21.5 million square feet) of residential land to a newly created public housing agency.",
      "Other proposed measures include higher taxes on holiday rentals, tax breaks and protections for landlords who provide affordable housing, and amending laws to speed up construction processes and expand the availability of land for private construction.",
      "The rising cost of living has driven voter discontent across many wealthy countries in recent years, including the United States.",

      "Also, according to the Spanish Constitution, all Spaniards have the right to enjoy a \"decent and adequate\u201d home. In theory, at least, the government has a duty to allow citizens to exercise that right.",

      "Canada\u2019s ambassador to Washington says Canada is prepared to buy more from the United States including its next fleet of submarines to appease President-elect Donald Trump's concerns about the U.S.-Canada trade deficit",
      "PALM DESERT, Calif. -- Canada's ambassador to Washington said Monday that Canada is prepared to buy more from the United States, including its next fleet of submarines, to appease President-elect Donald Trump's concerns about the U.S.-Canada trade deficit.",
      "Ambassador Kirsten Hillman also warned Americans in an interview with The Associated Press that prices will go up for Americans almost immediately if Trump follows through with his plan to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products.",
      "The ambassador also dismissed Trump\u2019s talk of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state, saying that\u2019s how Trump negotiates.",
      "\u201cHe has a negotiating style which involves positioning himself in the best way he can for discussions. I think that is what this is,\u201d Hillman told the AP.",
      "Trump continues to erroneously cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada \u2014 a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like oil \u2014 as a subsidy.",
      "Hillman noted Canada buys more from the United States than any other country but is prepared to buy more.",
      "\u201cWe are happy to source what we can from the United States. And we have some big military procurements coming up for example, replacing our entire submarine fleet,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe those are some purchases that can happen from the U.S.\u201d",
      "Hillman said 70% of Canada's military procurement is American sourced. That includes a plan to purchase 88 F-35 fighter jets.",
      "Alberta's Premier Danielle Smith said earlier Monday she favors appeasing Trump by trying to narrow the trade gap, saying the solution is that Canada finds ways to buy more American goods. Smith visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump's home in Florida, over the weekend and spoke to Trump.",
      "Hillman has said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. is energy exports.",
      "Hillman said trade with Canada supports over 8 million jobs in the United States and Canada is the number one customer to 36 U.S. states. She said Canada provides a lot of primary materials that go into U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"Adding 25% tariffs to those products will raise the price for Americans almost immediately,\u201d Hillman said. \u201cAnd at a time when the cost of living is challenging, when food prices are high, it seems like the wrong direction to go in.\"",
      "Hillman also reiterated that Canada will retaliate if tariffs are placed on Canadian goods and that will mean a cost for Americans.",
      "\u201cCanada will respond,\" she said. \u201cTherefore your number one customer will make American products more expensive and Canadians will probably look for alternatives to those products.\u201d",
      "Hillman said Canada is not interested in a trade war but said it will be hard for the Canadian government to not respond if the U.S. government makes choices that hurt Canadians.",
      "She said it doesn't make sense for Trump to reverse what he accomplished in his first term when he renegotiated the free trade deal with Canada and Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe are 99% tariff free with the United States, 99% tariff free. And that tariff level is as a result of the USMCA,\u201d Hillman said, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. \u201cThat was negotiated by President Trump. He achieved that success so why would we backtrack from this success that he achieved in his last administration. It just doesn\u2019t make a lot sense.\"",
      "Hillman gave Trump credit for accelerating Canada's plans to increase security at the border. Trump initially threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if the government does not stem what Trump calls a flow of migrants and drugs in the U.S. \u2014 even though far fewer of each crosses into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened.",
      "Canada now has a billion plus border security plan.",
      "\u201cWe have moved really quickly, I\u2019ll be honest, because President Trump focused the mind to put together a full package of improvements,\" Hillman said.",
      "Hillman said also said the U.S. and Canada are in a \u201cgenerational struggle\" with China, a powerful adversary. Trump has been clear about the economic and security threat that Beijing poses, she said. The ambassador said Canada has the energy America needs to drive the artificial intelligence revolution.",
      "\"That is really not possible, based on our experts and American experts, without greater cooperation with Canada through oil and gas, through nuclear, through hydro electricity,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "\u201cIf we are working at odds then frankly China wins. China is trying to drive us apart. That is clear. They look for every opportunity to do so. That\u2019s not good for us, our citizens and Americans.\u201d"

      "Automakers are joining forces to boost their scale and competitiveness to contend with industry newcomers like iPhone maker Foxconn",
      "BANGKOK -- Auto industry newcomers like Taiwan-based iPhone maker Foxconn and China's Huawei Technologies are maneuvering to gain an edge in the electric vehicle sector, prompting automakers like Japan's Nissan and Honda to announce plans to join forces against a flood of ambitious competitors.",
      "Also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, Foxconn has been snapping up links in the automotive supply chain, one of a growing number of technology companies that are leveraging their knowhow in electronics and communications.",
      "Foxconn's auto venture with Taiwan automaker and importer Yulon Motor Co., Foxtron, showcased its Model B, a sleek EV hatchback, as well as its automotive electronics, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week.",
      "Honda and Nissan announced in December that they plan to seek a merger, a move that reports said may have partly been driven by Foxconn's interest in Nissan.",
      "Here's an update on Foxconn's auto ambitions.",
      "Whether or not Foxconn wanted to make a bid for Nissan, it has big ambitions, saying it eventually intends to make four of every 10 EVs sold in the world. The contract manufacturer has invested nearly $1.3 billion in auto-related acquisitions in the past decade, according to Mergermarket, a merger and acquisitions research firm.",
      "In addition to Foxtron, its automaking joint venture with Taiwan's Yulon Motor, it has a 50% joint venture with Stellantis NV to design and sell automotive semiconductors and a 50% joint venture with Germany\u2019s ZF Friedrichshafen AG, a major auto supplier, to make passenger car chassis. It has invested in Indigo Technologies, which is commercializing a road sensing system developed at MIT. It also has a collaboration agreement with Blue Solutions to develop solid state batteries and has a collaboration with Italian auto designer Pininfarina.",
      "Foxconn holds a 34% stake in Japanese electronics company Sharp, which has been inching toward the automotive sector. This year, Foxconn and Sharp introduced an LDK+ (living, dining, kitchen) concept vehicle, a boxy minivan that converts to a living space with solar and storage battery and a big LCD screen.",
      "\u201cLeveraging a plug-and-play strategy similar to its electronics operations, Foxconn\u2019s foray into electric vehicles is a pre-emptive move in anticipation of the increasing convergence of electronics and automotive technologies,\u201d Vivian Wong, head of Mergermarkets\u2019 M&A Analytics for the Asia Pacific, said in an emailed comment.",
      "China\u2019s Huawei Technologies, smartphone and appliance maker Xiaomi and e-commerce giant Alibaba and Baidu also are scaling up their EV operations, relying on their scale and strength in advanced technologies as vehicles become ever more computerized.",
      "Huawei has several EV joint ventures in what it has dubbed its Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance, including Luxeed brand EVs with Chery Automobile and Aito brand EVs with Seres Group. Its joint venture with JAC Motor, an automaker based in eastern China's Anhui province, has announced plans to compete with luxury brands such as Rolls-Royce and Mercedes Benz AG.",
      "Some Japanese electronics companies also are jumping on the bandwagon. Apart from Sharp's partnership with Foxconn, entertainment and technology giant Sony Corp. has an EV joint venture with Honda that plans to introduce the EV Afeela sedan for pre-sale this year.",
      "The increasing reliance on connectivity between cars, phones, laptops and televisions has lured such companies into a market that is quickly being transformed by electrification, even if inroads into some markets have stalled due to tariffs and other factors.",
      "Nissan introduced the Leaf, the first mass-market EV, in 2010 and has strong EV technology, vehicle platforms and sales capacity that would appeal to a newcomer like Foxconn.",
      "Reports by Japanese media and by Taiwan\u2019s Central News Agency said Hon Hai\u2019s chief strategy officer, Nissan veteran executive Jun Seki, visited France for talks with France\u2019s Renault SA, which holds a 15% stake in Nissan and more shares held in a French trust. Seki is a former chief operating officer of Nissan and former president of Dongfeng Nissan, a joint venture in China.",
      "In formally announcing plans to attempt a merger with Honda, Nissan Motor Corp. CEO Makoto Uchida said Foxconn had not directly approached his company about a possible merger. Foxconn did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Nissan\u2019s internal woes are a small part of the bigger challenge posed to all major automakers by the ascent of Tesla, which makes more than half of its EVs in China, and Chinese automakers like BYD in an industry so competitive that more than a dozen Chinese EV makers have already folded, bested by bigger and stronger companies that got into the game before them.",
      "As the pace of sales growth slows, with car buyers questioning the affordability and convenience of switching to electrics, the going has been rough, and Foxconn has a long way to go before it can compete with industry leaders like BYD and Tesla.",
      "It was set to manufacture the Endurance battery EV truck at a former General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which it acquired in 2023. Lordstown Motors Corp. then filed for bankruptcy. Foxconn also set up a partnership in 2021 with Fisker Inc., maker of the Ocean EV truck, that called for making up to 250,000 vehicles. Fisker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June.",
      "But the company appears undaunted.",
      "Foxconn lists six models of EVs on its website, including its Model T bus, Model V pickup truck, Moden N van, its Model B, and its \u201cluxury flagship\u201d Model E sedan."

      "Trudeau told MSNBC: \"No American wants to pay 25% more for electricity or oil and gas coming in from Canada. That\u2019s something I think people need to pay a little more attention to.\u201d",
      "Trump has also said that if Canada merged with the U.S., taxes would decrease and there would be no tariffs.",
      "\u201cI know that as a successful negotiator he likes to keep people off balance,\" Trudeau said of Trump's threats to use economic force to turn Canada into the 51st state. Trump has also erroneously cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada \u2014 a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like oil \u2014 as a subsidy.",
      "Canadian officials say that if Trump follows through with his threat of punishing tariffs, Canada would consider slapping retaliatory tariffs on American orange juice, toilets and some steel products. Already during Trump's first term in the White House, Canada responded to Trump's tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum with its own on American products like bourbon, Harley Davidson motorcycles and playing cards.",
      "\u201cHe got elected to try and make life easier for all Americans, to support American workers,\u201d Trudeau said of Trump. \u201cThese (tariffs) are things that are going to hurt them.\u201d",
      "Trump said last week that the U.S doesn\u2019t need oil, or anything else, from Canada. But almost a quarter of the oil that the U.S. consumes each day comes from Canada. The energy-rich western province of Alberta exports 4.3 million barrels of oil a day to the U.S.",
      "Data from the United States Energy Information Administration shows that the U.S. consumes 20 million barrels a day, and produces about 13.2 million barrels a day.",
      "Canada, a founding partner of NATO and home to more than 40 million people, is also the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $2.7 billion worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "Trump has said that he would reconsider his tariff threat if Canada made improvements in managing security at the Canada-U.S. border, which he and his advisers see as a potential entry point for undocumented migrants.",
      "Trudeau has said that less than 1% of illegal immigrants and fentanyl cross into the U.S. from Canada.",
      "But after a meeting last November with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect\u2019s private club and residence in Florida, Trudeau announced an increase in spending on border security, expressing willingness to address Trump's concerns in hopes that he would reconsider his tariff threat.",
      "With the challenge of Trump\u2019s second administration looming and Trudeau's party trailing badly in the polls, the beleaguered Canadian prime minister announced his resignation last Monday. He will be replaced on March 9, when his Liberal party is set to pick a new leader."

      "The Philadelphia 76ers have decided not to build a $1.3 billion downtown arena",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia 76ers have decided not to build a $1.3 billion downtown arena, a surprising move that comes just weeks after the team received approval for the controversial project from the city council.",
      "The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday that multiple council members had confirmed the change in plans. The team has struck a deal with Comcast Spectacor to remain in the city's sports stadium district, the newspaper said, but further details about the new proposal have not been released.",
      "The 76ers, the mayor's office and Comcast Spectator \u2014 which owns the Wells Fargo Center, where the team currently plays \u2014 did not respond Sunday to requests for comment. The team rents the arena from Comcast Spectacor, which also owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL, who also play there.",
      "The council had voted on Dec. 19 to approve the downtown arena after more than two years of heated debate over the proposal, and the owners of the NBA team had hoped to move in to what would be called 76 Place by 2031. The council vote came despite vocal opposition from nearby Chinatown residents and other activists.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so livid right now I don\u2019t even know what to do,\u201d Jimmy Harrity, an at-large member of the council, told the newspaper. Harrity, who supported the team\u2019s move, said, \u201cI feel as though I was used as a pawn.\u201d",
      "Mayor Cherelle Parker, a Democrat who had championed the plan, has said the entire city will benefit from what she called a \u201chistoric game-changing economic development project.\u201d Supporters had hoped the 18,500-seat arena would help revive a distressed retail corridor called Market East, which runs from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The area has struggled for years despite several redevelopment efforts.",
      "The team owners, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, had pushed for city approval by year\u2019s end so they could meet their target opening date. They had vowed not to ask the city for any construction funding, although they were free to seek state and federal funds. Instead of property taxes, they would have paid about $6 million in annual payments in lieu of taxes.",
      "Opponents feared the arena would bring gridlock on game days as well as gentrification and rising rents to the area.",
      "The Chinatown community has fought a series of proposed developments since the 1960s, including casinos, a prison, a baseball stadium and a highway, the last of which dissected the neighborhood when it opened in 1991."

      "But a drive through the charred neighborhoods around Altadena shows that the fires also burned through a remarkable haven for generations of Black families avoiding discriminatory housing practices elsewhere. They have been communities of racial and economic diversity, where many people own their own homes.",
      "Some now fear the most destructive fires in California\u2019s history have altered that for good. Recovery and rebuilding may be out of reach for many, and pressures of gentrification could be renewed.",
      "Samantha Santoro, 22, a first-generation college student at Cal Poly Pomona, remembered being annoyed when the initial news coverage of the wildfires focused more on celebrities. She and her sister, who attends UC Berkeley, worry how their Mexican immigrant parents and working-class neighbors who lost their homes in Altadena will move forward.",

      "The landlord of their family's two-bedroom house with a pool had never increased the $1,650 rent, making it possible for the Santoros to affordably raise their daughters. Now, they're temporarily staying with a relative in Pasadena. The family has renters insurance but not much else.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s hard to believe that you have nothing,\u201d Santoro said, through tears, thinking of her parents. \"Everything that they ever worked for was in that house.\u201d",
      "Altadena had been a mix of tiny bungalows and magnificent mansions. The community of 42,000 includes blue-collar families, artists, entertainment industry workers and white-collar ones. About 58% of residents are non-white, with one-fourth of them Hispanic and nearly a fifth Black, according to Census data.",
      "During the Civil Rights era, Altadena became a rare land of opportunity for Black Americans to reach middle class without the discriminatory practices of denying them access to credit. They kept homes within the family and helped others to flourish. Today, the Black home ownership rate there is at 81.5%, almost double the national rate.",
      "That's impressive considering 92% of the 15,000 residences in Altadena are single-family homes, according to the 2023 Census American Community Survey. The median income is over $129,000. Just over 7% of residents live in poverty.",
      "Victoria Knapp, chair of the Altadena Town Council, worries that the fires have irreparably changed the landscape for these families.",

      "He is challenging state and federal officials to help all fire-affected communities fairly because \u201cyour $40 million home is no different than my $2 million home.\u201d",

      "Shawn Brown lost not only her home but also the public charter school she founded in Altadena.

      "The Rev. George Van Alstine and others are trying to help more than 10 church members who lost homes with needs like navigating insurance and federal aid. The pastor is worried the fires will lead to gentrification, with Black parishioners, who make up half the congregation, paying the price.",

      "The wildfires that erupted this week across Los Angeles County are far from contained, but they're already expected to be the costliest in U.S. history and among the worst natural disasters",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The wildfires that erupted this week across Los Angeles County are still raging, but already are projected to be among the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.",
      "The devastating blazes have killed at least 11 people and incinerated more than 12,000 structures since Tuesday, laying waste to entire neighborhoods once home to multimillion-dollar properties.",
      "While it's still too early for an accurate tally of the financial toll, the losses so far likely make the wildfires the costliest ever in the U.S., according to various estimates.",
      "A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. By comparison, AccuWeather estimated the damage and economic losses caused by Hurricane Helene, which tore across six southeastern states last fall, at $225 billion to $250 billion.",
      "\u201cThis will be the costliest wildfire in California modern history and also very likely the costliest wildfire in U.S. modern history, because of the fires occurring in the densely populated areas around Los Angeles with some of the highest-valued real estate in the country,\u201d said Jonathan Porter, the private firm\u2019s chief meteorologist.",
      "AccuWeather factors in a multitude of variables in its estimates, including damage to homes, businesses, infrastructure and vehicles, as well as immediate and long-term health care costs, lost wages and supply chain interruptions.",
      "The insurance broker Aon PLC also said Friday that the L.A. County wildfires will likely end up being the costliest in U.S. history, although it did not issue an estimate. Aon ranks a wildfire known as the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, in 2018 as the costliest in U.S. history up to now at $12.5 billion, adjusted for inflation. The Camp Fire killed 85 people and destroyed about 11,000 homes.",
      "The L.A. County wildfires, which were fueled by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds and an extreme drought, remained largely uncontained Saturday. That means the final tally of losses from the blazes is likely to increase, perhaps substantially.",
      "\u201cTo put this into perspective, the total damage and economic loss from this wildfire disaster could reach nearly 4% of the annual GDP of the state of California,\u201d AccuWeather's Porter said.",
      "In a report Friday, Moody's also concluded that the wildfires would prove to be the costliest in U.S. history, specifically because they have ripped through densely populated areas with higher-end properties.",
      "While the state is no stranger to major wildfires, they have generally been concentrated in inland areas that are not densely populated. That's led to less destruction per acre, and in damage to less expensive homes, Moody's noted.",
      "That's far from the case this time, with one of the largest conflagrations destroying thousands of properties across the Pacific Palisades and Malibu, home to many Hollywood stars and executives with multimillion-dollar properties. Already, numerous celebrities have lost homes to the fires.",
      "\u201cThe scale and intensity of the blazes, combined with their geographic footprint, suggest a staggering price tag, both in terms of the human cost and the economic toll,\u201d Moody's analysts wrote. The report did not include a preliminary cost estimate of the wildfire damage.",
      "It could be several months before a concrete tally of the financial losses from the wildfires will be possible.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the very early stages of this disaster,\u201d Porter said."

      "NEW ORLEANS -- The second-guessing began before the bodies had been cleared from the debris of the deadly Bourbon Street truck attack.",
      "A law firm signed up survivors of what it called a \u201cpredictable and preventable\u201d tragedy. Politicians parried blame for the latest mass-casualty event in New Orleans\u2019 infamous adult playground. And investigations targeted the ill-fated removal of the street's bollards, steel columns designed to restrict vehicle access.",
      "But as the city seeks to recover and beefs up security ahead of next month's Super Bowl and Carnival season, law enforcement and community leaders are confronting an existential question as old as the entertainment district: Can Bourbon Street be protected in a way that preserves its unique, round-the-clock revelry?",
      "\u201cOnce we start to hear what it\u2019s actually going to take to secure the French Quarter and the Mardi Gras parade routes, I don\u2019t know if this city is going to have an appetite for all that,\u201d said Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor who is president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission watchdog group.",
      "\u201cIf we try to make New Orleans as secure as an airport, people aren't going to like it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Disney World.\u201d",
      "Shock and grief have given way to finger-pointing over whether additional security could have stopped \u2014 or mitigated \u2014 the Islamic State group-inspired attack, which killed 14 people when Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove a pickup through a New Year's crowd.",
      "In the difficult days since, proposals for new safety measures have ranged from banning vehicular traffic in the French Quarter to turning the historic neighborhood into a state park.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s just too wide open. It\u2019s too trustworthy down here,\u201d said Bryan Casey, 53, a native New Orleanian who has worked on Bourbon Street since the late 1990s and waits tables at Galatoire\u2019s, an upscale restaurant that opened in 1905. Casey and his colleagues wiped blood off the wall after the attack as bodies lay mangled in front of the establishment.",
      "Bourbon Street should have been made into a pedestrian mall long ago, Casey said: \u201cThere\u2019s people watching and they\u2019re going to get you, so you got to be careful.\u201d",
      "Much of the immediate focus has centered on the absence of the bollards, which had stopped working reliably and were being replaced ahead of the Super Bowl.",
      "City leaders have been criticized for the timing of that project and failing to implement a suitable replacement during their repair. A lawsuit filed Thursday on behalf of victims alleged the city \u201chad years of opportunities\u201d to patch up vulnerabilities.",
      "But a half dozen current and former law enforcement officials in Louisiana described the bollard issue as a red herring, saying that even if they had been functioning they may not have prevented the attack given how hell-bent Jabbar appeared on creating carnage.",
      "The broader safety conundrum is more complex, they said, given the quarter's dense, alcohol-fueled crowds and structural challenges inherent to an early 18th-century neighborhood built for horse-drawn buggies. Policing here is even more complicated in a city with notoriously high crime, a chronic shortage of officers and a new state law allowing permit-less concealed carry of firearms.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know of another place that has the same challenges for protecting people,\u201d said Ronnie Jones, a public safety consultant who served in the Louisiana State Police for 32 years, including as deputy superintendent.",
      "\u201cA lot of people in public safety don\u2019t want to talk about it, but we just can\u2019t guarantee that everybody going to the French Quarter is going to be safe,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere\u2019s a tradeoff here, and we\u2019ve never, ever, found that balance.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s newly hired security consultant, William J. Bratton, a former New York City police commissioner, said he recognizes the importance of maintaining a festive atmosphere during carnival even as he works with city police to bolster security over the next few months.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I talked about is developing security provisions that don\u2019t change Mardi Gras, don\u2019t change the flavor of it, the excitement of it and the nature of it,\u201d Bratton said at a news conference this week. \u201cTo develop security protocols that don\u2019t become so intrusive, so disruptive.\u201d",
      "The New Year's attack was far from the first deadly vehicle incident on Bourbon Street.",
      "In 1972, one person died and 18 were injured when a teenager fleeing police in a stolen car crashed through metal barricades and sped down the thoroughfare at 70 mph (about 113 kph). Ten years later a man smashed through steel barricades and careened down nearly seven blocks, injuring at least 11. And in 1995, an intoxicated 63-year-old man drove a beer van through a crowd attending a St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade, killing one and injuring 38.",
      "More recent Bourbon Street tragedies have involved gun violence, including multiple fatal shootings last year. In 2014, a mass shooting killed a 21-year-old woman and wounded nine others, including a bystander shot through her cheek. Two years later a person was killed and nine others were wounded in a shooting.",
      "Many of those incidents prompted similar calls for change and accountability, raising questions about civil liberties and what, if anything, the city is willing to sacrifice in the name of public safety. City, state and federal law enforcement officials have offered varying solutions that critics have said were mere stopgaps, likening them to putting Band-Aids on a wound that has never quite healed.",
      "\u201cI was part of those conversations when we were looking to create a very robust security package, including metal detectors and infrared technology that could alert if something metal was in someone's clothing \u2014 none of that ever materialized,\u201d said Michael Harrison, a former head of New Orleans police who later became commissioner in Baltimore. \u201cThere are ways to prevent ramming attacks. There\u2019s not yet a way to prevent people from walking on Bourbon Street and doing bad things.\u201d",
      "Pedicab driver Jody \u201cCajun Queen\u201d Boudreaux, 65, said Bourbon Street has always embodied New Orleans' laissez-faire charm and she is not sure whether the city has the will to shore up its lax security.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a target, clearly. They know we have holes, they know we are all scrambling and they also know that our vibe is \u2018Laissez les bons temps rouler\u2019\u201d she said, invoking the famous Cajun French saying that means, \u201cLet the good times roll.\u201d \u201cI think it can be balanced, I truly do.\u201d",
      "Andrew Monteverde, co-vice president of the New Orleans Firefighters Association, said first responders and law enforcement deal with a raft of emergencies, from extinguishing fires to saving people in cardiac arrest. The more that limited resources are dedicated to one part of the city, he added, the less is available to deal for elsewhere.",
      "\u201cCould you possibly make the French Quarter so secure that you couldn\u2019t even spit on the sidewalk?\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, but then what would you trade off?\u201d",
      "At The Beach on Bourbon Street, where workers screen clubgoers at every entrance with handheld metal detectors, general manager Woody Ryder has become inured to the frequent shootings after working there for seven years. \u201cThere's crazy people out there,\u201d he said.",
      "But the recent attack has made him uneasy. Ryder and his staff are still recovering from witnessing what he and others likened to a \u201cwar zone.\u201d",

      "Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes spent Sunday watching some wild-card playoff games while waiting for his wife, Brittany, to give birth to their third child",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Patrick Mahomes had his mind on the playoffs even as he was awaiting the arrival of his third child.",
      "The Chiefs quarterback said Tuesday that his wife, Brittany, let him watch some of the wild-card games Sunday while they were waiting for her to give birth. She wound up delivering their second daughter, which they named Golden Raye, to go along with 3-year-old daughter Sterling and a 2-year-old son that they nicknamed Bronze.",
      "\u201cBrittany crushed it,\u201d Mahomes said before heading out to practice for Saturday's divisional-round matchup against Houston, which blew out the Chargers in the wild-card round. \"It's been cool to welcome another baby girl to the family and see how my other kids reacted to her, and have a baby sister and stuff like that. So it's been a lot of fun.",
      "\u201cAnd,\u201d Mahomes added, \u201cit was cool that football was on TV while I was in the hospital, so I was able to watch a little bit.\u201d",
      "Mahomes, a self-described football junkie, was happy the schedule worked out for him. The Chiefs clinched the No. 1 seed and a first-round bye before their Week 18 game in Denver, which Mahomes sat out with many of their best players. And that meant he was able to focus on the arrival of his child rather than worrying about a first-round playoff opponent.",
      "Asked whether baby No. 3 was easier than the first two, Mahomes offered a wise husband-turned-father reply: \u201cI don't even want to say that because, like, Brittany's doing everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was cool that we got the bye, just because you can kind of really focus in on just being at the hospital, being in the moment,\u201d he added. \u201cIt's a special moment that a lot of dads and moms experience. And you don't forget that stuff.\u201d",
      "Now, the two-time NFL MVP can focus on making some more memories. The Chiefs are trying to become the first team to win three consecutive Lombardi Trophies. They were early 8 1/2-point favorites to beat the Texans, according to the BetMGM Sportsbook, and have the second-best odds to win the Super Bowl behind Detroit, the top seed in the NFC.",
      "\u201cI think every year is special,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cObviously you want to win three in a row and build those memories with the guys and the community. But every single year is special. And when I look back at all the different Super Bowls that we've won, I look back at special moments that we've had and special games that we've had. And so, we'll try to do the same this year.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs beat the Texans the weekend before Christmas, part of a grueling stretch in which both played three times over 11 days. And they've won four in a row over Houston dating to the 2020 playoffs, when they fell behind 24-0 in a divisional-round game at Arrowhead Stadium but rallied for a 51-31 victory \u2014 and went on to win Mahomes' first Super Bowl.",
      "Chiefs coach Andy Reid said the bye week \u2014 and really, more than three weeks off for the most consequential players who sat out the game in Denver \u2014 has left his team as healthy as it's been all season heading into their playoff opener.",
      "\u201cThey've got good attitudes,\" Reid said. \u201dThey were in last week and did a nice job with that. Even on the days off, a lot of them came in. But they're excited. They know they're playing a good football team.\"",
      "NOTES: CB Jaylen Watson (broken ankle) could play Saturday for the first time since getting hurt Oct. 20 against San Francisco. \u201cNot telling you he could play a whole game,\u201d Reid cautioned, \u201cbut I think he has a chance to play for sure.\u201d ... The Chiefs plan to rotate Joe Thuney and D.J. Humphries in practice before deciding on a starter at left tackle. Thuney slid out from guard late in the season with Mike Caliendo replacing him as the Chiefs tried to better protect Mahomes' blind side. But that was while Humphries was dealing with a hamstring injury, and he will be healthy for Saturday. \u201cI'm going to see how it goes this week,\u201d Reid said.",

      "HONOLULU -- Gary Woodland had a brief vacation with wife Gabby on the Big Island before coming over to Oahu for the Sony Open. Never was a 45-minute flight more memorable.",
      "They were in the second row on the Hawaiian Airlines flight. The final passengers to board were in the first row \u2014 former President Barrack Obama, his wife and two daughters.",
      "\u201cThat one surprised me,\" Woodland said. \u201cI was surprised he was on a commercial flight.\u201d",
      "Woodland thought it was strange when they boarded the flight and were told their overhead luggage needed to be stored toward the back of the plane, not in first class. Before long, he said five or six federal agents boarded the plane.",
      "\u201cI knew President Obama was playing golf at the same place I was, so I knew he was in town,\u201d Woodland said. \u201cThen I saw the Secret Service and I had an inkling. When they told us to put our luggage in the back, I had never seen that before in first class.\u201d",
      "Woodland said the flight was full, but the Obama family was the last to board and \u201cI don't even think people knew he was on the plane.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a cool experience,\u201d Woodland said. \u201cThere was no talking. I would have loved to have talked to him, but I didn't want to bother him, either. Just to see the whole operation \u2014 how they did it, when we landed, five or six more Secret Service \u2014 it was cool.\u201d",
      "Obama loves golf and sports. Unclear is whether the former president recognized the 2019 U.S. Open champion at Pebble Beach. Woodland said he and his wife were asked to deplane first.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Thank you for your service\u2019 when I got off the plane,\u201d Woodland said. \u201cI don't know if he recognized me or not. I know people who know him and they say he's a massive sports nut and a golf fan. He gave me a thumbs-up when I got off the plane.\u201d",
      "One match into the inaugural TMRW Golf League season, the hi-tech indoor circuit already has prompted suggestions for the PGA Tour. Matt Fitzpatrick and Rickie Fowler said as much when they answered simultaneously after their New York club won the opener.",
      "\u201cShot clock.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was my favorite part of TGL,\u201d Webb Simpson said.",
      "Is it possible? Enough that it will probably get some consideration when the PGA Tour puts together a working group of players for yet another look at pace of play under Commissioner Jay Monahan's \u201cEverything is on the table\u201d message at the end of last year.",
      "It has been done in professional golf. The Shot Clock Masters debuted on the European tour in 2018 at what previously was the Austrian Open. The tournament had a lapse in sponsorship, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived and it became one-and-done. Four penalties were handed out, mainly because players said they forgot about the clock.",
      "Is it practical? There would be significant expense involved in adding more rules officials, or spending a lot of time training volunteers operating what could be as many as 54 clocks on 18 holes (tee, fairway, green).",
      "\u201cI think people would be in favor of it, but it would be an adjustment,\u201d Sony Open winner Nick Taylor said. \u201cCertain shots are not equal, like in a playoff or a putt to make the cut \u2014 now that would be interesting. But it would speed things up, no doubt.\u201d",
      "TGL is helped by already having an indoor arena with a lot of lights, including the shot clock. One idea is to have a green, yellow and red light on tour to keep spectators from counting down to zero, while still letting players know time is running out.",
      "Simpson mentioned two allowable bad times per round. He also said while fines don't work, perhaps cumulative fines for taking too long will get players' attention.",
      "\u201cI would be so for it,\" he said. \"Me and some players talked about it a few days ago. It would be an investment on the PGA Tour. You have to get trained people. We'd have to iron out the kinks, like rulings. But I think you could do it.\u201d",
      "Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley was two shots out of the lead going into the final round of the Sony Open, got off to a slower start than he wanted and tied for sixth, three shots out of a playoff. It was his third top 10 in his last five starts dating to his BMW Championship victory.",
      "Bradley now is No. 11 in the world, making him the sixth-ranked American.",
      "So much of the attention is on whether he will play his way on his Ryder Cup team. That\u2019s a bridge to cross this summer. Bradley is trying to play good golf for other reasons.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m on a mission to be the best player that I can be, one of the best players in the world,\u201d he said.",
      "He hasn\u2019t won a major since his rookie year in 2011, and he hasn\u2019t challenged in a major since the U.S. Open at Brookline in 2022. That tops his list of priorities. Right behind is winning on the PGA Tour, which he has done each of the last three years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to make that four years in a row,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I really want to be looked at as one of the best players in the world. Me being the Ryder Cup captain doesn\u2019t have anything to do with that. I still feel like I\u2019m in the prime of my career, playing the best golf I\u2019ve ever played, and I want to keep building on that.\u201d",
      "Jesper Svensson of Sweden made the best first impression among the 10 European tour players who earned PGA Tour cards this year. He played the back nine in 30 at the Sony Open and tied for 10th.",
      "How he made it to Hawaii is still hard for him to believe.",
      "\u201cTwo years ago, I didn\u2019t even have a category on the Challenge Tour,\u201d Svensson said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy journey.\u201d",
      "Svensson, who won the Big South Conference title twice at Campbell University in North Carolina, lost his card in 2022 and was playing in the Nordic Golf League when he received an exemption to the B-NL Challenge Trophy in the Netherlands and shot 66 the last day to win.",
      "That led to a European tour card, and he won the Singapore Classic. He effectively clinched a PGA Tour card with his tie for seventh in the DP World Tour Championship.",
      "The only other player from the 10 European tour members to play the Sony Open was Rikuya Hoshino, who missed the cut. Matteo Manassero and Antoine Rozner will join them in The American Express.",
      "Golf Digest Middle East reported that Tom McKibbin of Northern Ireland, who got the last card, is on the verge of joining LIV. Because the PGA Tour season has started, if he goes to LIV then a card would not go to Jordan Smith, who finished 11th in the European tour category.",
      "Lucas Glover hit a bunker shot in the third round of the Sony Open that brought a strange experience. There was a dead baby sea turtle, about the size of a casino chip, next to his ball. He played the shot without touching it. \u201cI thought I was going to make it,\u201d Glover said. \u201cAre they good luck?\u201d He did manage to get up and down. ... Florida State junior Luke Clanton now has as many runner-up finishes as missed cuts (2) on the PGA Tour in his nine tournaments since June. ... Matt Kuchar in 2019 is the last 54-hole leader to win the Sony Open.",
      "Nico Echavarria of Colombia was at No. 292 in the world going into the last week in October. In his last six starts, he won the Zozo Championship, had a top 10 in Mexico, was runner-up at Sea Island and lost in a playoff at the Sony Open. Now he is No. 41.",

      "It was quite a debut in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament for the 18-year-old Brazilian, who is currently ranked 112th and made it into the bracket at Melbourne Park by winning three matches in qualifying rounds last week.",
      "The victory over 10-time major quarterfinalist Rublev, who is 27, lasted just under 2 1/2 hours and stretched Fonseca's current unbeaten run to 14 matches. That includes taking the title last month in Saudi Arabia at the Next Gen ATP Finals for top players who are under 21, and another trophy this month at a lower-tier Challenger tournament in Canberra.",

All of those qualities, and more, were on display against Rublev in Margaret Court Arena, the second-biggest stage in Melbourne.",
      "Fonseca got to match point with a backhand winner that he celebrated by raising his right index finger in a No. 1 gesture and nodding his head. Then he ended it with a down-the-line forehand, spreading his arms wide and tossing his head back.",
      "\u201cI mean, not bad,\u201d were Fonseca's first words during his on-court interview afterward.",
      "That drew a smile from him and supportive laughter from the stands, where there were plenty of fans sporting his home country's green-yellow-and-blue flag.",

      "Hitting serves at up to 133 mph (214 kph), Fonseca delivered 14 aces and had just one double-fault while saving five of the six break points he faced.",
      "He accumulated 51 total winners, 18 more than Rublev, a quarterfinalist in Melbourne three of the past four years and Fonseca's first opponent ranked higher than No. 20.",
      "\u201cI was just focusing (on) my game, trying to put no pressure on myself, playing (against) a top-10 guy,\u201d Fonseca said. \u201cI was just playing my game and, well, now we're in the second round.\u201d",

      "The No. 5-seeded Medvedev earned the title at the 2021 U.S. Open and is a three-time runner-up at Melbourne Park, including a year ago, but was hardly playing his best in the second and third sets against Kasidit Samrej, a wild-card entry from Thailand who was making his Grand Slam debut.",
      "\u201cI know I play better when I play more tennis,\u201d Medvedev joked afterward. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Why play 1 hour, 30 (minutes)?\u2019 Need a minimum of three hours, at least, to feel my shots better.\u201d",
      "The camera-destroying racket swings happened in what would be the last game of the third set, which Samrej claimed to take a two-sets-to-one-lead in the best-of-five match.",
      "Medvedev's display of anger came after he lost a 13-stroke point to trail 40-15. Samrej hit a shot that clipped the net, altering its trajectory and throwing off the Russian's balance, before a cross-court forehand passing winner left Medvedev unable to make contact.",
      "Medvedev went up to the net and brought his racket forward with full force five times, breaking his equipment while shattering a small black camera and sending pieces of it flying. That earned a code violation warning for racket abuse from the chair umpire.",
      "Soon enough, Medvedev had dropped the set, leaving him with plenty of work to do to avoid a massive upset in his first match of the 2025 season. Medvedev quickly did turn things around, though, claiming 12 of the remaining 15 games, and 61 of the remaining 94 points.",
      "He finished with 24 aces and fewer than half as many unforced errors as Samrej, 34 to 69.",
      "\u201cIn the end of last year, this match, I probably would have lost it,\u201d said Medvedev, who went 3-1 in five-setters at the 2024 Australian Open. \u201cNew year, new energy.\u201d",
      "Samrej got treatment from a trainer because of a problem with his left leg late in the fourth set.",

      "The players were chosen from among the thousands of Ukrainians wounded in the war",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The players were chosen from among the thousands of Ukrainians wounded in the war. With limbs lost to Russian attacks, they gathered at a stadium in Kyiv over the weekend, ready to embark on a new contest: a soccer tournament.",
      "Organized by Ukraine\u2019s Association of Football, the \u201cLeague of the Mighty\u201d is Ukraine\u2019s first soccer championship for amputees. Over the past year, the association has invested in local communities to establish teams, recognizing the growing number of war-wounded citizens as a result of the nearly three-year war.",
      "With six outfield players and one goalkeeper on each side, they engaged in intense matches. Outfield players, all lower-limb amputees, and goalkeepers with upper-limb amputations, played without prostheses, relying on wrist clutches for control.",
      "Pokrova AMP won the tournament, with captain Valentyn Osovskyi describing the triumph as exhilarating. \u201cWe're really glad that we had to work our way through, it was interesting,\u201d he said, adding that the goal is to have their own championship and to create a strong team to represent Ukraine on the international level.",
      "\u201cThis will be a priority for the next few years for us,\u201d said Andriy Shevhenko, president of the Ukrainian Association of Football, noting there are more than 100,000 amputees in the country, most of them \u201csoldiers who defended our country.\u201d",
      "For Olena Balbek, adviser to the president of the association, the sport is one way to provide mental and physical rehabilitation for amputees while also normalizing their growing presence in society.",
      "\u201cThis is a societal effort,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on sports because it\u2019s our area of expertise, to make sure this is normalized.\u201d",
      "Citing their own research, Balbek said the association boasts at least 60 professional amputee players in Ukraine \u2013 a significant number considering there are around 1,000 worldwide.",
      "Though the reasons are unfortunate, Balbek said, \u201cWe have a huge potential in terms of engaging people in the sport.\u201d",
      "Featuring five teams from across Ukraine, the weekend\u2019s championship served as a testament to the association\u2019s success in developing grassroots amputee football across the country since the full-scale invasion began. A dedicated department within the association assists local groups in creating teams.",
      "The work is multifaceted, said Balbek, involving communication with veteran\u2019s groups, local initiatives and football clubs underscoring the importance of establishing amputee teams.",
      "\u201cFootball is the best rehabilitation for me,\" said Mykola Gatala, captain of the Pokrova AMP-One team. \"It has helped me both physically and mentally. I\u2019m doing it with my brothers in arms who went through the same things I did. We understand each other.\u201d",

      "They lead the NBA in wins so far in January",
      "They lead the NBA in wins so far in January. They'll have a winning record at the midpoint of the season. They've won five of their last six games at home, and they've also won five of their last six games on the road.",
      "And chances are, you wouldn't guess which team fits that billing.",
      "It's the Detroit Pistons. Yes, the Pistons.",
      "Doormats and punchlines no more, the Pistons are adding themselves to the list of great surprises in the NBA this season. They're now 21-19 after winning Monday night against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden, meaning they'll hit the halfway mark of the season with a winning record for the first time since 2017-18.",
      "\u201cWe believe we can beat anybody,\u201d Pistons center Isaiah Stewart said. \u201cThat's our belief. We're good enough to beat any team in this league. That's the belief we've got and we believe in each other. We're always pouring confidence into each other to go out there and be the best versions of ourselves. When we have that collectively as a group, that's a lot of energy \u2014 a lot of positive energy that we're putting out there.\u201d",
      "The notion of the Pistons beating anybody \u2014 literally, anybody \u2014 a year ago would have been comical. That was the team that lost a record 28 consecutive games, the worst single-season stretch in NBA history. They were 4-37 through 41 games, tying the sixth-worst start to a season ever. They were so bad that Pistons owner Tom Gores had to do the unthinkable and fire a coach in Monty Williams with five years and $65 million or so left on his contract.",
      "This year's Pistons started 0-4 under new coach JB Bickerstaff. The preseason expectations of being bad once again looked pretty secure. But they've now won 10 of their last 12 games and lead the NBA with seven wins so far in January. They could be a play-in team. They could be a playoff team. They might have an All-Star in Cade Cunningham. The way he's playing right now, Cunningham \u2014 bidding to be Detroit's first All-Star since Blake Griffin in 2019 \u2014 might want to go ahead and make plans for a trip to San Francisco next month for that very reason.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just thankful for my team, thankful for this coaching staff,\" Cunningham said. \"We've got to keep going. We've got a lot more work to do.\u201d",
      "The Pistons have already smashed last season's win total of 14. They're maybe a couple weeks away from rewarding bettors that went on the high side of their season-long win total that was set at 25.5 by BetMGM Sportsbook. It's happening with Cunningham \u2014 the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 draft \u2014 now looking like a bona fide breakout star, with season averages of 24.5 points, 9.4 assists and 6.6 rebounds per game.",
      "\u201cOur job is to put him in position to be successful. And then he\u2019s got to go out there and do it,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201cOver these 40 games now, he and I and his teammates have learned a lot about each other and how we can best help each other. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s about \u2014 each of us playing our role and doing what we\u2019re supposed to do together and collectively to just help one another, make this team as good as we possibly can. Cade knows his role and what this team needs, and he\u2019s executed perfectly.\u201d",
      "It does seem fitting that Bickerstaff is getting to be part of something good, since he was fired by a good team in Cleveland after last season. The Cavaliers had an over-under of 48.5 wins entering the season; they're an NBA-best 33-5 right now.",
      "Oklahoma City, Houston, Chicago, Portland, Brooklyn and Atlanta are also among the teams on pace to top their expected win totals for the season. But they won't get there in January, like the Pistons might. If that's the metric for measuring surprises, then the Pistons might be the biggest stunner so far this season.",
      "\u201cThe best part about this team is finding different ways to win the game,\u201d Bickerstaff said.",
      "It's been a long time coming. It's not time to start selling playoff tickets quite yet, Detroit. But before now, the last time the Pistons were even two games over .500 \u2014 barely above mediocre \u2014 was March 2019, nearly six years ago.",
      "These are good signs. Signs of progress. Signs of belief. For a franchise that hasn't won a playoff game in 17 years \u2014 that's 173 players, 10 coaches and two arenas ago \u2014 there might be real hope this time.",

      "The Chargers and Broncos joined the Chiefs in this year's playoffs",
      "DENVER -- The Denver Broncos and the Los Angeles Chargers felt good about their chances heading into the playoffs in large part because they had played the reigning two-time Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs so tough this season.",
      "Their wipeouts in the wild-card round show they're not as close to overtaking the Chiefs as they may have thought.",
      "The Broncos (10-8) would have swept Kansas City (15-2) were it not for a blocked field goal as time expired in Week 10 that preserved the Chiefs' 16-14 escape at Arrowhead, and Denver ended its eight-year playoff drought with a 38-0 shutout of K.C.'s backups in Week 18.",
      "If not for that fluke failure from his field goal protection unit, Sean Payton would be 3-1 against Kansas City since becoming Broncos head coach, and Jim Harbaugh was really close to going 2-0 against Andy Reid this season.",
      "The Chargers (11-7) lost by two and seven points to K.C., which won its ninth consecutive AFC West crown in its quest for an unprecedented three-peat as Super Bowl champs.",
      "The Chargers face-planted 32-12 at Houston  on Saturday after taking a 6-0 lead into the second quarter, and the Broncos were blown out 31-7 at Buffalo after grabbing a 7-0 lead just five snaps into the game.",
      "The remaining teams \u2014 Baltimore, Buffalo and Houston \u2014 in the AFC field all could pose stiff challenges to the Chiefs. But Patrick Mahomes is 15-3 in the playoffs, has won his last seven postseason starts and is 4-0 against the AFC quarterbacks remaining in the playoffs.",
      "Josh Allen is 0-3 against Mahomes in the playoffs and 6-2 against everybody else. Lamar Jackson is 0-1 against Mahomes and 3-3 against others, and Stroud is 2-1 and will face Mahomes for the first time in the postseason Saturday, when Mahomes and several other starters will be coming off a whopping 24 days' rest.",
      "The Ravens and Bills meet in the other divisional round game while the Chargers and Broncos both look toward next season and ponder the painful lessons learned from their early exits.",
      "Though not nearly as strong as the NFC North, which produced the 15-2 Lions, 14-3 Vikings and 11-6 Packers, all playoff teams, the AFC West sent three teams to the postseason for the first time since 2013.",
      "\u201cOne of the things we learned early on is we got to find a way to play these games at home,\u201d coach Sean Payton said.",
      "That would mean upending the Chiefs, who have owned the division ever since Peyton Manning retired in 2016 and have averaged almost 13 wins a season since Mahomes became their starter in 2018.",
      "So, how close are the Broncos to knocking the Chiefs from their pedestal? Several players who were cleaning out their lockers Monday said they felt they were close, although one thought it was a gotcha question.",
      "\u201cI mean, if you look at us, we were in all those games, every single one of them,\u201d left tackle Garett Bolles said of the Broncos' 3-3 divisional record that included a sweep of Las Vegas and a pair of seven-point losses to the Chargers. \u201cNone of them were blowouts. We're right there. I think that we need to get some more playmakers but everything we have in this locker room, the core value, is here.",
      "\u201cThe sky's the limit for us and I think we're going to be exactly where we want to be.\u201d",
      "Asked how close he felt the Broncos were to catching the Chiefs, right guard Quinn Meinerz, fresh off his first All-Pro season, was having none of it.",
      "\u201cYou're already assuming the Chiefs,\u201d he retorted.",
      "Well, they have won nine consecutive division titles, second most ever behind the New England Patriots' 11-year dominance of the AFC East from 2009-19 under Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.",
      "\u201cWe're not even on to the next season yet,\u201d Meinerz interjected. \u201cI mean, I can't predict any of that. We just got done playing in the playoffs. I think that's kind of a, kind of baiting question to ask, to be honest.\"",
      "Are you around the corner, at least?",
      "\u201cThis is all speculation and I'm not here to speculate,\u201d Meinerz said. \u201cI'm here to talk about what we just accomplished and not necessarily speculate on the future.\u201d",

      "Jones said the organization and McCarthy mutually agreed to part ways. A search for the team's next coach begins immediately, he said.",
      "\u201cI have great respect for Mike, and he has led the team through some very unique and challenging times during his tenure,\u201d Jones said in a statement.",
      "McCarthy\u2019s contract expired on Jan. 8 following a 7-10 season. Dallas was 12-5 each of the three years before that under him, but still hasn\u2019t been past the divisional round of the NFC playoffs since its last Super Bowl at the end of the 1995 season.",
      "University of Colorado coach Deion Sanders \u2014 who played on the last Super Bowl-winning Cowboys team \u2014 has a good relationship with Jones and could emerge as a coaching candidate. The two have discussed the job, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation. The person, speaking on condition of anonymity because a formal interview hasn\u2019t been arranged, said the team was still in the process of gathering candidates.",
      "The Cowboys had an exclusive negotiating window with McCarthy through Tuesday, but the parties decided to split ahead of the deadline.",

      "Next season will be the 30th for the Cowboys since winning the last of their five Super Bowl titles.",
      "Before taking the Dallas job after a full season out of coaching, McCarthy was with the Packers for 13 seasons and had a 125-77-2 record from 2006-18. He was 10-8 in the playoffs and led Green Bay to a Super Bowl title at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Cowboys, 14 years ago.",
      "There were also three other NFC championship games for McCarthy in Green Bay, and that is what Jones envisioned \u2014 and more \u2014 when he hired the coach in 2020 after Jason Garrett never got that far in his 10 years.",
      "McCarthy finished with a 50-38 record in Dallas, including a 1-3 mark in the playoffs. That included last season, when the Cowboys were NFC East champions and had won 16 consecutive home games before trailing by 32 points in the fourth quarter of a 48-32 wild-card loss to the seventh-seeded Packers.",
      "Dallas played the final nine games this season without franchise quarterback Dak Prescott because of a torn hamstring. Top receiver CeeDee Lamb, seven-time Pro Bowl guard Zack Martin, cornerback Trevon Diggs and rushing defending DeMarcus Lawrence also finished the season on injured reserve.",
      "Garrett had the franchise\u2019s second-longest coaching tenure. Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry was the coach for the Cowboys\u2019 first 29 seasons, the same number of seasons they have now gone since winning a Super Bowl. Jones fired two-time Super Bowl winner Landry when he bought the Cowboys before the 1989 season.",
      "Only 12 NFL coaches have more career regular-season wins than McCarthy\u2019s 174, which is still far behind Don Shula\u2019s record 328. The only active coaches with more wins than McCarthy are Andy Reid (302 in 29 seasons) and Mike Tomlin (183 in 18 seasons).",
      "Jones' next coach will be his ninth. He hired Jimmy Johnson from the University of Miami, and the Cowboys won back-to-back Super Bowls in the 1992-93 seasons before the college teammates at Arkansas had an acrimonious split.",
      "Barry Switzer replaced Johnson, a Pro Football Hall of Fame coach, and won a Super Bowl in his second season but was fired two years later following a 6-10 season. Bill Parcells, another Hall of Famer, led the Cowboys to the playoffs twice in four seasons from 2003-06 but lost in the wild-card round both times.",

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on Monday signed a bill restricting the use of smartphones at school, following a global trend for such limitations.",
      "The move will impact students at elementary and high schools across the South American nation starting in February. It provides a legal framework to ensure students only use such devices in cases of emergency and danger, for educational purposes, or if they have disabilities and require them.",
      "\"We cannot allow humanism to be replaced by algorithms,\u201d Lula said in a closed ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital, Brasilia, adding that the bill \u201cacknowledges the work of every serious person in education, everyone who wants to take care of children and teenagers in this country.\u201d",
      "In May, Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a leading think-tank and university, said Brazil had more smartphones than people, with 258 million devices for a population of 203 million Brazilians. Local market researchers said last year that Brazilians spend 9 hours and 13 minutes per day on screens, one of the world's highest figures.",

More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children.",

      "His 13-year-old daughter Isabela said her classmates struggled to focus during class because of their smartphones. She approved the move, but doesn't see it as enough to improve the learning environment for everyone.",
      "\"When the teacher lets you use the cell phone, it is because he wants you to do searches,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's still a lot of things that schools can't solve, such as bullying and harassment.\u201d",
      "As of 2023, about two-thirds of Brazilian schools imposed some restriction on cellphone use, while 28% banned them entirely, according to a survey released in August by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.",
      "The Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias have already passed local bills to ban such devices at schools. However, authorities have struggled to enforce these laws.",
      "Authorities in Sao Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil, are discussing whether smartphones should be banned both in public and private schools.",
      "Gabriele Alexandra Henriques Pinheiro, 25, works at a beauty parlor and is the mother of a boy diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. She also agrees with the restrictions, but says adults will continue to be a bad example of smartphone use for children.",
      "\u201cIt is tough,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to restrict the time my son watches any screens, but whenever I have a task to perform I have to use the smartphone to be able to do it all,\u201d she said.",
      "Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children\u2019s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.",
      "Cell phone bans have gained traction across the United States, where eight states have passed laws or policies that ban or restrict cellphone use to try to curb student phone access and minimize distractions in classrooms.",

      "He took the unusual step of filing court documents asking the Supreme Court to put the law on hold so that he could negotiate a deal for the sale of TikTok after he takes office. His position marked the latest example of him inserting himself into national issues before he takes office. It also was a change from his last presidential term, when he wanted to ban it.",

      "A long-awaited La Nina has finally appeared, but the periodic cooling of Pacific Ocean waters is weak and unlikely to cause as many weather problems as usual, meteorologists said Thursday.",
      "La Nina, the flip side of the better-known El Nino, is an irregular rising of unusually cold water in a key part of the central equatorial Pacific that changes weather patterns worldwide.",
      "The last El Nino was declared finished last June, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasters have been expecting La Nina for months. Its delayed arrival may have been influenced by the world's oceans being much warmer the last few years, said Michelle L'Heureux, head of NOAA's El Nino team.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s totally not clear why this La Nina is so late to form, and I have no doubt it\u2019s going to be a topic of a lot of research,\u201d L'Heureux said.",

They tend to make weather wetter in parts of Indonesia, northern Australia and southern Africa, L'Heureux said. They typically bring more Atlantic hurricanes in summer months, but L\u2019Heureux forecast that this La Nina will have dissipated by the summer.",
      "El Nino often leads to rainier weather in the United States, and tends to increase temperatures globally while La Nina has the opposite effect. Studies have found that La Nina droughts have been costlier than weather extremes linked to El Nino.",

      "In a collision between free speech and national security, the Supreme Court will hear arguments over the fate of TikTok, a digital age cultural phenomenon that roughly half the U.S. population uses for entertainment and information",
      "WASHINGTON -- In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\u201cRarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\u201d lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \u201cno one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\u201d",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\u201d D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice to be his administration\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump\u2019s solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law\u2019s most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more of these things that have basically surveillance technology built into them, and it enables some cool things,\u201d Liz Chamberlain, director of sustainability at the e-commerce site iFixit told The Associated Press. \u201cBut it also means that now we\u2019ve got microphones and cameras in our washing machines, refrigerators and that really is an industry-wide problem.\u201d",

      "The feature \u201cincreases energy consumption, encourages wasteful takeout consumption and distracts drivers\u2014all while adding little value,\u201d Higginbotham said. That landed the in-car system as \u201cleast sustainable\u201d on the list.",
      "TP-Link's Archer BE900 router won for \u201cleast secure\u201d of CES. The company is a top-selling router brand in the U.S. But its products are vulnerable to hacking, said Paul Roberts, founder of The Security Ledger.",

      "An international team of scientists say they\u2019ve successfully drilled one of the oldest ice cores yet, penetrating nearly 2 miles to Antarctic bedrock to reach ice that's at least 1.2 million years old",
      "An international team of scientists announced Thursday they\u2019ve successfully drilled one of the oldest ice cores yet, penetrating nearly 2 miles (2.8 kilometers) to Antarctic bedrock to reach ice they say is at least 1.2 million years old.",
      "Analysis of the ancient ice is expected to show how Earth's atmosphere and climate have evolved. That should provide insight into how Ice Age cycles have changed, and may help in understanding how atmospheric carbon changed climate, they said.",
      "\u201cThanks to the ice core we will understand what has changed in terms of greenhouse gases, chemicals and dusts in the atmosphere,\u201d said Carlo Barbante, an Italian glaciologist and coordinator of Beyond EPICA, the project to obtain the core. Barbante also directs the Polar Science Institute at Italy's National Research Council.",
      "The same team previously drilled a core about 800,000 years old. The latest drilling went 2.8 kilometers (about 1.7 miles) deep, with a team of 16 scientists and support personnel drilling each summer over four years in average temperatures of about minus-35 Celsius (minus-25.6 Fahrenheit).",
      "Italian researcher Federico Scoto was among the glaciologists and technicians who completed the drilling at the beginning of January at a location called Little Dome C, near Concordia Research Station.",
      "\u201cIt was a great a moment for us when we reached the bedrock,\u201d Scoto said. Isotope analysis gave the ice's age as at least 1.2 million years old, he said.",
      "Both Barbante and Scoto said that thanks to the analysis of the ice core of the previous Epica campaign they have assessed that concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, even during the warmest periods of the last 800,000 years, have never exceeded the levels seen since the Industrial Revolution began.",
      "\u201cToday we are seeing carbon dioxide levels that are 50% above the highest levels we\u2019ve had over the last 800,000 years,\" Barbante said.",

      "The announcement was exciting to Richard Alley, a climate scientist at Penn State who was not involved with the project and who was recently awarded the National Medal of Science for his career studying ice sheets.",
      "Alley said advancements in studying ice cores are important because they help scientists better understand the climate conditions of the past and inform their understanding of humans\u2019 contributions to climate change in the present. He added that reaching the bedrock holds added promise because scientists may learn more about Earth\u2019s history not directly related to the ice record itself.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Interior lighting aimed at reducing motion sickness. Shiny holographic dashboards displayed on windshields. And AI-powered voice assistants paired with infotainment systems to keep you company on long drives.",
      "Automakers pulled out all the stops to showcase their latest advances for in-vehicle experiences at CES, the Consumer Technology Association\u2019s annual trade show of all things tech, in Las Vegas this week. Hyundai Mobis unveiled a full-windshield holographic technology, while BMW spotlighted its new \u201ciDrive\u201d panoramic display. And Honda and Sony Honda Mobility showed what consumers can expect with their upcoming electric vehicles.",
      "Many of these driving enhancements aim to \u201cmake life on board more comfortable,\u201d explains Axel Maschka, executive vice president and head of the business division at Hyundai Mobis. And for some consumers today, he adds, \u201cthis \u2018living space\u2019\" of a car's interior has become a dominant part of a vehicle's appeal.",
      "Hyundai Mobis' holographic windshield display provides a glimpse into that. The technology, which won't be on the market for at least several more years, projects information ranging from driving speed to safety alerts across the entire windshield, and also provides some entertainment options for those who aren\u2019t behind the wheel. To keep the driver's eyes on the road, the panoramic display looks different depending on where you sit. A demo from the South Korean company shows the front row passenger can watch a movie or play a video game projected ahead of them, for example, but it's not visible to the driver.",
      "Maschka claims the holographic windshield gives drivers an easier view of key information in their line of sight and keeps other distractions in the car out of sight.",
      "Car safety experts have long stressed that keeping drivers' eyes on the road is critical. Simplicity is also key, says Ian Reagan, a senior research scientist at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an education and research nonprofit. Too many visual display features can be overwhelming, he explains.",
      "\u201cDriver distraction is a big concern with visual displays in vehicles,\u201d said Reagan, who cautions that safety \u201cdoesn't always win out\u201d over what some companies determine is going to be \u201csexy and sell\u201d for consumers. Still, Reagan says he's encouraged by recent developments in panoramic displays that aim to keep key, minimal information in a car's line of sight.",
      "Beyond Hyundai Mobis, that's part of what BMW, which showed off its new Panoramic iDrive and Operating System X, also says it's trying to do. The system, which will be integrated into of new models starting later this year, projects a panoramic display onto the vehicles' lower windscreen.",
      "The technology offers a range of digital features and can be personalized by different colors, apps and other preferences. But in the driver's line of sight, Stephan Durach, BMW\u2019s Head of UI/UX Development, said the goal was to avoid redundancies.",
      "\u201cYou often hear the phrase, \u2018your car is your smartphone on wheels.\u2019 And to be honest, I don\u2019t like this at all,\u201d Durach told The Associated Press. He said that the display aims to show a minimal amount of the most important information above the dashboard, in efforts to help reduce distractions.",
      "Honda and Sony Honda Mobility also spotlighted in-cabin features that drivers will soon encounter in their new EV lineup.",
      "Sony Honda Mobility says \u201cAfeela 1\" will include an interactive AI-powered voice agent. In Monday's remarks, CEO Yasuhide Mizuno said that \u201ccustomers can be entertained by communicating with Afeela 1\u201d \u2014 noting that Afeela's agent is \u201cfocused on conversation\u201d and \u201cproactively talks to you\u201d to provide useful information as you drive.",
      "The Afeela 1, scheduled to go on sale later this year with deliveries anticipated for mid-2026, also touts a panoramic screen and infotainment system filled with a variety of entertainment apps. Online reservations for the car opened in California this week.",
      "Meanwhile, Honda spotlighted \u201cultra-personal optimization\u201d for customers of its upcoming 0 series of electric vehicles \u2014 the first two models of which are set to launch in North America next year. The Japanese car giant unveiled the operating system that it plans to use in all 0 series models, \u201cAISMO OS,\u201d which it says will be integrated into vehicle operations ranging from automated driving and advanced driver assistance to in-car infotainment.",
      "In-vehicle software functions will also continue to be updated after purchase. \u201cThe more it is used, the more personalized it will become,\u201d Katsushi Inoue, global head of electrification business development at Honda, said in Tuesday remarks.",
      "While there's ample excitement around the latest bells and whistles announced from car companies like those on display at CES this week, there are still questions about the safety and efficacy of new features.",
      "Reagan points to AI-powered voice agents and the growing buzz around partial automated driving. He says his team's research shows that people interacting with partially-automated driving are \u201cmore distracted than ever\u201d because drivers have to \u201calways be ready\u201d for changes in vehicle assistance.",
      "And while AI voice assistants bring promising solutions to keeping drivers' eyes on the road, Reagan notes that they're not all built equally. How they are implemented is key, he said, noting that if a voice assistant requires too much back and forth or complicated answers it can also lead to frustration and distraction.",
      "Beyond in-vehicle experiences, EVs showcased at CES this week highlighted the state of sustainable energy in the car industry today \u2014 and the need to expand charging sources for consumers. Honda has a venture with seven other automakers to create the \u201cIONNA\u201d charging network in North America and said Tuesday it plans to expand such efforts \u201cto ensure that Honda 0 Series owners will have access to more than 100,000 charging stations by 2030.\u201d",
      "Honda is also exploring ways to provide \u201cpersonalized\u201d charging experiences for its EV customers down the road. The company said it's considering incorporating AI technology from Amazon Web Services to help individuals find nearby charging facilities, for example, or simplify payments.",

      "Yoon declared martial law in a televised speech on Dec. 3.",
      "South Korean police detained impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol at his residence in Seoul on Wednesday local time, ABC News confirmed.",
      "The detention comes weeks after investigators\u00a0first attempted to arrest the embattled politician over his short-lived declaration of martial law in December.",
      "Prosecutors from South Korea's Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials entered Yoon's residence, spokesperson Kim Baek-ki told reporters. The warrant was officially executed at 10:33 a.m.",
      "Afterward, Yoon traveled in his own presidential security vehicle to the Corruption Investigation Office for questioning.",
      "The president decided to appear in person at the office, \"to avoid serious incidents between the Security Service and the police,\" his lawyer Suk Dong-hyun said.",
      "\"With the high likelihood of a physical confrontation between the Security Service and the police, it is clear that a serious incident could arise,\" Yoon's lawyer said. \"As president, President Yoon has resolved to prevent such a scenario, despite recognizing that the CIO's investigation and attempted arrest are clearly unlawful.\"",
      "In a pre-recorded video message to the country, Yoon addressed the latest attempt to detain him.",
      "\"Unfortunately, the law has completely collapsed in this country,\" he said. \"Seeing warrants being issued by agencies that do not have investigative authority, and courts without warrant review authority issuing arrest warrants and search and seizure warrants, investigative agencies issuing false official documents to deceive the people, committing such illegal acts, and proceeding with procedures based on invalid warrants, I cannot help but feel regretful.\"",
      "Yoon said he was presenting himself to the CIO, but it was not an endorsement of what he called its illegal investigation, but instead \"an effort to prevent unnecessary bloodshed as they attempted to enter my residence using force.\"",
      "Earlier this month, anti-corruption authorities attempted to enter the property earlier this month, but a standoff ensued between Yoon's security team and police investigators.",
      "There were a total of 3,000 police officers on the scene and thousands of protesters attempting to block the arrest, which was eventually called off.",
      "The efforts to detain Yoon came after a South Korean court issued an arrest and search warrant on Dec. 31 over his short-lived imposition of martial law, ABC News confirmed at the time. Yoon has been suspended from his position since Dec. 14.",
      "The former president declared martial law in a televised speech on Dec. 3, saying the measure was necessary due to the actions of the country's liberal opposition, the Democratic Party, which he accused of controlling parliament, sympathizing with North Korea and paralyzing the government.",
      "Under South Korea's constitution, if a sitting president is accused of insurrection, the police have the authority to arrest him while he is still in office.",
      "A joint investigation team sought the initial warrant on insurrection and abuse of power charges after they said Yoon ignored three summonses to appear for questioning. The court's decision to grant the warrant marked a first for a president in the country's history.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 19:26:08 -0500",
    "summary": "New guidance from a team of health experts around the world proposes expanding the definition of obesity beyond the popular body mass index (BMI) measure.",
    "story": [
      "Obesity is currently defined as a BMI of 30 or above in adults.",
      "New guidance from a team of health experts around the world proposes expanding the definition of obesity beyond the popular body mass index (BMI) measure.",
      "The new guidance comes from the Commission on Clinical Obesity, which is led by dozens of medical experts from various medical specialties around the world. The commission recommends the inclusion of body fat measurements and the presence of existing health issues -- and cautions against using BMI alone as an individual measure of health.",
      "The proposal also recommends using the terms \"pre-clinical\u201d and \u201cclinical\u201d obesity to offer more nuanced approaches to the evaluation and management of obesity.",
      "Pre-clinical obesity refers to excess fat without organ dysfunction but increased risk of developing clinical obesity and other long-term health problems such as cardiovascular disease, and Type 2 diabetes.",
      "\u201cIn other words, their organs are functioning well. They have no metabolic diseases, and they have a fairly good quality of life,\u201d said Dr. Robert Kushner, a commissioner and professor of medicine and medical education at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, in an interview with ABC news.",
      "Clinical obesity, by contrast, involves excess fat that directly affects organ function or limits an individual\u2019s ability to conduct daily activities. It can lead to potentially life-threatening complications such as heart attack, kidney failure, and/or stroke.",
      "\u201cThe extra body fat is impacting the health or the quality of life of the individual,\u201d said Kushner.",
      "The report further outlines the diagnostic criteria for obesity, combining elevated BMI with at least one abnormal body fat measurement, such as waist circumference, waist-to- hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, or high direct body fat measurements noted on a scan.",
      "Notably, two or more abnormal body fat measurements could still classify an individual as obese, regardless of BMI.",
      "Obesity is currently defined as a BMI of 30 or above in adults, according to the World Health Organization, affecting 1 in 8 adults. However, using BMI alone to aid in the diagnosis of obesity has its limitations.",
      "\u201cBMI doesn\u2019t take body composition, or how much of body weight is fat or the location of the fat into account,\" said Dr. Louis Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine, in an email to ABC News. \"As a result, someone could be normal weight, but have a high percent of body fat and be at risk of clinical obesity. Additionally, someone could have a high BMI, but have a relatively low body fat percentage.\"",
      "The commission also stressed that obesity is a chronic disease with major health consequences.",
      "\u201cThis is a physical, not a mental or behavioral phenomenon. Obesity as a disease-causing entity either causes or worsens multiple illnesses. Losing weight improves all of them at the same time,\u201d said Aronne.",
      "\u201cBy recognizing that some people already have complications of obesity (clinical) and focusing more intensive, expensive treatment on them makes sense as a cost-effective approach. Those who have not reached that point (pre-clinical) can initiate treatment with less intensive, less expensive treatment,\u201d Aronne added.",
      "It is unclear when or if these recommendations will be widely adopted by the medical community.",
      "\u201cWe're trying to get this out,\" said Kushner. \"We're putting a stake in the ground to start, getting away from just a blanket diagnosis of obesity for someone who has an elevated BMI. We really need to start identifying individuals who are harmed by their weight.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 21:47:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Hydroclimate whiplash -- the rapid shift between wet and dry conditions -- likely contributed to the severity of the wildfires in Southern California, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The state's naturally variable climate increases its wildfire risk.",
      "Hydroclimate whiplash -- the rapid shift between wet and dry conditions -- likely contributed to the severity of the wildfires burning in Southern California, according to experts.",
      "In recent years, parts of the state shifted from a major drought to an extended period of above-average precipitation that allowed for abundant vegetation growth. After that, a stretch of intense, record-breaking heat dried out much of that vegetation and provided ample fuel for large and fast-growing wildfires.",
      "The Los Angeles region experienced two \"extraordinarily wet\" winters -- in 2023 and 2024 -- followed by dry conditions that began in February, Edith de Guzman, a water equity and adaptation policy cooperative extension specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles, told ABC News. Since May 6, Los Angeles has only seen 0.16 inches of rain, so the region\u2019s rainy season is off to an unusually dry start.",
      "\"Right now, we essentially have had no measurable precipitation since last spring, which has dried out all of that vegetation that grew happily over the last two wet winters,\" De Guzman said.",
      "The shrub cover that popped up as a result of the extra precipitation later dried out -- providing large volumes of fuel for a fire, De Guzman said.",
      "Combined with the highly flammable materials many of the houses were constructed with, such as wood frames, it was a recipe for disaster, De Guzman said.",
      "In Southern California, dry conditions are also now more likely to last later into the fall, leaving the region more vulnerable during high wind events, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with both UCLA and UC Agriculture and Natural Resources.",
      "\"Climate change is increasing the overlap between extremely dry vegetation conditions later in the season and the occurrence of these wind events,\" Swain said.",
      "Hydroclimate variability has always been a staple of California's natural climate, leaving it particularly vulnerable to wildfires.",
      "Among all of the states in the continental U.S., California has the most year-to-year variability between wet and dry conditions.",
      "\"As you move down into Southern California, that variability increases even more,\" Julie Kalansky, climate scientist and deputy director of operations at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the University of California, San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, told ABC News.",
      "However, some climate experts point to growing evidence that shows climate change has increased the volatility between very dry and very wet conditions around the world, like moving from a devastating drought to record-breaking precipitation and then back to a drought. These rapid swings between extreme weather events will amplify many of the associated hazards and contribute to devastating wildfire events.",
      "Climate change could also be making wild weather swings more common and more extreme, according to new research published in Nature Reviews Earth & Environment and the Fifth National Climate Assessment, a breakdown of the latest in climate science coming from 14 federal agencies, published in November 2023.",
      "\"These hotter, dry conditions that are driven by climate change have created a tinderbox,\" said Rachel Cleetus, policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"We have this dried out vegetation, very dry landscapes.\"",
      "But hydrovariability alone didn\u2019t lead to the devastating fires over the past week. A \"confluence\" of events allowed the fires to explode instantly, Cleetus said.",
      "It was the wind that spread the fires so rapidly once they were ignited. An exceptionally strong mountain wave wind event, with northerly 80 mph to 100 mph gusts, spread the fires faster than anyone could stop them.",
      "\"We experienced the most intense Santa Ana winds in nearly 15 years,\" De Guzman said.",
      "Conditions higher up in the atmosphere helped to further enhance winds at the surface.",
      "Cold, dense air associated with a low pressure system in the upper atmosphere was moving over Baja California. That air was positioned at a favorable north-northeast to northeast trajectory over the region allowing for the colder air located higher up in the atmosphere to come rushing down towards the surface and enhance the winds already blowing.",
      "This brought surges of powerful winds across the Los Angeles and Ventura County Mountains -- including in some places that don't typically see winds that strong, like Burbank and in the foothills of the Pacific Palisades.",
      "The wind direction and topography played a major role as well. The San Gabriel Mountains and the wind orientation interacted to produce a damaging wind event that doesn't occur often. The mountains can also make the winds more erratic because additional whirls of wind, known as wind eddies, can form as the air moves across the peaks and through the canyons.",
      "\"They were extremely strong and fast, but they were also erratic,\" De Guzman said. \"They typically are narrower and a little bit more predictable in direction.\"",

Even so, relatives have established a GoFundMe campaign to help him recover from the disaster, writing, \"His home was not just a shelter but a repository of memories, mementos, and the life he built over decades with his late wife.\"",
      "In the meantime, he's living at the Pasadena Convention Center, which has been converted into an emergency shelter for fire victims.",

      "The Eaton Fire ignited just after 6 p.m. Pacific Time on Jan. 7, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).",
      "Fueled by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds, the blaze \u2013 one of several that have broken out during what the National Weather Service designated a \"particularly dangerous situation\" \u2013 ravaged many neighborhoods in the communities of Altadena and Pasadena, destroying some 7,000 structures, including homes and businesses, and burning 14,000 acres.",
      "The Eaton Fire, which was 35% contained as of Tuesday morning, is the second-largest of the infernos that ignited over a 45-square-mile area of Los Angeles County. The Palisades Fire in the oceanfront community of Pacific Palisades also started on the morning of Jan. 7 and has grown to nearly 24,000 acres, and is the largest of the fires.",
      "The Palisades Fire has destroyed about 5,000 structures, including homes and businesses. The fire was 17% contained as of Tuesday as firefighters braced for the re-emergence of strong Santa Ana winds, which were forecast to blow through the drought-stricken region through Wednesday, further fueling the fires.",
      "At least 24 fire-related deaths have been blamed on the Eaton and Palisades fires, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office.",

    "title": "Here's the science behind the Los Angeles wildfires",
    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:59:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Epic events like the Southern California wildfires do not have a singular cause.",
    "story": [
      "Conditions made for a perfect storm of flames.",
      "Epic events like the Southern California wildfires do not have a singular cause.",
      "While we don\u2019t yet know the official causes of the fires, we do know that the weather and climate conditions when they started made for a perfect storm for the rapid spread of the flames.",
      "The first problem is that Los Angeles has been very dry. The city has only seen 0.16 inches of rain since May 6, so the region\u2019s rainy season is off to an unusually dry start. This created a lot of fuel for potential fires. But a lack of rain alone didn\u2019t lead to the devastating fires we saw this week.",
      "It was the wind that spread the fires so rapidly once they were ignited. An exceptionally strong mountain wave wind event, with northerly 80 to 100 mile per hour gusts, spread the fires faster than anyone could stop them.",
      "And we knew the weather conditions were coming. Thirty-six hours before the fires started, the National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned of \"life threatening and destructive winds, extreme fire behavior and likely the strongest north winds in southern California since 2011.\u201d",
      "That event on Dec. 1, 2011, also brought powerful and destructive wind gusts to much of Southern California, including the Los Angeles metro area.",
      "Wind gusts up to 97 mph were recorded in the mountains of northwestern Los Angeles County, according to the National Weather Service. But unlike last week, no large wildfires broke out like they did in 2011. A more normal rainfall amount from October to December of that year may have helped avoid the same disaster.",
      "Santa Ana events typically are associated with northeast to east-northeast winds in Los Angeles County and usually result in very little wind in the San Gabriel Valley and eastern San Fernando Valley areas, which are home to many high-populated sections of the LA metro area.",
      "The atmospheric setup during this recent event oriented winds in a more northerly to north-north easterly direction. This sent the high winds right over the region\u2019s San Gabriel Mountains in a trajectory that not only helped amplify their strength, but made the air even drier as it came rushing down the other side. This brought powerful wind gusts to areas that don\u2019t typically experience winds at such an intensity.",
      "What made this a devastating Santa Ana event is that conditions higher up in the atmosphere helped to further enhance winds at the surface.",
      "In this case, an area of low pressure in the upper atmosphere was moving over Baja California. The cold, dense air associated with this system was positioned at a favorable north-northeast to northeast trajectory over the region. The particular setup allowed for the colder air located higher up in the atmosphere to come rushing down towards the surface and enhance the winds already blowing. This brought surges of powerful winds across the Los Angeles and Ventura County Mountains, crashing into the foothills and some coastal communities.",
      "The wind direction and topography played a major role as well. The San Gabriel Mountains and the wind orientation interacted to produce a damaging wind event that doesn't occur often. The mountains can also make the winds more erratic because additional whirls of wind, known as wind eddies, can form as the air moves across the peaks and through the canyons.",
      "So while both the 2011 and 2025 events brought powerful, destructive winds, one big difference is how dry it is right now in the LA area.",
      "As far as climate change, we won't know the direct impact until climate attribution studies are done. While climate change likely amplified some of the conditions that contributed to the massive, destructive nature of the wildfires, it is just one part of a long list which also includes more direct human impacts like rapid urbanization and land management.",
      "But we do know that wildfires in the West have become larger, more intense and more destructive and that human-amplified climate change is one of the key reasons.",
      "And new research explains how climate change is making hydroclimate whiplash more common. Those are rapid swings between intensely wet and dangerously dry weather.",
      "As Daniel Swain, the lead author of the research and a climate scientists with UCLA explains, \"This whiplash sequence in California has increased fire risk twofold: first, by greatly increasing the growth of flammable grass and brush in the months leading up to fire season, and then by drying it out to exceptionally high levels with the extreme dryness and warmth that followed.\"",
      "Less than a year ago, Los Angeles had historic flooding and is now facing severe drought conditions. That literally adds fuel to the fire.",
      "Finally, it\u2019s important to reiterate that California has and will always be particularly vulnerable to wildfires simply due to its natural climate. The state historically experiences highly variable weather and climate conditions, typically shifting from periods of very dry to very wet weather.",
      "Across the continental U.S., California has the most year-to-year variability between wet and dry conditions. As you move down into Southern California, that variability increases even more, according to Julie Kalansky, a climate scientist and deputy director of operations at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the University of California, San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 12:23:31 -0500",
    "summary": "While the end to the fire danger is not yet in sight, experts say the hazards that will remain in its wake will be severe.",
    "story": [
      "The fires are still burning. But when they stop, experts say hazards remain.",
      "Fires are continuing to burn in Southern California, with further weather-related threats expected to increase as another Santa Ana wind event picks up this week.",
      "While the end to the fire danger is not yet in sight, the hazards that will remain in its wake will be severe, especially due to the urban nature of many of the burn zones, experts told ABC News.",
      "The fires burning in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties are occurring on the urban-wildland interface -- areas where wildland landscapes meet with urban dwellings, Costas Synolakis, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Southern California who has studied how urban fires exacerbate post-fire related hazards, told ABC News. The further away from wildland, the less chance of ignition, which is why heavy winds were able to spark house-to-house spread quickly.",
      "But these wildfires are so severe that they have penetrated into more urban areas, Scott Stephens, professor of fire science at the University of California, Berkeley, told ABC News.",
      "The fires will have unprecedented environmental impacts, Synolakis said.",
      "Landslides will be of great concern once the fires subside",
      "Once the fires are out, landslides from burn scars will be a big concern when rain returns to Southern California and could be an issue for years to come. Post-fire debris flows are particularly hazardous because they can occur with little warning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Post-wildfire landslides can exert great loads on objects in their paths, strip vegetation, block drainage ways, damage structures and endanger human life, according to the USGS. Additionally, wildfires could destabilize pre-existing, deep-seated landslides over long periods. Flows generated over longer periods could be accompanied by root decay and loss of soil strength, according to the USGS.",
      "Landslides already historically occur in California. But conditions are currently extreme enough to warrant concern for increased threat, Edith de Guzman, a water equity and adaptation policy cooperative extension specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles, told ABC News",
      "The wildfires are incinerating the shrub cover, so when a rain event does occur, the precipitation hits a ground surface that could be bare minerals and unable to soak it up, Stephens said.",
      "\"You're going to get flows of soil, rock and debris,\" Stephens said.",
      "In Los Angeles, debris basins designed to catch some of the materials sliding down the mountain to lessen the threat of landslide hazards have been built in Mount Wilson and near Eaton Canyon.",
      "The landslide danger will be especially dangerous in the Pacific Palisades, the neighborhood nestled in the lower hills of the Santa Monica mountain range on the Westside of Los Angeles that was decimated by the Palisades fire, because there is no debris basin there, Synolakis said.",
      "\"Palisades is going to be an area that people need to be on the watchout for landslides because the valley walls are steep,\" Synolakis said.",
      "The houses that did survive the wildfire in the Palisades could also be in great danger of a severe rainstorm undercutting the foundation, Synolakis added.",
      "Homes near creeks and steep hills could also contribute a lot of debris to landslides, Stephens said.",
      "An average of 25 to 50 people are killed by landslides each year in the U.S., according to the USGS.",
      "Long-term pollution could impact the region, experts say",
      "An even bigger concern than potential landslides is the environmental impact of the fires, Synolakis said. In the near future, these burned-out communities will be filled with cleanup crews dressed in hazmat suits, Hugh Safford, a research fire ecologist at the University of California, Davis, told ABC News.",
      "Since the fires are burning down manmade structures, the materials used to construct homes and cars are depositing toxins into the air and ground as they combust, the experts said.",
      "\"This is going into the local creek systems and in the local soils,\" Safford said, adding that many of the homes built before the 1980s likely are filled with asbestos.",
      "Debris from the scorched homes near Malibu's Big Rock will end up in the ocean as well -- by wind and sea -- due to the proximity to the coastline, Synolakis said.",
      "In Altadena, homes that were destroyed near the San Gabriel Valley Groundwater Basin could contribute pollutants to the water system, De Guzman said.",
      "Researchers are already monitoring soil to see what kinds of heavy metals and other toxins have seeped in during the combustion process. It won't be long before the toxins end up in the ocean through the watershed, Synolakis said.",
      "The environmental impact of a series of wildfires this big is yet to be seen, Synolakis said. And the cleanup process will be long and arduous, Safford said.",
      "Fire danger expected to persist",
      "On Monday afternoon, winds will begin to pick up in the mountains and higher elevations gusting 20 to 30 mph, locally 50 mph.",
      "There is very little rain relief for the fires in sight for the Los Angeles area in the near future, forecasts show.",
      "While there is a 20% chance for a sprinkle on Saturday, that precipitation is expected to occur closer to San Diego.",
      "Dry conditions are expected in the long term as well. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared that La Nina conditions are expected to persist through April 2025, with Southern Californian expected to be very close to drier than normal.",
      "But even low rainfall amounts could trigger dangerous flash flooding that can unfold very quickly, as recent wildfire burn scar areas are especially prone to flooding, mudslides and landslides. In some instances, burned soil can be as water repellant as pavement, according to the National Weather Service. The susceptibility to flash flood within the burned area is greatest during the first two years following the fire.",
      "The general rule of thumb is that half an inch of rainfall in less than an hour is sufficient to cause flash flooding in a burn area.",
      "Ideally, several light to moderate rainfall events in the region would be best to significantly diminish the current wildfire danger and gradually soak the ground.",

Colbert County Sheriff Eric Balentine confirmed to ABC News that a state autopsy ruled 39-year-old Dennoriss Richardson died by suicide in September.",
      "But the family's independent autopsy concluded that homicide or staged suicide could not be ruled out, namely because the hyoid neck bone was missing from the body after it was sent to the family.",

      "LEIGH RICHARDSON: Actually, I have not been told anything. I haven't spoken to any of the authorities, even since I've gotten my autopsy back. That is very questionable to me with that being missing. I know that is standard procedure, but it definitely needs to be accounted for.",
      "And I also think that it needs to be made available to Dr. Shaker [who signed the private autopsy report] and also with the crime scene photos, the rope -- there are several pieces of evidence, of key evidence that should have been examined and should still be examined and investigated for a thorough investigation.",

Dennoriss, since an infant, had chronic asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]. All of his life, he's been very scared and kind of anxiety -- he would have anxiety attacks if he couldn't breathe. He kept his rescue inhaler on him at all times.",

      "Tuesday\u2019s speech was Murphy\u2019s second-to-last, and he emphasized his reluctance to become a lame-duck governor in the final stretch of his second term. Among the other proposals he unveiled, Murphy said he would direct schools to ban cellphones in grades K-12.",

      "Delta Air Lines fourth-quarter results topped analysts\u2019 expectations as travel demand was strong during the crucial holiday period",
      "Delta Air Lines topped profit and revenue expectations in the fourth quarter on strong demand during the crucial holiday period.",
      "Delta said Friday that travel demand picked up throughout the quarter. During November and December, the airline said that it saw four of the top 10 revenue days in its history and double-digit growth in cash bookings driven by both leisure and corporate travelers.",
      "\u201cAs we move into 2025, we expect strong demand for travel to continue, with consumers increasingly seeking the premium products and experiences that Delta provides,\u201d CEO Ed Bastian said in a prepared statement on Friday.",
      "The company earned $843 million, or $1.29 per share. Per share earnings removing one-time expenses were $1.85, easily beating Wall Street projections of $1.76, according to industry analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.",
      "A year earlier, Delta earned $2.04 billion, or $3.16 per share.",
      "Delta hit the top end of its own forecast for the three months ended Dec. 3, having said that it would earn between $1.60 and $1.85 per share.",

      "Total revenue per available seat mile climbed to $21.60 from $20.78 a year ago.",

      "Shares of Delta jumped more than 6% before the opening bell on Friday after saying that it now anticipates full-year earnings will be more than $7.35 per share, and between 70 cents and $1 in the first quarter.",
      "Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting full-year earnings of $6.11 per share and first-quarter earnings of 77 cents per share.",
      "Delta's strong quarter also pushed the shares of other airlines higher in premarket trading, with American Airlines up more than 4%, JetBlue rising about 2% and United Airlines climbing more than 5%.",
      "Among U.S. carriers, Delta scored the highest for on-time arrivals last year, aviation-data provider Cirium reported last week. That was despite a computer outage that caused thousands of flight cancellations in July.",
      "Delta, based in Atlanta, achieved an on-time rate of more than 83%, good enough to rank third worldwide behind Aeromexico and Saudia, respectively. The next-best U.S. carriers were United Airlines, at nearly 81%, and Alaska Airlines, at just over 79%, Cirium said.",

      "California has withdrawn requests for the EPA to give the state authority to enforce rules limiting emissions from diesel-powered trains and big rigs",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California\u2019s efforts to limit pollution from diesel-powered trains and big rigs were stalled in anticipation of pushback from the incoming Trump administration.",
      "The California Air Resources Board said Tuesday it withdrew its requests for federal approval to implement stricter emissions rules for locomotives and semi-trucks because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had yet to approve them. The decision came just days before Democratic President Joe Biden leaves office.",
      "During his first administration, Trump attempted to thwart various California climate efforts, including rules to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions from transportation sources.",
      "One of the rules California pulled after the EPA failed to approve it would have phased out the sale of new diesel-powered semi-trucks and buses by 2036. The Air Resources Board passed the regulation in 2023. Another rule, which the agency approved the same month, would have banned locomotive engines more than 23 years old by 2030 and increased the use of zero-emissions technology to transport freight from ports and throughout railyards.",
      "Both rules were opposed by industry as costly mandates that would be difficult to implement.",
      "Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph said the agency is assessing its options to continue its efforts to curb planet-warming emissions and improve air quality but did not offer specifics on what comes next.",
      "\u201cWhile we are disappointed that U.S. EPA was unable to act on all the requests in time, the withdrawal is an important step given the uncertainty presented by the incoming administration that previously attacked California\u2019s programs to protect public health and the climate and has said will continue to oppose those programs,\u201d Randolph said in a statement.",
      "Mike Alpern, a spokesperson for the EPA\u2019s Pacific Southwest region, said the agency would not take any further action on the rules.",
      "California has long had the authority to set emissions standards that are stricter than federal rules. During Trump's first term, his administration challenged that authority. But a federal court last year upheld California's ability to set nation-leading vehicle emissions regulations. The EPA granted California the authority last month to enforce a rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars in the state by 2035.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump's transition team, did not comment on California pulling its waiver requests but said the incoming president would work to improve air and water quality during his second presidency.",

      "A surprising AP photograph of an undamaged Volkswagen van surrounded by destruction from a Los Angeles wildfire has astonished viewers",
      "Preston Martin figured the retro blue Volkswagen van he slept in for a year during college was a goner, given that he parked it in a Malibu neighborhood just before the Palisades fire ripped through, reducing homes and cars to rubble and charred metal.",
      "So the surfboard maker was stunned to find that the vehicle survived. Not only that, a photo of the vibrant bus taken by an Associated Press photographer was circulating widely on television and online, giving viewers a measure of joy.",
      "\u201cThere is magic in that van,\u201d Martin, 24, said Tuesday in an interview with AP. \u201cIt makes no sense why this happened. It should have been toasted, but here we are.\u201d",
      "The neighborhood remains closed to the public, and neither Martin nor the friend and business partner to whom he sold the van last summer, Megan Krystle Weinraub, have been able to inspect the vehicle. In other photos of the van, it appears to have soot on its windows, Martin said.",
      "Martin purchased the 1977 Volkswagen Type 2 somewhat on a whim sometime around his junior year studying mechanical engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "His mother, Tracey Martin, of Irvine, yelled at him for blowing his money, but Martin told her he'd save on rent by fixing up the inside and living in it his senior year, which he did. She came to love the bus, and sewed curtains for the windows.",
      "Last summer he sold the van to Weinraub, 29, who designs surf and skate boards under the Vibrant Boards brand. Martin makes carbon fiber surfboards under Starlite.",
      "On Jan. 5 the friends drove to go surfing with the van, which Weinraub calls Azul \u2014 Spanish for \u201cblue.\u201d Afterward Martin parked it on a flat spot up the hill from her apartment by the Getty Villa, as she is still learning to drive the manual transmission.",
      "Two days later the Palisades fire erupted, and Weinraub fled with her dog, Bodi, and some dog food in her primary car. She felt sad about Azul, but that was minor compared with those who lost homes or loved ones.",
      "On Thursday a neighbor sent her a photo. In the background was the bus, still blue and white and not at all damaged.",
      "\u201cI freaked out,\u201d she said. \u201cI was in the bathroom, and I screamed.\u201d",
      "She called Martin, who also freaked out. He called his mom, who was ecstatic. \u201cI've never cried for a car before,\u201d Tracey Martin texted her son.",
      "They were even more surprised when the AP photo aired on television and popped up online.",
      "\u201cWe made the news,\u201d Martin said in a reel on Instagram, and Weinraub contacted the photographer.",
      "Weinraub, whose home survived, does not know when she'll be allowed back to her apartment or to Azul. The two are thrilled that the van's survival has touched so many people.",
      "\u201cIt's so cool that it\u2019s become this, like, beacon of hope,\u201d Martin said. \u201cEverything around it was toasted, just destroyed. And then here\u2019s this bright blue shiny van, sitting right there.\u201d"

      "Four members of the Hasidic Jewish community accused of damaging a historic Brooklyn synagogue during a melee over an illegal tunnel are set to stand trial later this year",
      "NEW YORK -- Four men accused of damaging a Brooklyn synagogue during a melee that followed the discovery of a secret tunnel at the global headquarters of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement of Hasidic Judaism are set to stand trial after turning down a plea deal offered by prosecutors.",
      "The men face felony criminal mischief charges for their alleged role in a brawl last January that damaged parts of the famed complex, a deeply revered Jewish site that receives thousands of visitors annually.",
      "At the time, scores of young men had gathered to protest an attempt by synagogue leaders to seal off a makeshift tunnel that some congregants had dug without permission in an effort to expand the worship space. When police arrived, prosecutors say some of the men ripped wooden siding off the wall, flung prayer books in the air and refused to leave the dusty excavation site.",
      "Sixteen people were arrested following the altercation, which was partially captured on video, drawing widespread social media attention and curiosity.",
      "At a court conference Monday, six defendants pleaded guilty to lesser charges and agreed to an order of protection that prohibits them from making \u201calterations, excavations or demolitions to the synagogue\u201d for three years. Six others have previously pleaded guilty to reduced charges.",
      "\u201cThis is a blemish on the Chabad movement as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Judge Adam Perlmutter told the men, scolding them for not consulting with synagogue leadership about the expansion plan. \u201cThey built buildings all over the world. It involves raising money, hiring architects, getting building permits and any rezoning as necessary. It is the only way that it gets done in this town.\u201d",
      "Four of the defendants \u2014 Yaakov Rothchild, Yisroel Binyamin, Yerachmiel Blumenfeld and Menachem Maidanchik \u2014 declined the plea deal offered by the Brooklyn District Attorney\u2019s Office. They are scheduled to face trial on April 28 on a felony charge that carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years.",
      "Jonathan Strauss, an attorney for Blumenfeld, called the charges an \u201coutrage\" and described his client as a participant in a \u201ccivil dispute that\u2019s been going on for many, many years.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a 20-year-old kid,\u201d Strauss said. \u201cKids don\u2019t decide on their own to take the actions he did without being told to do so by much older and wiser people of authority.\u201d",
      "Proponents of the tunnel said they were carrying out the wishes of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the longtime leader of the Chabad movement and one of Judaism\u2019s most influential figures, who spoke of expanding the densely packed religious space before his death in 1994. Some members of the Chabad community believe Schneerson is still alive and that he is the messiah.",
      "The messianic view has long been rejected by Chabad\u2019s administrators, who characterized the illicit passageway as a rogue act of youth vandalism.",
      "\u201cThere is no righteous justification, theological or otherwise, for their lawless and violent behavior,\" said Rabbi Motti Seligson, a spokesman for the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. \u201cWe pray that they actually heed the Rebbe\u2019s teachings of highest ethics and see the grave error of their ways, and make moral and religious amends for the immense pain and damage they\u2019ve wrought.\u201d",
      "Stretching 60 feet (18.3 meters) long and 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide, the tunnel connected multiple buildings in the Jewish complex through holes cut in basement walls.",
      "An investigation by the Department of Buildings found the excavation had destabilized multiple nearby buildings, prompting vacate orders. The tunnel has since been filled with cement."

      "CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y. -- A high-ranking member of an MS-13 clique in New York pleaded guilty Tuesday to racketeering and other federal charges in a case involving seven slayings, including the 2016 killings of two high school girls that focused the nation\u2019s attention on the violent Central American street gang.",
      "Jairo Saenz, 28, entered the plea in federal court in Central Islip in a hearing attended by members of his family and some of the victims\u2019 families.",
      "\u201cI did these things and I knew they were wrong,\u201d he said in Spanish through a translator after his lawyer read his accounting of the killings in suburban Long Island, just east of New York City.",
      "Saenz, who is originally from El Salvador, will be sentenced June 13 and faces 40 to 60 years in prison as part of the plea deal approved by the judge.",
      "Prosecutors have said he was the second-in-commend in a gang clique operating in Brentwood and Central Islip known as Sailors Locos Salvatruchas Westside. His brother, Alexi Saenz, the clique\u2019s leader, previously pleaded guilty to similar charges and will be sentenced later this month.",
      "The brothers have admitted they ordered or approved the killings of rivals and others who disrespected or feuded with the clique in order to move up in the MS-13 hierarchy and bolster their group's reputation.",
      "Saenz\u2019s family and lawyers didn\u2019t comment outside court, but the parents of two of the victims said they wished he had been given a life sentence.",
      "\u201cIt was some justice, but not what I wanted,\u201d said George Johnson, the father of 29-year-old Michael Johnson, who was bludgeoned and stabbed to death in Brentwood in 2016. \u201cAt least he\u2019s not out in the street to hurt anybody else.\u201d",
      "Elizabeth Alvarado lamented that her daughter, Nisa Mickens, was just a day shy of her 16th birthday when she met a similar fate in September 2016.",
      "\u201cThat really hurt because she had so many dreams,\u201d her mother said outside the courthouse. \u201cShe wanted to be a veterinarian. She wanted to be a nurse like me and her dad. There\u2019s just so many things that I\u2019m missing out on.\u201d",
      "Mickens and Kayla Cuevas, 16, had been lifelong friends and classmates at Brentwood High School when they were killed with a machete and a baseball bat by a group of young men and teenage boys who had stalked them in a car.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Carolyn Pokorny said in a statement that Saenz took part in \u201cbarbaric, and multiple acts of senseless gang violence that had turned parts of Long Island into a war zone\u201d with MS-13 gang members \u201cwielding guns, machetes, bats and fire\u201d in their reign of terror.",
      "\u201cIt is my sincere hope that today\u2019s guilty plea brings some measure of solace and closure to the families of the defendant\u2019s victims who continue to mourn the deaths of their loved ones,\u201d she added.",
      "President Donald Trump, then in his first term in office, called for the death penalty for Saenz and others arrested in the killings and blamed the violence and gang growth on lax immigration policies as he made several visits to Long Island.",
      "Other victims in the case included Javier Castillo, a 15-year-old whom prosecutors say gang members befriended before driving him to a secluded park and attacking him with machetes.",
      "Another victim, Oscar Acosta, 19, was discovered dead in a wooded area near some railroad tracks five months after leaving home to play soccer.",
      "Older victims included Esteban Alvarado-Bonilla, 29, who was killed by a gunman inside a Central Islip deli in early 2017 and Dewann Stacks, 34, who was ambushed and beaten to death as he walked along a road in Brentwood.",
      "Saenz also pleaded guilty Tuesday to his participation in three attempted killings; arson; narcotics trafficking; firearms offenses; and a conspiracy to kill Marcus Bohannon, who was slain by other MS-13 members in 2016."

      "Flush with her $1.25 winnings at the bingo tables, Sharon Tanner retired to a room off the dining hall to discuss the top worry for the residents council at her senior living community: what to do about people leaving their laundry in the washing machines and dryers.",
      "Dinner service at the Terraces at Park Marino in Pasadena, California, was about half over, and residents were gathering in the lobby for the night\u2019s movie feature: \u201cScent of a Woman.\" Tanner and Carlene Sutherland, the council vice president and secretary, were discussing the laundry scofflaws when something caught their attention.",
      "\u201cI smell smoke,\u201d Tanner said.",
      "\u201cSo do I,\u201d remarked Sutherland.",
      "High above in the surrounding hills, a fire was burning. But staff had decided they were in no immediate danger, and the women figured they were smelling a distant fire.",
      "Then they heard a commotion in the lobby.",
      "The space was filling up with people, many of them agitated. Outside, the wind was howling. Then the power went out.",
      "Tanner was looking out a picture window toward the backyard, where she sometimes takes meals, when embers began falling from the sky \u201clike hail.\u201d She sat amazed as first the bushes, then a wooden fence burst into flames.",
      "Within an hour, the Terraces' staff and residents would be in a race for their lives, walking, rolling and stumbling out into a hellscape of swirling coals in what one person called a \u201churricane with flames.\u201d",
      "Four of 15 residents in the Safe Haven wing were in hospice care. As Yesenia Cervantes, director of the memory care unit, scrambled to get people prepared to evacuate, a dark thought began gnawing at her.",
      "Oh, my God, she thought. Will we have to decide which people we can save, and which to leave behind?",
      "The wildfires that have ravaged the Los Angeles area since Jan. 7 have claimed at least two dozen lives and destroyed thousands of structures. AccuWeather, a company that provides data on weather and its impact, puts the damage and economic losses at $250 billion to $275 billion.",
      "About 150,000 people in Los Angeles County remain under evacuation orders.",
      "Around 850 patients and residents of nursing homes, assisted living facilities and group homes were evacuated after the blazes last week, according to the California Department of Public Health.",
      "Among them are the people who called the Terraces home.",
      "A three-story wood and stucco building partially covered with ivy, the Terraces nestled in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. The 95 residents \u2014 ranging in age from 60 to 102 \u2014 were divided between assisted living and memory care.",
      "Jan. 7 started out just like any other Tuesday. Breakfast was served from 7-9 a.m. Then at 9:45, it was time for \u201cStay Fit\u201d \u2014 what they call their chair exercises.",
      "Walking Club is usually at 10:15, but the staff decided it was too windy for the residents \u2014 many of whom, like Tanner, use a walker. After lunch, it was \u201cTech Hour,\u201d where staffers helped residents with their devices, and dinner started at 4. Residents had a choice between orange chicken with rice and broccoli, or a cold shrimp salad.",

      "The 83-year-old widow and her neighbor, a 70-year-old man named Eddie, were inseparable, and also \u201ckind of night owls\" and wanted something to do after dinner, said Sam Baum, the community relations director. Soon, other residents began joining them, and \u201cMovie Night\u201d was born.",
      "Not long into the film, a visiting nurse came by and told staff there was a fire in the hills above. Baum decided to jump in his car and head up for a closer look.",
      "It was part of the Eaton fire, which began earlier that day and, fanned by vicious Santa Ana Winds, would eventually grow and all but obliterate the nearby community of Altadena. But when Baum stopped his car and took a look around, he didn\u2019t see cause for alarm. There were lots of firefighters on the scene, and the blaze would have to jump a major thoroughfare and a canyon stream to get to the Terraces.",
      "So, when he got back, he told his colleagues, \u201cI think we\u2019re OK.\u201d",
      "Neither local nor state officials had suggested that the Terraces evacuate, says Terraces CEO Adam Khalifa.",
      "Just the same, staff decided to begin bringing the 93 residents (two others were already in other facilities when the fire broke out) down to the lobby.",
      "They started methodically draping lanyards around each neck with badges containing the resident's photo, name and apartment number; on the back were medical details: any conditions, cognitive deficits and \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d orders.",
      "Off-duty staffers began showing up to volunteer. They started calling families to let them know what was happening, and some came and picked up their loved ones.",
      "Suddenly, the lights went out. It was around 6:40 p.m.",
      "Cervantes was on the phone with hospice to get some help evacuating those residents when the power went out. That\u2019s when she saw the backyard catch fire. She and another employee grabbed a fire extinguisher and ran outside, trailed closely by Cervantes' Pomeranian-Yorkie mix WALL-E, and put out the blaze.",
      "Smoke began filling the lobby. Residents donned protective masks.",
      "By 7:45 p.m., the backyard had reignited. Cervantes decided it was time to clear Safe Haven. Around the same time they got an evacuation order.",
      "Some residents were still in bed. One woman who\u2019d had a seizure earlier that day was too weak to rise; Cervantes lifted her up and put her in a wheelchair.",
      "Other staff made multiple forays to the upper floors, carrying residents down strapped in emergency stair chairs, in wheelchairs, even on their backs. The dining room had caught fire, and Cervantes finally rushed out.",
      "When they got outside, it was bedlam. Workers from the Pasadena Park Healthcare & Wellness Center, a skilled-nursing facility next door, were wheeling their residents across the road in chairs and on beds. First responders were shouting and gesturing.",
      "\u201cGo straight,\u201d they yelled, pointing down the street into the murk. \u201cGo to 7-Eleven.\u201d Cervantes made multiple trips back and forth to the 7-Eleven, WALL-E following her every move.",
      "Tanner, 72, was struggling when a man with dark hair appeared out of the smoke and told her sit on the bench of her walker.",
      "\u201cHold your feet up,\u201d the stranger said as she faced back toward to the Terraces. \u201cBe careful.\u201d",
      "He towed her across the road \u201clike a bat out of hell,\u201d made sure she was OK, then disappeared into the haze in search of someone else to help.",
      "Terraces executive director Maria Quizon was pushing a woman in a wheelchair when she noticed a man sitting on a sidewalk bench. He was confused, probably in shock, and she begged him to follow her. The winds were so fierce that Quizon was forced to zig and zag, like a sailboat tacking in a gale, the man close in her wake.",
      "The Terraces is set about 200 feet back from the street. Then it was another 800 feet to the 7-Eleven.",
      "It was \u201cthe longest, scariest\u201d walk of Quizon\u2019s life.",
      "When the nursing home next door had finished evacuating its 93 residents, staff pitched in with the Terraces folks.",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter who it was,\u201d Pasadena Park vice president of operations Rhea Bartolome said to herself. \u201cNobody\u2019s dying.\u201d",
      "When residents and staff reached the convenience store parking lot, transport vehicles were already waiting. Tanner and two other residents were loaded into an ambulance and whisked away. Other residents were packed into buses and whisked away to the Pasadena Convention Center 5 miles away.",
      "When he was sure everyone had gotten away, Baum drove to his condominium about eight minutes away from the Terraces to retrieve the ashes of his late wife Patrice, medications, some shoeboxes full of photos and his two cats.",
      "Then he headed to the convention center to rejoin his staff and charges.",
      "At 10:25 p.m. that night, Miller called her son, who was also under an evacuation order, to make sure he didn't worry about her. The call went to voicemail. \u201cWe are in some giant facility in Pasadena,\u201d his mother said in a sweet, even tone. \u201d She had no idea where that was _\u201cIt\u2019s like a football field with a linoleum floor and lots and lots of people.\"",
      "After Miller and the other refugees were situated with cots, water and food, the Terraces staff went to work finding each of their residents a place to stay \u2014 be it a home, a hospital or another senior living facility. They found two facilities that would take 20 residents each.",
      "They made sure Miller and Eddie were kept together.",
      "When the smoke cleared, all that remained of their former home was a charred, water-stained shell, some of the black metal letters spelling out \u201cthe Terraces at Park Marino\u201d still intact over the front door.",
      "Miller lost all her treasures, including the precious papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sculptures her mother made \u2014 everything but her wallet, cellphone and the clothes on her back.",
      "Her son, James Dyer, had nothing but praise and admiration for the Terraces staff.",
      "\u201cIt was like a hurricane with flames,\u201d he says of the disaster. \u201cAnd they did amazing work for the very short notice that they had.\"",
      "The Terraces staff set up a makeshift \u201ccommand center\u201d in the lobby of a hotel just a few miles away to continue advocating for their residents and employees. Baum has vowed that his \u201csecond home\u201d will be rebuilt, and that they will al be together again.",
      "Tanner \u2014 a former waitress who\u2019d worked at Denny\u2019s, Frisch\u2019s Big Boy and too many other restaurants to count \u2014 had only been at the Terraces for 10 months. She loved the place so much that she was already a \u201cresident ambassador.\u201d",
      "For now, she\u2019s staying with her sister and brother-in-law in San Jose. But she can\u2019t wait to see all of her friends again.",
      "\u201cWherever I go is going to be just temporary,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause as soon as it\u2019s built, I\u2019m back to the Terraces. That was my home, and that\u2019s where I want to live.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A judge says the New Orleans Police Department can begin the process of ending longstanding federal oversight",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans Police Department can begin ending its longstanding federal oversight, a judge ruled Tuesday in response to a request from the city and the Justice Department to wind down the monitoring program.",
      "The police department has transformed itself into a more transparent and accountable agency, even though work remains to be done over the next two years while the program concludes, U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan said during a hearing.",
      "\u201cThe court is tremendously proud of the achievements the NOPD has made,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cThe hard work of the civilian and sworn members of the NOPD paid off. The NOPD is a far different agency from the one that spawned the DOJ investigation in 2011.\u201d",
      "The city revived a long-dormant motion late Friday asking to end federal oversight immediately, but Morgan rejected it, describing it as unnecessary \u201cpolitical gamesmanship\" which \u201cdiminishes the credibility of the top leadership of the city.\u201d",
      "Morgan denied another request from the city to bring on counsel from the office of the state's Republican attorney general, Liz Murrill, who has criticized federal oversight for costing too much money. Murrill said in a statement that she would appeal the judge's orders in an effort to end oversight sooner.",
      "City Council President J.P. Morrell, standing beside city mayoral candidate and councilmember Helena Moreno, blasted Cantrell's attempt to end oversight immediately, calling it \u201cdastardly\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d They said they were not consulted beforehand and pressed for the city to fully finish the reform process.",
      "\u201cThe city cannot have it both ways,\u201d said Morgan, noting the city had already acknowledged that it had not yet fulfilled all the requirements needed to end federal oversight.",
      "Instead, the judge said she was sticking to the joint motion filed by the city and Justice Department in September last year that requested she grant a two-year \u201csustainment period\u201d to allow time for the NOPD to fix outstanding problems and demonstrate that existing reforms remained in place.",
      "In a Monday press release, Mayor LaToya Cantrell praised the police department for its progress but criticized Morgan for not ending the oversight sooner, claiming the reform goals \u201cwere achieved years ago.\u201d",
      "In 2013, the city agreed to what it called \u201cthe nation\u2019s most expansive\u201d federal oversight plan after a U.S. Justice Department investigation found evidence of racial bias, misconduct and a culture of impunity. The department had long engaged in mistreatment of the city\u2019s Black community and been plagued by high-profile scandals, including a 1994 murder ordered by a corrupt officer and an attempt to cover-up police killings of unarmed civilians in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.",
      "Although critics say the police department hasn't done enough to change and restore the public's trust, Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told Morgan during a Monday court hearing that the NOPD has established a \u201cnew culture.\u201d",
      "In the years since oversight started, the department has created a framework of audits and data analysis, increased transparency by revising and publishing online training materials and policies, bolstered disciplinary processes, and enhanced efforts to cut down on longtime issues such as payroll fraud, police officials said.",
      "Kirkpatrick told reporters that the judge\u2019s ruling was the culmination of 12 years of hard work by her department.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge milestone for the city, I\u2019m excited about it,\u201d she said. \u201cNOPD \u2014 this police department \u2014 is truly a world class police department in a world class city and I\u2019m just so proud.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s important during this two-year period, we stay the course,\u201d Kirkpatrick added. \u201cThere will be no pulling back, it\u2019s just going forward.\u201d",
      "Jonas Geissler, a Justice Department attorney, told Morgan on Monday that more improvements are needed before the city can fully exit federal oversight. The Justice Department will continue to review audits, policies and data throughout the sustainment period, he said.",
      "During a public comment period, community watchdogs raised a host of concerns \u2014 many tied directly to original mandates from the 2013 reform pact the city had promised the Justice Department it would implement. Police officials told the judge they are now trying to address some of the most pressing.",
      "\u201cOne underlying message was clear: The work is not done and we need the community to recognize that and to continue engaging,\u201d Stella Cziment, who heads the city\u2019s Office of the Independent Police Monitor, told The Associated Press. \u201cBecause it can\u2019t be done without them.\u201d",
      "An initiative to establish community advisory boards to meet with and provide recommendations to the police has by almost all accounts languished, though the city appointed a full-time staffer in December to try and revive these groups in the coming months.",
      "Detectives still struggle to handle high sex crime caseloads, leading to far fewer getting solved than the national average. In the past three weeks, NOPD officials say they assigned eight more detectives to work on these cases, bringing the total number of officers from 17 to 25. Julie Ford, an advocate for improving police response to sex crimes, said the NOPD \u201ccontinues to struggle with the effectiveness of their investigations into sexual assault cases\u201d and will benefit from ongoing federal monitoring and support.",
      "And in a city that's just over 50% Black, nearly 90% of police uses of force targeted Black people last year, the city\u2019s Office of the Independent Police Monitor reported. A court-appointed federal monitors reviewed the NOPD's use of force and concluded there was no evidence of bias based on Justice Department analysis. The NOPD also plans to hire Sigma Squared, a consulting firm co-founded by Harvard University economist Roland Fryer, to improve its analysis of potential bias in its policing.",
      "Fryer said in an email to the AP that his company \u201chas created the only software in the world that can distinguish between disparity and bias and help departments generally do more data-responsive policing.\u201d",
      "Police officials have said that contracting Fryer is an example of the department going above and beyond the requirements of federal oversight.",
      "Marvin Arnold, an organizer with the police watchdog group Eye on Surveillance, had long drawn attention to alleged conflicts of interest among federal monitors overseeing the NOPD, prompting dozens of concerned public comments submitted to the judge. Arnold said he felt Morgan did not substantively engage with these concerns, which \u201creinforces the idea that the public comment was a dog and pony show.\u201d The monitors have denied any conflicts of interest.",
      "Belden \u201cNoonie Man\u201d Batiste, who chairs the civic advocacy group New Orleans United Front and attended most of the public hearings, protested in front of the court as recently as Monday to oppose ending federal oversight.",
      "Batiste said he appreciated that the judge directly addressed the broad array of concerns he and others had shared with her. And he noted that with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has sought to curtail federal oversight of police departments, he believed it was a smart move to lock the city's police into another two years of monitoring and reforms during the sustainment period.",
      "\u201cSometimes you can have a debate, and you can walk away either with nothing or a little something,\" Batiste said. \"Going to sustainment, that\u2019s something.\u201d",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin's Democratic governor on Tuesday created a new office dedicated to preventing gun violence, a month after a school shooting not far from the state Capitol.",
      "Gov. Tony Evers also called on the Republican-controlled Legislature to pass a series of gun control and public safety measures, saying reducing violence should be a \u201cshared priority that transcends politics.\u201d",
      "The Legislature has already rejected numerous gun control measures put forward by Evers, including universal background checks for gun purchases. But Evers said the shooting at Abundant Life Christian School last month demonstrated the need for lawmakers to act.",
      "\u201cReducing crime and violence should be an issue that receives earnest bipartisan support,\u201d Evers said at a news conference surrounded by gun control advocates, Democratic lawmakers and the mayor and police chief of Madison who responded to last month's school shooting.",
      "Evers signed an executive order creating a statewide office of violence prevention. He said the office will work with local partners including law enforcement agencies, nonprofits, school districts and gun shop owners with the goal of reducing gun violence.",
      "The office will also work to develop public education campaigns and promote safer communities, Evers said. It will also award grants targeting a reduction in violence, in particular gun violence, to school districts, firearm dealers, law enforcement agencies, nonprofits and government agencies.",
      "Evers announced $10 million in federal funding for the office. He said his state budget that will be submitted to the Legislature next month will request more state funding to continue the office over the next two years.",
      "Evers also said he would be proposing a sweeping package of gun violence and public safety measures.",
      "Republican majorities in the Legislature shrunk after the November election, leading Evers and Democrats to say they hoped for more bipartisanship and consideration of ideas that have been summarily rejected in the past. But following the Dec. 16 shooting at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison that left a student, teacher and the 15-year-old shooter dead, Republicans have not voiced support for any gun control measures backed by Democrats.",
      "Wisconsin polls have repeatedly shown high public support for a variety of gun control measures.",
      "Evers in 2019 called a special session of the Legislature to pass a universal gun background check bill and a \u201cred flag\u201d proposal that would allow judges to take guns away from people determined to be a risk to themselves or others. Republicans immediately adjourned without debating the measures. It was the first of a dozen special sessions Evers has called since 2019, none of which have been successful.",
      "Democrats have reintroduced those and more than two dozen other gun safety bills over the past six years, but Republicans have repeatedly refused to take them up. Republicans, instead, have introduced bills that would expand access to guns and discussed arming teachers. Evers in 2022 vetoed Republican bills that would have allowed holders of concealed carry permits to have firearms in vehicles on school grounds and in churches located on the grounds of a private school."

      "Kemp promised the chamber in 2023 that he would limit lawsuits and large jury verdicts, an effort many call \u201ctort reform.\u201d Supporters say Georgia has a permissive legal system that lets people unfairly sue businesses, medical practitioners and property owners for damages, driving away insurance companies and raising insurance rates.",
      "Normally, Kemp might have rolled out his plan in the first few days of the session, which began this week, but the politics of limiting lawsuits cuts across normal party lines. Opposition comes from Democrats and Republican trial lawyers. Kemp signed a law in 2024 to gather data on lawsuit costs as he considered an array of approaches to reform.",
      "\u201cThis is not a partisan issue,\u201d Kemp said Tuesday. \u201cNo matter your party, your district, your zip code, or your background, this issue impacts us all.\u201d",
      "Several Republican leaders, including House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch of Dahlonega, have said they would make lawsuit reform a top priority in their chambers.",
      "Opponents to lawsuit reform say changes would limit the rights of Georgians to seek compensation for wrongdoing on the part of businesses, doctors and others. They also say there is no evidence that the state\u2019s legal landscape is causing higher insurance rates.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 09:46:23 -0500",
    "summary": "As fires burn in Los Angeles, water utilities are responding to extensive damage to pipes and storage and treatment facilities",

      "As fires burn in Los Angeles, water utilities are responding to extensive damage to pipes and storage and treatment facilities",
      "As fires continue to burn across Los Angeles, several utilities have declared their drinking water unsafe until extensive testing can prove otherwise.",
      "A warmer, drier climate means wildfires are getting worse, and encroaching on cities \u2014 with devastating impact. Toxic chemicals from those burns can get into damaged drinking water systems, and even filtering or boiling won\u2019t help, experts say.",
      "Last week, Pasadena Water and Power issued a \u201cDo Not Drink\u201d notice to about a third of its customers for the first time since it began distributing water more than a century ago. With at least one burned pump, several damaged storage tanks, and burned homes, they knew there was a chance toxic chemicals had entered their pipes.",
      "\u201cOut of the abundance of caution, you kind of have to assume the worst,\" said Stacie Takeguchi, chief assistant general manager for the utility.",
      "This week, they lifted the notice for most of the area after testing.",
      "When large fires burn in towns and cities, rather than forests and grasslands, infrastructure can be heavily damaged. When drinking water systems are damaged in a fire, \u201cwe can have ash, smoke, soot, other debris and gases get sucked into the water piping network,\u201d said Andrew Whelton, a Purdue University engineering professor who researches water contamination in communities hit by fire.",
      "Those elements can be particularly toxic because chemically engineered synthetics in building materials and households are heating, burning and releasing particles and gases, he said. Some of those chemicals are harmful even at low concentrations, experts say.",
      "Drinking water systems are designed to be airtight to keep harmful elements out. But that critical pressure can be lost in many ways during a fire, which means toxins can get in.",
      "There's normal demand on the water system from people who didn't need to evacuate. Firefighters use a lot of water. Pipes in burned buildings can be damaged, spewing water.",
      "Power loss can also cause pressure loss when pumps stop working, said Greg Pierce, professor of urban environmental policy at the University of California. This happened during the 2023 Maui fires.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard, if not impossible, to keep up the power supply to the whole water system in the event of a fire, because you\u2019re either shutting off the power, because power can contribute to the fire, or it just goes out,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019re relying on generators at best in spots.\u201d",
      "The loss of pressure can affect not only water quality but also water availability for firefighting. Hydrants ran dry in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood as surrounding homes burned. The utility says it was from high demand and the pumps were working, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will investigate.",
      "Toxic chemicals in drinking water after a fire pose risks ranging from temporary nausea to cancer, experts say.",
      "\u201cIn Paradise (California), there were benzene levels high enough to acutely give a child a blood disorder\" said Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, referring to the 2018 Camp Fire that burned most of the city.",
      "Even very low levels of some chemicals can be a concern. In California, state regulators say only one part per billion of benzene \u2014 a known carcinogen \u2014 is considered a safe level in drinking water, calculating for 70 years of exposure. The national recommendation is no more than five parts per billion.",
      "\u201cIn terms of cancer risk, what we\u2019re really interested in is the cumulative amount that you\u2019re exposed to over your entire lifetime,\" Goldman said. \u201cAnd if a short-term exposure adds a lot to that, that is a real risk.\u201d",
      "Benzene and similar compounds are known as volatile because they tend to become airborne, like gasoline that turns to vapor when it drips from the pump onto your car. A group of heavier compounds, called semi-volatile, were found in water pipes in Louisville, Colorado after the 2021 Marshall Fire, even when benzene and other better-known chemicals weren't. Whelton says it's critical to test for both.",
      "Vast Los Angeles County has more than 200 water service providers, but so far only a handful believe that damage or loss of pressure may have resulted in chemical contamination and have issued \u201cDo Not Drink\u201d notices. Utilities are focused on ensuring there's enough water for fighting fires, though some are beginning to test for contaminants. It can take weeks to months of testing before water can be declared safe for drinking in areas with minimal damage.",
      "That is sometimes a best-case scenario.",
      "In the Paradise Fire, most buildings burned. The city rebuilt a reservoir and is working to replace 10,000 service lines. It expects to spend the next decade and $50 million to replace roughly 17 of 172 miles of main lines that were contaminated.",
      "Whelton doesn't recommend people pay for expensive water testing in their homes until their utility has declared the public water system safe.",
      "Many publicly available water quality tests are \u201cnot capable of finding fire-related drinking water contamination,\u201d Whelton wrote on X this week. Getting your water professionally tested once the utility's water is declared safe would be the best way to learn whether your pipes are contaminated, he said.",
      "People should follow guidance issued by their utility or local health department on safety precautions until their water is declared safe.",

      "A rare glimpse into mobster Al Capone\u2019s home life will be on display in a new exhibit at the Mob Museum in downtown Las Vegas",
      "LAS VEGAS -- It was on a school playground where she learned her last name carries weight, when another girl pointed a finger at her and ordered the other kids to follow her.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d the girl said. \u201cThat\u2019s a Capone.\u201d",
      "Diane Capone Pette is the granddaughter of Al Capone, one of the most infamous mobsters in American history who was nicknamed \u201cScarface\u201d for a slash he got in a fight. His legacy in the public eye is marked by violence, prison time and crime. His reign starting in the 1920s over the Chicago Outfit has inspired dozens of shows and movies, including the 1983 film \u201cScarface\u201d starring Al Pacino.",
      "At home, Pette said Capone led a very different life.",
      "\u201cHe was not one-dimensional. He was a man of many facets,\u201d Pette told The Associated Press. \u201cHe seemed to have the capacity to be quite ruthless and aggressive,\u201d and on the other hand, she said, \u201cthis was also a man who was incredibly loving and loyal to family and friends.\u201d",
      "A rare glimpse into that part of Capone\u2019s life will be on display for the public in a new exhibit, \u201cThe First Public Enemy,\u201d opening Wednesday at the Mob Museum in downtown Las Vegas. For the first time, the public can get an up-close look at Capone\u2019s favorite personal weapon and a short home movie shot by the mob boss himself in 1929.",
      "After Capone\u2019s death in 1947 of natural causes, his belongings stayed in the family for decades. First with his wife and son, and then after their deaths, with his four granddaughters. Two including Pette are still alive.",
      "Pette, 81, and her sisters auctioned some of their grandfather\u2019s belongings a few years ago, afraid they might lose them to the wildfires common in California where they now live, or that the items would be lost or forgotten after their own deaths.",
      "One of their most treasured hand-me-downs was Capone\u2019s favorite weapon, a Colt 1911 .45-caliber pistol that was popular during World War I.",
      "\u201cHe called her \u2014 we refer to it as a her \u2014 his sweetheart,\u201d Pette said.",
      "In family lore, the pistol has taken on its own identity as a faithful companion to Capone, credited with saving the mobster more than once.",
      "\u201cShe saved him, and so she was very special to him and so very special to us,\u201d Pette said.",
      "Geoff Shumacher, historian and vice president of exhibits and programs at the museum, said the artifacts from the Capone family collection are one of a kind. Most of the items already sold by the family at auction went to personal collectors, he said, adding, \u201cthis a slice of life that you can get nowhere else except at the museum.\u201d",
      "In 1929, a few years before Capone was convicted of federal tax evasion and sent to prison for seven years, he filmed a short home movie at his Miami waterfront mansion.",
      "Capone is behind the camera and never appears in the black-and-white silent film, but it showcases a day with friends by the pool and on a boat. Two of those friends are fellow mobsters Lucky Luciano and Frank Costello.",
      "The Mob Museum has the only physical copy of the 12-minute and 20-second home movie, which was captured on 16mm film. A shorter version of the film will play at the museum.",
      "In it, Luciano is on the high dive above the pool with a towel around his neck while Costello sits poolside, watching people take turns jumping into the water. Later, they get on a boat, and Capone's footage captures Luciano and Costello sitting together, smiling.",
      "After Capone was released from prison in 1939, he retired from mob life and spent his final years in the Miami mansion.",
      "Pette was 3 when her grandfather died, but some of her earliest memories are with her \u201cPapa.\" Their January birthdays were days apart, and she can remember sitting on his lap while blowing out the candles together on their cake.",
      "Her last and most vivid memory of him was just before his death. Capone was sick and in bed, and Pette\u2019s father \u2014 Capone\u2019s only son \u2014 placed her on the bed to say goodbye.",
      "Pette kissed the mobster\u2019s cheek. Capone said, \u201cI love you, baby girl.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd that was the last thing he said to me,\u201d Pette said.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Additional water tankers and scores of firefighters have arrived at the Los Angeles area ahead of fierce winds that were forecast to return and threaten the progress made so far on two massive infernos that have destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 24 people.",
      "On Monday, planes doused homes and hillsides with bright pink fire-retardant chemicals, while crews and fire engines were being placed near particularly vulnerable spots with dry brush. Dozens of water trucks rolled in to replenish supplies after hydrants ran dry last week when the two largest fires erupted.",
      "Tabitha Trosen and her boyfriend said she feels like they are \u201cteetering\u201d on the edge with the constant fear that their neighborhood could be the next under threat.",
      "\u201cOur cats are ready to go, we have their carriers by the door prepped with their little stuffed animals and things like that,\u201d Trosen said, adding that she's packed things as she thinks about what she could lose. \u201cIt\u2019s like, how do I take care of myself, and what are the things that will ground me as a human and remind me of my background and my life and my family.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and other officials \u2014 who have faced criticism over their initial response to fires that began last week \u2014 expressed confidence Monday that the region was ready to face the new threat with additional firefighters brought in from around the U.S., as well as Canada and Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely better prepared,\u201d LA County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said when asked what will be different from a week ago, when hurricane-force winds propelled multiple fires across the parched, brush-filled region that hasn\u2019t seen rain in more than eight months.",
      "There have been more than a dozen wildfires in Southern California since Jan. 1, mostly in the greater Los Angeles area. The latest started late Monday in a dry riverbed in Oxnard, about 55 miles (about 89 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles, and was burning in an agricultural area.",
      "The winds are predicted to pick up starting early Tuesday and continue through midday Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. They are not expected to reach hurricane-force like last week, but they could ground firefighting aircraft, Marrone said, warning if winds reach 70 mph (112 kph), \u201cit\u2019s going to be very difficult to contain that fire.\"",
      "Fire officials advised residents in high-risk areas to just leave home \u2013 and not wait for formal evacuation orders -- if they sense danger.",
      "That\u2019s exactly what Tim Kang of La Crescenta did last Wednesday. Feeling sick from the smoky air and fearful of nearby fires spreading, Kang and his brothers packed up and have stayed away from their neighborhood.",
      "\u201cEverything just felt like, \u2018Oh man, the world\u2019s ending,\u2019\u201d said Kang, who's staying with his girlfriend in Pasadena.",
      "In less than a week, four fires around the nation\u2019s second-biggest city have scorched more than 62 square miles (160 square kilometers), roughly three times the size of Manhattan.",
      "The National Weather Service warned the weather will be \u201cparticularly dangerous\u201d on Tuesday, when wind gusts could reach 65 mph (105 kph). A large part of Southern California around Los Angeles is under this extreme fire danger warning through Wednesday, including densely populated Thousand Oaks, Northridge and Simi Valley.",
      "The Eaton Fire near Pasadena is roughly one-third contained, while the largest blaze in Pacific Palisades on the coast is far less contained.",
      "The death toll is likely to rise, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Monday. At least two dozen were missing, he said.",
      "Luna said he understands that people are eager to return to their homes and neighborhoods to survey the damage, but he asked for their patience. \"We have people literally looking for the remains of your neighbors,\u201d he said.",
      "At a Monday evening community meeting about the Palisades Fire, a Los Angeles Police Department official said many people reported as missing had been found. It wasn\u2019t clear if there was overlap in the numbers shared by the sheriff.",
      "The slower winds over the weekend allowed some people to return to previously evacuated areas. Many had no idea if their homes or neighborhoods were still standing.",
      "Jim Orlandini, who lost his hardware store in Altadena, a hard-hit neighborhood next to Pasadena, said his home of 40 years survived.",
      "\u201cThe whole time I was thinking, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to find when I get back here and after 40 years, you know, you got a lot of stuff you forget about that would disappear if the house burned down. So we\u2019re thankful that it didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "LA city Fire Chief Kristin Crowley urged people to stay away from burned neighborhoods filled with broken gas lines and unstable buildings.",
      "Just under 100,000 in Los Angeles County remained under evacuation orders, half the number from last week.",
      "Firefighters over the weekend fought flames in Mandeville Canyon \u2014 home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities \u2014 after the Palisades Fire spread, prompting new evacuation orders.

Other stars \u2014 and ordinary people \u2014 have left large donations of clothing and other items along street corners in around the city.",
      "Dozens of people have been arrested for looting after the wildfires. Officials are now starting to see price gouging and scams, including with hotels and short-term rentals and medical supplies, said Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman.",
      "The fires that began Tuesday north of downtown LA have burned more than 12,000 homes, cars and other structures.",

    "summary": "The state with the highest per capita number of people on probation is trying to lower that number",
    "story": [
      "The state with the highest per capita number of people on probation is trying to lower that number",
      "ATLANTA -- For three years, Jamariel Hobbs was confined to Georgia, unable to travel freely or move where he wanted to. At the beginning, a probation officer showed up at random times of night to test him for drugs.",
      "The soft-spoken Hobbs, now 29, was among almost 176,000 Georgia residents on probation, the largest per capita population in the United States. Then he got lucky. Because of a new law, the court slashed what was supposed to be nine years of probation to three.",
      "He was free.",
      "\u201cProbation feels like a leash,\u201d he said. \u201cI have my future back.\u201d",
      "People are often put on probation for low-level crimes such as drug possession or nonviolent theft. Georgia refuses to cap sentences the way many other jurisdictions do.",
      "The practice of long sentences persisted for years despite research suggesting that the likelihood of people reoffending drops after three years on probation. In short, longer probation may do little to improve public safety.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about folks who have often been through a lot of trauma and feel like they are constantly walking around with a weight on their shoulders, a cloud over their head, where the smallest little thing could completely derail all the work they\u2019ve put in,\u201d said Wade Askew of the Georgia Justice Project.",
      "People on probation also have to pay fees to help offset the cost of monitoring them, a particular burden for low-income people.",
      "Under state law, a lot more people like Hobbs could have been free. In 2017, Georgia lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill designed to reduce the number of people on probation by letting some off early. According to a study by the Urban Institute, the measure could have translated into roughly one-third of the men and women on felony probation being offered sentences with the opportunity for time off their probation after three years at most, providing they stayed out of trouble.",
      "Instead, just 213 sentences that included the possibility of an early end to probation actually finished ahead of schedule, according to Georgia\u2019s Department of Community Supervision.",
      "The Legislature\u2019s directive fell short for multiple reasons. Judges often failed to include possible early termination dates for probation when they should have and they turned down the Department of Community Supervision\u2019s requests to end probation early.",
      "In 2021, the Legislature passed a second law outlining stricter guidelines to make the process more automatic.",
      "To qualify for their freedom, people who are convicted of a felony for the first time have to pay off any restitution they owe and avoid being arrested for anything more serious than a routine traffic violation. They also have to have avoided their probation being revoked anytime within the previous two years. Judges or prosecutors can request a hearing if they oppose a case.",
      "And people who have been on probation for at least three years can seek an early end if they meet the criteria, even if they were originally sentenced to a longer period.",
      "Observers \u2013 including judges and lawyers \u2013 say the new law seems to be more effective than the original.",
      "By last January, Georgia\u2019s probationary population had fallen about 8% from 190,475 in 2021, according to the Department of Community Supervision, echoing nationwide trends.",
      "The department said it could not readily provide the number of people released from probation under the criteria set out in 2021. What is known, is that at least 26,523 sentences have ended early since the bill passed, though many of those terminations could have been granted for other reasons.",
      "\u201cIt has been a very successful, very big first step,\u201d Askew said.",
      "Some defense lawyers and advocates across the state say they still see eligible people on probation struggle to get probation officers to act. Others say they encounter judges and prosecutors less friendly to the changes.",
      "\u201cIf you want to get something done, you\u2019ve really got to hound them,\u201d said Devin Rafus, an Atlanta defense lawyer.",
      "Jamariel Hobbs had a friendly judge.",
      "The Emory University graduate\u2019s life seemed to be on track after he earned his degree in Japanese in 2019. He landed a sales job peddling auto parts across the South. Then, the pandemic took a toll on Hobbs\u2019 mental health. After intervening in a family argument in 2020, he was charged with aggravated assault, according to Hobbs and the indictment against him.",
      "He spent months couch surfing after his friends bailed him out of jail. He lost his job and his company car. In December 2021, he was sentenced to a year of incarceration and nine on probation, but was able to avoid jail time by enrolling in Georgia\u2019s Accountability Court Program for people with mental health and substance abuse problems. It was there that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed medication for it.",
      "He now works for a biopharmaceutical company and recently began serving as a peer outreach coordinator for people recovering from substance abuse or mental health issues.",
      "Hobbs said his probation officers didn\u2019t make it clear to him that his sentence included the possibility of early release from probation. So it felt surreal when he got a letter from Judge Layla Zon in December and was off probation days later.",
      "Now he hopes to move to North Carolina, where the cost of living is more affordable and he dreams of starting an organization to help people with health and wellness.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sitting here probation-free,\u201d Hobbs said, pausing to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing.\u201d",
      "Judge Zon agreed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really one of the better things that I get to do as a judge, to reward that person for what they\u2019ve accomplished and for doing what we\u2019ve asked them to do,\u201d she said.",

      "When the 2020 census results were released, they showed a boom in the number of people classified as multiracial in the United States since 2010. Two Princeton sociologists now say that jump was mostly an illusion.",
      "The 276% increase largely happened because of a change in how people were classified by the U.S. Census Bureau rather than strong shifts in racial or ethnic identity or major growth, according to a paper published last month by Paul Starr and Christina Pao. The Census Bureau for the first time provided space on the census form for people to write-in their families' origins, which guided how the statistical agency categorized them.",
      "People who were classified as being two or more races rose from 2.9% to 10.2% of the U.S. population from 2010 to 2020, and the increase was most noticeable among Hispanic people. The share of the white alone population dropped from 72.4% to 61.6%, provoking handwringing among some conservative commentators about what they called a loss of white power.",
      "The Princeton researchers argued that anyone who marked themselves as Black or as white on the 2020 census form but then wrote that they were of Latin American origin was reclassified by a computerized algorithm as multiracial even though they had marked themselves as a single race. The same multiracial reclassification appeared to have been made for people who self-identified as white only but then wrote that their origins were from an African country, according to the researchers.",
      "\u201cSo the 2020 census produced a sudden jump in the multiracial count and a precipitous decline in the count of the white population, contributing to an unwarranted panic among white conservatives about demographic change,\u201d Starr said in an email. \u201cThe procedure was misleading, and the public was misled about the extent of racial change.\u201d",
      "When the figures were released in mid-2021, Census Bureau officials said the new method was an improvement that did a better job of capturing the complexities of how people identify their race and ethnicity in the 21st century. At the same time, they acknowledged that some of the dramatic growth likely came from their changes.",
      "For the first time, empty spaces were left on the 2020 census form so that respondents could write in their \u201corigins,\u201d such as \u201cGerman\u201d or \u201cJamaican,\u201d when answering the race question. The detailed answers guided the Census Bureau in classifying the respondents and members of their households into race and ethnicity categories.",
      "\u201cThese improvements reveal that the U.S. population is much more multiracial and diverse than what we measured in the past,\u201d Census Bureau officials said at the time.",
      "The official numbers on multiracial people are important because they are used for redrawing political districts, civil rights enforcement, labor data, health statistics and distributing federal funding. As the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 run for the White House as the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee put multiracial identity in the spotlight.",
      "The Princeton researchers said the Census Bureau mistakenly mixed up ancestry with identity and national origin with race, and they believe the agency should abandon using \u201corigins\u201d to categorize people.",
      "The issue flew under the radar because of other distractions surrounding the 2020 census, such as the Trump administration's unsuccessful attempt to add a citizenship question, a controversial new data-privacy method and the COVID-19 pandemic, which threw the nation's head count off schedule. Black, Hispanic and American Indian residents on reservations were undercounted in the 2020 census.",
      "Researchers have been asking the Census Bureau since 2021 to rerun the 2020 data using 2010 methods so that an \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison of demographic changes can be made, but the agency hasn't done it yet, said historian Margo Anderson, who served on a National Academies panel that reviewed the quality of the census.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 2025 and people have been asking since 2021, \u2018What the hell did you do?\u2019\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThere is a lot of frustration there because we can't know.\u201d",
      "The Census Bureau has historically struggled to classify multiracial people, said Susan Graham, an advocate for multiracial representation in official statistics. Respondents weren\u2019t allowed to check more than one race until the 2000 census",
      "\u201cWas the 2020 Census subjected to a fictitious multiracial boom? Possibly,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAs always, answers only get more confusing when the federal government goes back and tries, one more time, to get it right.\u201d",
      "Race and ethnic categories used by the federal government are changing further to combine questions about race and ethnicity instead of asking about them separately. A Middle Eastern and North African category also is being added which will reduce the number of respondents identifying as white.",
      "Not all demographers think the Census Bureau's methodological change was that profound.",
      "\u201cI don't think it's that big of a deal for most people using the data,\u201d said William Frey, a demographer at The Brookings Institution. \u201cI think that the Census Bureau is trying hard to get this right.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 23:18:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green is proposing a range of new penalties to crack down on people who flout the state&rsquo;s fireworks laws",
    "story": [
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green is proposing a range of new penalties to crack down on people who flout the state\u2019s fireworks laws",
      "HONOLULU -- Hawaii Gov. Josh Green on Monday proposed a range of new penalties to crack down on those who flout the state's fireworks laws, nearly two weeks after a fireworks explosion at a Honolulu home on New Year's Eve killed four people and injured about 20 others.",
      "The potential new measures include $300 tickets police could issue to those who shoot off fireworks and class A felony charges and decades in prison for those whose use of fireworks leads to serious injury or death. The governor plans to include the proposals in a bill he will send lawmakers for the new legislative session beginning Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe want to deter people from doing this. Three hundred dollars will probably send a chilling effect over a lot of young people, I would expect,\u201d Green said at a news conference. \u201cBut getting a major felony on one\u2019s record and doing time in jail, I hope will give everyone pause.\u201d",
      "State and county officials have struggled for years to contain illegal fireworks in Hawaii, where it's become common for people to launch professional-grad aerial explosives from the streets in front of their homes all year round. Law enforcement officers have seized 227,000 pounds (103,000 kilograms) of fireworks since 2023, much of it from container ships at ports, but also from packages shipped by air. The director of the state Department of Law Enforcement said last week that authorities intercept U.S. Postal Service parcels containing illegal fireworks almost daily.",
      "New Year's is a particularly active time for contraband fireworks displays. They usually result in injuries and in some years people have died, but the start to this year was deadlier than ever.",
      "Green said his proposals were aimed at streamlining and clarifying Hawaii\u2019s fireworks laws so prosecutors can secure convictions more quickly and successfully.",
      "Under the proposal, police issuing $300 citations wouldn\u2019t need to collect evidence. They would just need a witness - a police officer or someone else - to identify the person who set off fireworks, said Tricia Nakamatsu, deputy attorney general. This would be particularly helpful for law enforcement because evidence in fireworks cases often go up in smoke.",
      "The person receiving a ticket would either pay the fine or go to court to contest it, much like a traffic ticket.",
      "This infraction wouldn\u2019t be a crime and so would decriminalize fireworks use at a low level. Crucially, courts would only need a preponderance of evidence to impose a fine. That's in contrast to a criminal charge which prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt to secure a conviction.",
      "\u201cThe citations themselves can also be issued much, much faster. It does not require an officer to go back to the office to write reports, to collect evidence, to submit for testing,\u201d Nakamatsu said. This would help officers get back on the road more quickly, she added.",
      "The governor's team came up with $300 amount because that's currently the fine imposed on those who use cell phones while driving. The principle in both cases is similar, she said, in that both actions could kill one or more people.",
      "For the more serious penalties, the governor proposes to slap heavier punishments on repeat offenders and those who cause serious injury or death with their fireworks. This would apply to those who import illegal fireworks, those who buy and sell them and to the end user who lights them.",
      "It\u2019s currently a Class C felony to possess more than 25 pounds of fireworks, which is punishable by up to five years in prison in Hawaii.",
      "The enhanced charges could lead to Class A felony convictions, which under Hawaii law are punishable by up to 20 years to life in prison.",
      "\u201cPeople, if they take the life of an innocent soul near them, have to be accountable and they\u2019re going to have to spend significant time in prison,\u201d Green said.",
      "The governor said he understands people enjoy the spectacle of fireworks but he said they must be enjoyed in a safe way. He said he would support having more public fireworks displays throughout the year so people can still watch fireworks.",
      "The Department of Law Enforcement last week asked lawmakers for $5.2 million to hire eight people and expand a forensic lab to crack down on fireworks smuggling."

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 02:10:33 -0500",

    "story": [
      "A new toll on drivers entering the core of Manhattan brought modest but measurable traffic reductions to New York City in its first week of operation",
      "NEW YORK -- A new toll on drivers entering the core of Manhattan brought modest but measurable traffic reductions to New York City\u2019s heavily-gridlocked streets in its first week of operation, according to preliminary data released Monday by the state's transit authority.",
      "Known as \u201ccongestion pricing,\u201d the first-in-the-nation program launched on Jan. 5, collecting $9 from most passenger cars entering the city below Central Park during peak hours and higher fees on trucks and other vehicles. In the days since, total traffic in the tolling zone has dropped by 7.5% \u2014 or roughly 43,000 cars per day \u2014 compared to the equivalent period last year, Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said.",
      "\u201cJust look out the window: there is less traffic, quieter streets, and we think everyone has seen it,\u201d said Juliette Michaelson, the MTA deputy chief of policy and external relations. \u201cTraffic patterns are already changing and they will continue to change.\u201d",
      "First proposed decades ago, the program is intended to raise billions of dollars in revenue for the cash-strapped MTA while easing congestion on the city\u2019s streets. It follows similar initiatives in London, Singapore and Stockholm, which also saw immediate reductions in traffic after their tolls went live.",
      "The effect in New York has been most pronounced during the morning rush hour period, with travel times over certain crossings \u2014 including the typically traffic-choked Holland and Lincoln tunnels that run under the Hudson River from New Jersey \u2014 falling by 40% or more, Michaelson said.",
      "Despite anecdotal reports of more crowded train cars, she said the agency had not clocked a noticeable increase in subway users, largely because the baseline number of riders \u2014 over 3 million daily \u2014 is so high. However, a handful of bus routes originating in Brooklyn and Staten Island had seen an increase in ridership the previous week.",
      "Within the congestion zone, the immediate impact has been more mixed. While certain thoroughfares have seen traffic reductions, others routes have stayed largely the same. A Midtown crosstown bus widely derided as New York\u2019s slowest saw its runtime shaved by only a minute, according to MTA data. And there has been little noticeable change during the overnight hours, when the toll for passenger cars goes down to $2.25, officials said.",
      "Bob Pishue, an analyst with INRIX, a traffic-data analytics company, said the MTA\u2019s initial data matched the findings of the firm, which has been comparing drivers\u2019 GPS data before and after the program launched.",
      "\u201cFewer people are coming into Manhattan, but we\u2019re not seeing a significant impact on speeds within the zone yet,\u201d he said. \u201cSome trips are faster, some are slower.\u201d",
      "He cautioned against drawing broad conclusions after barely a week, noting that many drivers were likely taking a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach.",
      "Congestion pricing has sharply divided residents of New York and neighboring areas, touching off protests from many drivers, along with threats of sabotage and viral videos on how to evade the fee.",
      "Proponents of congestion pricing, meanwhile, have hailed its launch as a transformative moment for a city contending with worsening traffic and aging public transportation infrastructure desperately in need of upgrades.",
      "Initially slated to begin in June, the program was halted at the last moment by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. A one-time supporter of the program, the Democrat said her position changed following conversations with \u201cordinary\u201d New Yorkers, including a Manhattan diner owner concerned the toll would disincentivize customers driving in from New Jersey.",
      "Hochul later revived the program but at the lower price of $9 for most drivers, down from the $15 fee initially approved by the state.",
      "Tarek Soliman, the owner of Comfort Diner in midtown Manhattan, said he had spoken directly with the governor about his fears of losing New Jersey customers. While he said it was too early to tell if the program had hurt business, the new fee was already having at least one impact on him.",
      "\u201cEvery weekend, I used to drive to the garage next to the diner,\u201d Soliman, a resident of Astoria, Queens, said by phone Monday. \u201cNow I don\u2019t drive. I take the subway.\u201d"

      "A lawsuit filed against Southern California Edison claims the utility\u2019s equipment sparked the deadly Eaton Fire burning just outside Los Angeles",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014",
      "Lawsuits filed Monday claim utility equipment sparked one of the two deadly wildfires burning in the Los Angeles area while some Pacific Palisades residents believe the other blaze may have started when hurricane-force winds reignited the remnants of an extinguished New Year's Day fire.",
      "Authorities haven\u2019t determined an official cause for the fires, which roared to life last Tuesday and have killed at least 24 people. A team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives took the lead on the investigations.",
      "Multiple lawsuits against Southern California Edison claim the utility\u2019s equipment sparked the deadly Eaton Fire burning near Pasadena. Edison has acknowledged fire agencies are investigating whether its equipment may have started a far smaller LA-area fire that broke out the same day.",
      "The Eaton Fire destroyed at least 7,000 homes and other structures and laid waste to entire neighborhoods. Attorneys representing homeowners who lost their homes said Monday that it is their belief that Edison\u2019s equipment caused it. Video taken during the fire\u2019s early minutes shows a large blaze directly beneath electrical towers.",
      "\u201cThere is clear evidence from video footage, photographs, and witness accounts that the fire was caused by electrical equipment operated by Defendants Edison International and Southern California Edison,\u201d according to one complaint, filed on behalf of Altadena resident Evangeline Iglesias.",
      "Gabriela Ornelas, an Edison spokesperson, said the utility is aware that a lawsuit has been filed, but has not yet reviewed it. \u201cOur hearts remain with our communities during the devastating fires in Southern California, and we remain committed to supporting them through this difficult time,\u201d she said.",
      "Last week, Edison filed a report with the California Public Utilities Commission related to the Eaton Fire that said it has not received any suggestions that its equipment was involved in the ignition of that fire. \u201cPreliminary analysis by SCE of electrical circuit information for the energized transmission lines going through the area for 12 hours prior to the reported start time of the fire shows no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire,\u201d the utility reported.",
      "Edison also submitted a filing with the utilities commission about the Hurst fire in the Sylmar neighborhood of Los Angeles that started last Tuesday. The utility said \u201ca downed conductor was discovered at a tower\u201d near where the fire started.",
      "But the utility added it \u201cdoes not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire.\u201d That fire burned more than a square mile (2.6 square kilometers) and is now contained.",
      "Meanwhile, a New Year's Day fire that broke out at the same place as the Jan. 7 fire that ripped through Pacific Palisades to become the most destructive in Los Angeles city history, is a particular source of interest for residents who saw both blazes.",
      "Asked about speculation that remnants of the Jan. 1 fire reignited in Pacific Palisades, LAPD Assistant Chief Dominic Choi said Monday that no causes have been ruled out.",
      "The Los Angeles Fire Department reported a brush fire shortly after midnight on Jan. 1 in the area of Pacific Palisades. The initial report was 3 to 4 acres (1.2 to 1.6 hectares) of heavy brush burning under 15 mph (24 kph) winds. Water dropping helicopters and firefighters on the ground battled the blaze, which grew to 8 acres (3 hectares), and it was reported as contained less than five hours later, according to reports posted on the department\u2019s website.",
      "Residents say the wind-whipped blaze that ripped through that community started in the same location as a fire sparked by fireworks shot off just after midnight on New Year's Day. The hurricane-force winds that day could have helped ignite any embers that remained. Officials have not directly attributed the Jan. 1 fire to fireworks.",
      "\u201cI still think it\u2019s too coincidental that it would be in almost exactly the same spot. The fireworks went off that night. The firefighters were there,\u201d said Sue Pascoe, a resident who lost her home and who runs the neighborhood news website Circling the News, which has been writing about the connection to the New Year's Day fire since the Jan. 7 start.",
      "The official investigations could take months, and with strong winds again in the forecast, the area is at risk for more fires that could further complicate efforts to determine cause.",
      "Ginger Colbrun, a spokesperson for the ATF, said it is too early to determine the cause of the Palisades fire. Colbrun said investigators did an initial assessment of the area Friday and began processing the scene Monday.",
      "Pacific Palisades resident Robert Trinkkeller said he saw the fire early on New Year\u2019s Day, and watched aircraft drop water on it.",
      "When he saw the fire break out on Jan. 7, Trinkkeller said he immediately thought it was linked.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, it was a rekindling of the six-day old fire,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the exact same place.\u201d",

      "The U.S. has ended its latest legal battle against the company that owns the salvage rights to the Titanic shipwreck",
      "NORFOLK, Va. -- The U.S. government has scrapped its litigation against the company that owns the salvage rights to the Titanic, noting that the firm no longer has expedition plans to the shipwreck that could break federal law.",
      "The scuttling of the government's latest legal battle isn't necessarily the end of RMS Titanic Inc.'s attempts to enter the rapidly deteriorating ocean liner or to fetch more historic objects. The company said last month that it's still considering the implications of future expeditions.",
      "But the U.S. on Friday withdrew its motion to intervene in a federal admiralty court in Virginia, which oversees salvage matters for the world's most famous shipwreck. The withdrawal concluded the second of two legal battles in five years that the U.S. has waged against RMS Titanic Inc, the company that has retrieved and exhibited the ship's artifacts.",
      "The U.S. filed its latest legal challenge in 2023 when RMST was planning to take images inside the ship's hull and pluck items from the surrounding debris field. RMST also said it would possibly recover freestanding objects from the room where the ocean liner broadcast its distress calls.",
      "The U.S. argued that entering the hull \u2014 or disturbing the wreck \u2014 would violate a 2017 federal law and a corresponding agreement with Great Britain. Both regard the site as a hallowed memorial to the more than 1,500 people who died when the ship struck an iceberg in 1912.",
      "RMST ultimately scaled back its dive plans, stating that it would only take external images. The change followed the 2023 implosion of the Titan submersible, which killed RMST\u2019s director of underwater research Paul-Henri Nargeolet and four others onboard.",
      "The experimental Titan craft was operated by a separate company, OceanGate, to which Nargeolet was lending his expertise. He was supposed to lead the RMST expedition.",
      "After RMST revised its dive plans, the U.S. stopped trying to block that particular expedition, which produced detailed images of the wreck in September. But the government told the federal court in Norfolk last year that it wanted to leave the door open to challenging subsequent expeditions.",
      "RMST, however, told the court in December that it won\u2019t visit the wreck in 2025 and hasn't settled on any plans for future expeditions. The company said it will continue to \u201cdiligently consider the strategic, legal, and financial implications of conducting future salvage operations at the site.\u201d",
      "In response, the U.S. withdrew its motion to intervene.",
      "\u201cShould future circumstances warrant, the United States will file a new motion to intervene based on the facts then existing,\u201d the government wrote in a filing on Friday.",
      "RMST has been the court-recognized steward of Titanic artifacts since it won salvage rights to the ship in 1994. The firm has recovered and conserved thousands of items, from silverware to a piece of the ship\u2019s hull, which millions of people have seen through exhibits.",
      "The company's last expedition to recover artifacts was in 2010, before the federal law and international agreement took effect.",
      "The first federal enforcement was in 2020, when RMST wanted to retrieve and exhibit the radio that broadcast the Titanic\u2019s distress calls.",
      "U.S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith, who presides over Titanic salvage matters, gave RMST permission. But the U.S. government swiftly challenged the plan. The legal battle never played out because RMST indefinitely delayed the expedition in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Smith noted during a court hearing in March that time may be running out for expeditions inside the Titanic. The ship is rapidly deteriorating on the North Atlantic seabed."

      "Pete Hegseth will try to convince members of the Senate Armed Services Committee he should be the next secretary of defense",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Pete Hegseth will try to convince members of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that he should be the next secretary of defense, following weeks of meetings with lawmakers who peppered him with questions about his character and views on a range of military issues.",
      "As author of several books and a former Fox News Channel host, Hegseth has been forced to defend himself against a long record of his own public comments, including in his most recent book, \u201cThe War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.\u201d",
      "His wide-ranging opinions could provide some insight into how he could approach the top Pentagon job if confirmed. At times, he says he's been misconstrued, but other times he's tried to soften his previously stated views on contentious topics.",
      "Here's a look at Hegseth in his own words:",
      "An Army veteran who rose to the rank of major and served in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, Hegseth, 44, says he believes that standards have declined and that efforts to expand diversity, equity and inclusion have driven white men away.",
      "He complains in his latest book that \u201cwoke\u201d generals and the leaders of the elite service academies have left the military dangerously weak and \u201ceffeminate\u201d by promoting DEI. He says, \u201cthe next commander in chief will need to clean house.\u201d",
      "\u201cTurns out, all the \u2018diversity\u2019 recruiting messages made certain kids \u2014 white kids \u2014 feel like they\u2019re not wanted,\u201d he said in his book.",
      "If confirmed, he has said there will be no more \u201csocial justice, politically correct approaches to how we fight and conduct wars.\" Instead, he said, \u201cthis is about lethality, meritocracy, readiness.\u201d",
      "And he has vowed to fire generals involved in \u201cwoke\u201d programs.",
      "Hegseth's opposition \u2014 stated in his book and interviews \u2014 was simple and direct before his nomination on Nov. 12. But, in the face of questions from Congress, he appears to have altered his stance.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn\u2019t made us more effective. Hasn\u2019t made us more lethal. Has made fighting more complicated,\u201d he said in a podcast hosted by Shawn Ryan on Nov. 7.",
      "Women have a place in the military, he said, just not in special operations, artillery, infantry and armor units.",
      "In his book, he said women have performed well in dangerous support roles during war, but \u201cwomen in the infantry \u2014 women in combat on purpose \u2014 is another story.\u201d He adds, \u201cwomen cannot physically meet the same standards as men.\u201d",
      "He said, \"Dads push us to take risks. Moms put the training wheels on our bikes. We need moms. But not in the military, especially in combat units.\"",
      "His views riled some members of Congress.",
      "Asked about the issue on the \u201cMegyn Kelly Show\u201d in early December, Hegseth said he cares only that military standards are maintained. Women serve in combat, he said, and, \u201cif we have the right standard and women meet that standard, roger. Let's go.\u201d",
      "Hegseth faced allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman he met at a conference in California in 2017. He has denied it, saying it was consensual. No charges were filed.",
      "He has acknowledged paying a settlement to his accuser, contending he did so to head off a baseless lawsuit. \u201cThe matter was fully investigated, and I was completely cleared,\u201d he said.",
      "He also has acknowledged multiple instances of infidelity, including the California incident, which happened while he was going through a divorce with his second wife after having a child with the woman who is now his current wife, Jennifer Rauchet.",
      "He told Kelly that going to a hotel room with someone who was not his wife \u201cis not OK\u201d and that he paid the settlement \u201cto protect my wife. I did it to protect my family. I did it to protect my job.\"",
      "He said it was fair to call him a \u201cserial cheater\u201d but he \u201ctruly was changed by Jen and my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\u201d and is now a different man.",
      "Senators have also expressed concerns about reports of excessive drinking.",
      "Hegseth has denied having a drinking problem and said publicly that he told lawmakers he wouldn\u2019t drink while defense secretary.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to have a drink at all,\" he said, likening it to following the Pentagon\u2019s general order No. 1, which prohibits troops from drinking while deployed.",
      "He said that often when service members come home from war they \u201chave some beers.\u201d But insisted in the Kelly interview that, \"I\u2019ve never had a drinking problem.\"",
      "Hegseth has said the Pentagon overreacted by taking steps to address extremism and has taken leadership to task for the military\u2019s efforts to remove people it deemed white supremacists and violent extremists.",
      "He wrote that the problem is \u201cfake\u201d and characterized it as \u201cpeddling the lie of racism in the military.\u201d He said efforts to root out extremism had pushed \u201crank-and-file patriots out of their formations.\u201d",
      "Hegseth was pulled from Washington National Guard duty during President Joe Biden's inauguration after he was flagged as a possible \u201cInsider Threat\u201d by a fellow service member due to a tattoo.",
      "Hegseth has said it was due to a Christian cross tattoo on his chest. But the fellow Guard member, who was on an anti-terrorism team at the time, shared with The Associated Press an email he sent to the unit\u2019s leadership flagging a different tattoo on Hegseth's bicep that's associated with white supremacist groups.",
      "Shortly after President-elect Trump announced his nomination, Hegseth posted on X, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time for a @SecDef who has\u2026 Led in combat. Been on patrol for days. Pulled a trigger. Heard bullets whiz by. Called in close air support. Led medevacs. Dodged IEDs.\"",
      "He said Trump told him that, \u201cI chose you because you\u2019re the guy that\u2019s gonna put the warfighters first. We haven\u2019t had that. We need a guy that\u2019s kicked down doors and understands the consequences of war.\u201d",
      "Trump's first defense secretary, retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, served in combat in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and was awarded a Bronze Star with a V for valor for serving in one of the lead assault units going into Kuwait in the first Gulf War.",
      "Current Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, a retired Army four-star general, also commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and was awarded a Silver Star, the nation's third-highest award for valor, for leading troops into Iraq during the 2003 invasion.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve led troops in combat in pretty significant and tough situations,\u201d Austin told The Associated Press. \u201cEven if you are a self-described \u2018door kicker\u2019 or whatever you want to call it, I had run large, complex organizations before I came into this job, and I did that successfully.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo I think you have to have a perspective on what\u2019s happening on the ground, but you also have to have an understanding of how things fit in terms of the bigger picture,\u201d he said.",

      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and other officials \u2014 who have faced criticism over their initial response to fires that began last week \u2014 expressed confidence Monday that the region was ready to face the new threat with additional firefighters brought in from around the U.S., as well as Canada and Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely better prepared,\u201d LA County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said when asked what will be different from a week ago, when hurricane-force winds propelled multiple fires across the parched, brush-filled region that hasn\u2019t seen rain in more than eight months.",
      "The winds are predicted to pick up late Monday into early Tuesday, but they are not expected to reach hurricane-force like last week.

    "story": [
      "The US markets watchdog has filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk alleging he failed to disclose that he had amassed a stake in Twitter, allowing him to buy shares at \"artificially low prices.\"",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit alleges that the multi-billionaire Tesla boss saved $150m (\u00a3123m) in share purchases as a result.",
      "According to SEC rules, investors whose holdings surpass 5% have 10 days to report that they have crossed that threshold. Musk did so 21 days after the purchase, the filing says.",
      "In a social media post, Musk called the SEC a \"totally broken organisation.\"",
      "He also accused the regulator of wasting its time when \"there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished.\"",
      "\"Musk's violation resulted in substantial economic harm to investors,\" the SEC complaint said.",
      "In a statement emailed to BBC News, Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, described the lawsuit as a \"sham\" and \"a campaign of harassment\" against his client.",
      "Twitter's share price rose by more than 27% after Musk made his share purchase public on 4 April 2022, the SEC said.",
      "Musk ended up buying Twitter for $44bn in October 2022 and has since changed the platform's name to X.",
      "The complaint was submitted by the SEC to a federal court in Washington DC on Tuesday.",
      "The lawsuit also asked the court to order Musk to give up \"unjust\" profits and pay a fine.",
      "The head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, announced in November that he will resign from his role when Donald Trump returns to the White House on 20 January.",
      "That was after Trump said he planned to sack Mr Gensler on \"day one\" of his new administration.",
      "Under Mr Gensler's leadership, the SEC clashed with Musk, who is a close ally of the president-elect.",
      "But Musk had run-ins with the SEC long before Mr Gensler took office.",
      "In 2018, the regulator charged Musk with defrauding investors by claiming he had \"funding secured\" to take Tesla, the electric car company he leads, private.",
      "He later settled the charges, stepping down as chairman of the firm's board and agreeing to accept what was dubbed a Twitter sitter - limits on what he could write on social media about the company."

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged to go \"further and faster\" to improve economic growth after market turbulence saw the cost of servicing UK debt rise.",
      "The last few days have seen pressures on the public finances increase, after government borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years.",
      "Conservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride called it \"a crisis made in Downing Street\", saying business tax rises in October's Budget had dented the UK's economic prospects.",
      "Reeves said she was \"under no illusion\" about the scale of the challenge on the economy.",
      "It is understood she will now bring forward announcements from Labour's promised industrial strategy within the next two weeks.",
      "Chancellor will remain for all of Parliament, Downing Street says",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "The chancellor was addressing the Commons following her return to the UK from a trip to China to drum up investment.",
      "During the debate, she accused Conservative critics of ignoring \"global volatility\" behind rising borrowing costs in other countries such as the US, Germany and France.",
      "\"The economic headwinds that we face are a reminder that we should, indeed we must, go further and faster in our plan to kick-start economic growth that plunged under the last government,\" she told MPs.",
      "Reeves promised to set out new economic policies after next week's meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos.",
      "The BBC has been told the industrial strategy, promised in Labour's manifesto, is now being \"fast tracked\" to help bolster growth.",
      "Sector-specific announcements, like this week's strategy for boosting artificial intelligence, will be rolled out in the coming weeks.",
      "Reeves is navigating a critical moment as Chancellor, with investors demanding higher returns on UK government bonds - known as gilts.",
      "The yields - the interest rate at which the government pays back investors - on gilts are a key indicator of market confidence.",
      "On Tuesday, the yield on 30-year gilts stood at 5.42% - close to the highest since 1998.  Meanwhile the yield on debt due for repayment in 10 years was 4.87% - close to the highest since 2008.",
      "If sustained, higher UK borrowing costs may raise annual debt interest by \u00a310bn by 2029-30, wiping out the Chancellor's \u00a310bn headroom against her self-imposed fiscal rules.",
      "And if the Treasury's financial headroom goes, spending will be squeezed rather than taxes raised, Reeves' aides told the BBC.",
      "Speaking in the Commons, Stride accused the government of having \"talked down the economy\" and \"crippled businesses\" with rises in the Budget to employers' National Insurance (NI) contributions.",
      "\"Growth has been killed stone dead, inflation is rising impacting millions, interest rates are staying higher for longer, and business confidence has fallen through the floor,\" he added.",
      "\"This is a crisis made in Downing Street.\"",
      "Conservative MP Luke Evans added to the criticism, claiming higher bond yields showed \"the markets do not believe her plan for growth\".",
      "But in response, Reeves called for Evans to \"get real\" arguing there had been \"a global volatility in markets\".",
      "She said: \"I don't believe that it is reasonable to suggest that the reason why bond yields in the United States, in Germany and France, have risen is because of decisions made by this government.\"",
      "The chancellor spent the weekend in China seeking new investment, sparking claims she was capitulating to Beijing and dodging awkward questions in parliament.",
      "During the debate, Reeves argued agreements reached during her visit to China would be worth \u00a3600m to the UK over the next five years.",
      "But Stride argued the current higher level of debt interest costs would be \"100 times what she says she has brought back from Beijing\".",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper argued that the benefits from the new China deal was the equivalent to \"just five hours of NHS spending\".",
      "Cooper argued Reeves's Budget \"has not worked,\" claiming the NI increases were \"self-defeating\" and a blow to struggling small businesses.",

      "She argued the visit let her confront China on human rights and trade concerns.",
      "\"You can't raise tough issues if you're not in the room,\" Reeves said.",
      "On Monday, Sir Keir Starmer said he had \"full confidence\" in Reeves and the government was committed to its fiscal rules.",
      "But Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused him of refusing to back her after he declined at a press conference to answer specifically whether she would be in post at the next election.",

    "summary": "Should more AI be used to help GPs with consultations and administrative work?",
    "story": [
      "This is the fifth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK.",
      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Could AI help prevent diabetes-related sight loss?",
      "Alison Dennis, partner and co-head of law firm Taylor Wessing's international life sciences team, warns that GPs need to tread carefully when using AI.",
      "\"There is the very high risk of generative AI tools not providing full and complete, or correct diagnoses or treatment pathways, and even giving wrong diagnoses or treatment pathways i.e. producing hallucinations or basing outputs on clinically incorrect training data,\u201d says Ms Dennis.",
      "\u201cAI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use \u2013 which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.\u201d",
      "She says specialist medical products must be regulated and receive some form of official accreditation.",
      "\u201cThe NHS would also want to ensure that all data that is inputted into the tool is retained securely within the NHS system infrastructure, and is not absorbed for further use by the provider of the tool as training data without the appropriate GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] safeguards in place.\"",
      "For now, for GPs like Misra-Sharp, it has transformed their work. \u201cIt has made me go back to enjoying my consultations again instead of feeling time pressured.\u201d"

      "Willow Green, Cranfield, Bedfordshire",
      "Dean, 41, paid \u00a3375,000 for his home which was built in 2015.",
      "Each morning he wakes up and worries about the roof, he says.",
      "Two roofing companies have told him there are too few rows of tiles, meaning the overlap isn't sufficient to prevent water ingress.",
      "But Bellway and its insurers, the National House Building Council (NHBC), have rejected Dean's claims, saying repair work of a poor standard by an independent builder, didn't comply with regulations and invalidated his warranty.",
      "It said the NHBC inspections had \"not identified a defect within the original construction of Mr Carpenter's property\" or any evidence of a leak or water ingress.",
      "Since then, Bellway has blocked Dean's emails and threatened legal action if he continues posting critical remarks on Facebook.",
      "\"I feel totally fobbed off by Bellway,\" he says.",
      "\"The roof needs replacing, it needs re-battening, re-tiling and re-relaying correctly.\"",
      "Eight people on the Willow Green estate shared their concerns about stained walls, mould, or crumbling mortar in the eaves.",
      "One of them, Robert Degavino, 77, says his loft is full of black mould.",
      "\"Bellway came out to inspect the property, but as far as they're concerned it meets building regulations.",
      "\"We're worried because if it's constantly getting wet, what's it going to be like in another five, 10 or 20 years?",
      "\"They're lovely designed houses, I just think it's poor building practice.\"",
      "Bellway says staining on render was not unusual after nine years and the NHBC found no sign of water ingress.",
      "At least six homeowners have complained to Bellway or the NHBC about their roofs.",
      "So far, only one claim has been approved, resulting in major remedial work on a property in November.",
      "Florence Close, Brentwood, Essex",
      "Robert Altman, 44, says he and his neighbours in Florence Close, a 10-home development built by Bellway in 2017, are in a similar situation.",
      "They say they are the guinea pigs of a new, flat-roofed design, which has resulted in years of damp or mould on the walls of their bedrooms and bathrooms.",
      "In 2023 Bellway admitted some of the roofs were faulty and agreed to improve ventilation and lay new insulation, but the work took nearly two years, and people's lofts were exposed for months under scaffolding.",
      "\"And the worst of it is, they didn't fix the problem,\" Robert says.",
      "\"The specialists who came in to certify the work said there were still dangerous levels of moisture in our lofts.",
      "\"It's just misery after misery and we've been left in the cold - we're spending time on this when we have young families, we all have jobs, and if we want to sell our houses, then we're not going to be able to.\"",
      "Some of the residents are now considering legal action.",
      "Georgina Bright, 32, says damp has been pooling on her upstairs ceiling, such that \"all the lights have been flickering\" and when an extractor fan was removed \"loads of water flew out of it\".",
      "She says although Bellway's contractors tried to clean up the mould, it is growing again all over her loft and on the bathroom walls.",
      "\"It gives me PTSD, the whole thing. It's horrific.",
      "\"And I think sometimes, even when Bellway respond, it's so unhelpful, it makes me feel really crap.\"",
      "Bellway \"apologised to any homeowner on Florence Close who had been impacted\" and said it had worked hard to resolve outstanding issues, adding the roofs were now \"fitted as designed to prevent any future concerns\" and a mould treatment specialist would reassess the properties in the Spring.",
      "Paula Higgins, chief executive at the Homeowners Alliance, said the level of cover for newbuild homeowners could be \"deeply unfair\".",
      "\"The structural warranty is very limited in scope so it can be difficult to get problems resolved \u2013 it's frustrating and residents shouldn't have to become experts because it's not their fault.",
      "\"We're relying on private companies with shareholders to provide a public good and I don't think they take full responsibility for the overall build of these homes,\" Mrs Higgins said.",
      "How are new build owners protected?",

Many homeowners hire professionals to spot themFrom years three to 10, the homeowner is usually insured for structural defects, or where damage has been caused because the foundations or the roof say, have not been built to the correct standardsDuring this structural warranty period, minor defects are no longer covered.

    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will remain in her role \"for the whole of this Parliament\", Downing Street has said, as she faces criticism over the falling pound and rising government borrowing costs.",
      "The pound fell to $1.21 on Monday, its lowest level since November 2023, while one measure of the rate at which the government can borrow money hit its highest level since 2008.",
      "Borrowing costs are rising for many countries across the world, but some have argued that decisions made in the Budget appear to have made the UK more vulnerable.",
      "The Conservatives said the chancellor was \"hanging on by her fingernails\".",
      "When asked at a press conference earlier whether Reeves would remain chancellor for the whole of the Parliament, the prime minister declined to answer, but did then say she had his \"full confidence\" and was doing a \"fantastic job\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"The prime minister just refused to back his chancellor staying in her job.",
      "\"The markets are in turmoil and business confidence has crashed, yet the chancellor is nowhere to be seen.\"",
      "However, the prime minister's official spokesman later said: \"You heard from the prime minister this morning.",
      "\"He was very explicit (that) he has full confidence in the chancellor and he'll be working with her in the role of chancellor for the whole of this Parliament.\"",
      "The row comes after the chancellor defended her decision to travel to China to improve economic ties with the country, despite the uncertainty in the financial markets.",
      "The Conservatives said she had \"fled to China\", but Reeves said agreements reached in Beijing would be worth \u00a3600m to the UK over the next five years.",
      "Reeves is a central figure in the Labour government, presented to the voters as a safe pair of hands in the run-up to the election. She also led the work to build bridges with business.",
      "But business and some other observers were shaken by her first Budget in October, which they fear could knock the wind from the economy further, rather than spur the growth Labour has promised.",
      "Market jitters over the past week have increased concerns over the government's economic strategy.",
      "Rising borrowing costs will have a knock-on effect on the government's tax and spending plans, because it will have to pay more interest to finance its existing debt. That leaves less to spend on public services and investment.",
      "Trump factor",
      "Governments generally borrow money by selling bonds to big investors, such as pension funds. UK government bonds are known as gilts.",
      "The yield on the 10-year gilt - the interest rate at which the government pays back a decade-long loan to investors - rose to 4.88% on Monday, its highest level for 17 years.",
      "The 30-year gilt yield climbed to 5.44%, its highest in 27 years.",
      "Government debt costs in Germany, France, Spain and Italy also rose on Monday.",
      "Some experts say investors are reacting to the re-election of former US President Donald Trump and his talk of tariffs.",
      "There is concern this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought, and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as expected, both in the US and elsewhere.",
      "Strong US jobs data released on Friday added to expectations that US rates will stay higher for longer, and this has helped to strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies.",
      "However, Emma Wall, head of platform investors at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the UK's problems were not purely caused by global issues, arguing that measures announced in the Budget have stoked inflation.",
      "\"If you can get inflation under control, you will see interest rates come down in the UK,\" she added.",
      "Reeves also faced questions over her self-imposed rules on government debt and spending, which she said on Saturday were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "Despite her commitment, some have questioned whether she will be able to achieve the targets without making further spending cuts or tax rises because of how government debt costs have risen.",
      "On Monday, Sir Keir said the government was going to keep to its fiscal rules.",
      "However, he added that the government would be \"ruthless\" in its decisions for the upcoming spending review.",

      "Reeves faces 'difficult decisions' on tax and spending",
      "Confidence 'bruised'",
      "The government has made growing the UK's economy a key objective, but recent figures indicate the economy saw zero growth between July and September, while it contracted during October.",
      "Businesses have warned that Budget measures, such as the rise in employer National Insurance contributions, together with the higher National Living Wage could lead to job cuts and price rises.",
      "Rupert Soames, chair of the Confederation of British Business (CBI), said the picture was \"not good\" but insisted that firms were still somewhat upbeat.",
      "\"I wouldn't say confidence is gone,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"I'd say it's bruised.\"",
      "However, he said the government was making the situation worse by introducing the Employment Rights Bill, which he said contained \"powerful dissuaders to employment\".",
      "Unions argue the protections introduced in the bill, such as banning fire-and-rehire, make employees safer, while the government has said it \"represents the biggest upgrade in employment rights for a generation\".",
      "However, Mr Soames said the bill would lead to job losses.",
      "\"Businesses will not only not employ, they will let people go,\" he said.",
      "As part of its push for growth, the government revealed plans on Monday to make the UK the global capital of artificial intelligence through measures such as building a new supercomputer.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence presents a \"vast potential\" for rejuvenating UK public services, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday.",
      "In a speech setting out the government's plans to use AI across the UK to boost growth and deliver services more efficiently, Sir Keir said the government had a responsibility to make AI \"work for working people\".",
      "The AI Opportunities Action Plan is backed by leading tech firms, some of which have committed \u00a314bn towards various projects, creating 13,250 jobs, the government said.",
      "But the government faces questions over how much time and money will be needed to make its vision a reality, amid concerns over borrowing costs and the falling value of the pound.",
      "The plan includes proposals for growth zones where development will be focused, and suggests the technology will be used to help tackle issues such as potholes.",
      "While estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) support the claim that AI could increase productivity, it also says the changes may come gradually.",
      "The government tasked AI adviser Matt Clifford with creating a UK action plan for supporting the growth of artificial intelligence and its use in public services.",
      "He came back with 50 recommendations which are now being implemented.",
      "Among these is for the UK to invest in a new supercomputer to boost computing power - marking a change in strategy after the Labour government ditched the previous government's plans for a supercomputer at Edinburgh University.",
      "Sir Keir said AI \"will drive incredible change\" in the country and \"has the potential to transform the lives of working people\".",
      "\"We're going to make AI work for everyone in our country,\" he added, saying the \"battle for the jobs of tomorrow is happening today\".",
      "Sir Keir said the UK would become one of the AI \"superpowers\" - mirroring former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's drive to boost the UK sector so it could rival that of the US and China.",
      "At the time, many of Sunak's proposals were geared towards mitigating future risks of highly powerful AI systems.",
      "In October 2023, he said AI could enable faster, easier production of chemical and biological weapons, or be used by terrorist groups to spread disinformation.",
      "He added that in a worst-case scenario, society could lose control over AI.",
      "His government's emphasis on \"safety\" seems largely absent in this new plan  - instead focusing on maximising opportunities, growth and innovation.",
      "The pivot away from the previous narrative of caution and safety suggests the government has decided the UK should attempt to compete in the AI arms race, currently lead by major global players including the US and China.",
      "However, building data centres and boosting the nation's computing power will not happen overnight.",
      "This means the government is unlikely to see the end results of this major project ahead of the next general election - when Labour will have to convince voters that it was still the right decision, at a time when public finances remain stretched.",
      "Professor Dame Wendy Hall said the proposals were \"ambitious\", but necessary to help the UK keep up with the pace of development.",
      "\"It's an ambitious plan but there's a lot of upfront investment,\" she told BBC Radio Four's Today programme.",
      "\"It will take some time to see a return on that investment and they've got to be in it for the long-term.\"",
      "How the AI plan could affect you",

      "AI will be used by the public sector to enable its workers to spend less time doing admin and more time delivering services.Several \"AI Growth Zones\" around the UK will be created, involving big building projects and new jobs.AI will be fed through cameras around the country to inspect roads and spot potholes that need fixing Teachers and small business owners were highlighted as two groups that could start using AI for things like faster planning and record-keeping.AI is already being used in UK hospitals for important tasks such as diagnosing cancer more quickly and it will continue to be used to support the NHS.",

      "While the push towards AI is seen as way of cutting down on public spending, Mak accused Labour of undermining this goal with its economic policies.",

      "It was founded by three University College London students before its acquisition by Google.",
      "Tim Flagg, chief operating officer of UKAI - a trade body representing British AI businesses - said the proposals take a \"narrow view\" of the sector's contributors and focus too much on big tech.",
      "\"AI innovation spans industries, from small enterprises to non-tech sectors, all driving the new industrial revolution,\" he said.",
      "\"It's time the government recognised this broader definition and tapped into the full potential of AI across the UK.\"",

    "story": [
      "The hum of sewing machines is a constant in parts of Guangzhou, a thriving port on the Pearl River in southern China.",
      "It rattles through the open windows of factories from morning until late at night, as they finish the t-shirts, shorts, blouses, pants and swimwear that will be shipped to fill wardrobes in more than 150 countries.",
      "This is the sound of Panyu, the neighbourhood known as the \"Shein village\", a warren of factories that power the world's largest fast fashion retailer.",
      "\"If there are 31 days in a month, I will work 31 days,\" one worker told the BBC.",
      "Most said they only have one day off a month.",
      "The BBC spent several days here: we visited 10 factories, spoke to four owners and more than 20 workers. We also spent time at labour markets and textile suppliers.",
      "We found that the beating heart of this empire is a workforce sitting behind sewing machines for around 75 hours a week in contravention of Chinese labour laws.",
      "These hours are not unusual in Guangzhou, an industrial hub for rural workers in search of a higher income; or in China, which has long been the world's unrivalled factory.",
      "But they add to a growing list of questions about Shein, once a little-known Chinese-founded company that has become a global behemoth in just over five years.",
      "Still privately-owned, it was valued at about \u00a354bn ($66bn) in a fundraising round in 2023. It is now eyeing a potential listing on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "Its meteoric rise, however, has been dogged with controversy about its treatment of workers and allegations of forced labour.",
      "Last year it admitted to finding children working in its factories in China.",
      "The company declined to be interviewed but told the BBC in a statement that \"Shein is committed to ensuring the fair and dignified treatment of all workers within our supply chain\" and is investing tens of millions of dollars in strengthening governance and compliance.",
      "It added: \"We strive to set the highest standards for pay and we require that all supply chain partners adhere to our code of conduct. Furthermore, Shein works with auditors to ensure compliance.\"",
      "Shein's success lies in volume - the inventory online runs into the hundreds of thousands - and deep discounts: \u00a310 dresses, \u00a36 sweaters, prices that hover below \u00a38 on average.",
      "Revenue has soared, outstripping the likes of H&M, Zara and Primark. The cut-price sales are driven by places like the Shein village, home to some 5,000 factories, most of them Shein suppliers.",
      "The buildings have been hollowed out to make way for sewing machines, rolls of fabric and bags brimming with cloth scraps. The doors to their basements are always open for the seemingly endless cycle of deliveries and collections.",
      "As the day passes, the shelves fill up with warehouse-bound, clear plastic bags labelled with a now-distinctive five-letter noun.",
      "But even past 22:00, the sewing machines - and the people hunched over them - don't stop as more fabric arrives, in trucks so full that bolts of colour sometimes tumble onto the factory floor.",
      "\"We usually work, 10, 11 or 12 hours a day,\" says a 49-year-old woman from Jiangxi unwilling to give her name. \"On Sundays we work around three hours less.\"",
      "She is in an alleyway, where a dozen people are huddled around a row of bulletin boards.",
      "They are reading the job ads on the board, while examining the stitching on a pair of chinos draped over it.",
      "This is Shein's supply chain. The factories are contracted to make clothes on order - some small, some big. If the chinos are a hit, orders will ramp up and so must production. Factories then hire temporary workers to meet the demand their permanent staff cannot fulfil.",
      "The migrant worker from Jiangxi is looking for a short-term contract - and the chinos are an option.",
      "\"We earn so little. The cost of living is now so high,\" she says, adding that she hopes to make enough to send back to her two children who are living with their grandparents.",
      "\"We get paid per piece,\" she explains. \"It depends how difficult the item is. Something simple like a t-shirt is one-two yuan [less than a dollar] per piece and I can make around a dozen in an hour.\"",
      "Examining the stitching on the chinos is crucial for making that decision. All around her, workers are calculating how much they will get paid to make each piece of clothing and how many they can make in an hour.",
      "The alleys of Panyu function as labour markets, filling up in the mornings as workers and scooters rush past the breakfast dumpling cart, the cups of steaming soybean milk and the hopeful farmer selling chicken and duck eggs.",
      "Standard working hours appear to be from 08:00 to well past 22:00, the BBC found.",
      "This is consistent with a report from the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye, which was based on interviews with 13 textile workers at factories producing clothes for Shein.",
      "They found that a number of staff were working excessive overtime. It noted the basic wage without overtime was 2,400 yuan (\u00a3265; $327) - below the 6,512 yuan the Asia Floor Wage Alliance says is needed for a \"living wage\". But the workers we spoke to managed to earn anywhere between 4,000 and 10,000 yuan a month.",
      "\"These hours are not unusual, but it's clear that it's illegal and it violates basic human rights,\" said David Hachfield from the group. \"It's an extreme form of exploitation and this needs to be visible.\"",
      "The average working week should not exceed 44 hours, according to Chinese labour laws, which also state that employers should ensure workers have at least one rest day a week. If an employer wants to extend these hours, it should be for special reasons.",
      "While Shein's headquarters are now in Singapore, there is no denying the majority of its products are made in China.",
      "And Shein's success has drawn the attention of Washington, which is increasingly wary of Chinese firms.",
      "In June, Donald Trump's pick for US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said he had  \"grave ethics concerns\" about Shein's \"deep ties to the People's Republic of China\": \"Slave labour, sweatshops, and trade tricks are the dirty secrets behind Shein's success,\" he wrote.",
      "Not everyone would agree with Rubio's choice of words to describe the conditions at Shein's suppliers. But rights groups say that the long working hours, which have become a way of life for many in Guangzhou, are unfair and exploitative.",
      "The machines dictate the rhythm of the day.",
      "They pause for lunch and dinner when the workers, metal plates and chopsticks in hand, file into the canteen to buy food. If there is no more space to sit, they stand in the street.",
      "\"I've been working in these factories for more than 40 years,\" said one woman who spent just 20 minutes eating her meal. This was just another day for her.",
      "Inside, the factories we visit are not cramped. There is enough light and industrial-sized fans have been brought in to keep workers cool. Huge posters urge staff to report underage workers - likely a response to finding two cases of child labour in the supply chain last year.",
      "The BBC understands that the company is keeping a closer eye on its suppliers ahead of plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "\"This is about their reputation,\" says Sheng Lu, a professor in Fashion and Apparel Studies at the University of Delaware. \"If Shein can successfully achieve an IPO then it means they are recognised as a decent company. But if they are to keep the confidence of investors, they have to take some responsibility.\"",
      "One of the biggest challenges Shein faces is accusations that it sources cotton from China's Xinjiang region.",
      "Once touted as among the world's best fabric, Xinjiang's cotton has fallen out of favour after allegations that it is produced using forced labour by people from the Muslim Uyghur minority - a charge that Beijing has consistently denied.",
      "The only way to get around this criticism is to be more transparent, Prof Sheng says.",
      "\"Unless you fully release your factory list, unless you make your supply chain more transparent to the public, then I think it's going to be very challenging for Shein.\"",
      "A major advantage, he adds, is that Shein's supply chain is in China: \"Very few countries have a complete supply chain. China has this - and nobody can compete.\"",
      "Aspiring rivals like Vietnam and Bangladesh import raw materials from China to make clothes. But Chinese factories rely entirely on local sources for everything, from fabric to zippers and buttons. So it's easy to make a variety of garments, and they are able to do it quickly.",

      "\"Before Shein, we produced and sold clothes on our own,\" said an owner of three factories. \"We could estimate the cost, decide the price  and calculate the profit. Now Shein controls the price, and you have to think about ways to reduce the cost.\"",

      "\"If payment for our goods is due on the 15th, no matter whether it's millions or tens of millions, the money will be paid on time.\"",
      "Shein, with its gruelling hours and sometimes lower wages, may not be a source of comfort to all its workers. But it is a source of pride for some.",
      "\"This is the contribution we Chinese people can make to the world,\" said a 33- year-old supervisor from Guangdong, who didn't want to give her name.",

    "story": [
      "UK laws on internet safety are \"very uneven\" and \"unsatisfactory\", Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has said, following calls from campaigners to tighten the rules.",
      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",
      "In July 2022, Badenoch, who was not then a minister, said the bill was in \"no fit state to become law\" adding: \"We should not be legislating for hurt feelings.\"",
      "Another Conservative MP, David Davis, said it risked \"the biggest accidental curtailment of free speech in modern history\".",
      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",
      "He did not commit to making changes to the current legislation but said he was \"very open-minded\" on the subject.",
      "He also said the act contained some \"very good powers\" he was using to \"assertively\" tackle new safety concerns and that in the coming months ministers would get the powers to make sure online platforms were providing age-appropriate content.",
      "Companies that did not comply with the law would face \"very strident\" sanctions, he said.",
      "Following the interview, a Whitehall source told the BBC the government was not planning to repeal the Online Safety Act, or pass a second act, but to work within what ministers believe are its limitations.",

      "He said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Elon Musk, owner of the social media site X, were \"at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry\".",
      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",
      "Responding to Russell's criticism, a Meta spokesperson told the BBC there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and said the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",
      "Rules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide.",
      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",
      "The law also requires companies to take action against illegal, state-sponsored disinformation. If their services are likely to be accessed by children they should also take steps to protect users against misinformation."

    "story": [
      "This is the fourth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Over a video call, Alex Zhavoronkov holds up a small, green, diamond-shaped pill.",
      "It has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure.",
      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",

      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

    "summary": "Donald Trump's planned tariffs are expected to greatly impact international trade in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation, interest rates and tariffs mean 2025 is shaping up to be an intriguing year for the global economy. One in which growth is expected to remain at a \"stable yet underwhelming\" 3.2%, according to the International Monetary Fund. So what might that mean for all of us?",
      "Exactly a week before Christmas there was a welcome gift for millions of American borrowers - a third interest rate cut in a row.",
      "However, stock markets fell sharply because the world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, made clear they shouldn't expect as many further cuts in 2025 as they might have hoped for, as the battle against inflation continues.",
      "\"From here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world, and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly.",
      "Despite that, November saw inflation push up in the US, eurozone and UK to to 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. It highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so-called \"last mile\" of their battle against inflation. Their target is 2%, and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing.",
      "However, the biggest difficulty for global growth \"is uncertainty, and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the US under Trump 2.0\", says Luis Oganes, who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan.",
      "Since Donald Trump won November's election he's continued to threaten new tariffs against key US trading partners, China, Canada and Mexico.",
      "\"The US is going into a more isolationist policy stance, raising tariffs, trying to provide more effective protection to US manufacturing,\" says Mr Oganes.",
      "\"And even though that is going to support US growth, at least in the short term, certainly it's going to hurt many countries that rely on trade with the US.\"",
      "New tariffs \"could be particularly devastating\" for Mexico and Canada, but also be \"harmful\" to the US, according to Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and a previous economic advisor to President Obama.",
      "He cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that \"depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries. If you disrupt that supply chain, you have massive disruptions in the auto market\".",
      "That has the potential to push up prices, reduce demand for products, and hurt company profits, which could in turn drag down investment levels, he explains.",
      "Mr Obstfeld, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, adds: \"Introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth, could throw the world into recession.\"",
      "The tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Even though the majority of what the US and China sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald Trump's first term in office, the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world's second-biggest economy in the year ahead.",
      "In his new year address President Xi Jinping acknowledged the \"challenges of uncertainties in the external environment\", but said the economy was on \"an upward trajectory\".",
      "Exports of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to China's economy. A drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges, including weak consumer spending and business investment, that the government is trying to tackle.",
      "Those efforts are helping, according to the World Bank, which at the end of December increased its forecast for China's growth from 4.1% to 4.5% in 2025.",
      "Beijing has yet to set a growth target for 2025, but thinks it's on course for 5% last year.",
      "\"Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,\" according to the World Bank's country director for China, Mara Warwick.",
      "Those domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is \"more welcoming\" of foreign investment, according to Michael Hart, who is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.",
      "Tensions between the US and China, and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency, meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere.",
      "However, Mr Hart points out that \"it took 30 to 40 years for China to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer\", and whilst \"companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks... no one's prepared now to completely replace China.\"",
      "One industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles. More than 10 million were made in China last year, and that dominance led the US, Canada and European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on them.",
      "Beijing says they're unfair, and is challenging them at the World Trade Organization.",
      "However, it's the prospect of Donald Trump imposing tariffs that is concerning the EU.",
      "\"Restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth, and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain,\" the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said last month. \"[But] in the short term, it's probably net inflationary.\"",
      "Germany and France are the traditional engines of Europe's economic growth. But their poor performance amid political instability over the past year means that, despite a recent uptick in growth, the eurozone risks losing momentum in the year ahead.",
      "That is, unless consumers spend more and businesses increase their investments.",
      "In the UK higher prices could also come as a result of tax and wage increases, according to one survey.",
      "One barrier to cutting eurozone interest rates is that domestic inflation, which focuses on the prices of items that are less prone to influence from external factors, remains at 4.2%. That's more than double the overall inflation target of 2%, and strong wage pressure has been a barrier getting it down further.",
      "It's been similar in the US according to Sander van 't Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad, the world's biggest recruitment firm.",
      "\"In the US, for instance, [wage inflation] is still going to be around 4% in 2024. In some Western European countries, it's even higher than that.",
      "\"I think there's two factors there. There's the talent scarcity, but there's also, of course, the inflation and people demanding to get more for the work they do.\"",
      "Mr van 't Noordende adds that many companies are passing those extra costs on to their customers, which is adding upward pressure to general inflation.",

      "Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural.",
      "\"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building.",
      "\"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\"",
      "Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous.",
      "The artist would return to the club several times to create new worlds, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds \u2013 oblivious to who the artist would eventually become.",
      "It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol.",
      "His friend had a suggestion \u2013 someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy.",
      "\"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said.",
      "This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police.",
      "What do we know about Banksy?",
      "Campaign to save building home to early Banksy art",
      "Banksy's Girl with Balloon print sells for \u00a380,000",
      "Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids.",
      "The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub.",
      "\"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society.",
      "\"It was always very vibrant.\"",
      "Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston.",
      "He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said.",
      "\"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said.",
      "\"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas.",
      "\"Then they would all just muck in and spray these things that were invented.",
      "\"It wasn't more Banksy than the young people, it was definitely a kind of 50/50 thing.\"",
      "And how much did it cost to bring in Banksy?",
      "\"For the first one [workshop], I think we paid him \u00a350. Probably only covered the cost of the spray paints back then,\" Peter said.",
      "\"I don't think he's ever been in it for the money. It shows what a deep, kind and caring person he is.\"",
      "The murals Banksy created with the children were fun and vivid in colour \u2013 but with meaning.",
      "Cows looking up as bombs are dropped above them, which Peter believes was a nod to climate anxiety, while another was more obscure - a circus overrun by robots.",
      "'I painted over a Banksy'",
      "But what happened to these murals? They were painted over. Again and again.",
      "\"I personally painted over a Banksy. I threw a Banksy stencil away when I was clearing up,\" Peter said.",
      "But he is not one to get sentimental about preserving street art.",
      "\"I have no regrets at all [covering them up]. Back then, it was much more about working with and engaging young people.",
      "\"And it was just another art project back then.\"",
      "For Peter, the value of Banky's time at the club is not monetary, but based on what these murals did for the community.",
      "He wonders if the children remember creating pieces with a man who is now one of the most famous artists in the world.",
      "\"I'm very proud he came here,\" he said.",
      "\"There will be [those who were] young people in the local community who are parents now who worked with Banksy, and they may not know that.\"",

      "Sir Stephen Fry has led the tributes to British actor and comedian Tony Slattery, who has died aged 65 following a heart attack.",
      "Slattery was known for his quick-witted improvisations on the popular Channel 4 show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, from 1988 onwards.",
      "Sir Stephen, who also featured on the show as well as with Slattery in Cambridge University's Footlights group, described his old friend on Instagram as \"the gentlest, sweetest soul\" and \"a screamingly funny deeply talented wit and clown\".",
      "Londoner Slattery also played comedic and serious roles in films such as crime thriller The Crying Game, Peter's Friends and the dark comedy How to Get Ahead in Advertising.",
      "He earned an Olivier Award nomination for best comedy performance for his role as Gordon in Tim Firth's play Neville's Island.",
      "A statement on behalf of Slattery's longstanding partner, actor Mark Michael Hutchinson, said: \"It is with great sadness we must announce actor and comedian Tony Slattery, aged 65, has passed away today, Tuesday morning, following a heart attack on Sunday evening.\"",
      "In his tribute on Instagram, Sir Stephen noted the \"cruel irony that fate should snatch him from us just as he had really begun to emerge from his lifelong battle with so many dark demons\".",
      "Slattery's Whose Line co-star Josie Lawrence added: \"Memories of just laughing a lot. Being silly and laughing. He was talented kind funny and beautiful. Sending love and condolences to wonderful Mark. Rest in peace now Tony.\"",
      "'Dazzling talent'",
      "Fellow comics Richard K Herring and Al Murray also paid tribute, along with Absolutely Fabulous actress and comedian Helen Lederer.",
      "Murray wrote: \"Really sad news about Tony Slattery. Such a dazzling talent,\" while Herring simply posted: \"Oh, Tony.\"",
      "Lederer offered on social media: \"My best friend in laughter, wit, love, absurdity, being my best man (twice), we adored you - what will we do now.\"",
      "Another comedian, Arthur Smith wrote: \"RIP Tony Slattery. Brilliant quick wit, kind, thoughtful.\" Performer Tom Walker aka Jonathan Pie added: \"Absolutely heartbreaking to hear about Tony Slattery. A genius.\"",
      "Comedian and writer David Baddiel described the news as \"so sad\", while presenter and actor Les Dennis remembered Slattery as a \"wonderful talent and a nice man\".",
      "Born into a working class family in North London in 1959, Slattery won a scholarship to study medieval and modern languages at Cambridge University.",
      "It was from here that he entered the world of showbiz, meeting a young Sir Stephen, who invited him to join the Cambridge Footlights - the university's famous amateur dramatics club.",
      "From then on, Slattery once said: \"Getting up on stage and hearing laughter took over.\"",
      "At Cambridge, he was also a contemporary of Dame Emma Thompson and Hugh Laurie.",
      "In 1981, the group won the inaugural Perrier Comedy Award at the Edinburgh Festival, for their production of The Cellar Tapes.",
      "And the following year, Slattery was named Footlights' President, following in the footsteps of Eric Idle, Clive Anderson and Peter Cook.",
      "Slattery went on to appear on the London club circuit doing \"kind of a variety act with bizarre turns\" as he put it.",
      "He made several TV appearances, including a stint hosting children's programme TX.",
      "But his big break came in 1986, when he landed a starring role in the West End musical Me and My Girl; before going on to appear in Radio Times, Privates on Parade and Neville's Island \u2013 to critical acclaim.",
      "His other on screen credits include To Die For, Up 'N Under and The Wedding Tackle.",
      "But he will be most fondly remembered for his work on Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Channel 4's flagship comedy show which saw performers conduct a series of short improvisation games, creating comedic scenes from suggestions made by the host or the audience.",
      "Slattery tickled the nation, appearing alongside the likes of fellow Comedy Store Players members Paul Merton, Josie Lawrence and Sandi Toksvig, as well as Rory Bremner and Sir Stephen, in 48 episodes from 1988 to 1995.",
      "The departure of Slattery - one of the show's most popular performers - after series seven, affected the show's ratings.",
      "He featured once more alongside his old university comedy sparring partners, Sir Stephen, Dame Emma and Lawrie, in the 1992 comedy romance film Peter's Friends; and opposite Richard E Grant in How to Get Ahead in Advertising.",
      "Slattery also starred in the comedy spoof Tiger Bastable and sitcom Just A Gigolo, as well as making appearances in the final Carry On film, Robin Hood, Red Dwarf and Coronation Street.",
      "The comic actor took a break from performing for personal reasons, before returning to film and TV - with a number of projects for the BBC.",
      "He had recently been touring a comedy show in England and launched a podcast, Tony Slattery's Rambling Club, in October.",
      "'Slightly barmy'",
      "Like many much-loved entertainers, Slattery had his demons. In 1996, aged 36, he had a physical and mental breakdown.",
      "In an interview with the Guardian in 2019, he said: \"I had a very happy time until I went slightly barmy\".",
      "The star, who had problems with drink and drugs, flipped between \"terrible isolationism and an almost comatose state, and then terrible agitation, constant pacing, sitting inside with thoughts whirling round and round\".",
      "He admitted himself to hospital on several occasions.",
      "Once, he locked himself in his flat for six months and threw all of his furniture into the Thames.",
      "He was eventually diagnosed as being bipolar, which helped him to explain \"the mania, finding things too exciting, then the withdrawal, apathy and bleakness\".",
      "In 2020, Slattery told the Radio Times that his \"fiscal illiteracy and general innumeracy\" as well as his \"misplaced trust in people\" had led him to bankruptcy.",
      "The same year he was the subject of the BBC Two Horizon documentary What's The Matter With Tony Slattery?, which saw him and Hutchinson visit leading experts on mood disorders and addiction.",
      "Slattery had previously spoken about his condition on the 2006 BBC Two programme The Secret Life Of The Manic Depressive.",
      "Slattery is survived by Hutchinson, his partner of more than three decades, whom he met while performing in Me and My Girl in the mid 1980s.",
      "\"He's kept with me when my behaviour has been so unreasonable and I can only think it's unconditional love,\" Slattery told the Guardian. \"He's certainly not with me for my money - we don't have any money. It's the mystery of love.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 20:03:33 GMT",
    "summary": "The ceremony, hosted by David Tennant, will take place on 16 February at the Royal Festival Hall.",
    "story": [
      "The Bafta nominations will be announced on Wednesday, the latest milestone in an unpredictable awards season which has thrown up several surprises.",
      "The British Academy's shortlists are likely to be a strong Oscars indicator. Last year, the winners of the top six categories matched up perfectly between the two ceremonies.",
      "The nominations follow last week's Golden Globe Awards, which saw Spanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez take home the most prizes, and Demi Moore boost her chances in the best actress race for body horror The Substance.",
      "The Bafta Film Awards, hosted by David Tennant, will take place on 16 February at London's Royal Festival Hall.",
      "There is currently no consensus on what will ultimately win best picture at this year's Oscars, which take place in Los Angeles on 2 March.",
      "The Brutalist, Emilia P\u00e9rez, Anora, Conclave, Wicked and A Complete Unknown have been tipped by different pundits for the top prize. All currently have a feasible path to victory.",
      "Bafta's shortlists come a week after the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) nominations, which saw a strong showing for Wicked and a surprise nod for Pamela Anderson for her role as an ageing Las Vegas performer in The Last Showgirl.",
      "The British Academy's longlists, from which the nominees will be selected, were announced earlier this month.",
      "They included most of this year's frontrunners but with a few notable omissions, such as Angelina Jolie and Golden Globe winner Fernanda Torres. Paddington in Peru also failed to make the new children's and family film category.",
      "But the fact the longlists have already been released doesn't mean there won't be surprises when the final nominations are announced.",
      "Film frontrunners",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, a Spanish-language musical about a Mexican cartel leader who leaves the world of crime to live a new live as a trans woman, is the frontrunner at Bafta after scoring the most longlist mentions.",
      "It was closely followed by Conclave, about a gossipy and scheming group of cardinals who gather in Rome to elect a new Pope, and A Complete Unknown, which follows Bob Dylan's rise to fame in the 1960s.",
      "The Brutalist, about a Hungarian architect who is hired by a wealthy American after World War Two, and The Substance, which sees a woman take a black-market drug to create a younger and more beautiful version of herself, also featured heavily in the longlists.",
      "They were joined by blockbusters Wicked, the origin story of Elphaba from The Wizard of Oz, and the sandy sci-fi sequel Dune: Part Two.",
      "Anora, which follows the whirlwind romance of a young couple who meet in a strip club, and Gladiator II, about the grandson of Rome's former emperor being forced into slavery, also chalked up several appearances on the longlists.",
      "Possible surprises",
      "There are six nomination slots available in every acting category at the Baftas, one more than the Oscars, which means there is extra room for some fun surprises.",
      "Frontrunners in the best actress race who have a strong chance at Bafta include Demi Moore (The Substance) for her role as a TV aerobics instructor whose relevance is fading, and Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n (Emilia P\u00e9rez) for playing a newly transitioned woman who used to be a drug baron.",
      "The other dead-certs are Cynthia Erivo (Wicked) for her role as Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Mikey Madison (Anora), for playing a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.",
      "But there's still a chance of a nomination for longlisters such as Marianne Jean-Baptiste (Hard Truths), for her performance as an irritable woman struggling with depression, and Saoirse Ronan (The Outrun) for playing a young alcoholic who returns to Scotland.",
      "Kate Winslet (Lee) could also make it into the category for her role as journalist Lee Miller, as could Amy Adams (Nightbitch) and Nicole Kidman (Babygirl). A nomination for Marisa Abela, for Amy Winehouse biopic Back to Black, would be a particular surprise.",
      "Meanwhile, the best actor category is widely seen as fairly locked down by contenders such as Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) for his role as an architect from Budapest building a new life in the US, and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) for his portrayal of a young Bob Dylan and the conflict between his love of folk music and rock'n'roll.",
      "Colman Domingo (Sing Sing), could be recognised for playing a prison inmate who enrols in a performing arts programme, while Sebastian Stan (The Apprentice) may be nominated for portraying Donald Trump in his early years as a real estate tycoon.",
      "British frontrunners include Daniel Craig (Queer), who plays a gay man who ventures into the jungle in search of a plant with telepathic qualities, and Ralph Fiennes (Conclave), for his role as a cardinal who oversees the race to elect a new Pope.",
      "But don't bet against Bafta also getting behind one or two outsiders such as Hugh Grant (Heretic), Dev Patel (Monkey Man), Kingsley Ben Adir (Bob Marley: One Love) and Jude Law (Firebrand). All are British, and if any of them were going to spring a surprise nomination, the Baftas would be the place it would happen.",
      "The supporting categories, meanwhile, are likely to feature frontrunners such as Zoe Salda\u00f1a (Emilia P\u00e9rez), Ariana Grande (Wicked), Kieran Culkin (A Real Pain) and Yura Borisov (Anora).",
      "But a particular focus of the supporting actor race is whether Denzel Washington (Gladiator II) will be nominated. Despite a decades-long career and nine Oscar nods for acting (including two wins), Washington has never been nominated for a Bafta.",
      "Voting changes",
      "A few years ago, Bafta altered the voting system in some of its major categories in an effort to increase diversity.",
      "It came after no ethnic minority actors were nominated in 2020, with one white actress, Margot Robbie, even being nominated twice for two different movies.",
      "The jury system introduced the following year meant members' votes only determined two of the six slots in the acting categories, while juries decided the other four.",
      "The 2021 shortlists were certainly more diverse as a result, but they were also wildly out of step with the rest of awards season (although the eventual winners broadly matched up with the Oscars).",
      "Bafta kept using the jury system over the following years, although the number of places determined by juries reduced to three.",
      "This year, however, things have changed.",
      "Although juries helped compile this year's longlists, the final nominations for most of the major categories such as the acting prizes are now entirely determined by Bafta members.",
      "As a result, the nominations are more likely to resemble those of other ceremonies, with fewer outliers making the shortlists than in recent years.",
      "The Bafta nominations will be announced by Mia McKenna Bruce and Will Sharpe from Bafta's headquarters in central London at 12:00 GMT.",

      "Best-selling British author Neil Gaiman has reportedly been accused of sexual misconduct by eight women, including four who previously spoke out.",
      "The fantasy graphic novel and science fiction writer - whose books Good Omens, American Gods and The Sandman have been adapted for television - was the subject of a New York Magazine cover story on Monday.",
      "The article - which details fresh claims made against him based on interviews with eight women - follows last year's release of Tortoise Media's podcast Master, which reported the initial accusations.",
      "Gaiman has denied the allegations, posting on his blog on Tuesday: \"I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\"",
      "In July 2024, Tortoise Media reported that Gaiman had been accused of sexual assault and released a podcast series which covered allegations made by five women.",
      "On Monday, New York Magazine and its website Vulture reported allegations from eight women - four of whom also participated in Tortoise's podcast - claiming to have had similar experiences with Gaiman.",
      "One of the women, who had been babysitting Gaiman's five-year-old child, alleges that he offered her a bath in his garden before joining her in the tub naked, asking her to sit on his lap, and that he sexually assaulted her.",
      "While the article states that all of the accusers had at some point played along with Gaiman's desires to some extent by calling him \"master\" and continuing to communicate with him, the women allege that consent and specific BDSM activities which they say took place had not been discussed and agreed upon prior to them happening.",
      "Gaiman's representative's previously told Tortoise that \"sexual degradation, bondage, domination, sadism and masochism may not be to everyone's taste, but between consenting adults, BDSM is lawful\".",
      "The BBC has contacted Gaiman's representatives for further comment.",
      "A police report accusing Gaiman of a sexual assault was made in January 2023, but the investigation was eventually dropped.",
      "Productions affected",
      "Since the allegations first surfaced, several of Gaiman's film and TV projects have been affected.",
      "Season three of Prime Video's Good Omens will now end with one 90-minute episode, with Gaiman no longer involved in the production.",
      "Disney has paused production on its film adaptation of another Gaiman title, The Graveyard Book, while Netflix has cancelled Dead Boy Detectives, although it's not clear if this was related to the allegations.",
      "Season two of The Sandman is still expected to be released this year on Netflix, however, as well as Prime Video's series adaptation of Anansi Boys.",
      "The BBC has contacted Netflix, Prime Video and Disney for a comment.",

    "summary": "Ador accuses the girl group of trying to sign new deals, while still under contract at the label.",
    "story": [
      "The chart-topping K-pop band NewJeans may be prevented from signing advertising deals and other contracts, after their record label filed an injunction against them.",
      "The five-piece are currently engaged in a fierce dispute with Ador, the entertainment company that formed their band in 2022.",
      "Last November, the group claimed their contracts were invalid, due to what they alleged was a pattern of bullying, harassment and subterfuge at the company. Ador, which denied the allegations, sued to have their contracts upheld.",
      "The company is now accusing NewJeans of trying to sign independent deals without its approval, and has taken further legal action in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "\"This decision was made to prevent confusion and potential harm to third parties, including advertisers,\" Ador explained in a statement.",
      "The agency also warned that there could be broader repercussions for South Korea's lucrative music industry if NewJeans' actions went unchecked.",
      "\"Allowing unilateral terminations of exclusive contracts and independent activities without legal procedures could undermine investment in the entertainment industry and destabilise the K-pop sector,\" Ador said in its injunction application, according to the Yonhap News Agency.",
      "NewJeans were considered one of the brightest new bands in K-Pop, thanks to a playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies.",
      "In 2023, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world. Last year, they picked up a nomination for best group at the MTV Awards.",
      "But their relationship with Ador soured after its parent company Hybe allegedly  forced out their mentor, Min Hee-Jin.",
      "The band issued an ultimatum demanding that Min should be restored. When Hybe refused, the group went public with a number of complaints against the label, including the claim that Hybe had deliberately undermined their careers.",
      "K-Pop group NewJeans split from agency in mistreatment row",
      "K-pop star gives tearful testimony on  harassment",
      "Are K-pop stars workers? South Korea says no",
      "Uncertainty for K-Pop band after failed ultimatum",
      "In a press conference last November, the five members - Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein - announced their departure from the company, saying Hybe and Ador had lost the right to represent them as artists.",
      "They subsequently filed court papers seeking a legal separation from the agency, but the case has yet to be heard.",
      "Ador argues that the band's contract, which runs until 2027, should be upheld.",
      "The label has already finalised a schedule for the quintet's next 12 months, which includes releasing a new album and hosting fan meetings, amongst other activities.",
      "However, the band members have continued to assert their independence, creating a new Instagram account under the name \"jeanzforfree\", where they have been hosting regular live-streams with fans.",
      "The band say they will fight to keep their name, and their career, and will remain \"NewJeans at heart\" even if they lose that fight.",
      "It is not the first time that a K-pop band has tried to terminate a contract.",
      "The popular groups TVXQ and Fifty Fifty have both taken their labels to court - but the cases have had mixed results, and both bands have seen their line-ups change as a result.",
      "The biggest problem facing NewJeans is that their case against Ador could take two or three years to settle if it goes to trial. During that time, they're unlikely to be able to record or promote new music, unless the projects are created in conjunction with the label.",
      "If the court eventually finds Hybe was at fault, the members will be able to walk away \u2013 and may even be able to hold on to the band's name.",
      "But if the decision goes against the band, they may face a financial penalty.",
      "In October, the K-pop news site Koreaboo estimated that the members would have to pay about 300bn South Korean Won (about \u00a3170m) to walk away from their contract early."

      "Images of the blood-drenched clothes of a soldier killed in Bosnia were featured on Benetton billboards around the world.",
      "His graphic use of a photo depicting David Kirby, a man dying of Aids, also prompted a boycott of the brand.",
      "Three identical human hearts labelled black, white and yellow hinted at the racism in fashion, while another of his adverts - featuring a priest and nun kissing - was also eventually banned.",
      "He parted company with the brand in 2000 following disputes over his last campaign, which featured images of death row prisoners, captioned \"sentenced to death\".",
      "He has said that his campaigns, which touched on subjects such as human rights, religion and racism, were designed to raise awareness of certain issues.",
      "\"I exploit clothing to raise social issues,\" Toscani told Reuters in an interview at the time, as debate erupted over whether the campaign had gone too far.",
      "\"Traditional advertising says if you buy a certain product, you will be beautiful, sexually powerful, successful. All that doesn't really exist,\" he said.",
      "In 2007, his photo of French model Isabelle Caro for a fashion label's anti-anorexia campaign made headlines.",
      "Her gaunt face and emaciated body, ravaged by the eating disorder, was featured on billboards and in newspapers during Milan fashion week. The campaign coincided with the rise in concern about the use of excessively thin models on the catwalk.",
      "The image, shot for fashion house Nolita, was banned in several countries including Italy, but provoked fierce debate online after going viral.",
      "Toscani resumed working for Benetton in 2017, but three years later, the group cut ties with him after he played down the significance of the Morandi Bridge disaster which killed 43 people.",
      "He is survived by his wife and three children Rocco, Lola and Ali.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:59:47 GMT",
    "summary": "As Love Island All Stars returns, we find out if reality stars can still have a lucrative social media career.",
    "story": [
      "The cast of this year's Love Island All Stars, a spin-off featuring former contestants, has been described as \"dating royalty\" by its makers.",
      "More than half of the 12 islanders heading to the South African villa were finalists on their respective series, while 2022 winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu is also rumoured to be entering later on.",
      "Appearing on Love Island was once seen as a route to independent fame and success.",
      "But could the return of names from some of the show\u2019s most popular series be a sign that the once-profitable pipeline from Islander to influencer or TV star is coming to an end?",
      "Becoming an influencer is a well-worn career path for those leaving Love Island, and past contestants have been paid by brands to sell everything from cosmetics to cars to social media users.",
      "Perhaps the highest achiever in this role has been 2019 series runner-up Molly-Mae Hague, who went on to work as a creative director for fast fashion brand Pretty Little Thing, and has recently launched her own fashion company.",
      "But Molly-Mae appeared on Love Island at the peak of its popularity. The episode in which she and Tommy Fury lost out to winners Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea is still the show's most watched ever, attracting over six million viewers.",
      "Hitting these heights isn't possible for every former cast member, something more recent contestant Tanyel Revan believes aspiring influencers need to be aware of.",
      "\"One thing about this industry that people have to remember is that if you don't maintain it 24/7, which is very hard because it is a bit of a fake lifestyle, you can easily be forgotten,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I think a lot of influencers go back on All Stars because they need to keep up and have that boost,\" she adds.",
      "Tanyel, 28, appeared on a winter series of the show in 2023, when interest was still high (its final was watched by over a million people), but not at the levels Molly-Mae experienced in 2019.",
      "The hairdresser says while she has earned some \"extra income\" from social media influencing, the haircare company she started before entering the villa is what gives her \"stability\".",
      "\"I am a businesswoman who has got my own salon,\" Tanyel adds.",
      "'It's very saturated'",
      "A lot has changed since Love Island first aired in its current form in 2015. More than 300 people have now appeared on the UK edition of the show - being an ex-Islander is no longer an exclusive club.",
      "For a while, finalists enjoyed rumoured six-figure brand deals with fast fashion companies and sponsored Instagram posts that could earn them thousands.",
      "But according to social media expert and co-founder of Sloane House Marketing, Bryleigh Flack, the appetite for this type of content no longer exists.",
      "\"The way we digest content is completely different to how we did even five years ago,\" she says.",
      "\"There are so many adverts, not even just influencer ads but when you are scrolling, even through your friends' [Instagram] stories, you're hit with them, it's very saturated,\" she says.",
      "Bryleigh says big-brand partnerships used to be the best way to make money, but \"appealing to the masses\" is no longer the best strategy for influencers, thanks to newer platforms like TikTok, which use a different algorithm to choose content for users.",
      "She says there is a new type of content creator in 2025 - the \"micro influencer\" - who may not have loads of followers, but has a really engaged and specific audience.",
      "These creators \"really hone in on their audience and know them\", she adds. \"For example, mums with young families or girls that love to go out every weekend, they're completely different people so trying to market to them both won't work.\"",
      "'Just being good looking is not going to get you much'",
      "Billy Brown, who appeared on series eight of Love Island in 2022, says many of the people he was on the show with saw it as an easy route to becoming an influencer.",
      "\"I know a lot of people who came out, quit their job and thought that's it now, but it's not.",
      "\"You can earn a lot of money from that show but if you don't do well, it's not the case,\" says the 25-year-old, who entered the main villa after impressing fellow contestant Tasha Ghouri in second villa Casa Amor.",
      "Billy, who owns businesses in construction and property development, says that days after leaving the show, he was \"getting up at half four in the morning [for work] and then going to a movie premiere at night\".",
      "\"I didn't let it get to my head, I think I was one of the only people who could say 'look, it's not all glitz and glam',\" he adds.",
      "Billy has maintained a social media presence in the years since, featuring content on his construction work alongside more lifestyle and sports-focused material.",
      "He says he still earns some money from influencing but thinks that's due to his personality, rather than his follower count, a relatively modest 115,000. In contrast, Molly-Mae has over eight million.",
      "\"People [who go on the show] need to focus on what they like, instead of just being known for being on Love Island.",
      "\"You have to have something about you, just being good looking is not going to get you much,\" he adds.",
      "'People would do adverts for every single company'",
      "Love Island's cultural relevance has become a topic of conversation in recent years due to falling viewing figures.",
      "At the show's peak in 2019, it achieved an average of nearly six million viewers, with more recent series in 2023 and 2024 attracting around one to two million.",
      "With the reality TV dating genre's recent boost from Netflix shows such as Love is Blind, The Ultimatum and Too Hot to Handle, audiences now have more options than ever at their disposal.",
      "Jake Lee, who runs Alpha Talent Group, represents stars from across sport, entertainment and social media.",
      "He manages boxer Tommy Fury and sports presenter Mac Griffiths (known as Michael on Love Island), who both appeared on the aforementioned 2019 series of the show.",
      "\"People would come off a show and do adverts for every single company, because these companies would want to take advantage of the quick exposure they could get,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"But four or five months down the line you'd be harming your own career, because you'd used your platform the wrong way and there'd be no credibility there,\" he adds.",
      "Jake says more recent reality TV contestants have learnt a lot from the mistakes of their predecessors, who were leaving shows with no real strategy.",
      "\"My biggest piece of advice is to go in with your eyes wide open,\" he cautions.",

    "summary": "The singer, who was one of the breakout stars of 2024, is tipped for even bigger things this year.",
    "story": [
      "Pop star Chappell Roan has won BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025 \u2013 the station's annual poll to identify music's biggest rising stars.",
      "Her win caps a wild 12 months in which she rocketed from relative obscurity to the top of the charts, thanks to her colourful, 80s-influenced brand of synth-pop.",
      "She was named winner by a panel of more than 180 musicians and experts, including Sir Elton John, Dua Lipa and Sound of 2014 winner Sam Smith.",
      "Jack Saunders, who hosts Radio 1's New Music show, said: \"No one deserves this accolade more than Chappell Roan. She was the most exciting artist of the last 12 months and is now set to be the artist of the next 12 months.\"",
      "An exclusive interview with the singer will be published by Radio 1 and BBC News in the coming weeks.",
      "The 26-year-old has had a long path to success.",
      "Born Kayleigh Amstutz, she was brought up in the conservative city of Willard, Missouri, where she attended church three times a week and was taught that being gay was a sin.",
      "She signed her first record deal in 2017, based on the strength of a song she had uploaded to YouTube called Die Young.",
      "Cast as a singer-songwriter in mould of Lorde and Lana Del Rey, she failed to make much of an impact, and was dropped by her label during the pandemic.",
      "But by that stage, she had already recorded a song that would become her calling card.",
      "Titled Pink Pony Club, it was inspired by a visit to an LA gay club, and helped her define a new sound - camp, liberated and packed with singalong choruses.",
      "The experience also spawned her campy stage persona, which she has described as a \"larger-than-life, drag queen version of myself\".",
      "After finding a new record label, she released her debut album, The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess, in September 2023.",
      "A slow-burning success, it only sold a few thousand copies in its first week of release. But word began to spread - and when she played California's Coachella Festival last April, the crowd that turned up for her mid-afternoon set was huge.",
      "More importantly, the show was broadcast on YouTube - going viral after Roan  leaned into the TV cameras and declared: \"I'm your favourite artist's favourite artist.\" The performance has subsequently been watched more than a million times.",
      "Around the same time, she released a stand-alone single called Good Luck, Babe, that talked about her experience of falling in love with her best friend.",
      "\"It's a pop song with a sad element to it,\" she told BBC News last year.",
      "\"It's very common in queer relationships, when someone is still coming to terms with their queerness, [that] they'll kiss 100 boys to 'stop the feeling', as the song says.",
      "\"And it's like, 'Sure, OK. Your time will come.'\"",
      "The single eventually reached number two in the UK charts, and The Rise And Fall Of The Midwest Princess became a number one album after it was re-released on vinyl last summer.",
      "Since then, Roan has been nominated for six Grammy awards, including album of the year, and won best new artist at the Billboard Music Awards in December.",
      "She has also experienced the downside of her sudden fame, and spoke out about the \"creepy behaviour\" of certain fans who \"yelled\" and \"harassed\" her at private moments; and who had approached her family and friends.",
      "The singer has taken time off at the start of 2025 to work on new music, but will headline the Reading & Leeds festival this summer.",

      "Runners-up for this year's prize included jazz outfit Ezra Collective and dance producer Barry Can't Swim.",
      "To qualify, artists could not have had more than two UK top 10 albums or two UK top 10 singles by 30 September 2024.",

      "Frayne told the audience he started his career performing street magic in City Park, where the opening ceremony was held, and that his home city was \"going to make its mark on the world\" in 2025.",
      "Organisers said about 10,000 people turned out to watch the show, which took place in temperatures of -3C (26.6F).",
      "Bradford is the fourth UK City of Culture, a title that is awarded every four years.",
      "The scheme is designed to boost the chosen city's visitor numbers, economies and reputations, and Bradford's year has received \u00a315m government funding.",
      "Other events will include the Turner Prize, a national drawing project inspired by Bradford-born artist David Hockney, and an exhibition about the parallels between boxing and calligraphy.",
      "Frayne said headlining Friday's opening ceremony \"means more than I could ever put into words\".",

      "\"I'm super proud to be from Bradford. It wasn't necessarily the easiest place to grow up... so to be a small, tiny part of this [celebration], it's just incredible.\"",
      "The opening show, titled Rise, involved a cast of 200 including 10-year-old rapper Cruzy T plus poets, musicians and dancers alongside Frayne, with a theme of warts-and-all pride, unity, diversity and overcoming adversity.",
      "On the two stages, scaffold towers formed stacks of boxes containing the performers, as slogans and visuals of the city and its people were projected onto the front.",
      "Projections were also used to transform the towers into Frayne's childhood home, with a young actor playing Frayne as a boy before the real magician enlisted the crowd to take part in a series of tricks.",

      "That exhibition will then tour to Cardiff, Belfast and Glasgow, the first time a City of Culture event has travelled to all four nations of the UK.",
      "Gulzar said winning the City of Culture title had also been instrumental in attracting a new Brit School, which has trained stars including Adele and Tom Holland. It is expected to open in 2027.",

      "Bandleader and drummer Femi Koleoso has a room-filling smile and a zest for life that infuses his music.",
      "\"We're just trying to bring something positive and joyful to whoever will listen,\" he says. \"So anything that exposes us to more people is always gratefully received.\"",
      "Today, that means the honour of being named runner-up in the BBC's Sound Of 2025.",
      "The annual poll, which has been running since 2003, has tipped everyone from 50 Cent and Adele, to Raye and Dua Lipa for success.",
      "Ezra Collective's addition to the list comes relatively late in their career. They've already won the Mercury Prize, for their second album Where I'm Meant To Be, and last November, they became the first jazz act to sell out Wembley Arena.",
      "But to their minds, the band are still newcomers.",
      "Koleoso recalls the thrumming intensity of making his Wembley debut.",
      "\"Fifteen minutes before the gig, I made the horrific mistake of reading the wall backstage,\" he says.",
      "\"They'd put up the names of everyone who'd played there before us. So it was like, 'OK, Beyonc\u00e9 played here, and Jay-Z and Stormzy and Madonna\u2026 And now it's Ezra Collective's turn'.\"",
      "If they were intimidated, it didn't show. The quintet turn audience participation into an artform, venturing out into the crowd and making fans part of their ensemble, almost like a New Orleans parade.",
      "Reviews were ecstatic, calling the show a \"masterclass in musicianship\" that left \"every single person with a smile on their face.\"",
      "As a result, Ezra Collective's name will be added to the Wembley Wall \u2013 but Koleoso wants it to have a radically different effect.",
      "\"Wouldn't it be great if, in 10 years' time, some band is getting intimidated by Beyonc\u00e9 and Madonna, and then they see our name, and they're like, 'Oh yeah, they came into our school to do an assembly - so we'll be fine'?\".",
      "Community and musical kinship is Ezra Collective's foundation stone; one that can be traced back to the youth club Tomorrow's Warriors, where they first met in central London in 2012.",
      "The charity offers training to musicians who can't afford private tuition, with a special focus on \"those with a background from the African Diaspora and girls, who are often under-represented in the music industry\".",
      "\"It's where I met my best friends,\" says Koleoso, who remains a passionate supporter of youth clubs.",
      "\"Not to get too deep, but how do you fix domestic violence or the male suicide rate? You teach a 14-year-old boy how to deal with rejection, how to love people, how to control anger, how to respect others.",

      "When Koleoso first visited Tomorrow's Warriors with his brother TJ, they'd already formed a tight rhythm section in their church band. In fact, Femi had been playing drums since he was four.",
      "\"Maybe I'm slightly biased, but I think the drums are the best instrument, because you can see what's going on,\" he says.",
      "\"When I watch our horn section, I'm hearing thousands of notes, but I'm only seeing three valves. It doesn't quite make sense. But with the drums, you hit them and they make a sound.",
      "\"I wish everything was as simple as that.\"",
      "Tomorrow's Warriors introduced Koleoso to jazz, a genre he'd previously considered elite and inaccessible, and to his future bandmates James Mollison (sax), Ife Ogunjobi (trumpet) and Joe Armon-Jones (keyboards).",
      "Together, they ripped the genre rulebook to shreds, magpie-ing elements of Afrobeat, hip-hop, grime, reggae, Latin, R&B, highlife and jazz to create a sound that bulges with possibility.",
      "\"We're the shuffle generation,\" explains Koleoso. \"We listen to Beethoven and 50 Cent comes on straight after. That influences the way we approach music: We love jazz but at the same time I love salsa too, so why not try and get that in there?\"",
      "After playing their first gig in a Foyles bookshop, they released their debut EP, Chapter 7, in 2016, and a debut album, You Can't Steal My Joy in 2019.",
      "Then Covid hit.",
      "\"We were meant to do a world tour but shortly after we arrived in New Zealand, we were told get back to London because the world was collapsing,\" says Koleoso.",
      "Lockdown inspired their second album, but instead of introspection and gloom, it's an immensely energetic record, fuelled by the promise of post-pandemic reconnection.",
      "\"What we found was we had each other,\" says Koleoso. \"It felt like we were meant to be together, and we made as many tracks as we could that articulate that.\"",
      "When it won the Mercury Prize, the follow-up was already in the bag.",
      "Dance, No-One's Watching was recorded over three days (\"one was just setting up\") at Abbey Road Studios, with the band still slightly worse-for-wear after a weekend at the Notting Hill Carnival.",
      "The idea was to capture the excitement of their live show direct to tape \u2013 with an audience of family and friends to stop them obsessing over the technicalities of recording.",
      "\"What you're hearing is very, very real. We just played it and then had a listen back, and were like, 'Yeah, put it on a vinyl'.\"",
      "That's why the album features a short, aborted performance of Ajala, with Koleoso ordering his bandmates to play harder on the next take.",
      "\"A lot of people think that's a skit, but it was a very real moment,\" he says. \"I wanted the song to go off, but it didn't, so we stopped and tried again.",
      "\"Those things are precious, because they will never happen again.",
      "\"There's a lot of things in the world that don't feel real enough, but music shouldn't be one of them.\"",
      "In contrast to its predecessor, the album is immersed in the real world. Themed around a night out in London, it celebrates the sacred power of dancing and losing yourself in music with other people.",
      "There's even a song titled N29, after the night bus Koleso used to catch home from nights out in London.",
      "Anyone who's braved one of those 3am rides home will recognise the song's mixture of post-club euphoria, random conversations and the backdrop of potential violence.",
      "Koleoso says his first experience of that liminal reality came after his high school prom.",
      "\"Our school got one of those fancy little boats on the Thames and everyone paid their \u00a320, which, for a state school in Enfield, was an impressive night out,\" he recalls.",
      "\"This was at the height of grime and funky house, so I'm just having the best time in my life, dancing on this boat in a suit\u2026 then I missed the last tube home.\"",
      "In a time before Google Maps, it took a while to locate the right bus. When he finally clambered on board, it was carnage.",
      "\"I grew 10 years in that one journey, do you know what I mean?\" he laughs. \"I saw waaaay to much life!\"",
      "His desire to document life in all its messy, wonderful glory is the album's core.",
      "\"In 2022, we got to travel the whole world. We had amazing nights in New Orleans, on colourful streets with so much going on that it's hard to describe.",
      "\"And you'd think, 'How do I get this feeling into a song? I want someone in their flat in Edmonton to get a glimpse of this.'",
      "\"Or you'd go to the shrine in Lagos and be like, 'I need to convey the feeling of the shrine to someone who lives in Cardiff.'\"",
      "Ezra Collective's ever-growing audience suggests they've successfully completed that mission.",
      "But there's one person who'll be surprised: Koleoso's A-level music teacher.",
      "\"Here's the secret, I got a D in music,\" he confesses.",
      "\"I was pretty embarrassed, because it made difficult to convince my parents that playing music was gonna be OK.",
      "\"But what it tells you is that exams can determine one type of intelligence, but they're not the be-all and end-all.",
      "\"If there was an exam in shutting down shows, I think I'd do better than a D.\"",

      "Staff members and musicians signed their names and left messages on the stage before a new carpet was laid over the top.",

      "Access to weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro is often restricted to patients in this category.",

      "The data, published in BMJ Sexual and Reproductive Health, shows a \"shift\" in contraception use in the last five years, from \"more reliable\" hormonal contraceptives such as the pill, to \"fertility awareness-based methods\", say researchers.",
      "Hormonal methods, including the mini pill, fell from 19% in 2018 to 11% in 2023 among tens of thousands of women.",

      "What lies behind the rise of the contraception app?",
      "Period trackers 'coercing' women into sharing risky information",
      "Fertility apps help track fertile days so a woman can know when she would be most likely to get pregnant each month or menstrual cycle.",
      "They rely on measurements like body temperature to predict ovulation (when an egg is released from the ovary).",
      "Companies say they can be as much as 93% reliable when used correctly.",
      "However, they require people to take readings and control when they have sex, avoiding intercourse on days when the app tells them that they may be fertile.",
      "The NHS says if you do not follow the instructions exactly, the method is only 76% effective. This means 24 in 100 women will get pregnant when tracking their fertility for a year.",
      "In comparison, the pill and the mini pill are 91% effective with \"typical use\" and 99% effective with \"perfect\" use.",
      "Hormonal coils or implants, which do not rely on the user remembering to take them, are 99% effective.",
      "For the study, researchers from NHS Forth Valley and the University of Edinburgh compared data from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service for the periods January to June 2018 (33,495 women) and January to June 2023 (55,055 women) to see if contraceptive use changed.",
      "As well as the shift to natural methods, more women reported using no contraceptive at all in 2023 - 70% compared to 56% in 2018.",
      "It is impossible to say what is driving the trends, but difficulty accessing sexual health services during the Covid pandemic may be a factor, say the study authors.",
      "Lead researcher Dr Rosie McNee told the BBC: \"Something that really needs scrutiny is the surge in the use of ehealth, including fertility apps and period trackers.",
      "\"The market has exploded. There are hundreds of them and some are more reliable than others. Plus you don't need a prescription, and so you may not get all the information you need.\"",
      "She said some tracking apps are designed to track periods rather than fertility or family planning.",
      "Abortion provider MSI Reproductive Choices UK told the BBC it too has seen more women using fertility awareness methods.",
      "Tanya Lane, contraception lead, explained: \"This could be a result of the rise in popularity of social media platforms like TikTok, which has seen more people sharing their experiences...and content creators doing paid partnerships with brands of fertility awareness methods that might be influencing people to choose this option.",
      "Long waits for appointments at GP surgeries and sexual health clinics could also be a factor.",
      "\"People are waiting months for appointments in some areas of the UK, especially for long-acting methods like the coil and implant.\"",
      "She said that any woman thinking of switching to fertility tracking should speak to a medical professional.",
      "Dr Melanie Davis-Hall, Medical Director at women's health review platform The Lowdown, said: \"The key here is to reduce the spread of misinformation and the use of apps and methods that are not approved fertility awareness methods so people know they are equivalent to not using contraception. Then we need to address why people are ditching hormonal and non hormonal contraception and the role the spread of misinformation plays in this.\"",
      "Paula Baraitser, medical director of the NHS-partnered free sexual health service provider SH:24, said there could be many reasons why women are switching, including concerns about future fertility and possible side effects.",
      "The risks can range from mild side effects to rare but potentially serious complications.",
      "She told the BBC: \"Many people will use contraception for 30 years of their lives.",
      "\"People's experience of hormonal contraception is highly variable and ultimately we need a larger choice of methods to enable people to find one that suits them.",
      "\"There have been few new methods of contraception in the last 50 years, reflecting a lack of investment in research in this area.\"",
      "The sexual health charity Brook said many women use hormonal contraception not simply to prevent pregnancy, but to manage their menstrual health, to make periods lighter and more predictable.",

    "story": [
      "This is the fifth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK.",
      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

      "\"There is the very high risk of generative AI tools not providing full and complete, or correct diagnoses or treatment pathways, and even giving wrong diagnoses or treatment pathways i.e. producing hallucinations or basing outputs on clinically incorrect training data,\u201d says Ms Dennis.",
      "\u201cAI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use \u2013 which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.\u201d",
      "She says specialist medical products must be regulated and receive some form of official accreditation.",
      "\u201cThe NHS would also want to ensure that all data that is inputted into the tool is retained securely within the NHS system infrastructure, and is not absorbed for further use by the provider of the tool as training data without the appropriate GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] safeguards in place.\"",
      "For now, for GPs like Misra-Sharp, it has transformed their work. \u201cIt has made me go back to enjoying my consultations again instead of feeling time pressured.\u201d"

      "'Financial strain'",
      "The couple said to fund the treatment they had switched to an interest-only mortgage.",

      "Figures obtained by the BBC via a Freedom of Information request to the NHS Business Services Authority show that in 2023-24 a total of 14.7m tablets of controlled ADHD medication were prescribed privately to an estimated 30,000 patients.",
      "The most commonly prescribed drug, methylphenidate, can cost private patients between \u00a315 and \u00a350 per month. Whilst lisdexamfetamine and dexamfetamine can cost patients between \u00a350 and \u00a3130 per month.",

      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her.",

      "Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year.",
      "Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies.",

      "He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\".",

      "Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\".",
      "In the letter, Sir Laurie said: \"A lack of records and lapse of time has meant that, unfortunately, I have not been able to obtain comprehensive comfort in relation to all the UK property-related matters referred to in the media.",

      "Sir Laurie said Siddiq had \"explained the context\" of that visit as \"solely for the social purpose of joining family and enjoying the tourist access to the city facilitated as a result of her aunt's official visit as head of state\".",
      "He said Siddiq had been clear that she had \"no involvement in any inter-governmental discussions between Bangladesh and Russia or any form of official role\".",
      "\"I accept this at face value,\" he said, \"but should note that this visit may form part of investigations in Bangladesh.\"",
      "Sir Laurie added that Siddiq was a \"prominent member of one of the principal families involved in Bangladesh politics\" which had \"exposed her to allegations of misconduct by association\".",
      "\"Given the nature of Ms Siddiq's ministerial responsibilities... it is regrettable that she was not more alert to the potential reputational risks - both to her and the government - arising from her close family's association with Bangladesh,\" he said.",

      "The embattled and heavily criticised chair of the miscarriages of justice review body the Criminal Cases Review Commission has resigned.",
      "Helen Pitcher had been criticised for the agency's failings in relation to the Andy Malkinson affair,  which saw Mr Malkinson spend 17 years in jail for a rape he did not commit.",
      "Ms Pitcher told the Times in an interview that she had been made a scapegoat.",
      "Mr Malkinson called Ms Pitcher's statement \"shameless\", adding: \"I know what it truly is like to be a scapegoat.\"",
      "The BBC understands Mrs Pitcher spoke to the newspaper before telling ministers or senior members of the commission that she was resigning.",
      "A government source said Ms Pitcher had \"jumped as she was pushed\", as the prime minister had received an independent recommendation to advise the King to remove her from office.",
      "Last summer, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood began the formal process of sending a recommendation to the King that Ms Pitcher should go, after personally concluding that she was not fit to head the CCRC.",
      "That decision came after a damning independent report into how the CCRC had mishandled Mr Malkinson's pleas for help, and how the chair herself had presented its work on his case.",
      "While he was in jail, the CCRC twice rejected Mr Malkinson's submissions that he was innocent. The second of those rejections came after Mrs Pitcher had become chair in 2018.",
      "He was only cleared in 2023 after exhaustive work by his own legal team tracked down the long-available DNA evidence that showed another man must have committed the rape in 2003.",
      "The first of two independent reviews - commissioned by the CCRC itself - found that the body  had failed to complete basic work that could have cast doubt on Mr Malkinson's conviction. It said Mrs Pitcher's statements as chair had not properly reflected these failings.",
      "A second, judge-led, inquiry into wider alleged failings into all agencies, including  Greater Manchester Police which first accused Mr Malkinson of the crime, is continuing.",
      "Despite the criticisms of Ms Pitcher, ministers had no power to sack her directly because the CCRC is an independent criminal justice body.",
      "The chair is appointed by the King to ensure the agency's separation from ministers, prosecutors and judges.",
      "That meant the Ministry of Justice had to exceptionally set up an independent panel to assess whether Ms Pitcher was fit to remain in office.",
      "The panel's majority findings led Mahmood to send a recommendation to the prime minister to advise the King to remove the chair. The full details of the panel's report are confidential.",
      "Had Ms Pitcher not quit, it is thought she would have been the first public servant in modern times to be sacked by the monarch under such a process.",
      "'Scapegoat' claim",
      "In her resignation letter, Mr Pitcher said she had been made a scapegoat by Alex Chalk KC, the Conservatives' last justice secretary.",
      "Mr Chalk, who the BBC has contacted, did not start the process to remove Ms Pitcher but had launched the judge-led inquiry into the actions of all agencies in the Malkinson case.",

      "\"Serious questions remain for Greater Manchester Police and the Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "\"I note that the DPP [the director of public prosecutions, who heads the CPS] and the chief constable of the GMP have not been the subject of comparable criticism.",
      "\"It feels unfair that I, who supported sending Mr Malkinson's case back to judges, have been singled out.\"",

      "Champion, the Labour MP for Rochdale, has called for a national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs, with councils leading the investigations.",

    "story": [
      "UK laws on internet safety are \"very uneven\" and \"unsatisfactory\", Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has said, following calls from campaigners to tighten the rules.",
      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",
      "In July 2022, Badenoch, who was not then a minister, said the bill was in \"no fit state to become law\" adding: \"We should not be legislating for hurt feelings.\"",
      "Another Conservative MP, David Davis, said it risked \"the biggest accidental curtailment of free speech in modern history\".",
      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",
      "He did not commit to making changes to the current legislation but said he was \"very open-minded\" on the subject.",
      "He also said the act contained some \"very good powers\" he was using to \"assertively\" tackle new safety concerns and that in the coming months ministers would get the powers to make sure online platforms were providing age-appropriate content.",
      "Companies that did not comply with the law would face \"very strident\" sanctions, he said.",

      "He said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Elon Musk, owner of the social media site X, were \"at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry\".",
      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",
      "Responding to Russell's criticism, a Meta spokesperson told the BBC there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and said the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",
      "Rules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide.",
      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",
      "The law also requires companies to take action against illegal, state-sponsored disinformation. If their services are likely to be accessed by children they should also take steps to protect users against misinformation."

      "Ian Russell's voice hard for Starmer to ignore",
      "No one watching or listening to Mr Russell over the years could deny his passion for change or his deep knowledge of the dark world that Molly was caught up in. Along with other bereaved parents we have met in the past couple of years - including Esther Ghey, Judy Thomas, and Mariano Janin - he has told his family's story with huge dignity, and for a simple reason: he doesn't want anyone else to go through the pain.",
      "He's become a prominent campaigner on an issue that is important to millions of parents and young people around the country. His voice is hard for the government to ignore.",
      "But creating and then imposing rules on the online world is difficult for politicians for many reasons.",

The Internet Watch Foundation boss, Derek Ray-Hill, also told us: \"Unless Ofcom is more ambitious in its interpretation of the Act, so many of the things the legislation makes possible will remain frustratingly out of reach.\"",
      "There is a sense in Whitehall of \"wait and see\". Ministers have acknowledged that as technology advances, extra laws might be required. The Home Office is expected in the next couple of weeks to outline new offences to tackle child abuse online.

      "Dear Prime Minister,",
      "Six months ago, you were elected on a platform that promised an end to short-term sticking plaster solutions. I am writing to you as a bereaved father and online safety campaigner because it is evident that urgent action is required to protect young people from the horrors they are routinely exposed to online.",
      "It's now over seven years since the death of my youngest daughter Molly. More than ever before, I am convinced that strong and effective online safety regulation is the most powerful tool available to prevent the loss of ever more young lives at the hands of social media platforms whose indifference to children's safety is fundamentally baked into their commercial strategies, business models and products.",
      "However, in recent months it has become clear that progress towards online safety has stalled \u2013 and we are now going backwards. Regulation as it is currently designed is failing to deliver the protection that children and parents need, want and deserve. No one can credibly claim that Ofcom's implementation of the Online Safety Act is anything other than a disaster \u2013 a view not only shared widely by civil society but also increasingly privately shared across many parts of your Government.",
      "Ofcom's choices when implementing the Act have starkly highlighted intrinsic structural weaknesses with the legislative framework. We not only have a regulator which has fundamentally failed to grasp the urgency and scale of its mission, but a regulatory model that inherently and significantly constrains its ability to reduce preventable harms.",
      "While I understand that this is legislation you inherited and did not design, the reality is that unless you now commit to act decisively to fix the Online Safety Act, the streams of life-sucking content seen by children will soon become torrents: a digital disaster driven by the actions of tech firms, and being left unchallenged by a failing regulatory model. This preventable harm would be happening on your watch.",
      "At the same time as the UK's overdue regulation is falling badly short, the very industry being regulated is ominously changing. The Online Safety Act was developed around a premise that large tech firms would increasingly accept their responsibilities, and we would see safer social networks develop over time.",
      "However, this is a time when platforms readily say they will now 'catch less of the bad stuff'; allow underdeveloped AI to generate and spread disinformation; and promote targeted and polarising content leading to isolation and despair. We have now entered a different era, and we will need a different regulatory approach that can address it.",
      "Put simply, people like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry. We should be in absolutely no doubt that when Zuckerberg speaks about a 'cultural tipping point towards prioritizing speech', he is signalling a profound strategic shift away from fundamental safety measures towards a laissez-faire, anything goes model. In this bonfire of digital ethics and online safety features, all of us will lose, but our children lose the most.",
      "It's on that basis that I now encourage you to act swiftly and decisively to address this coming flood of preventable harm. In the immediate term, that means strengthening the existing framework. Beyond that, it means committing to substantially strengthened regulatory model \u2013 with primary legislation being introduced as soon as possible to enact its provisions.",
      "It is not just a new Online Safety Act that is required, but a wholesale re-imagining of the framework to ensure it is capable of responding to the threats of today and beyond. A new framework must be fundamentally oriented towards tackling the reckless behaviours of social media leadership \u2013 a goal which can best be achieved through establishing an overarching Duty of Care supported by a robust set of conduct-based rules to enforce it.",
      "A bolstered OSA must have harm reduction at its core. That means having a clear harm reduction duty on Ofcom, transparency and safety-by-design as integral components of the regulatory regime, and a regulatory design that puts victims at its core \u2013 a major failure of the current regime, where the asymmetry between the interests of victims and industry has if anything been substantially reinforced. The voices of those with lived experience must be heard clearly if big tech's powerful players are not to shout them down in this debate.",
      "Crucially, this must also mean an extension of the Duty of Candour to extend to tech firms. This vital measure stands to correct the historic injustices faced by so many victims, and the power of this measure to address the cultural issues driving harms in the tech sector \u2013 and the asymmetry between industry and victims which perpetuates further harm \u2013 would be considerable.",
      "Too many parents have lost hope that governments will deliver the online safety reform they urgently need. Among bereaved families, there is widespread dismay that successive governments have chosen to dither and delay when the consequences of inaction has been further lost lives.",
      "As Prime Minister and as a father, I implore you to act. You now have a profound opportunity, but also a great responsibility, to act clearly and decisively and to show to millions of parents across this country that meaningful change is on the way. It is time to decisively protect children and young adults from the perils of our online world.",

      "Asked whether the government was ruling out another inquiry, Ms Nandy said: \"The reason I think that people have heard from us that there may at some point in the future be another inquiry is because child abuse by its very nature is hidden, it's secretive, and, at various points, I'm sure that more will come out about the scandals that we've heard.\"",

      "The prime minister has warned that launching a further inquiry could delay action on tackling child sexual abuse, though he noted there was no \"fixed view\" among survivors on whether one was needed.",

      "On Wednesday, the Commons rejected a Conservative amendment to the government's Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which called for another national inquiry.",
      "The Tories accused Labour MPs of having \"turned a blind eye to justice\" for victims of grooming gangs.",
      "The bill, which includes measures aimed at protecting children and tougher rules around home-schooling, as well as changes to academies, would have been killed off if MPs had voted through the Tory amendment.",
      "Burnham said that while he supported a limited, new inquiry, MPs were right to vote down Conservative \"opportunism\".",
      "Labour peer and former deputy party leader Baroness [Harriet] Harman has also said issues raised by the grooming gangs scandal should be looked at in closer detail.",
      "\"Whether it's a task force, whether it's more action plans, whether it's a mini inquiry on this, this is something that we need to develop resilience in,\" she told Sky News.",
      "Ministers have suggested they are keeping an open mind about a future investigation if it becomes clear that survivors want one, along with the implementation of Prof Jay's recommendations.",
      "But Nandy said she had spoken to survivors who had given evidence to the Jay inquiry and had begun to lose faith in the process leading to concrete action.",
      "\"We can not possibly ask victims to go through that again when not one single one of those recommendations has been implemented.",
      "\"Our message to victims is we understand the time for action is long overdue and we are acting. The time for talking is over, the time for action is now,\" she said.",
      "However, she added the government was not ruling out a future inquiry \"because child abuse by its very nature is hidden, it's secretive, and, at various points, I'm sure that more will come out about the scandals that we've heard\".",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 17:34:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts say the UK has enough gas after Centrica said storage levels were \"concerningly low\".",
    "story": [
      "The UK has enough gas to meet winter demand, the network operator has said, after British Gas owner Centrica warned about \"concerningly low\" storage levels.",
      "Centrica, which owns the country's largest gas storage facility, said the UK had \"less than a week of gas demand in store\" due to colder-than-usual weather.",
      "But National Gas, which owns the UK gas network, said the UK gets its gas from \"a diverse range of sources\" and that storage \"remains healthy\".",
      "Energy analysts said even if gas storage did run low, the UK could buy in more from Europe and other countries.",
      "Centrica has said that UK gas storage facilities are currently about half-full.",
      "\"Plunging temperatures and high demand for gas-fired power stations have reduced UK winter gas storage to concerningly low levels,\" it said.",
      "\"Stubbornly high\" gas prices had made it \"more difficult to top up storage\", the company added.",
      "Parts of the UK are experiencing freezing conditions, with extremely low night-time temperatures forecast in some areas.",
      "Gas central heating is the most common way that households heat their homes. Around three in four households (74%) in England and Wales said it was their only central heating source in 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "National Gas, which owns and operates nearly 5,000 miles of the UK's gas transmission system, said the \"overall picture across Great Britain's eight main gas storage sites remains healthy with average levels at just over 60% across the board\".",
      "It added it was \"well-placed to respond to demand this winter\".",
      "Energy prices rise with warnings of more pain to come",
      "Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said that there are various gas pipelines running from Europe to the UK, and the country also gets shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG).",
      "Given household energy prices are currently capped until the end of March, any shortage would be very unlikely to affect consumer bills, he said.",
      "If there was a short-term spike in wholesale prices, this could affect some business customers, he said.",
      "However, the weather in the UK is forecast to become milder from Tuesday meaning a spike may not happen, he added.",
      "Wholesale prices are currently lower than they were at the beginning of the year.",
      "\"There does not appear to be a risk of a physical shortage in UK gas supply this winter,\" said Jack Sharples, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.",
      "As well as LNG, Dr Sharples said the UK still gets some gas from North Sea fields and there are pipelines running to the UK from Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium.",
      "The government said it was \"confident the UK has enough natural gas supplies to make it through the winter\".",
      "Hydrogen push",
      "Gas inventory levels have come under pressure from the cold weather conditions and the end of Russian gas pipeline supplies through Ukraine at the end of last month.",
      "The UK has relatively little capacity to store gas, but has more than it did compared with a few years ago.",
      "About half of the capacity it has is at Centrica's Rough facility off the coast of East Yorkshire.",
      "This was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "There is also LNG storage at three terminals, and other smaller facilities across the country.",
      "If the UK needed more gas, traders would have access to EU stocks, provided they paid the right price.",
      "Centrica wants to invest \u00a32bn in the Rough facility, so it can use it to store more gas, then hydrogen as the UK starts to burn less natural gas to meet green targets.",
      "It has been pushing the government to say hydrogen will be part of the UK energy mix in the future to justify that investment."

      "Former Prime Minister Liz Truss has sent a legal \"cease and desist\" letter to Sir Keir Starmer demanding he stop saying she \"crashed the economy\".",
      "Her lawyers argue the claim made repeatedly by Sir Keir is \"false and defamatory\", and harmed her politically in the run-up to losing her South West Norfolk seat in the general election.",

      "Earlier, Commons leader Lucy Powell told MPs \"we won't cease and desist from telling the truth that they [the Conservatives] crashed the economy\".",
      "Also speaking in the Commons, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said the previous Conservative government had \"ruined the lives of people across this country\" through their \"hubris\" and \"recklessness\".",
      "It comes as the pound fell to its lowest level in over a year and government borrowing costs have surged to their highest level in 16 years.",
      "Economists have warned these rising costs could force further tax rises or cuts in spending as the government tries to meet its self-imposed rule not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending.",
      "Responding to an urgent question in the Commons, Jones insisted there was \"no need for an emergency intervention\" in financial markets.",
      "Movements in borrowing costs were being driven by \"a wide range of international and domestic factors,\" he said.",

      "A \"cease and desist\" letter usually represents a warning that the recipient will face legal action if they continue the allegedly unlawful activity.",
      "In the letter sent to Sir Keir on Thursday, Truss's lawyers say his statements about their client are \"false and misleading\".",
      "\"Their publication is not only extremely damaging but also grossly defamatory and indefensible... It would be hard to avoid a conclusion that they were made maliciously,\" the letter adds.",
      "Truss's lawyers say they are seeking \"an amicable basis on which you will agree to cease repetition of what is clearly a factually incorrect and defamatory statement about our client.",

      "But in a video posted on X after Downing Street's comments, Truss said Labour, the Bank of England and \"the media establishment smeared my budget and forced a reversal\".",
      "\"Now, they've plunged the country into economic crisis,\" she added.",

      "When David Lammy is asked about the new government's relations with the incoming US administration, he likes to talk about the dinner he and the prime minister had with Donald Trump in New York last September.",
      "\"We had a very good meal,\" the foreign secretary said on Thursday. \"We had a long time to discuss the issues. He was an extremely gracious host, very affable, very warm indeed about our great country.\"",
      "And throughout a series of media interviews, briefings and a speech at the Foreign Office, Lammy talked up UK-US relations, even daring to speak of a \"special relationship\", a phrase largely avoided by diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "The UK and the US, he said, were \"required to work very closely together\" on global challenges.",
      "They include challenges such as the wars in Europe and the Middle East and what he called \"the growing problems in Sudan\". He cited the \"close cooperation\" between both countries on military and intelligence matters.",
      "But what was striking was how far the foreign secretary was willing to challenge Trump only days before his inauguration.",
      "The president-elect's refusal to rule out military action against Greenland was, Lammy said, an example of his \"destabilising\" rhetoric.",
      "His language was more measured than that of French and German politicians and he said Trump was focused on Arctic security - but he insisted such an attack by one member of Nato on another was \"simply not going to happen\".",
      "He said Trump was right to ask Europe to do more to defend itself but questioned his call for Nato members to spend 5% of their national income on defence, noting the US was itself spending only 3.38 %.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier in the day, Lammy had cast doubt on Trump's campaign promise of a quick ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "\"I see no evidence that Putin wants to come to the table to negotiate,\" he said.",
      "\"I think the indications are, from what I've seen over the last few days, a slight pushback on this sense that somehow a deal will be achieved on 21 January, I think that's now unlikely. And we're hearing that actually the timetable's moved down somewhat towards Easter.\"",
      "Musk looms large over UK politics as MPs return for 2025",
      "How Elon Musk seized on baseless memo claim to fuel wave of misinformation",
      "Lammy played down the influence of Elon Musk, the wealthy ally of Trump who in recent days has personally attacked British ministers on X. He said the tech boss would have only a \"domestic portfolio\" in the new administration and his role had not come up in talks between British and Trump officials.",
      "The foreign secretary also emphasised the need to engage with China \u2013 on trade, climate, health and artificial intelligence - and urged the country \"not to throw in its lot\" with Russia. This position is at odds with that held by Trump allies who see China already as a key member of an anti-Western axis including Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "Lammy calls his approach to foreign policy \"progressive realism\". He said this means seeking progressive ends while accepting the world as it is.",
      "When applying this framework to Trump, he said he will be guided more by the president-elect's actions than his rhetoric. We shall learn in coming days how far the two remain apart.",
      "And as for that dinner with Trump last autumn, Lammy rarely mentions the fact the meal was almost the cause of a diplomatic upset.",
      "He and Sir Keir Starmer were presented with large plates of Guyanese chicken, somewhat to the dismay of the vegetarian prime minister.",
      "In the national interest, the foreign secretary was obliged to eat more chicken that night than he might have expected."

      "On Boxing Day, it announced its membership figures had surpassed those of the Conservatives. There was then a spat with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch over whether those numbers were correct.",

      "Reform UK members gathering on an icily cold Friday evening at Sandown Racecourse for the party's South East conference weren't disheartened by the possible loss of a rich and influential backer.",

      "\"I think Reform got away lightly... Nigel has handled it diplomatically. I don't think he can afford to have Musk too close.",
      "\"He is destructive, he could destroy Reform.\"",
      "There are about 850 attendees at Sandown, according to the organisers, who say it was a sold out event.",

      "Like many here he is not bothered about Musk. \"Let him talk away,\" he says.",

    "story": [
      "It has not been a good week for Chancellor Rachel Reeves.",
      "Government borrowing costs have hit their highest level in 16 years and the pound has fallen to a 14-month low against the dollar.",
      "She has gone on a planned trip to China amid accusations from opposition parties that she is leaving at a moment of economic peril.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is accompanying her on the trip. The 12-hour flight to Beijing is probably the length of the meeting she might have wanted to have with him.",
      "So how serious are the recent movements on the markets and what could happen as a result?",
      "Budget plans need to be tweaked",
      "While the markets stabilised from Thursday lunchtime, the move against UK government debt is already enough to cause a problem for the chancellor's Budget maths.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. The Treasury has said these fiscal rules, set out in the Budget, are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "At times over the past week the markets have looked pretty fragile for Britain, with both government borrowing costs going up and sterling falling back at the same time. That is a key marker.",
      "While it's true that the overall direction for the markets over the past month has been set by an assessment of the inflationary consequences of President-elect Trump's trade and economic policies, the UK has been getting some special attention in addition.",
      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",
      "No impact on mortgages so far",
      "The impact on budgetary maths is real, but the wider impact that might be expected - of higher borrowing costs for companies and for households - has not yet materialised.",
      "The mortgage market has yet to see an increase in rates for fixed-term mortgages, as occurred rapidly in the panic after the 2022 mini-Budget. There is a curious calm.",
      "One explanation lies in what is not happening. This time last year the major lenders greatly discounted mortgages in a battle for market share ahead of the key moments for house buying. This has not happened this year, and may yet have a consequence in the property market.",
      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "Many economists say this is the wrong call, and believe rates will be cut multiple times. There's quite a lot of uncertainty here, and the key Bank of England committee is split. The Bank's words will be very carefully watched.",
      "More positively for the economy, despite a lot of rhetoric from retailers, many have delivered strong results and have not lowered their profits expectations. Are consumers a bit more robust than had been assumed, and could this drive some growth in 2025?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Growth strategy needs a reboot",
      "The problem of servicing higher interest payments on the national debt increases the likelihood of the Treasury making plans for an adjustment, based on a squeeze on spending. A \u00a310bn cut will hurt, but with a majority of 170 MPs in the House of Commons, and an ongoing spending review already in train, it can be done.",
      "In these circumstances, with the credible threat of a global trade war, for example, it should be noted that Rachel Reeves' new fiscal rules do have an escape hatch.",
      "In the event of \"an emergency or a significant negative economic shock to the economy\" the chancellor may \"temporarily suspend the fiscal mandate\".",
      "While a global trade war could qualify, it would be difficult optics to suspend a \"non-negotiable\" and \"iron-clad\" set of rules before they had really bitten. The rules have not yet formally passed into law yet either, and remain a \"draft\" until the Commons votes to approve them.",
      "It seems very unlikely that this route will be taken unless there is a very clear economic shock in the coming weeks.",
      "The bigger point here is what matters in the markets, which is whether the UK is pursuing a credible set of policies, a convincing overall strategy.",
      "Labour's focus on stability at all costs was understandable after the humiliation of Liz Truss's mini-Budget. But \"stability\" is not a growth strategy.",
      "Pursuing green growth by borrowing for long-term capital investment is a potential strategy, and it underpinned \"Bidenomics\" in the US. The incoming government embraced the rhetoric of US policy under the outgoing president, without the same firepower. \"Bidenomics without the money\", you might say.",
      "But now the new Trump administration is jettisoning this approach, rightly or wrongly, and the markets are less convinced that such a strategy will pay for itself. It will cost more to fund such a strategy, and require harsher trade-offs than expected.",
      "Bidenomics without the money and without Biden is much too thin. A more detailed strategy for sustained growth is needed, and in short order.",

      "Governments generally spend more than they raise in tax so they borrow money to fill the gap, usually by selling bonds to investors.",
      "As well as eventually paying back the value of the bond, governments pay interest at regular intervals so investors receive a stream of future payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. They are mainly bought by financial institutions, such as pension funds.",
      "Interest rates - known as the yield -  on government bonds have been going up since around August.",
      "The yield on a 10-year bond has surged to its highest level since 2008, while the yield on a 30-year bond is at its highest since 1998, meaning it costs the government more to borrow over the long term.",
      "The pound has also fallen in value against the dollar over the past few days. On 7 January it was worth $1.25 but it has now fallen to just above $1.21.",

      "The US economy created more jobs than forecast last month which has added to expectations that US rates will remain higher than previously forecast, and this has helped to push up the value of the dollar.",
      "How does it affect me?",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged that all day-to-day spending should be  funded from taxes, not from borrowing.",
      "But if she needs more money to pay back higher borrowing costs, that uses up more tax revenue, leaving less money to spend on other things.",
      "Economists have warned that this could mean spending cuts which would affect public services, and tax rises that could hit people's pay or businesses' ability to grow and hire more people.",
      "The government has committed to having only one fiscal event a year, where it can raise taxes, and this is not expected until the autumn.",
      "So if higher borrowing costs persist, we may be more likely to see cuts to spending before that or at least lower spending increases than would otherwise happen.",
      "Some people may be wondering about the impact of higher gilt yields on the mortgage market, particularly after what happened after Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022.",
      "Although yields are higher now than they were then, they have been creeping up slowly over a period of months, whereas in 2022 they shot up over a couple of days.",
      "That speedy rise led to lenders quickly pulling deals while they tried to work out what interest rate to charge.",
      "Analysts and brokers say the current unease in the markets is having some effect on the pricing of mortgages. Many were expecting to see some falls in rates at the start of the year but instead lenders are holding off from cuts to see what happens.",
      "However, the market is favourable to anyone currently buying an annuity - a product from an insurance company that gives a retirement income for the rest of their life, bought only once.",
      "One annuity expert told the BBC many people would get a better deal now than at any time since 2008, because annuity rates usually move in line with gilt yields.",

      "A wave of social media posts - including some amplified by Mr Musk - allege that a 2008 Home Office document advised police not to intervene in child grooming cases because victims had \"made an informed choice about their sexual behaviour\".",
      "But BBC Verify has carried out extensive searches of Home Office circulars issued across that period and found no evidence that any document containing this advice exists.",

      "In one post, which has received over 25 million views, Mr Musk alleged that \"Gordon Brown sold those little girls for votes\" while reposting another user, June Slater, using words that were apparently a variation of the memo claim.",
      "The original unfounded claim about a Home Office circular to police seems to stem from an interview Nazir Afzal - the former Crown Prosecution Service chief prosecutor for north-west England - gave to the BBC on 19 October 2018. He now admits that he had not seen any such circular himself, despite apparently stating its existence as fact.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, he told presenter Carolyn Quinn at the time:",
      "\"You may not know this, but back in 2008 the Home Office sent a circular to all police forces in the country saying 'as far as these young girls who are being exploited in their towns and cities we believe they have made an informed choice about their sexual behaviour and therefore it's not for you police officers to get involved in\".",

      "Instead he now says he was referring to police officers who had told him some officers had misinterpreted instructions in a circular sent by the Home Office.",
      "Mr Afzal pointed us to Home Office circular 017/2008 which is about the police's powers under the 1989 Children's Act.",

      "It seems difficult to understand how any police officer could misconstrue this section in the way Mr Afzal described in his 2018 interview",
      "He told BBC Verify he was \"paraphrasing what I thought that meant to them\", when he gave his Radio 4 interview.",
      "Asked how officers could have interpreted circular 17/2008 in this way, Mr Afzal said:",
      "\"You're right, it doesn't stack up. It doesn't give an excuse or explanation, but I can't give you any other circular.\"",
      "BBC Verify also asked Mr Afzal if he could put us in touch with any of the officers that may have misinterpreted the circular in way he described, but he was unable to do this.",

      "\"The term \"child prostitute\" was used extensively to describe them and it should be noted both that the Home Office in a circular to police in 2008 used that term and spoke of girls making an \"informed choice\" to engage in this behaviour. Parliament only finally removed the term from all laws a couple of years ago.\"",

      "There were circulars in 2007 and 2010 that contained the phrase \"child prostitute\". The first was in connection with some technical changes to offences like \"controlling a child prostitute\". The second again dealt with technical changes but this circular on prostitution also said: \"In short, any steps taken, whether relating to criminal proceedings or not, should be designed to protect the child from continuing sexual exploitation and abuse.\"",

      "The Met Office, Nasa and other climate groups are due to release their own data later on Friday. All are expected to agree that 2024 was the warmest on record, although precise figures vary slightly.",

      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "The 1.5C figure has become a powerful symbol in international climate negotiations ever since it was agreed in Paris in 2015, with many of the most vulnerable countries considering it a matter of survival.",
      "The risks from climate change, such as intense heatwaves, rising sea-levels and loss of wildlife, would be much higher at 2C of warming than at 1.5C, according to a landmark UN report from 2018.",
      "Yet the world has been moving closer and closer to breaching the 1.5C barrier.",
      "\"When exactly we will cross the long-term 1.5C threshold is hard to predict, but we're obviously very close now,\" says Myles Allen of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, and an author of the UN report.",
      "The current trajectory would likely see the world pass 1.5C of long-term warming by the early 2030s. This would be politically significant, but it wouldn't mean game over for climate action.",
      "\"It's not like 1.49C is fine, and 1.51C is the apocalypse - every tenth of a degree matters and climate impacts get progressively worse the more warming we have,\" explains Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.",
      "Even fractions of a degree of global warming can bring more frequent and intense extreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall.",
      "In 2024, the world saw blistering temperatures in west Africa, prolonged drought in parts of South America, intense rainfall in central Europe and some particularly strong tropical storms hitting north America and south Asia.",
      "These events were just some of those made more intense by climate change over the last year, according to the World Weather Attribution group.",
      "Even this week, as the new figures are released, Los Angeles has been overwhelmed with destructive wildfires fuelled by high winds and a lack of rain.",
      "While there are many contributing factors to this week's events, experts say conditions conducive to fires in California are becoming more likely in a warming world.",
      "It wasn't only air temperatures that set new marks in 2024. The world's sea surface also reached a new daily high, while the total amount of moisture in the atmosphere reached record levels.",
      "That the world is breaking new records is not a surprise: 2024 was always expected to be hot, because of the effect of the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern - which ended around April last year - on top of human-caused warming.",
      "But the margin of several records in recent years has been less expected, with some scientists fearing it could represent an acceleration of warming.",
      "\"I think it's safe to say that both 2023 and 2024 temperatures surprised most climate scientists - we didn't think we'd be seeing a year above 1.5C this early,\" says Dr Hausfather.",
      "\"Since 2023 we've had around 0.2C of extra warming that we can't fully explain, on top of what we had expected from climate change and El Ni\u00f1o,\" agrees Helge G\u00f6\u00dfling, a climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.",
      "Various theories have been suggested to explain this 'extra' warmth, such as an apparent reduction in the low-level cloud cover that tends to cool the planet, and prolonged ocean heat following the end of El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "\"The question is whether this acceleration is something persistent linked to human activities that means we will have steeper warming in the future, or whether it is a part of natural variability,\" Dr G\u00f6\u00dfling adds.",
      "\"At the moment it's very hard to say.\"",
      "Despite this uncertainty, scientists stress that humans still have control over the future climate, and sharp reductions in emissions can lessen the consequences of warming.",
      "\"Even if 1.5 degrees is out the window, we still can probably limit warming to 1.6C, 1.7C or 1.8C this century,\" says Dr Hausfather.",

      "\"We found a big piece of metal that was very red so we had to wait for it to cool before anyone could approach it,\" said Ann Kanuna, who told us she owns the land where the object fell.",
      "The giant ring took around two hours to cool down and turn grey \u2013 but it had already become a sensation with people arriving to look at it.",
      "The rest of that Monday afternoon - with few people working as it was the day before New Year's Eve - crowds came to view the giant metallic ring.",
      "It was like selfie central, with people coming to pose next to it and great debates about what it could be.",
      "The local authorities in Makueni county - which is around 115km (70 miles) south-east of the capital, Nairobi - were informed.",
      "The Kenya Space Agency (KSA) then heard about it and made arrangements to come and investigate the next day.",
      "But such was the object's fame that Mukuku villagers feared it would be stolen overnight.",
      "Together with local officers, some of them took it in turns to stand guard, lighting a fire nearby. They wanted to keep away potential scrap dealers and others wanting to make money out of the curiosity.",
      "It is said to weigh more than 500kg (1,102lb) - around the same as an adult horse - and is around 2.5m (8ft) in diameter, roughly the size of child's four-seater merry-go-round.",
      "With daylight came more onlookers on New Year's Eve - followed by the KSA team and the media.",
      "Mukuku had never seen such activity. When the object was carted away later that day by the KSA, the buzz gave way to concerns about what the villagers had had in their midst.",
      "The KSA said its preliminary assessments indicated the object was \"a separation ring\" from a space launch rocket.",
      "\"Such objects are usually designed to burn up as they re-enter the Earth's atmosphere or to fall over unoccupied areas, such as the oceans,\" its statement said the next day.",
      "No-one was injured when it had fallen but some in Mukuku began to complain that the impact of the crash had caused damage to nearby houses.",
      "Christine Kionga, who lives about a kilometre from the crash site, showed us cracks in the concrete of some of the buildings in her home compound. She said they had appeared after the crash.",
      "Other neighbours alleged the structural integrity of their homes had also been affected - allegations that are yet to be substantiated.",
      "\"The government needs to find the owners of this object, and get compensation for those affected by it,\" Mukuku resident Benson Mutuku told the BBC.",
      "There were reports in the local media that some residents had begun to complain of feeling unwell after exposure to the metallic ring though there was no confirmation from those we spoke to when we visited - nor from the authorities or the KSA.",
      "Nonetheless Mr Mutuku said there were concerns about the long-term effects of possible space radiation.",
      "\"This is a space object and we have heard in other similar incidents that there have been effects of radiation affecting even future generations and there is that fear in this community.\"",
      "However tests run later by the Kenya Nuclear Regulatory Authority revealed that while the metal ring did have higher radiation levels than the area in which it was found, they were not at a level harmful to humans.",
      "Engineers from the KSA, which was established in 2017 to promote, co-ordinate and regulate space-related activities in the East African nation, are continuing to run other tests to find out more about the object.",
      "The KSA director general said it was lucky that no significant damage was done when the object hurtled to Earth.",
      "\"The ultimate responsibility for any damage or injury caused by that space object is on the state in whose jurisdiction that operator may have launched the object,\" Brigadier Hillary Kipkosgey told the BBC.",
      "According to the Outer Space Treaty, overseen by the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs, \"states shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects\".",
      "\"[The ring] is a common item in many rockets and many space objects so it difficult to attribute it to a specific rocket or space object but we have leads but as I said our investigations are not conclusive,\" Brigadier Kipkosgey said.",
      "The BBC showed pictures of the object to the UK Space Agency to get the thoughts of its experts.",
      "\"The most plausible object it could be is the upper stage separation ring from an Ariane rocket in 2008,\" its launch director, Matt Archer, said.",
      "\"The satellites are fine, but the actual rocket body has come through and de-orbited.\"",
      "The Ariane was Europe's main rocket launch vehicle, helping more than 230 satellites into orbit, before it was retired in 2023.",
      "It seems the separation ring may have been orbiting Earth for 16 years before making its unexpected appearance in Mukuku.",
      "This is not the first incident of space junk appearing in East Africa.",
      "Just over a year and a half ago some suspected space debris fell over several villages in western Uganda.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 18:36:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Leading tech firms are said to have committed \u00a314bn towards the project, which could create more than 13,000 jobs.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence presents a \"vast potential\" for rejuvenating UK public services, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday.",
      "In a speech setting out the government's plans to use AI across the UK to boost growth and deliver services more efficiently, Sir Keir said the government had a responsibility to make AI \"work for working people\".",
      "The AI Opportunities Action Plan is backed by leading tech firms, some of which have committed \u00a314bn towards various projects, creating 13,250 jobs, the government said.",
      "But the government faces questions over how much time and money will be needed to make its vision a reality, amid concerns over borrowing costs and the falling value of the pound.",
      "The plan includes proposals for growth zones where development will be focused, and suggests the technology will be used to help tackle issues such as potholes.",
      "While estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) support the claim that AI could increase productivity, it also says the changes may come gradually.",
      "The government tasked AI adviser Matt Clifford with creating a UK action plan for supporting the growth of artificial intelligence and its use in public services.",
      "He came back with 50 recommendations which are now being implemented.",
      "Among these is for the UK to invest in a new supercomputer to boost computing power - marking a change in strategy after the Labour government ditched the previous government's plans for a supercomputer at Edinburgh University.",
      "Sir Keir said AI \"will drive incredible change\" in the country and \"has the potential to transform the lives of working people\".",
      "\"We're going to make AI work for everyone in our country,\" he added, saying the \"battle for the jobs of tomorrow is happening today\".",
      "Sir Keir said the UK would become one of the AI \"superpowers\" - mirroring former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's drive to boost the UK sector so it could rival that of the US and China.",
      "At the time, many of Sunak's proposals were geared towards mitigating future risks of highly powerful AI systems.",
      "In October 2023, he said AI could enable faster, easier production of chemical and biological weapons, or be used by terrorist groups to spread disinformation.",
      "He added that in a worst-case scenario, society could lose control over AI.",
      "His government's emphasis on \"safety\" seems largely absent in this new plan  - instead focusing on maximising opportunities, growth and innovation.",
      "The pivot away from the previous narrative of caution and safety suggests the government has decided the UK should attempt to compete in the AI arms race, currently lead by major global players including the US and China.",
      "However, building data centres and boosting the nation's computing power will not happen overnight.",
      "This means the government is unlikely to see the end results of this major project ahead of the next general election - when Labour will have to convince voters that it was still the right decision, at a time when public finances remain stretched.",
      "Professor Dame Wendy Hall said the proposals were \"ambitious\", but necessary to help the UK keep up with the pace of development.",
      "\"It's an ambitious plan but there's a lot of upfront investment,\" she told BBC Radio Four's Today programme.",
      "\"It will take some time to see a return on that investment and they've got to be in it for the long-term.\"",
      "How the AI plan could affect you",
      "Among the government's proposals are:",
      "AI will be used by the public sector to enable its workers to spend less time doing admin and more time delivering services.Several \"AI Growth Zones\" around the UK will be created, involving big building projects and new jobs.AI will be fed through cameras around the country to inspect roads and spot potholes that need fixing Teachers and small business owners were highlighted as two groups that could start using AI for things like faster planning and record-keeping.AI is already being used in UK hospitals for important tasks such as diagnosing cancer more quickly and it will continue to be used to support the NHS.",

      "While the push towards AI is seen as way of cutting down on public spending, Mak accused Labour of undermining this goal with its economic policies.",
      "\"Labour's economic mismanagement and uninspiring plan will mean Britain is left behind,\" he said.",
      "Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle told the BBC there was no reason why the UK could not create tech companies on the same scale as Google, Amazon, and Apple.",
      "\"At the moment, we don't have any frontier conceptual, cutting-edge companies that are British-owned.\"",
      "He highlighted DeepMind, which created technology enabling computers to play video and board games, as an example of a former British-born company that was now US-owned.",
      "It was founded by three University College London students before its acquisition by Google.",
      "Tim Flagg, chief operating officer of UKAI - a trade body representing British AI businesses - said the proposals take a \"narrow view\" of the sector's contributors and focus too much on big tech.",
      "\"AI innovation spans industries, from small enterprises to non-tech sectors, all driving the new industrial revolution,\" he said.",
      "\"It's time the government recognised this broader definition and tapped into the full potential of AI across the UK.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "Is AI the answer for better government services?",
      "AI 'not perfect'",
      "There are continuing questions over the risks of introducing AI systems that can \"hallucinate\" or make things up, or discriminate against certain groups of people due to bias.",
      "Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said \"we're only at the foothills of this\" and AI was a developing technology.",
      "He said a government-developed AI teaching assistant had been used by about 30,000 teachers in England so far.",
      "\"It saves teachers about three-and-half hours a week - gives them their Sunday evening back, if you like, in terms of lesson preparation and classroom preparation,\" he told BBC Breakfast.",
      "McFadden said AI applications used by the health service can detect some cancers earlier which are not detectable by the human eye.",
      "However he acknowledged AI was \"not perfect\" after Apple faced calls to withdraw a controversial feature that generated inaccurate news alerts on its latest iPhones.",
      "\"We've got to have an eye on safety as well as opportunity,\" McFadden said.",

      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",

      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",

      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",

      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",

      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",

      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",

      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",

      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",

      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",

      "Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick for defence secretary, cleared his first hurdle on the way to confirmation: a long - and at times tense - hearing before the Senate's Armed Services Committee.",
      "For more than four hours on Tuesday, Hegseth faced questions about his ability to run the defence department, including its three million employees and $849bn (\u00a3695bn) budget.",
      "And although he was grilled by Democrats over accusations of sexual assault, infidelity and drinking in the workplace, he appears all but certain to be confirmed to the role after no Republicans came out against him.",
      "This was underscored later on Tuesday when Joni Ernst, one Republican who had been seen as a potential roadblock to his nomination, said she would support him.",
      "Here's a look at the five main takeaways from Hegseth's testimony.",
      "A 'warrior ethos'",
      "From the very start of his testimony, Hegseth, a military veteran, emphasised what he called a \"warrior culture\", vowing to return the focus of the defence department to the strength of America's military.",
      "\"Warfighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards, and readiness. That's it. That is my job,\" he said in his opening statements.",
      "As the hearing continued, Hegseth was critical of policies he felt harmed the efficiency and \"lethality\" of the military, namely efforts aimed at racial and gender diversity.",
      "\"This is not a time for equity,\" he said, adding that he opposes quotas, which he claims hurt morale.",
      "Women in the military",
      "In what became an expectedly partisan hearing, Democrats repeatedly grilled Hegseth on his past statements suggesting women were not suited to serve in combat roles in the military.",
      "Questions along these lines from Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono and Elizabeth Warren provided some of the most heated moments of the morning.",
      "He spoke over Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, as she tried to point to comments about female service members stretching back years.",
      "Who else is in Trump's top team?How these new recruits will be vettedWhat Trump can and can't do on day oneFULL REPORT: Hegseth questioned over alcohol use and women in military",
      "Who else is in Trump's top team?",
      "How these new recruits will be vetted",
      "What Trump can and can't do on day one",
      "FULL REPORT: Hegseth questioned over alcohol use and women in military",
      "\"Mr Hegseth, I'm quoting you in a podcast: 'Women shouldn't be in combat at all',\" Warren said.",
      "Hegseth remained composed, responding by saying his concern was not women in combat, but simply maintaining \"standards\" in the military.",
      "Lack of experience or 'breath of fresh air'",
      "Hegseth, who at 44 would be the youngest defence secretary in decades, also answered questions about his preparedness to run the defence department, a sprawling agency.",
      "The former Fox News host described himself as a \"change agent\", saying \"it's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm.\"",
      "Some Republicans deemed Hegseth's lack of experience a strength.",
      "\"I just want to say for all the talk of experience and not coming from the same cocktail parties that permanent Washington is used to, you are a breath of fresh air,\" Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, said.",
      "A graduate of Princeton and Harvard universities, Hegseth was an infantry platoon leader in Guantanamo Bay and Iraq, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. Hegseth, also a former Fox News TV host, has military experience in Afghanistan as well.",
      "Still, Democrats pressed Hegseth on his qualifications for the top military job. Reporting from US media found that Hegseth's tenures at the helm of two non-profit veterans groups ended in financial disarray.",
      "Combat veteran Tammy Duckworth focused on whether Hegseth had ever supervised an audit.",
      "\"Senator, in both of the organisations I ran, we were always completely fiscally responsible,\" Hegseth began, before Duckworth cut in.",
      "\"Yes or no? Did you lead an audit? Do you not know this answer?\" Duckworth said.",
      "What wasn't asked",
      "Some experts told the BBC they were most struck by how little Hegseth talked about how he'd handle the job's military complexities.",
      "Aside from brief mentions of China and the war in Ukraine and Russia, senators did not ask Hegseth specifically about current conflicts, and other potential military adversaries and strategic rivals.",
      "Those fundamental issues were mostly \"crowded out\" by the questions about  Hegseth's character and competence, said Mara Karlin, former assistant defence secretary for strategy, plans, and capabilities.",
      "\"What's astonishing about the hearing is just how little focus there has been on the bread and butter of what the secretary of defence has to do, which is protect the nation, and ensure you have a military capable of winning conflicts,\" Karlin said.",
      "Senate Armed Services Committee member Tammy Duckworth was also unimpressed with what Hegseth had to say about military strategy.",
      "\"He couldn't answer some of the most basic questions I asked of him,\" the Democratic Senator from Illinois told the BBC.",
      "Duckworth said that Hegseth could not name a single country that is in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - \"basic questions that any international affairs college student would be able to answer\".",
      "\"All he did today was reaffirm to me that he's not qualified for this job,\" she said.",
      "Sexual assault or smear campaign",
      "A 2017 accusation of sexual assault in Monterey, California, which surfaced soon after Trump tapped him for the Pentagon role, came up repeatedly.",
      "According to a police report, an unnamed woman said Hegseth took her phone and blocked the door when she tried to leave his hotel room before sexually assaulting her.",
      "Hegseth has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer acknowledged Hegseth had paid an undisclosed amount to stay quiet about the incident.",
      "On Tuesday, Hegseth mainly went on the offensive, decrying a \"coordinated smear campaign\" orchestrated by the left-wing media. \"They want to destroy me.\"",
      "But at other times in the hearing, Hegseth responded to questions about his conduct with passionate references to his Christian faith.",
      "\"I am not a perfect person, but redemption is real,\" he said.",
      "Senator Tim Kaine, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, found these statements to be unsatisfactorily contradictory.",
      "Referencing the allegations of sexual assault, views on women and drinking, Kaine repeatedly asked Hegseth during the confirmation hearing how Hegseth can be both a changed man and the allegations against him be meritless.",
      "\"If all those allegations were false, then what do you mean you changed and reformed,\" Kaine told the BBC."

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:48:16 GMT",
    "summary": "The area in Gaza which Israel's military has told people to go to \"for their safety\" has been hit by 97 strikes since May, BBC Verify analysis has revealed.",
    "story": [
      "The area in Gaza which Israel's military has told people to go to \"for their safety\" has been hit by 97 strikes since May, BBC Verify analysis has revealed.",
      "The findings come as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appear to be nearing a breakthrough. Mediators in Qatar say talks are in their final stages, raising hopes that an agreement could be reached soon.",
      "The \"humanitarian zone\" was first established by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in October 2023 for the \"protection\" of residents to \"keep innocent civilians out of harms way\".",
      "On 6 May 2024, the IDF significantly expanded the zone to include the cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah.",
      "The area - much of which is a strip of land along the Mediterranean sea - is densely populated and is estimated to have over a million people living there according to international humanitarian organisations. Many people are living in tents, with limited infrastructure and limited access to aid.",
      "In a statement to BBC Verify, the IDF said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\" and accused the group of violating international law while \"exploiting\" civilians as human shields and launching rockets from the area.",
      "Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "The conflict has caused widespread damage to infrastructure across Gaza, with satellite images showing areas flattened by Israeli strikes. The Hamas-run health ministry also says more than 46,600 people have been killed within the enclave since the start of the war.",
      "BBC Verify analysis suggests that attacks within the \"humanitarian zone\" have intensified since May 2024, with at least 22 strikes already recorded so far this month.",
      "Local media reports indicate more than 550 people have been killed in the 97 strikes mapped by BBC Verify.",
      "BBC Verify cannot confirm that all incidents are the result of IDF attacks. Israeli military officials have publicly acknowledged 28 attacks since 6 May, but did not confirm involvement in the others documented by BBC Verify.",
      "Gavin Kelleher, an access manager in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said there were \"near daily\" strikes within the zone, including from Israeli ships and quadcopters, or small drones.",
      "He added that \"heavy fire is recurrent in this area despite its [Israel's] unilateral 'humanitarian' designation.\"",
      "\"The Israeli military appears keen to maintain the illusion of a Humanitarian Zone that remains a certain size, yet that zone can be subject to 'evacuation orders' at any time and be targeted,\" Mr Kelleher said.",
      "One resident who lives within the zone, Khaled Abdel Rahman, told the BBC that residents were being subjected to daily bombardments, frequently resulting in injuries and casualties.",
      "\"We were displaced to Khan Younis because it was designated as a safe zone, but in fact we find nothing here but insecurity,\" Mr Rahman said. \"We have been denied the true sense of security, with fear dominating our lives.\"",
      "As Israel does not allow foreign reporters access to Gaza - apart from highly controlled, escorted trips with its military - international media, including the BBC, is reliant on imagery gathered by Palestinian journalists and Gaza residents.",
      "To track attacks within the IDF's \"humanitarian area\", BBC Verify monitored Palestinian social media channels and official IDF channels on Instagram, Telegram and X. Reports of strikes that included verified imagery from within the boundaries of the zone were then cross-referenced with local media reports to determine a reported death toll.",
      "It's important to note that death tolls cannot be verified based solely on videos and social media reports. BBC Verify analysis excluded reports of fatalities where there wasn't verifiable imagery which confirmed the incident happened within the IDF-defined boundaries of the \"humanitarian area\".",
      "BBC Verify reviewed more than 300 videos and photos posted since May in the \"humanitarian zone\". While it is not always possible to distinguish between fighters and civilians, the footage shows scores of people, including women and children, being pulled from rubble. Some appeared lifeless, while others were severely burned or had significant limb injuries, alongside collapsed buildings, destroyed tents and burnt-out cars.",
      "Seven of the documented strikes are reported to have killed 20 or more people each, with the most deadly on 13 July resulting in more than 90 deaths, according to the Gaza health ministry, first responders and medics.",
      "The IDF later said Hamas military chief, Mohammed Deif, was among the dead. Deif is accused of being one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks.",
      "Nine strikes occurred within 100m of buildings belonging to Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah, and four within 150m of the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.",
      "The IDF told BBC Verify the strikes were conducted \"against terrorists and terror infrastructures including rocket launchers, weapons warehouse and manufacturing sites, operational apartments, underground infrastructure, operational headquarters, and terrorists hideout.\"",
      "They also included links to six of their previously published statements about Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\".",
      "Residents in the zone also live under constant uncertainty. Including evacuation notices, the boundary of the \"humanitarian area\" has changed 20 times - and it has varied in size from around 7 km sq (2.7 sq miles) when it was first introduced to 72 km sq (27.8 sq miles) at its largest.",
      "The IDF said evacuation notices \"do not constitute as a reduction of the humanitarian zone. Once the danger has passed, the residents return\". But it's unclear how residents know it's safe to return, and the IDF has only twice posted to social media to explicitly say so. BBC Verify did not include strikes inside areas where evacuation notices were issued in our tally.",
      "While Israel's military has avoided using the term \"safe zone\", its statements have led civilians to interpret the \"humanitarian zone\" as such. IDF evacuation notices include language that tells civilians - like this one which was issued in mid-December - \"for your own safety, move immediately west to the humanitarian area\".",
      "It has also described the zone as being \"designated for humanitarian aid and shelters as part of the IDF's consistent efforts to protect the uninvolved population.\"",
      "But the UN and international humanitarian organisations operating in Gaza have said there's no such thing as a \"safe zone\" that is unilaterally enforced.",
      "Juliette Touma of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said: \"We have said it so so many times. There is no safe zone in Gaza. No place is safe. No-one is safe. No place is spared.\"",

      "\"We must recover our country economically... it's easy to destroy, but building is not an easy task.\"",
      "National reconciliation, creating more jobs, reforming electoral law and decentralising power are top of his agenda, he said.",

      "Mondlane - a part-time pastor and independent candidate who insists he was the true winner of the polls - is reported to be sheltering in one of the capital city's hotels. It is not known what security protection he has there, nor who is paying for it.",
      "He alleges that last week while touring a market in Maputo a vendor in his vicinity was shot, echoing the murder of two of his close aides in October.",
      "As the mastermind of nationwide protests against the disputed election result, he has come to be seen by many as a voice for the voiceless. Yet, at present, the president-elect's camp is not engaging him publicly.",
      "Nonetheless, listening to the public's grievances and demands, and sometimes ignoring the commands of his ruling Frelimo party, will be key to Chapo's success, analysts have told the BBC.",
      "Finding some way of engaging constructively with Mondlane would undoubtedly provide a boost, it seems.",
      "Winning the public over may also require Chapo to say no to \"fat salaries for the elite and fringe benefits, some of which are 10 times higher than Mozambique's minimum wage\", argues Mr Nhachote.",
      "Plus, if Chapo is to have any chance at bringing an end to the broader political crisis, he will require support from others to make lasting, structural change, argues prominent clergymen Rev Anastacio Chembeze.",
      "\"Perhaps we should remain sceptical of one single person to solve the challenges of Mozambique \u2013 change must start within the system itself.",

      "Once in the office Chapo is advised to sack the country's Police Chief Bernadino Rafael, analysts have told the BBC. He denies any wrongdoing but is regarded by some as the mastermind of the brutal response to the post-election protests.",
      "They say they want him replaced with a successor who \"respects human rights\" and follows legal and international standards. Another suggestion analysts have touted is for a new attorney-general to be brought in.",
      "Notably, Chapo will be the first president of Mozambique who did not fight in the independence war.",
      "\"He is part of the new generation. Part of his background is completely different from his predecessors - he was born in a country liberated by them,\" says Mr Nhachote.",
      "\"If he wants to make a real mark on history, he has to challenge those past icons. If he can't [manage that], I am sure that he will only run for one term.\"",

      "President Joe Biden is to remove the US designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism as part of a prisoner release deal, the White House said on Tuesday.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump reinstated the country's terror designation in the final days of his first presidency in 2021, banning US economic aid and arms exports to the country.",
      "But on Tuesday, a Biden administration official said an assessment of the situation had presented \"no information\" that supported the designation.",
      "Cuba said Biden's move was a step \"in the right direction\" despite its \"limited nature\".",
      "\"This decision puts an end to specific coercive measures that, along with many others, cause serious damage to the Cuban economy, with a severe effect on the population,\" the country's ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.",
      "Hundreds of prisoners will \"gradually\" be freed following talks brokered by the Catholic Church, a separate statement read a few hours later.",
      "Details about the prisoners have not been announced - it was hoped the deal would prompt the release of some protesters imprisoned after large anti-government protests in Cuba over the nation's economic decline in 2021.",
      "Cuba currently sits alongside North Korea, Syria and Iran on the US State Sponsors of Terrorism list.",
      "This means they are deemed by the US to have \"repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism\".",
      "Adding Cuba back to the list after its removal in 2015 by President Barack Obama, Trump citied the communist country's backing of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.",
      "At the time Cuba called the move \"cynical,\" \"hypocritical\" and an act of \"political opportunism\".",
      "Alongside prompting the prisoner release, this decision is also significant because it can be seen as a step towards normalising relations between Cuba and the US.",
      "This could pave the way for dialogue on other contentious issues.",
      "It could also help Cuba's dire economic situation, as some major banks and foreign investors have struggled to operate there legally.",
      "Biden is to notify Congress of his plans, which also include reversing Trump-era financial restrictions on some Cubans, a White House statement said.",
      "He will also suspend the ability of individuals to make claims to confiscated property in Cuba, the statement read.",
      "It is unclear whether Trump will reverse this latest decision when he returns to office on 20 January.",
      "The president-elect's nominee as the next US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has long advocated for sanctions on Cuba.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:27:55 GMT",
    "summary": "The measure is meant to help tackle the country's housing crisis, the prime minister said.",
    "story": [
      "Spain is planning to impose a tax of up to 100% on the value of properties bought by non-residents from countries outside the EU, such as the UK.",
      "Announcing the move, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said the \"unprecedented\" measure was necessary to meet the country's housing emergency.",
      "\"The West faces a decisive challenge: To not become a society divided into two classes, the rich landlords and poor tenants,\" he said.",
      "Non-EU residents bought 27,000 properties in Spain in 2023, he told an economic forum in Madrid, \"not to live in\" but \"to make money from them\".",
      "\"Which, in the context of shortage that we are in, [we] obviously cannot allow,\" he added.",
      "The move was designed to prioritise available homes for residents, the Spanish prime minister said.",
      "S\u00e1nchez did not provide any more details on how the tax would work nor a timeline for presenting it to parliament for approval, where he has often struggled to gather sufficient votes to pass legislation.",
      "His office described the proposed measure as a way to limit the purchase of homes by \"non-resident non-EU foreigners\". In Spain, people are classed as non-residents if they live in the country for less than 183 days in a single year.",
      "It added: \"The tax burden that they will have to pay in case of purchase will be increased up to 100% of the value of the property, in line with countries such as Denmark and Canada.\"",
      "The Spanish government said the proposal would be finalised \"after careful study\".",
      "The total number of sales to foreigners, including people from inside the EU, makes up around 15% of the Spanish housing market - that's 87,000 out of 583,000 sales in 2023 - according to the Spanish property registry.",
      "'Extreme proposal'",
      "Simon Creed of Azahar Properties, who has been selling homes in the Valencia region to Britons, Americans and other non-EU citizens for over 22 years, said the proposal had been the talk of property professionals in the area.",
      "Currently buyers in Valencia, non-residents and Spanish citizens alike, pay 10% transfer tax on the property's value. This figure varies with region.",
      "\"Naturally who wants to pay 100% purchase tax for buying a property here,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"The Brits have always been big buyers here in Spain, but obviously it is going to increase the buying power of EU citizens like the German, French and Belgians, so it doesn't appear to be very fair just to isolate non-EU buyers.\"",
      "He added: \"Something needs to happen to increase the amount of houses coming onto the market, but this is an extreme proposal.\"",
      "Antonio de la Fuente, managing director at Colliers International Spain, told BBC World Business Report he did not think 100% tax would solve the housing problem.",
      "\"We all agree we are in a problem of not enough supply and we need to produce new supply to give people migrating from other parts of Spain to big cities like Madrid, Valencia, [and] Malaga a new home.",
      "\"But this will be a drop in the ocean in my opinion and there will be other alternatives that will have a higher impact on the housing market.\"",
      "'I'll be looking at Cyprus instead'",
      "Prospective British buyers told BBC News the proposal had made them think again about buying in Spain.",
      "Michele Hayes, from Manchester, who spent the weekend house-hunting south of Alicante, had wanted a property for family to visit and to spend time during her retirement.",
      "\"We could look at buying quickly before the tax comes in, but we don't know what could happen in the future,\" she said.",
      "\"Selling could be tough if we can no longer sell to non-residents, especially a holiday home property in a touristy area.\"",
      "The 59-year-old said she empathised with their housing issue, but said she wanted to add to the local economy and asked: \"How many working Spanish people want to live in holiday homes in these tourist areas anyway?\"",
      "Martin Craven, from London, said he had been looking to buy in Spain this year.",
      "\"I definitely wouldn't consider trying to get in before this tax, because who knows what else they could do,  a retrospective tax or a tax on existing owners,\" the 62-year-old said.",
      "\"I'll be looking at Cyprus now instead.\"",
      "Julian, 54, from Surrey, said Spain was his first choice to buy a holiday home, but now it \"looks more risky\" than other countries.",
      "\"I would want to be out there four to six months a year, also travelling, spending money, buying food and drink, paying taxes,\" the 54-year-old said.",
      "\"Here in the UK, we also have problems with landlords buying multiple properties and driving up the rest, but this policy is losing sight of those of us who want to spend money in the country. \"",
      "It is one of a dozen planned measures announced by the Spanish prime minister on Monday aimed at improving housing affordability in the country.",
      "Other measures announced include a tax exemption for landlords who provide affordable housing, transferring more than 3,000 homes to a new public housing body, and tighter regulation and higher taxes on tourist flats.",
      "\"It isn't fair that those who have three, four or five apartments as short-term rentals pay less tax than hotels,\" S\u00e1nchez said.",

      "Israel and Hamas are thought to be close to agreeing a deal which could halt the war in Gaza and see the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.",
      "The BBC's US partner CBS has been told by Arab, US and Israeli officials that an agreement has been reached in principle and, if all goes well, will be finalised by Israel and Hamas this week.",
      "It would be the most dramatic breakthrough in 15 months of war, which began when the armed Palestinian group Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023.",
      "What could be in a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas?",
      "It is hoped that a ceasefire deal will mean an agreement to stop the war which has been raging in Gaza.",
      "It is also expected to see an exchange of hostages and prisoners.",
      "Hamas seized 251 hostages when it attacked Israel in October 2023. It is still holding 94 captive, although Israel believes that only 60 are still alive.",
      "Israel is expected to release about 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, some jailed for years, in return for the hostages.",

      "Why is there a war in Gaza?",
      "How would the ceasefire work?",
      "This ceasefire is expected to happen in three stages, once a deal is announced.",
      "Details are still being ironed out. Until an agreement is finalised, it is subject to change.",
      "First stage",
      "Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said that 33 hostages - expected to be  women, children, the elderly and the sick or injured - would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. Mr Mencer said that most but not all of the 33 hostages are thought to still be alive.",
      "Three hostages would be released straight away, a Palestinian official told the BBC, with the rest of the exchange taking place over six weeks.",
      "During this stage, Israeli troops would also begin pulling out of populated areas in Gaza.",
      "The Palestinian official said detailed negotiations for the second and third stages would begin on the 16th day of the ceasefire.",
      "Second stage",
      "In the second stage, the remaining hostages - soldiers and reservists - would be released, in return for another release of Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Of the 1,000 Palestinian prisoners Israel is thought to have agreed to release, about 190 are serving sentences of 15 years or more. An Israeli official told the BBC that those convicted of murder would not be released into the occupied West Bank.",
      "During this stage, Israel would also allow displaced people now in the south of Gaza to return to the north.",
      "Almost all of Gaza's 2.3 million population have had to leave their homes because of the fighting.",
      "Third stage",

      "Three things that could make a Gaza hostage deal more likely",
      "What are the unanswered questions about the deal?",
      "Getting to this point has taken months of painstaking indirect negotiations, not least because Israel and Hamas completely distrust each other.",
      "Hamas wanted a complete end to the war before it would release the hostages, something which was unacceptable to Israel.",
      "The ceasefire will in effect pause the war while its terms are carried out.",
      "However, it is unclear whether it will mean the war is over for good.",
      "One of Israel's key war aims has been to destroy Hamas's military and governing capabilities. Although Israel has severely damaged it, Hamas still has some capacity to operate and regroup.",
      "It is also unclear which hostages are alive or dead or whether Hamas knows the whereabouts of all those who remain unaccounted for.",
      "For its part, Hamas has demanded the release of some prisoners which Israel says it will not free. This is believed to include those who were involved in the 7 October attacks.",
      "It is also not known whether Israel will agree to pull out of the buffer zone by a certain date, or whether its presence there will be open-ended.",
      "Any ceasefire is likely to be fragile.",
      "Ceasefires between Israel and Hamas which have halted previous wars have been shaken by skirmishes and eventually broken down.",
      "The timetable and complexity of this ceasefire means even a small incident could turn into a major threat.",
      "What happened on 7 October 2023 and what has happened in Gaza?",
      "Hundreds of Hamas-led gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel, bursting through the border fence and targeting communities, police stations and army bases.",
      "About 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 hostages were taken back to Gaza. Hamas also fired thousands of rockets into Israel.",
      "Israel responded with a massive military campaign, first by air and then a ground invasion. Since then, Israel has attacked targets across Gaza by land, sea and air, while Hamas has attacked Israel with rockets.",
      "Israel's offensive has devastated Gaza and led to severe food shortages, with aid struggling to reach those most in need. More than 46,600 people - the majority of them civilians - have been killed by Israel's attacks, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.",

      "Her husband was raised in Middleton, Ohio, born to a family with roots in the impoverished Appalachians of eastern Kentucky.",
      "Their contrasting upbringings is what attracted them to each other, Charles Tyler, a Yale classmate and friend of the couple, told the BBC.",
      "\"They were always this match of very dissimilar people,\" he said.",
      "In his bestselling 2016 memoir, Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis, JD Vance recounted how his wife helped him adjust to life at the top law college.",
      "\"I have never felt out of place in my entire life,\" he wrote. \"But I did at Yale.\"",
      "The vice-president-elect described one instance in the book where his wife taught him which cutlery to use for which part of a formal meal, to pick the silverware from the outside in.",

      "That speech offered the public perhaps the clearest insight to their marriage.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:47:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Last week, India\u2019s top diplomat met a senior Taliban minister, the highest-level engagement since Kabul's fall.",
    "story": [
      "India's latest diplomatic outreach to Afghanistan's Taliban government signals a marked shift in how it sees the geopolitical reality in the region.",
      "This comes more than three years after India suffered a major strategic and diplomatic blow when Kabul fell to the Taliban.",
      "Two decades of investment in Afghanistan's democracy - through military training, scholarships and landmark projects like building its new parliament - were swiftly undone. The collapse also paved the way for greater influence from regional rivals, particularly Pakistan and China, eroding India's strategic foothold and raising new security concerns.",
      "Yet, last week signalled a shift. India's top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall. The Taliban expressed interest in strengthening political and economic ties with India, calling it a \"significant regional and economic power\".",
      "Talks reportedly focused on expanding trade and leveraging Iran's Chabahar port, which India has been developing to bypass Pakistan's Karachi and Gwadar ports.",
      "How significant is this meeting? Delhi has now given the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power, Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told me.",
      "\"The fact that this treatment is coming from India -  a nation that never previously had friendly relations with the Taliban, makes this all the more significant, and also a diplomatic triumph for the Taliban,\" he says.",
      "Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, countries have adopted varied approaches toward the regime, balancing diplomatic engagement with concerns over human rights and security. China, for example, has gone far: it has actively engaged with the Taliban, focusing on security and economic interests, and even has an ambassador in the country.",
      "Taliban welcomes first new Chinese ambassador since takeover",
      "Taliban welcomes first new Chinese ambassador since takeover",
      "No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, but up to 40 countries maintain some form of diplomatic or informal relations with it.",
      "That's why experts like Jayant Prasad, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, are more circumspect about India's outreach.",
      "For the past three years, he says, India has maintained contact with the Taliban through a foreign service diplomat. India had closed its consulates in Afghanistan during the civil war in the 1990s and reopened them in 2002 after the war ended. \"We didn't want this hiatus to develop [again], so we wanted to engage. It is very simply a step up in relations,\" he says.",
      "India has \"historical and civilisational ties\" with Afghanistan, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament in 2023. India has invested more than $3bn (\u00a32.46bn) in over 500 projects across Afghanistan, including roads, power lines, dams, hospitals and clinics. It has trained Afghan officers, awarded thousands of scholarships to students and built a new parliament building.",
      "This reflects a lasting geopolitical reality. \"Irrespective of the nature of the regime in Kabul - monarchical, communist, or Islamist - there has been a natural warmth between Delhi and Kabul,\" The Indian Express newspaper noted.",
      "Mr Kugelman echoes the sentiment. \"India has an important legacy as a development and humanitarian aid donor in Afghanistan, which has translated into public goodwill from the Afghan public that Delhi is keen not to lose,\" he says.",
      "Interestingly, relations with Delhi appear to be easing amid rising tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pakistan claims the hardline Pakistani Taliban (TTP) operates from sanctuaries in Afghanistan.",
      "Last July, Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told the BBC that Pakistan would continue attacks on Afghanistan as part of an operation aimed at countering terrorism. Days before talks between India and the Taliban, Pakistani airstrikes killed dozens in eastern Afghanistan, according to the Afghan government. The Taliban government condemned the strikes as violations of its sovereignty.",
      "This marks a sharp decline in relations since the fall of Kabul in 2021, when a top Pakistani intelligence official was among the first foreign guests to meet the Taliban regime. At the time, many saw Kabul's fall as a strategic setback for India.",
      "\"While Pakistan isn't the only factor driving India's intensifying outreach to the Taliban, it's true that Delhi does get a big win in its evergreen competition with Pakistan by moving closer to a critical long-time Pakistani asset that has now turned on its former patron,\" says Mr Kugelman.",
      "There are other reasons driving the outreach. India aims to strengthen connectivity and access Central Asia, which it can't reach directly by land due to Pakistan's refusal of transit rights. Experts say Afghanistan is key to this goal. One strategy is collaborating with Iran on the Chabahar port development to improve access to Central Asia via Afghanistan.",
      "\"It is easier for Delhi to focus on the Afghanistan component of this plan by engaging more closely with the Taliban leadership, which is fully behind India's plans as they would help enhance Afghanistan's own trade and connectivity links,\" says Mr Kugelman.",
      "Clearly, India's recent outreach helps advance its core interests in Taliban-led Afghanistan: preventing terrorism threats to India, deepening connectivity with Iran and Central Asia, maintaining public goodwill through aid, and countering a struggling Pakistan.",
      "What about the downsides?",
      "\"The main risk of strengthening ties with the Taliban is the Taliban itself. We're talking about a violent and brutal actor with close ties to international - including Pakistani - terror groups that has done little to reform itself from what it was in the 1990s,\" says Mr Kugelman.",
      "\"India may hope that if it keeps the Taliban on side, so to speak, the Taliban will be less likely to undermine India or its interests. And that may be true. But at the end of the day, can you really trust an actor like the Taliban? That will be the unsettling question hovering over India as it continues to cautiously pursue this complex relationship.\"",
      "Mr Prasad sees no downsides to India's current engagement with Afghanistan, despite concerns over the Taliban's treatment of women. \"The Taliban is fully in control. Letting the Taliban stew in its own juice won't help Afghan people. Some engagement with the international community might pressurise the government to improve its behaviour.\"",
      "\"Remember, the Taliban is craving for recognition,\" says Mr Prasad. \"They know that will only happen after internal reforms.\" Like bringing women back into public life and restoring their rights to education, work and political participation."

      "Kristi Noem - homeland security secretary",
      "In the spotlight on Wednesday will be the woman who could be tasked with carrying out one of Trump's top campaign pledges - billed by his team as the largest mass deportation of illegal immigrants in American history.",
      "As the president-elect's choice for homeland security secretary, Noem could be quizzed on the practicality of enacting this pledge. A mass deportation programme on the scale proposed would likely face logistical or legal difficulties, experts say.",
      "Noem could also face questions on other potential immigration policies, such as Trump's vow to end birthright citizenship.",
      "She has been a loyal and vocal backer of the president-elect's pledges, which is consistent with other nominees and appointees for Trump's second term in the White House.",
      "Marco Rubio - secretary of state",
      "The man picked to lead Trump's foreign policy agenda was once on the other side of a confirmation hearing for a Trump nominee for secretary of state.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 05:45:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Eleven survivors describe what happened and raise safety questions about the dive boat Sea Story.",
    "story": [
      "\"By the end, I was just wondering how I would prefer to die.\"",
      "Spending 35 hours trapped in a pitch-black air pocket in the upturned hull of a boat has taken its toll on Lucianna Galetta, her voice cracking as she recounts her ordeal.",
      "A video she managed to film briefly using the light on her phone, now shared with the BBC, shows the space where she thought her life might end - and how surging sea water and floating debris prevented her escape.",
      "Lucianna was one of the last of 35 survivors to be rescued from the wreck of the Sea Story, an Egyptian dive vessel that sank in the Red Sea on 25 November last year. Up to 11 people died or are still missing, including two Britons, Jenny Cawson and Tarig Sinada from Devon.",
      "At the time, Egyptian authorities attributed the disaster to a huge wave of up to 4m (13ft), but the BBC has spoken to 11 survivors of the Sea Story who have cast doubt on the claim. That has been supported by a leading oceanographer, who told us weather data from the time suggests a wave could not have been responsible, and that a combination of crew error and failings in the boat were the likely cause.",
      "As well as describing the terror of being trapped in a rapidly sinking boat, the survivors accuse the company which ran it, Dive Pro Liveaboard, of several safety failings. They also say the Egyptian authorities were slow to react, something which may have cost lives. We have put questions to Dive Pro Liveaboard - based in Hurghada - and the Egyptian government, but not received any reply.",
      "This, for the first time, is the inside story of how the Sea Story sank, as told by those who made it out alive.",
      "The luxury dive boat set off from Port Ghaleb on Egypt's Red Sea Coast on 24 November. On board were 31 international guests - mostly experienced divers - and three dive guides, along with 12 Egyptian crew. They were on a six-day trip, with their first destination being Sataya Reef, a popular diving spot.",
      "Like many of those on board, Lucianna's first impressions of the Sea Story were positive. \"It looked like a really nice boat, very big, very clean,\" she says, speaking from her home in Belgium.",
      "The company had transferred over Lucianna and others at the last minute from another boat, which had hundreds of good online reviews. Several guests were told they were getting an \"upgrade\" but some were frustrated because it was not going to the destination they had booked.",
      "Conditions that night were quite rough, although the survivors we spoke to, including experienced sailors, say the boat seemed more unstable than they would have expected.",
      "At one point, a few hours before the capsizing, a small inflatable boat slipped off the back of the Sea Story. A passenger filmed as the crew battled to bring it back on board - the oceanographer the BBC spoke to says the video shows conditions which were not unusual and consistent with 1.5m (5ft) waves.",
      "\"Looking out at the waves, the weather wasn't terrible,\" says Sarah Martin, an NHS doctor from Lancaster who was on the trip. But, she says, \"furniture was sliding around the deck - we asked the crew if it was normal and they just shrugged, so we didn't realise the danger we were in\".",
      "\"I didn't sleep that night because the boat was rocking so much,\" says Hissora Gonzalez, a diver from Spain, whose cabin was on the lower deck.",
      "She describes how the boat rolled sharply several times until, just before 03:00, it flipped onto its side with a loud bang, followed by silence as the engines died - and total darkness.",
      "Shouting could soon be heard coming from other cabins, as people were thrown from their beds. Possessions were scattered around, blocking exits and making escape difficult. One survivor - who had been sleeping outside on deck - described being trapped under heavy furniture which had shifted as the boat rolled.",
      "\"We couldn't see anything. I didn't know if I was walking on the floor, on the ceiling, on the side,\" says Hissora. Disoriented, she started looking around for life jackets. Before she could find one, her friend Cristhian Cercos shouted at her to run.",
      "That call may well have saved her life. Their cabin was on the starboard (right) of the boat, the side that hit the sea. Nearly all of the dead or missing had cabins on that side of the boat.",
      "\"I could hear the water coming in, but I could not see it,\" says Hissora. Their cabin door was now on the ceiling - she only escaped because Cristhian pulled her up on the fifth attempt.",
      "Across the hall from Hissora, also in complete darkness, were Sarah and her cabin mate Natalia Sanchez Fuster, a dive guide. They couldn't find the handle to the cabin door. When Sarah managed to turn on the torch on her phone she realised \"everything was at 90 degrees - the door was on the floor and all our things were blocking it\".",
      "After clearing the doorway, they joined about 10 others heading for an emergency exit towards the bow (front) of the boat.",
      "With the boat on its side, the group had to crawl along the emergency staircase for two floors, past the restaurant and dining room on the main deck. It was hard to find their way and it seemed the contents of the kitchen cupboards had spilled out over the floors.",
      "\"We had to climb along door frames and beams to make our way out,\" says Sarah. \"It was quite disorienting in the dark and it was very slippery. There was cooking oil and broken eggs everywhere.\"",
      "Hissora, just ahead of Sarah, managed to make it to the upper deck. She could hear people screaming behind her but did not turn around. \"I was afraid of looking back and seeing all the water coming in,\" she says.",
      "By this time, the Sea Story was sinking fast. Those who had reached the top deck knew they would have to jump into the water - a 2-3m (7-10ft) drop.",
      "\"I was paralysed because Cristhian kept saying to me 'don't jump' because he could see someone was trying to release the life raft,\" Hissora recalls.",
      "Sarah was behind Hissora and desperate to get out. \"There were other guests holding on to the side, blocking the exit,\" she remembers. \"We were shouting at them to move out of the way.\"",
      "With the water rising fast, Hissora, Sarah and the dozen or so people who had reached the top deck jumped into the water. They knew the danger was not over yet. \"If the boat was going down, we needed to get away so it wouldn't pull us down with it,\" says Sarah.",
      "Natalia, who had also jumped in, swam around the boat - she heard people screaming from inside the cabins and tried to use floating debris to break the windows, but didn't succeed.",
      "Sarah and Natalia were among the few who had grabbed a life jacket before escaping, but Sarah says they were not functioning as they should have.",
      "\"We noticed the lights weren't working. Looking back, I don't think there were any batteries in there.\"",
      "It is just one of several safety failings reported by the people we interviewed.",
      "In total, we have spoken to seven of the survivors who had been staying on the lower deck. They all tell a near-identical story of the moment the boat went over - but not all of them escaped the same way.",
      "Lucianna Galetta was in a cabin towards the back of the lower deck with her partner Christophe Lemmens. They were just moments slower than the others in realising the danger. That delay cost them dearly.",
      "\"We started to get up and tried to find the life jackets,\" says Lucianna. \"We opened the door but there was already water in the corridor. I think we panicked as we jumped in and almost drowned.\"",
      "Unable to reach the exit at the front, Lucianna and Christophe ended up in an air pocket in the engine room at the stern (rear) of the boat, which was still sticking out of the water. They did not understand where they were until they were joined in the tiny space, some time later, by one of the dive instructors, Youssef al-Faramawy.",
      "The three of them would stay there, sitting on fuel tanks, for about 35 hours.",
      "Outside the boat, Sarah, Hissora and the others who had jumped off eventually found the two life rafts, which had deployed after the sinking. As they clambered on board, they saw the boat's captain and a number of other crew members were already there.",
      "\"There should be some supplies in here,\" Sarah remembers one of the other guests saying. All the people we spoke to recall a safety briefing mentioning that the life rafts had food and water in them - but they did not, the BBC were told.",
      "\"We found a torch, but again it didn't have any batteries. We didn't have any water or any food,\" Sarah says. \"There were flares, but they had already been used.\"",
      "Sarah also says of the three blankets on board the raft, one had been taken by the captain for himself, leaving one for the rest of the crew and another for the guests. \"We ripped it up and huddled together,\" says Sarah.",
      "The rafts were met by rescue vessels at about 11:00 on the morning of 25 November, about eight hours after the capsizing. Both they, and the boat, had drifted eastwards.",
      "Back on board the Sea Story, Lucianna heard the rescue helicopter - but her ordeal was far from over.",
      "\"At this time we were very happy, but we had to wait 27 hours more,\" she says.",
      "Despite the boat having been located, the rescue effort was slow to reach them. \"We had no communication with the outside, nothing. No-one tried to see if there was someone alive in there,\" Lucianna says.",
      "She tells me there were moments when darkness and despair overtook her. \"I was so ready to die. We didn't think that someone would come.\"",
      "After several hours trapped in the air pocket, the dive guide, Youssef, wanted to try to swim through the boat, but Lucianna and Christophe persuaded him not to. \"Stay with us because they are going to come to get our bodies, so they will find us,\" Lucianna recalls telling him.",
      "Eventually, after nearly a day and a half stuck in the hull of the Sea Story, a light appeared in the darkness.",
      "A local Egyptian diving instructor, Khattab al-Faramawi, who was Youssef's uncle, had braved the wreck, diving through the submerged corridors looking for people. He took Youssef out first, then, after another hour's delay because of issues with the breathing apparatus, returned to lead Lucianna and her partner to safety. \"I hugged him so hard,\" says Lucianna. \"I was very, very happy.\"",
      "In total, five people from the Sea Story were rescued by divers, including a Swiss man and a Finnish man who had survived in another air pocket inside their cabin on the lower deck. Four bodies were recovered.",
      "But Lucianna is critical of the fact the Egyptian navy had to rely on volunteers. \"We waited 35 hours. I don't understand how there are no divers on the Egyptian military boats.\"",
      "Lucianna, Christophe and Youssef were taken on board a waiting naval vessel, before returning to shore. They were the last to be rescued. At least 11 people either died or are missing, presumed dead.",
      "Among them are Jenny Cawson and Tarig Sinada, a couple from Devon who were staying on the main deck, on the side of the boat that hit the water. Their bodies have never been found.",
      "\"It doesn't feel like it's real,\" says Andy Williamson, a friend of the couple. \"We keep expecting them to walk through the door.\" A month and a half after the sinking, hopes of that happening have all but vanished.",
      "The couple were experienced divers who always carefully researched the safety record of boats before their trips. They were also switched on to the Sea Story at the last minute, something that may have ultimately cost them dearly.",
      "The BBC spoke to survivors from nearly every cabin on the vessel in which someone got out alive. They all confirm the boat sank between 02:00 and 03:00. However, according to local authorities, a distress signal was not received until about 05:30 - a further factor which may have cost lives.",
      "Five survivors also reported that the heavy furniture on the top deck was unsecured and moved around before the sinking. The woman who had been sleeping on deck believes it all shifting to one side, as the boat started to overturn, further destabilised the Sea Story.",
      "The narrative put forward by Egyptian officials in the immediate aftermath, reported by news agencies around the world, was that a huge wave hit the boat. Multiple survivors' experiences in the water, just minutes after the capsizing, casts doubt on that.",
      "\"When we were in the water, the waves weren't so big that we weren't able to swim in them,\" says Sarah, \"so it does leave us wondering why that boat sank.\"",
      "Those suspicions are supported by data.",
      "Dr Simon Boxall is a leading oceanographer from the University of Southampton. He has analysed the weather from the day which shows the biggest waves were about 1.5m (5ft) - so he says \"there is no way a 4m (13ft) wave could have occurred in that region, at that time\".",
      "The Egyptian Meteorological Authority had warned of high waves on the Red Sea and advised against maritime activity on 24 and 25 November. But, according to Dr Boxall, \"these were over 200km (120 miles) away to the north of where the vessel went down.\"",
      "He says that leaves only two options, either pilot error or an error in the design of the vessel - or a combination of both.",
      "The UK's Marine Accident Investigation Board (MAIB), which will shortly publish a safety bulletin into the sinking, has recently warned divers of safety issues in the Red Sea after a number of incidents - at least two of which involved the same company, Dive Pro Liveaboard.",
      "The BBC sent all the safety concerns raised in this article to the Egyptian government and the company, Dive Pro Liveaboard, multiple times. We are yet to receive a response from either.",
      "After the disaster, the Egyptian authorities immediately opened an investigation into the sinking. That is yet to report, but for the friends of Jenny and Tarig this is about more than one boat.",
      "\"We've unfortunately had to learn of the dangers of diving in Egypt in the most tragic of circumstances,\" says Andy Williamson. \"I don't know how we will ever get over this.",
      "Lucianna wants to understand exactly what went wrong. \"We are lucky to be alive,\" she says. \"But there are so many people who didn't come back from this and I want their families to be able to grieve.\"",
      "On Wednesday, the survivors tell the BBC about what happened to them after they had been rescued - and the questions they now have about the official investigation.",

      "Introduction",
      "The first time it hit me that I had reached \"a certain age\" was while strolling through the streets of downtown New York with my daughters. They are, if I may be so bold, stunning girls. Rowan is a strawberry blonde with curves to die for; Grier is six feet tall, all legs, and towers over me. They're also funny, fiercely intelligent, thoughtful, and kind, though I guess those traits are less obvious to the casual observer.",
      "On this particular day, we were walking side by side, me in the middle, and it was impossible not to notice the admiring looks from various passersby. Over the years I've become used to being recognized on the street, but this time was different: the looks weren't cast in my direction, but at the two beauties by my side. I had every single feeling, all at once. What are you doing ogling my babies I will cut you but also aren't they gorgeous but also, wait, no one's gazing at me? When did that happen? Am I over? Protectiveness, pride, melancholy\u2014it all smacked me upside the head in one quintessential New York minute.",
      "There was also the time I was doing a photo shoot, and after a couple shots I took a peek at the monitor. \"I think there's some dust on the camera lens,\" I said to the photographer, pointing to a weird line on my cheek. His response was something to the effect of a pitying \"Awww, you're cute.\" There was no dust. That \"something\" was a wrinkle.",
      "I didn't have my first child until I was thirty-seven. I went through a hard time after I had Rowan, suffering from postpartum depression, which I wrote about in my first book, Down Came the Rain. But with the help of good medical professionals and the right medication, I felt like myself again, more or less, by her first birthday. I had Grier when I was forty, and the ensuing decade felt, in a word, playful. That was a brand-new feeling for me. I remember thinking in my forties, This isn't old at all! This is fun! Keep in mind, I'd been treated like an adult (and was expected to behave like one) since I was a kid. At forty, it was as though my biological age finally aligned with the age I'd felt for decades. I felt mature yet still playful. I was firing on all cylinders, and at the risk of sounding like Maria von Trapp, the world seemed full of possibilities. I felt like I was being primed for a moment when I could finally pat myself on the back and say \"You've earned it!\" if I chose to take a break. Plus, I'd arrived at a place of self-acceptance. I actually liked my body and no longer compared it to the runway models. (I never did runway and believed those girls were \"skinny,\" whereas I was considered \"athletic\"\u2014in my modeling days, a euphemism for \"not skinny.\") At forty, relieving myself of being compared to others felt like freedom. Mine was a body to be proud of. This body gave me babies! This body could dance! I had curves and was okay with that! It wasn't exactly \"I am woman, hear me roar,\" but I certainly felt like, \"I am woman, hear me more.\"",
      "And yet, as my forties progressed into my fifties, I began to notice that external perceptions didn't seem to match up with my internal sense of self. My industry no longer received me with the same enthusiasm I had come to expect. The vibe from casting agents and producers, but also my fans, was more: you need to stop time ... and maybe even reverse it. Case in point: at a routine dermatological appointment (to get a mole checked out), the doctor, unsolicited, waved his hand around my face and said, \"We could fix all that ...\"",
      "\"All what?\" I asked.",
      "\"You know, all the\"\u2014cue more hand waving\u2014\"you know.\"",
      "What the hell? Who asked for your opinion? I thought as I heard myself say, \"Thank you, but not yet.\"",
      "Maybe it took seeing myself through the eyes of other people to fully understand that, in fact, I was entering a new era of life. I mean, I was aware that some things were changing. I get tired now in a way I never did before. I literally can't read the fine print, and I hate it. I used to get mad at my mom for always misplacing her reading glasses, and now it's me saying \"Grier, honey, have you seen my readers?\" I like doing needlepoint and puzzles, which admittedly feels a bit geriatric. Am I in my mahjongg era?? I need 2.5s for these granny activities!",
      "And yes, sometimes I put on a pair of pants that once fit, and think, God, this used to be so much easier. Or I watch my kids, who can sleep until noon without stirring at the garbage trucks or sirens outside, and think, Ah, youth. There was a time when I could go to bed without taking a pill or being up for hours in the middle of the night, what was that like? And though these shockingly beautiful young women spend hours in front of the very mirrors I try to avoid, they still don't realize how fresh and perky and unaffected by gravity their bodies are\u2014just like we didn't at their age. (I mean, the butt and the boobs! How did I not appreciate that when I had it?) They complain that they hate their legs, whereas my knees are now practically lower than my calves. How is that even a thing? We are always chasing, never appreciating, and what runs through my mind is, Ugh, where is the justice?? Why are we forever criticizing ourselves and our bodies while seeking ridiculous perfection? Why do we never see how unique and special we are? And why, when we finally take the pressure off or count our blessings or just enjoy who we are, is it practically too late?",
      "But while I don't feel as invincible as I did in my youth, I also don't feel fifty-nine. When I was a kid, fifty-nine seemed so OLD, but it sure doesn't feel old to me now! When I say my age out loud, I know it may sound old to some people, but I truly don't feel, in any way, aged. Aging is a journey full of contradictions, especially in America. It's humbling and surprising and empowering and daunting and liberating. In plenty of cultures, older people are revered. In Korea, the sixtieth and seventieth birthdays are considered major life events, marked by parties and feasts. In Native American communities, elders are often referred to as \"wisdom-keepers\"\u2014they're considered community leaders. In India, elders have the final word in family disputes. In the Henchy-Shields household, on the other hand, this elder is constantly told, \"Mom, you just don't get it!\"",
      "In fact, a March 2023 cover story of the American Psychological Association's Monitor on Psychology described ageism in America as \"one of the last socially acceptable prejudices.\" Brands trip over themselves to capture the coveted eighteen-to-thirty-four demographic, even though surveys have found it's women over forty who have the most purchasing power: we have accumulated wealth, and we're making 85 percent of the household-buying decisions. The numbers for women over fifty are even more staggering: We control a net worth of $19 trillion, and spend 2.5 times that of the average person. Women in their forties and fifties are treated like we're invisible, even though we're one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country. (One in four Americans is a woman over forty.) We are ignored by brands, and when we are targeted, it's for wrinkle cream or menopause supplements. Talk about shortsighted.",
      "This notion of invisibility is so widespread, so pervasive, that it has become the namesake of a social phenomenon, aptly dubbed \"invisible woman syndrome.\" The gist? When we are no longer deemed sexy or able to contribute to society by birthing and raising young children, our value diminishes. We are overlooked, ignored, or worse, not seen at all.",
      "And the older we get, the more extreme it gets. An analysis of nearly eleven thousand ads featuring over twenty thousand people in 2021 and 2022 found that those featuring women over sixty years old amounted to a whopping 0.93 percent of all advertisements. You read that right: less than one percent of all advertisements feature women over sixty, even though the 2020 census found that one in six people in America is over sixty-five.",
      "According to a survey of women over forty by the advertising agency Fancy (which is specifically focused on marketing to a female audience), most women over forty feel that brands \"underestimate their spending power and intelligence while overestimating their preoccupation with appearance.\" We are, it turns out, more than just a demographic obsessed with looking younger. We embody vitality. We are smart and vibrant and powerful and ambitious. We are experienced, confident, capable, and complicated. We are running s**t.",
      "The truth is, I still can't quite get over that I'm using words like \"aging\" and \"elder\" in the same breath as I talk about myself and my friends. I'm not even sixty! I may not be playing the ing\u00e9nue or the girl next door or even the first love, but I'm not exactly the grandmother in Titanic.",
      "And yet, no one knows what to do with me. After all, Brooke Shields is not allowed to get old. The sixteen-year-old Calvin Klein model? Time magazine's face of the '80s? It's sacrilegious! I remember seeing a picture of what Marilyn Monroe would look like if she were still alive today, and it was truly impossible to wrap my head around. But she died looking like Marilyn Monroe. For me, as my body and face change in all the ways they should (don't get me started on my thinning, graying eyebrows), there is this sense of How dare you? That was never the plan, young lady! And, to be totally honest, there have been times when it's made me feel like a disappointment. Maybe you've felt this way, too\u2014maybe you were an athlete in your youth, singled out for your form and speed, and now you can still swim or run or play tennis or whatever, but not at the same level. You're still strong, but you had the audacity to grow older, to change, to slow down a bit, to not die young or stop aging entirely. You survived, and it should be celebrated, and yet there's a sense that you're not as valuable or exceptional as you once were, and therefore you're letting people down. And these reactions can cause us to feel disappointed in ourselves, too. I look back sometimes and feel like I've done something wrong because I no longer have the body or the face that I used to have. And yet, if I did anything drastic to hold on to my looks from my youth or to stop aging, I'd be judged or chastised for that, too.",
      "Generally speaking, at fifty-nine, I feel more confident than I ever have. I'm more comfortable in my skin and have stopped comparing myself to this ideal or worrying about that expectation. But I'll admit that even as I'm experiencing this newfound sense of satisfaction, I have to remind myself, sometimes daily, that I am good enough. The old negative tapes are lying in wait in the Walkman (remember those!?), ready for me to press play at any moment. But I also realize that if I don't wear makeup or the \"right-sized jeans and someone has a problem with it, that's on them. And yes, I continue to exercise and take care of my skin, but I think of it now as a privilege, because it makes me feel better. Do I sometimes wish that all my bits had remained higher and perkier? Or that I had the same skin that appeared on the cover of Life magazine in 1983? Of course I do! Who doesn't miss the gifts of youth? But this is a body\u2014and soul\u2014that has carried me through a lot, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I think I deserve some credit for this life well lived. We do all this work and get through hard times and suddenly you have a line on your face, and that one little wrinkle carries more weight than decades of accomplishments.",
      "I'll tell you, it took me a long time to have the guts to say that I deserved a bit more respect. Something began to shift in me around age forty. I started to own myself and my narrative in a new way. I'm not sure what it was that finally clicked, though becoming a mother probably had something to do with it. What I do know is that gaining that deeper sense of identity allowed me to speak up when others tried to diminish me. It's allowed me to look within and identify patterns and break cycles. It's allowed me to take on new risks and challenges. I know who I am and what I have to offer, and I've stopped hoping or trying to be different, or something that I'm not.",
      "Of course, as proud as I am of how far I've come ... there is still so much that I want to do. I want to pile into a camper with my daughters and my husband and take a cross-country road trip (although we'd probably end up killing each other, and the romance of the Porta Potti would surely wear off quickly). I want to learn to play an instrument. I want to get back to being fluent in French (it was my college major, after all). I want to travel to places I haven't been. The list goes on.",
      "All of this is doable, because there's a lot of freedom that comes with age. It's more fun to take a dance class when you can truly let yourself dance like no one is watching. It's more fun to go out with friends when you aren't worrying if you said the wrong thing or if people are talking about you behind your back. It's more fun to go to a restaurant alone when you realize that no one is wondering why you don't have a companion ... that no one is looking at you at all, because they're all dealing with their own s**t. And while, yes, my body is a little creakier than it once was, and it's not as easy to lose weight, the truth is I can still do almost everything I used to do. And the things I can't, well, I don't really want to. I don't want to surf ... I don't want to ski, unless it's somewhere sunny and the trail is long and relatively flat\u2014I just don't feel like exposing myself to freezing temperatures, fighting scary moguls, and navigating with the gear. But I don't feel limited. I'm happy that, at least for me, the moment for more intense, competitive activities has passed, and the moment for new emotional beginnings has arrived. I don't have to prove myself anymore. This is it. This is me! And if there is something I want to change, then I can make the decision to do so.",
      "What I've come to realize\u2014not only from my own lived experience but also from conversations with other women my age\u2014is that these \"later\" years are all about coming into your own and pivoting in the directions you've always wanted to go. You can finally live the life you intended to, because you no longer have to act in accordance with external timelines, something that is part and parcel of being a woman. I don't have to get married by this date or have kids by this age or get a certain job before that milestone. My time is my own.",
      "And yet\u2014 this newfound gift has come as a bit of a surprise. After all, the narrative we've been served for years is that it's all downhill for women after a certain age. As I hit my midfifties, I grew increasingly curious about the disconnect between how this age feels and how it's portrayed in our culture and society. I talked to other women my age who felt the same tension I did\u2014 both personally empowered and systemically dismissed. And this idea of being collectively ignored ... it irked me. I started connecting even more with women over forty, online and on social media, because I wanted to dig into what makes aging hard and what makes it great. What began as an online community to discuss health, aging, sexuality, relationships, and just plain living\u2014to dish about all those things you can't say to anyone except your closest girlfriends\u2014evolved into a hair-care brand, Commence, and a new business. So here I am, a first-time CEO in my fifties, inspired to start a business\u2014and write a book!\u2014all because of society's most uninspiring take on women my age.",
      "My first two memoirs, Down Came the Rain and There Was a Little Girl, were at their core about overcoming obstacles: first, postpartum depression, and second, losing my mom. But there is nothing to \"overcome\" about aging. That's the whole point! This time of our lives is something to enjoy and revel in, not something to merely survive. So if those books were about how I persevered through tough moments, this one is about how I took ownership and agency of a moment I'd been told would be tough, but really is rich and complex. But come on, life is complex. This book is about embracing an era that has been billed as an obstacle when, in reality, it's a stimulus. Yes, it has new and difficult challenges, but it doesn't have to be viewed as torture or a time to throw in the towel. I'm not trying to stave off this period, or deny it, or pretend I'm not in it. I'm taking the whole mess of it and reminding myself, and hopefully other women, that we have the elements we need to thrive. The story we've been told is, in a word, bulls**t. We are the narrators of our next chapters.",
      "For too long, women have talked about aging only in whispers and behind closed doors. Maybe it's because we've been embarrassed or ashamed. Maybe it's because we don't think anyone would want to hear what we have to say. These are understandable responses to our treatment by society, but they only serve to keep us isolated and disempowered. Recently, I had the pleasure of attending an intimate \"couch conversation\" with Gloria Steinem where she was talking about the challenges of being a woman today. The younger women in the room were eagerly asking her, \"But how can we fix it? How can we be a force for change?\" And she reminded us that \"every important movement started in a room like this\u2014in a basement, or a living room.\" When we step out from behind those closed doors and use our voices to talk about the misunderstandings, the underestimations, we're already starting to change them. Maybe even fix them.",
      "As far as I can tell, these decades in our lives are a time to be celebrated. Sure, there will be some hot flashes (been there!), but we can wear layers. (Or take hormones, which I have done, but more on that later.) I can tell you that the discomfort of those moments is far outweighed by the delight that comes from making intentional friendships, pursuing new interests, discovering our peak confidence, and giving ourselves permission to make changes to our lives.",
      "In 2023, my dear friend Ali Wentworth produced a documentary, Pretty Baby, about my life. Watching it, and seeing just how much I've been through, I couldn't help but feel proud. I'm not saying everyone should make a documentary about their lives, but I hope you can look back at how far you've come, how much life you've lived in order to get to this moment, and give yourself credit for the feat that it is. And then I hope it gives you the jump start you need to figure out how to enjoy this new stage of your life. Because the time is now! If there is something you want to change, now's the time to change it. If there's something you want to stop, now's the time to stop it. If there's something you want to do, now's the time to do it.",
      "Being relegated to the sidelines, as misguided as it is, also offers us more room to fully be ourselves. There's less pressure. We can push boundaries when we're moving through the world without the watchful eyes of, well, everyone. In Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis, author Ada Calhoun reconsiders all the so-called negatives of getting older. \"Could we see ... our newfound midlife invisibility as a source of power?\" she writes. \"There are great advantages to being underestimated. Two of the best reporters I know are women in their fifties. They look so friendly and nonthreatening, if you notice them at all. They can lurk in any room without usually wary people remembering to keep their guard up. Then they write devastating whistle-blowing articles. The world ignores middle-aged women at its peril.\"",
      "At fifty-nine, I'm the one making the calls in my life\u2014not my mother or the media or Hollywood or my family\u2014which is something I've never felt before. And this should be true for all of us. It doesn't matter what you've done, or what you think you've done (good or bad), or even what you always wanted to do. This is a new time. The same rules don't apply. Is that disorienting? Maybe, but I like to give it a different spin: We can make our own rules.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 10:08:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Now nearly 60, the model and actress was recently elected president of Actors' Equity, and launched Commence, her beauty brand for women over 40. She's also written her fourth book, \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old,\"",
    "story": [
      "Last Sunday, Demi Moore accepted her first major acting award at the Golden Globes. Watching from home was Brooke Shields \"My kids'll be like, 'Oh, it's Golden Globe night. Get the bottle of wine for Mom! Get the tequila!'\" Shields laughed. \"It's so interesting, these award shows, right? They can be torturous if you sit there and you go like, Why am I not valid enough to get that, do that, whatever?\"",
      "I asked, \"You've felt that?\"",
      "\"I've felt it my entire life.\"",
      "It can be surprising to hear that a veteran actress like Shields yearns for acceptance. Turns out she's totally human. \"I was listening to Demi, 'We've weren't the ones that ever got awards.' Like, no. I got People's Choice Awards! The people loved me.\"",
      "\"So, you get the People's Choice Award, but you wanted the Emmy, the Oscar?\"",
      "\"You just wanted, like, to be part of the group, the cool kids,\" said Shields. \"That's where the little insecure girl comes out.\"",
      "At this point in her career of six decades, the comedienne has earned the right to laugh at herself.",
      "Currently 59, Shields said she feels 38. \"I definitely feel a youthfulness that I didn't feel in my younger years,\" she said.",
      "She started modeling while wearing diapers. Later, she turned heads wearing Calvin Klein jeans. Shields was expected to sell products and say her lines, all while looking gorgeous. She delivered.",
      "But as she approaches 60, she's found a cultural script she's powerfully rejecting.",
      "\"By the time you get to 50, they've just completely written you off,\" she said. \"You are out to pasture. Society says, 'Oh, if you're not the hot twenty-something at the bar, you're an old lady.' There's this whole demo in the middle that gets just overlooked.\"",
      "It's those overlooked women for whom Shields has written her fourth book: \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old\" (to be published Tuesday by Flatiron). \"When you are someone that has been noted for looking a certain way, by virtue of just growing older, you become a disappointment, in a way,\" she said. \"I've watched people get sort of personally affronted that I dare to be 60!\"",
      "\"And what do you say to them?\"",
      "\"I just sort of feel bad for them,\" Shields said. \"And I'm a part of the problem, because I was that symbol, you know, maybe unwittingly. But I didn't set out to do that.\"",
      "Nearly 44 years after being named the face of a decade, Shields hopes to be a voice for her generation \u2013 empowering women by sharing her personal and at times vulnerable experiences.",
      "In her book, she reveals that a doctor performed a surgery on her that she did not consent to. \"I was asked by my gynecologist if I experienced discomfort, and I said yes.\"",
      "In the late 2000s, Shields went to a surgeon to help reduce some labia discomfort. But after the operation, she says she found out he performed an extra procedure: an unwanted vaginal rejuvenation. \"He literally looked at me and said, like, 'I tightened you up a bit,'\" Shields said. \"And I was like, 'What?' And he just sort of was, like, boasting that he 'threw in a little bonus' for me. And I was in such shock that I just, I became numb. I didn't even know what to do.\"",
      "\"What did you say?\"",
      "\"I didn't say it, I didn't say a thing. because it sounded like he wanted me to thank him,\" Shields replied. \"I didn't say anything then, and this is the first time I've said anything.\"",
      "That so-called bonus surgery has had lasting side effects. The actress and model says sex can be painful.",
      "\"This was, you know, a long time ago. We didn't know what we could fight or complain. I finally had a life and kids, and it was like, 'Dear God, I don't want that kind of attention,'\" she said.",
      "So, why is she speaking out now? \"Because I have daughters. And there's no shame around it. And the more we have those conversations with them, conversations that I never had, the more progress I think we will have as women.\"",
      "Shields is looking to make progress in other ways, too. In May, she was elected president of Actors' Equity Association, the union representing 51,000 actors and stage managers around the country. As a five-time Broadway star, she felt a responsibility to give back to a community that's embraced her.",
      "She's already taken her fight to Washington for more funding and to change tax policy. \u00a0\"It's been a learning curve,\" she said. \"It's trial by fire. I'd never gone on the Hill and met with Congressmen and Senators. But you know, producers need to take care of the people that bleed for them on a daily basis.\"",
      "Besides being a union boss, Shields is now a CEO. She'd founded the beauty brand Commence, after hearing concerns from aging women about their hair. \"They have felt overlooked, and that's just the truth,\" she said. \"They're not being marketed to.\"",
      "Asked what the hardest part of being a CEO is, Shields replied, \"Money raising. Keeping the money flowing, because you have to put it right back into the company. And you know, nobody's getting salaries yet. Least I'm not!\" she laughed.",
      "Don't ask Brooke Shields if she's ready to slow down. Age has brought wisdom, and she's just getting started.",
      "\"I'm, you know, going to be 60 years old,\" she said. \"I'm still here. I feel like I'm at the beginning of a new, really exciting stage. The more confident you get \u2013 isn't it interesting \u2013 the more opportunity you get. And yet, you couldn't have arrived at said confidence without going through all the time to get here.\"",

    "title": "Wendell Pierce: An actor's journey",
    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:40:16 -0500",
    "summary": "With standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Death of a Salesman,\" and the CBS drama \"Elsbeth,\" the acclaimed actor talks about his childhood in New Orleans, training at New York's Juilliard School, and tackling the character of Willy Loman.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a few years since Wendell Pierce attended a drama class at the Juilliard School in Manhattan. Forty years, to be exact. \"I remember it well. High windows and gray floors!\" he laughed.",
      "He's said that nothing in his career gave him as much anxiety as training at Juilliard: \"Yes, the anxiety of, you know, am I doing the right thing? I'm going into an unknown world. Will I have what it takes to be just a working actor? And so, I was reminded looking in that class, it was very touching to see these young people at a point in the journey that I recall with fondness \u2013 and with a lot of anxiety, too! But I knew I was exactly where I wanted to be.\"",
      "And it's where he belongs. At 61, Pierce is among the most prolific and respected actors of his generation, with standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Treme,\" \"Suits,\" \"Selma,\" and now, the quirky CBS drama, \"Elsbeth.\" Later this year, he'll play editor-in-chief Perry White in the newest Superman movie. He'll also take on Othello at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C.",
      "No matter the part, Pierce brings his own humanity to it. He said, \"In every role, there's a little part of Wendell in it. At the end of the run, I turn the lights down low in the dressing room and I just see the silhouette in the mirror. And I have a good cry and say goodbye. Right? I say, 'Man, you taught me so much about myself. I've learned so much from you. I hope I see you again. And I know there'll be times where I will see you again.'\"",
      "That sense of self-discovery began in his hometown of New Orleans, and the historical Black neighborhood of Pontchatrain Park. \"It was like a Black Mayberry,\" he said. \"The first Black mayor came out of there, the first Black DA. Lawyers, doctors, postal workers, maintenance men. That was the community I grew up in. It was absolutely wonderful. And it was totally destroyed. We were destroyed by Katrina. We were part of the deepest flooding. And we brought it back, and now we're on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",
      "His mother, Althea, was a beloved schoolteacher. \"She taught everybody in the neighborhood. And I just remember how, everywhere I went, I knew that I had to live up to being her son,\" Pierce said.",
      "His father, Amos Pierce, Jr., was a World War II veteran. \"He was Army unit attached to the 3rd Marines in the invasion of Saipan. And after that, his unit received medals of commendation. And because he was there with the Black unit, the officer didn't believe him when he told him. He said, 'Listen, I think we received medals.' And it was a woman who said, 'Yeah, right. You? You didn't receive anything.'\"",
      "It would take 65 years for the injustice to be corrected. \"We gave him his medals on Veteran's Day 2010,\" Pierce said. \"I tell that story to say that he was a man who loved this country even when the country didn't love him back. And even after receiving the medals, there was a great pride. He didn't let the anger destroy him. And that was a great lesson.\"",
      "Pierce sees his own life as a series of lessons \u2013 and acting is part of that journey. He said, \"Every audition for me is an opening and closing night, where you get to perform: This is what I would do with this material. You do whatever you like from this point on. And then you leave the room.\"",
      "And he says his best work \u2013 be it as Detective Bunk Moreland on \"The Wire,\" or in Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X,\" comes from the writing. He said, \"The really good material is the thing that will define it, you know, and make it classic. Something that speaks to people across time and place no matter where you are, that's gonna speak to people years from now.\"",
      "A career highlight was in 2022, when Pierce became the first Black actor to play Willy Loman on Broadway, in Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\"",
      "Why does he think it took so long? \"The ignorance of biases and bigotry, and when people just don't have the ability to see others' humanity,\" Pierce said. \"And it's something that people are very conscious of at times, and then sometimes they're not very conscious of it.\"",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "And it's Pierce's own compassion that draws people towards him, like Carrie Preston, his co-star on \"Elsbeth.\" She said, \"This kind of connection isn't always guaranteed. We've got it here. I'm grateful for it.\"",
      "And it's what his fellow Juilliard classmate Bradley Whitford recalled when he surprised Pierce with a message during our interview: \"Wendell, I miss you. I love you. I am so proud of you, not only for the great actor that you are and the dear friend, but what an amazing citizen you are. I love you!\"",
      "\"That's very special,\" said Pierce. \"Brad and I, we're part of a very special group here at Juilliard, our class. You know, when you go through the fire together, you're connected forever.\"",
      "Pierce has said he wants to make his mark. I asked, \"Do you think that you have? And what is that mark? What do you want to leave for people?\"",
      "\"I was afraid that I may not have the opportunity to leave my mark, that my best days were behind me,\" he replied. \"I had that fear, and I tapped into that fear when I did 'Death of a Salesman.' And while I still have the fear, now I have courage.",
      "\"I hope I can have an impact on someone else that way, the way they have an impact on me.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 21:59:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Sam Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
    "story": [
      "Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin,'\" has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \"call and response\" of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music's most enduring hits, which also included \"You Don't Know Like I Know,\" \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\" and \"I Thank You.\"",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music's most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \"Play it, Steve\" midway through \"Soul Man.\"",
      "Like many '60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \"Soul Man\" hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \"Saturday Night Live\" stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \"Soul Men\" depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning that, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\"Two thousand dollars for my lifetime?\" Moore said then. \"If you're making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don't give me cornbread and tell me it's biscuits.\"",
      "Moore wrote the song \"Dole Man,\" modeled on \"Soul Man,\" for Republican Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump's inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign used the song \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\"",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s but didn't meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label's Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band's troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "He married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction which he credited with saving his life.",
      "\"I did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\"That's funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I'm laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\"",
      "Moore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and performed for presidents, including Obama.",
      "Moore is survived by his wife, Joyce, daughter, Michell, and two grandchildren.",

      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention,\u00a0experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Trump urges court to pause",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",

    "summary": "The death risk goes up to 1 in 100 for those who drink alcohol nine times per week, the report found.",
    "story": [
      "Consuming more than one drink a day results in a steep increase of the risk of premature death, a new federal review has concluded. The draft report was published Tuesday ahead of a major update to influential federal guidelines on how much alcohol Americans should drink.",
      "\"In the United States, males and females have a 1 in 1000 risk of dying from alcohol use if they consume more than 7 drinks per week. This risk increases to 1 in 100 if they consume more than 9 drinks per week,\" the report's authors concluded, in a final draft published by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The review is one of two written by committees of outside experts to inform this year's update to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The other was published last month by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.",
      "The upcoming guidelines are important because the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies often rely on the recommendations to justify new rules, like on how to label food and drinks. Men are currently recommended to limit intake to no more than two drinks per day and women are recommended to limit to one drink per day.",
      "\"Once you're over a drink a day, your risk of dying from alcohol is already above one percent. Some people may think that doesn't sound like a lot, but in terms of a public health guideline, that would be really, really high,\" said Dr. Timothy Naimi, director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research and one of the authors of the report.",
      "Naimi was careful to say that the report was \"not endorsing any level of risk\" caused by drinking, but pointed to other countries and health regulations that have used 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 death risks as thresholds to set rules.",
      "It is unclear whether the incoming Trump administration will incorporate the findings of the latest report into any updated guidelines. In 2020, the Trump administration rejected a call by its outside expert panel to recommend limiting drinking for all Americans to no more than once per day, saying the \"emerging evidence\" did not support the move.",
      "The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade coalition which represents spirits producers, called in a statement on the federal government to reject the findings of the panel.",
      "\"Today's report is the product of a flawed, opaque and unprecedented process, rife with bias and conflicts of interest,\" the statement said,\" accusing some of the experts on the federal panel of having ties to international anti-alcohol advocacy organizations.",
      "\"Congress never authorized or appropriated money for the panel or its work, and numerous letters from Congress and industry have voiced serious concerns over the process,\" the council said.",
      "Alcohol linked to deaths from cancer, injuries, other causes",
      "The report was designed to weigh all of the data on a range of diseases and injuries, and boiled down a complex web of studies that have looked at alcohol's health risks and benefits into \"alcohol-attributable death\" estimates.",
      "This modeling is likely underestimating the true health risks of alcohol, Naimi said, given limits in how researchers can study its health impacts.",
      "Risks can also vary widely from person to person, the report cautions, meaning some harms can be very small for some even if they add up to substantial risks at the public health level.",
      "\"The overall effect of alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality is dependent upon the risk of diseases and injuries that are causally related to alcohol. These risks are affected by numerous factors, including smoking, diet, physical activity, obesity, hepatitis infection, and genetics,\" the report states.",
      "At one drink a day, the report estimated that injuries and cancer added up to the biggest contributors of the risk for a premature death.",
      "For men, injuries made up a substantial portion of the risk of dying. This includes a variety of accidents, road injuries and intentional harm, like suicide and violence linked to drinking.",
      "Cancer, which was next largest factor, made up a third of the additional risk of death for men.",
      "For women consuming one drink a day, the risk of death from cancer was statistically similar or larger compared to the increased risk of fatal injuries.",
      "Increased risk of a number of cancers \u2014 colorectal, female breast cancer, and cancers of the liver, mouth, throat and esophagus \u2014 \"begins with any alcohol use and increases with higher levels of use,\" the report states.",

    "summary": "It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to finalize the rule on food labels.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration released on Tuesday its long-awaited proposal to require food manufacturers to put some nutrition facts on the front of packages, in a bid to nudge Americans and food companies towards healthier diets in line with similar pushes in other countries.",
      "FDA's new \"nutrition info box\" focuses on telling people whether levels of saturated fat, sodium and added sugar are \"high\" or \"medium\" or \"low\" as well as the percentage for each serving.",
      "The proposal will be open for public comment for 120 days. It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize the rule.",
      "After that, the FDA says that large food companies earning more than $10 million annually will have three years to comply with the rule. Smaller food brands will have an additional year.",
      "Up to $154 million will be spent by the food industry over the next decade to relabel their products with the new box, the FDA estimates.",
      "The agency also estimates many food brands may also spend millions more dollars to try to rework their products, changing their recipes to avoid being called out as having too much of an unhealthy nutrient.",
      "\"We assume there may be manufacturers who would want to reformulate to maybe move from the high category into the medium category, or the medium category into the low category,\" Rebecca Buckner, the associate deputy director for human food policy at the FDA, told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Trump's pick to head the federal department that oversees the FDA, has been sharply critical of federal nutrition officials for not doing enough to help Americans eat healthier diets and crack down on the food industry.",
      "Kennedy has not specifically addressed the proposal. A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Why only saturated fat, sodium and added sugars?",
      "The FDA said it will require the box to only call out saturated fat, sodium and added sugars. Food manufacturers would not be able to put other nutrients inside the FDA's information box.",
      "They cited research showing that \"simpler schemes are easier for consumers to understand\" for narrowing the box down to just these three worrying unhealthy nutrients.",
      "Designs they tested with focus groups that included nutrients Americans need more of, like fiber and calcium, confused participants.",
      "The FDA said it is still weighing whether calories should be incorporated into the label and acknowledged that some food brands are already voluntarily listing the information on the front.",
      "What determines \"high,\" \"medium\" and \"low\" levels?",
      "FDA officials said Tuesday that levels of saturated fat, sodium or added sugars will be deemed as \"high\" if they are above 20% in the daily value, a measurement of how much Americans eat each day in the \"reference\" diet. Medium was set at between 6% and 19% of the daily value. And low is 5% and below.",
      "Agency officials have used these benchmarks for \"high\" and \"low\" for decades, dating back to the formulation of the nutrition facts label back in the 1990s.",
      "At the time, officials decided against including the \"interpretive descriptions\" in the nutrition facts label. But the agency said recent data shows many Americans do not understand the percentages.",
      "\"It's really based on longstanding usage,\" McKinnon said.",
      "What will it look like?",
      "The FDA says food makers will be required to put the labels \"somewhere in the top third\" of the front of the box.",
      "The box also uses the same Helvetica font used in the nutrition facts on the back of the package and must comply with a range of more detailed rules to avoid it from being too small or obscured by other designs on the package.",
      "Some other design decisions were also abandoned during the focus group testing process, the FDA said.",
      "For example, previous mockups using the colors red, yellow and green to call out different levels did not make a statistically significant difference in helping people interpret the box.",

      "This winter's wave of norovirus infections has reached levels that are now more than double last season's peak, in figures published Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracking the notorious stomach bug.",
      "Nearly 28% of norovirus tests run over the week of the New Year's holiday came back positive for the highly contagious virus, which is the leading cause of foodborne illness like vomiting and diarrhea in the U.S.",
      "That is more than double the 13.52% of tests coming back positive reached during the peak of last season's wave in March, according to data from public health laboratories around the country tallied by the CDC.",
      "Labs usually test samples of sick people's stool for the virus, which can be diagnosed up to 10 days after symptoms begin. The virus can also be found in other samples, including contaminated food or drinks that can spread the virus.",
      "Rates of norovirus in that CDC system have reached levels at or above last season's peak in all regions of the country. Norovirus test positivity rates look to be the worst in the Midwest, in a grouping of states spanning Kansas through Michigan.",
      "Since most people sick with norovirus get better without needing to go to the doctor, a majority of cases go unreported in the U.S. Instead, health authorities and experts use other measurements, such as the rate of positive tests, to track trends of the virus.",
      "Data from WastewaterSCAN's sewer sampling also suggests norovirus rates in recent weeks have been highest in the Midwest as well as the Northeast. Figures published by private testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also above previous seasonal peaks for norovirus.",
      "Why are norovirus cases so high in 2025?",

      "Taxpayers will pick up the tab for the lost birds. To incentivize farmers to quickly report and stomp out the virus, a USDA program pays producers for the eggs and poultry they cull.",

      "Why are bird flu cases high right now in poultry?",
      "U.S. officials brace every winter for upticks in bird flu because migrating wild birds that spread the virus fly south during the colder months.",
      "It's also easier for the virus to spread in the winter. Heat and sunlight degrade the virus on surfaces, the USDA says.",
      "This winter has been different because a strain of the bird flu virus has spilled over into dairy herds too, leading to hundreds of infected herds.",

      "Most American cases of bird flu have been mild. A majority were farm workers who were infected after close contact with animals infected by a bird flu strain that spilled over into dairy cows in late 2023.",
      "Researchers think\u00a0this bird flu strain mutated to be milder to humans than other variants spreading in the wild. Those other strains usually cause more severe disease when they jump into humans.",
      "Can animals be vaccinated for bird flu?",
      "The USDA announced this week it is drawing up a new stockpile of poultry vaccines. That vaccine will target the D1.1 strain of the virus, which has been spreading in wild birds and was recently to blame for a fatal human case in Louisiana.",
      "But officials said it's unlikely the vaccine will be used. The Biden administration has been weighing the possibility of vaccinating poultry for bird flu for years.",

      "The violations, detailed in an inspection report released to CBS News in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, were seen during an inspection of a food production facility in Colorado run by Taylor Farms.",
      "Their findings amounted to the FDA issuing the McDonald's supplier a so-called Form 483, a list of citations over conditions inspectors worried could be \"injurious to health.\"",
      "That facility had been tasked with supplying \"slivered onions\" to McDonald's restaurants across a broad swath of states. Taylor Farms also produces a number of other products, including salads it sells in grocery stores as safe and ready to eat.",

      "\"Taylor Farms is confident in our best-in-class food safety processes, and in turn, the quality and safety of our products. As is common following an inspection, FDA issued observations of conditions that could be improved at one of our facilities,\" Taylor Farms said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Abortion bans enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned may be driving Americans to leave restrictive states, researchers find.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

    "story": [
      "Capital One was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts. As a result, customers lost more than $2 billion in potential interest payments, the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a complaint filed Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took aim at Capital One's promises and handling of its \"360 Savings\" accounts, which were promoted as accounts providing one of the highest interest rates in the nation. But instead, the CFPB alleges, Capital One froze its rate at a low level for at least several years, even as rates rose nationally.",
      "At the same time, the CFPB adds, the bank created \"360 Performance Savings,\" which had a much higher rate \u2014 at one point, more than 14 times higher than the original \"360 Savings\" accounts. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates, part of its effort to fight soaring inflation. As a result, some banks have rolled out high-interest savings accounts to attract savers.",
      "But at the same time, some banks haven't boosted rates on their savings accounts, creating a gap between low-and top-paying accounts, similar to that of Capital One's two offerings. According to the CFPB, Capital One marketed the products similarly to obscure their distinction and forbade employees \"from proactively telling\" those with 360 Savings accounts about the higher-paying 360 Performance Savings, the agency said.",
      "\"Capital One did not specifically notify 360 Savings account holders about the new product, and instead worked to keep them in the dark about these better-paying accounts,\" the CFPB said in a statement. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates to fight soaring inflation, which allowed banks to roll out high-interest savings accounts after years of meager rates.",
      "In response, Capital One said that it strongly disagreed with the CFPB's allegations and plans to \"vigorously defend\" itself in court. The banking giant added that it was \"deeply disappointed to see the CFPB continue its recent pattern of filing eleventh-hour lawsuits ahead of a change in administration.\"",
      "Capital One also maintained that all of its 360 banking products \"offer great rates\" \u2014 and have \"always been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions.\"",
      "Billions in lost interest",
      "These actions mean Capital One \"illegally avoided paying billions in interest to millions of consumers,\" the CFPB wrote in its Tuesday complaint. The agency says it's seeking to impose civil penalties and provide financial relief to those impacted.",
      "\"Banks should not be baiting people with promises they can't live up to,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a prepared statement.",
      "According to disclosures on the Capital One's website, 360 Savings accounts currently carry an interest rate of just under 0.50%. 360 Performance Savings accounts have an interest rate of about 3.74%.",
      "That means the rate for 360 Performance Savings is nearly 7.5 times higher than that of 360 Savings today. But the CFPB says they've been farther apart in the past. In July 2024, the agency notes in Tuesday's complaint, the 360 Performance Savings rate was more than 14 times that of 360 Savings.",
      "The CFPB alleges that Capital One kept the rate for its 360 Savings accounts at 0.30% between December 2020 through at least August 2024. The rate for 360 Performance Savings, by contrast, climbed from 0.40% in April 2022 to as high as 4.35% at the start of 2024 \u2014 falling slightly to 4.25% by August, the agency noted Tuesday.",
      "The CFPB's complaint against Capital One comes less than one week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Despite the change in administration, some say this litigation could still survive.",

Municipal resources, like fire hydrants, have run dry in some areas.",
      "Those who can afford to do so are reaching out to private firefighting crews in hopes of saving their homes from the furious wildfires.",

      "Some of the company's firefighters also work for county fire departments. Others are retired from active duty, according to the company, which offers different levels of protective services ranging in price from $2,500 to $14,000.",
      "Clients called on All Risk Shield before the fires reached their properties to try and protect their homes from encroaching flames.",
      "\"We deployed our teams to these high-risk properties we knew the fire was going to possibly reach, and we were on the ground before the fire even made it to that area,\" Torres said. That included fighting fires from homeowners' properties, using residents' resources like pools, spas, rainwater tanks and water tanks to extinguish flames, in addition to the company's own fire retardants. Torres noted that the company never relies on municipal resources, like fire hydrants, to serve private clients.",
      "He added that the company operates completely independently from Los Angeles County Fire Department, but that \"indirectly, we are helping each other.\"",
      "\"Our teams have been working alongside municipal firefighters in this event,\" he said.",
      "The National Wildfire Suppression Association (NWSA), which represents private firefighter services, said that contractors often join forces with local, state and federal firefighting efforts. Contracts with private home and land owners account for a small share of business for these types of companies; the bulk of contracts comes from providing supplemental personnel and equipment to local, state and federal firefighting efforts, according to the NWSA.",
      "Fire prevention and mitigation contractors also do work for insurance companies performing tasks to reduce fire risks, such as clearing undergrowth, trimming or removing trees near homes, and applying fire retardants. A growing segment of the industry, this work typically occurs during the off-season and not in response to active fires.",
      "An \"all hands on deck\" situation",
      "The association, which represents 369 private firefighting companies across the country, confirmed that its members have directed personnel and other resources toward containing the Los Angeles wildfires. Combined, its member organizations can pool up to 11,000 professionally trained wildland firefighters.",

That includes being directed to mail money orders to third-party \"attorneys\" or representatives, or to upload funds to a Walmart Green Dot Money Card account.",
      "Green Mirage scammers have impersonated more than 400 mortgage institutions and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars of losses to deceived homeowners, many of whom only learn of the fraud when their actual lender starts foreclosure proceedings, the FCC said.",

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0later this month if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "Specifically, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok. If ByteDance had started the process to sell TikTok, the president also could push pause on adoption of the law for 90 days.",
      "On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Elon Musk could buy TikTok's U.S. operations, effectively allowing the app to evade a ban. Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to ever sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "The Supreme Court on Jan. 11 heard arguments from government attorneys, who say TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security, and from lawyers for the social media platform. Experts said the justices seemed receptive to the government's case, increasing the likelihood of a ban. Here's what that would mean for TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

    "story": [
      "By some measures, New York City's traffic is more congested than it's ever been. Enter: Congestion pricing. Since last Sunday, during most hours, cars crossing into the lower half of Manhattan are charged nine dollars. There's a higher toll for trucks.",

      "\"If we can just impact on a proportion of those people, we can make a difference and make it a much better place for everybody,\" said Janno Lieber, who heads the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York's sprawling subway, bus and commuter rail systems. \"We're wasting a ton of money, literally billions of dollars, according to our business leaders, having people stuck in traffic.\"",

      "Wylde is a longtime advocate for congestion pricing, and has advice for other American cities: \"You have to explain the benefits clearly,\" she said. \"You have to have transit options in most cases. Otherwise, it's just another tax, because if somebody has no choice, they're gonna resist.",

    "title": "Jamie Dimon on the economy, billionaires, and income inequality",
    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:21:39 -0500",
    "summary": "The chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase explains why he's referred to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme; his bank's efforts to improve the lives of lower-income Americans; and his recent near-death experience.",
    "story": [
      "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, says he was not surprised that Donald Trump won the election: \"People were angry at whatever they called the state \u2013 the 'swamp.' Ineffective government. That people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously. I think it's the lecturing part of it. It's social superiority, it's the 'My way or the highway.' I traveled all over the country; I felt it wherever I went.\"",
      "I asked, \"There's a sense of gloom out there about the economy. Do you understand that?\"",
      "\"I do understand it, 'cause I think there are a lot of legitimate concerns that Americans have. For example, ineffective government, they're angry about it. They're angry about immigration. There're people with legitimate issues.\"",
      "Despite lower unemployment, a calming of inflation, and a soaring stock marker, even he says he's \"cautiously pessimistic\" about the economy. And as head of the largest bank in America, it matters what Dimon has to say about things.",
      "Listen to him on Bitcoin, which he's referred to as \"a Ponzi scheme\" and \"as useless as a pet rock\": \"We are going to have some kind of digital currency at some point. I'm not against crypto. You know, Bitcoin itself has no intrinsic value. It's used heavily by sex traffickers, money launderers, ransomware. I just don't feel great about Bitcoin. I applaud your ability to wanna buy or sell it. Just like I think you have the right to smoke, but I don't think you should smoke!\"",
      "Since he took charge of the bank 20 years ago, the company has doubled its number of employees to 320,000, and grown its assets by nearly $3 trillion. Which probably would surprise his grandparents, who came to the U.S. from Greece with little money in the early 1900s.",
      "Dimon spent much of his childhood in an apartment building in a middle-class neighborhood in Queens, New York, sharing a room with his two brothers. Revisiting the street where he grew up, Dimon noted, \"I broke my arm on those monkey bars over there.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did you ever dream when you were growing up, in a million years that you'd be running one of the biggest banks in the world?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"My dad was a stockbroker. So, I was sometimes conscious of that part of the world. But I had never met a CEO until I was in college or something like that.\"",
      "He grew up to be one of most successful CEOs in the country, processing $10 trillion a day.",
      "His bank is thriving and healthy, but Dimon, now 68, has had two major health scares. The first was throat cancer a decade ago.",
      "He says it's in remission: \"But I know a little bit more,\" he said. \"People who have been told they have cancer know a little bit more than other people. That's staring you right in the face and it may actually happen. You become a little more deliberate, a little more thoughtful. You don't want to have regrets.\"",
      "He also had a heart scare in March 2020, at the beginning of COVID. \"My heart, I just, I mean, the pain was extraordinary. I thought I heard it rip. It was an aortic dissection. I had a tear in the aorta.\" He was told he might not make it.",
      "I asked, \"Going in for surgery, you know, at least you think in your mind, 'I've lived the life I should've lived so far'?\"",
      "\"Yeah. Not enough of it, but yeah,\" Dimon laughed.",
      "He woke up after seven or eight hours on the operating table: \"The doctor told me I was one of the only people he's ever seen wake up immediately after surgery like that. I waved at my kids, who had been sitting there the whole time. And then, I was back asleep in the ICU.",
      "\"Waking up in the ICU, I mean, like, when you're a man who's never had to rely on other people really, and all of a sudden you have tubes everywhere and you can't do anything yourself, and you know, you got tubes in your heart and tubes in your lungs and tubes down your jugular\u2026\"",
      "He was in the hospital for a week, back at work a month later, and soon traveling the world, which he does, he says, 40 percent of his time.",
      "We met him in the executive suite on the 43rd floor of the bank's Manhattan headquarters. From there, he can see where he grew up \u2013 and to the left, the nearly-twice-as-high, dazzling new JPMorgan headquarters going up next door, which he says will be taller than the Empire State Building.",
      "With all the big things he deals with, it's interesting that one of the things Dimon is most proud of is opening branches in lower-income and underserved communities around the country. Visiting one branch in Harlem, he noted, \"Mortgage documentation is really hard to do. So, in one of these community branches, a guy stood up and he said he finally bought a home that he'd lived in for 30 years. He said there's no way he could have gotten that mortgage if one of our mortgage loan officers didn't call him every day for months, taking him through it, making him feel comfortable, getting the forms. He got our homeowner's grant. And it works.\"",
      "This isn't a not-for-profit; these local branches make money for the bank.",
      "But what about the other end of the spectrum? Asked about the increasing wealth of the very rich and what might be \"out of whack\" with the system, Dimon replied, \"I think you have to be very careful to say, 'What's outta whack?' You want a healthy economy, and a really healthy economy lifts up all citizens. You want to help all Americans? Grow the economy. You can wail at the moon. That's not going to grow the economy. And if there are unfair things that created some of that wealth, they should be fixed.\"",
      "\"But I'm not hearing you say, 'There's something wrong here that there are these billionaires growing like poppy.' I mean, what is it? The tax laws?\"",
      "\"If I was king for a day, I would probably change a bunch of the tax laws, too, which I'm not gonna give you specifics on. It won't reduce it as much as you seem to think it should be reduced.\"",
      "\"No. But I'm interested that you're not saying, 'This is wrong. This is not working.'\"",
      "\"I think the wrong part is that the bottom 30% didn't do better, not that the top 0.1% did so well.\"",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "\"They may be unrelated. What we need to do to fix it for everybody \u2026\"",
      "\"But you haven't said what's wrong at the other end?\"",
      "\"I don't know what's wrong at the other end,\" Dimon replied.",
      "Dimon himself is a billionaire. We asked him about the richest person in the world, Elon Musk. \"He's clearly an extraordinary talent,\" Dimon said. \"I mean, to look at Tesla and SpaceX, yeah, well, we should make government more efficient. Is this the way to do it? I don't know. Do I want them to succeed? Absolutely.\"",
      "\"But it's odd to have a man who's so wealthy, with so many important companies that matter to our economy and even to our national security, now sort of insinuating that he can influence right-wing politics in Europe. It doesn't sound right, does it?\"",
      "Dimon said, \"I'm not responsible for his behavior, so let him do it. But when you say it's odd, it's not that odd. It's been going on in this country for a long time. If you go back to Lindbergh, there's been more interfering in cross-Atlantic politics than you would think.\"",
      "\"Are you distressed by it?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Take it in stride?\"",
      "\"Take it in stride.\"",
      "\"Somebody called him an oligarch, an American oligarch.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's name-calling.\"",
      "Dimon has been in banking for more than 40 years, which leads to the inevitable question: When will he retire? \"Last time I was asked, I said, less than five years. But when you say retire, I'm not going to retire like that. I may write a book. I may teach. I may work with my kids, if they want. I would never pressure them to work with me.\"",
      "\"I didn't hear you say, 'I might become chairman and, you know, just give up the CEO part.'\"",
      "\"Oh, that's likely. That's likely to happen. Again, that is up to the board, not up to me. But if it makes sense, I may be chairing for a couple years.\"",
      "He says he does not know whom his successor might be. But one thing he does know: \"I love my job. I love what it does. I like our people. It motivates me. Like a lotta people, by Friday I'm exhausted. I want to go home, I want to have my martini and go to sleep! But I do love my job. I think it's great to have a purpose in life.

      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 19:41:08 -0500",
    "summary": "The fast-moving legal battle over the release of special counsel Jack Smith's final report played out days before Trump's second-term inauguration.",
    "story": [
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland has submitted to Congress a portion of former special counsel Jack Smith's final report on his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump and released it to the public after a court order blocking its release expired at midnight Tuesday.",
      "Smith wrote in his report that his office began its prosecution of Trump because it had enough evidence against him, that \"[b]ut for Mr. Trump's election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.\"",
      "The report was sent to Congress, a source familiar with the matter confirmed, and made public shortly after following days of legal wrangling over whether it \u2014 or part of it \u2014 should be disclosed to the public. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon on Monday declined a request from Walt Nauta, an aide to Trump, and Carlos de Oliveira, former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, to block volume one of Smith's final report from becoming public.",
      "That portion pertains to Trump's alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Volume two delves into allegations that Trump unlawfully held onto classified documents after the end of his first term in 2021 and obstructed the Justice Department's investigation.",
      "In a letter to Garland accompanying the report, Smith defended his decision to pursue charges against the president-elect and rejected Trump's accusations that his actions were influenced by the top ranks of the Justice Department.",
      "\"To all who know me well, the claim from Mr. Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable,\" Smith wrote, adding later in the report his office had \"no interest in affecting the presidential election.\"",
      "Following the release of the section of the report on the 2020 election probe, the president-elect attacked the former special counsel on social media, calling him a \"a lamebrain prosecutor who was unable to get his case tried before the Election, which I won in a landslide.\"",
      "\"To show you how desperate Deranged Jack Smith is, he released his Fake findings at 1:00 A.M. in the morning,\" Trump said early Tuesday.",
      "Smith used the first volume of his report to defend his work and investigative findings, alleging, \"The throughline of all of Mr. Trump's criminal efforts was deceit \u2014 knowingly false claims of election.\"",
      "Much of the 137-page volume recounts information that has already been made public through court filings during the course of the now-dismissed case against Trump filed in Washington, D.C. It also includes images of the violence that transpired at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump's supporters breached the building in an effort to stop Congress from reaffirming President Biden's win.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that the rioters who descended on the Capitol \"had been motivated and directed by Trump,\" a claim Trump has denied. The former special counsel wrote that his office was \"prepared\" to prove \"Trump willfully caused his supporters to obstruct and attempt to obstruct the proceeding by summoning them to Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Still, Smith wrote that his office \"did not develop direct evidence \u2014 such as an explicit admission or communication with co-conspirators \u2014 of Mr. Trump's subjective intent to cause the full scope of the violence that occurred on January 6.\"",
      "Now, four years since the Jan. 6 attack, more than 1,500 people have been charged as a result of their conduct at the Capitol. The former special counsel wrote that \"with that in mind, Mr. Trump's relative culpability weighed heavily in favor of charging him, as the individual most responsible for what occurred at the Capitol on January 6.\"",
      "Smith revealed that through voluntary interviews of more than 250 individuals and the grand-jury testimony of 55 people, his office was able to gather evidence that pointed to Trump's alleged crime, including allegations that he sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence into delaying the vote certification on Jan. 6, 2021, and he supported the organization of a false slate of electors.",
      "Pence sat for a grand-jury interview with prosecutors during the investigation, CBS News reported at the time.",
      "The former special counsel also detailed ways in which he alleged Trump sought to pressure the Justice Department at the time to investigate the false claims of fraud. At one point, according to the report, Trump allegedly told his acting attorney general to \"just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.\"",
      "A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Trump with four counts in the summer of 2023. He pleaded not guilty to all of the counts. But Smith wrote that his office considered \u2014 and ultimately decided against \u2014 bringing other charges. One potential charge was under the Insurrection Act, a Civil War-era law that bars those who incite an insurrection against the U.S. from holding federal office.",
      "But Smith said that while courts have described the Jan. 6 attack as an \"insurrection,\" his office was \"aware of the litigation risk that would be presented by employing this long-dormant statute.\"",
      "Trump was charged with allegedly participating in crimes with at least six unnamed co-conspirators, and Smith wrote that his office determined some shared criminal culpability with the president-elect. Smith said that after Trump was indicted in August 2023, his office continued to look into whether any of the other alleged participants should face charges. He said that he referred to a U.S. attorney's office for further investigation evidence that one individual may have committed unrelated crimes.",
      "Smith's office made a \"preliminary determination\" that admissible evidence could justify pursuing charges against some of Trump's co-conspirators and had started to look into how to proceed. But because his team did not reach a conclusion or seek any further indictments, Smith wrote that the report \"should not be read to allege that any particular person other than Mr. Trump committed a crime, nor should it be read to exonerate any particular person.\"",
      "Ahead of the report's release, Trump's defense attorneys asked Garland to remove Smith from his post and either decline to release the special counsel's report or hand the matter over to Trump's incoming administration, according to a letter released last week.",
      "The letter, addressed to Garland and a top career official at the Justice Department, alleged the special counsel did not have the legal authority to submit a final report summarizing his investigations into Trump and urged the attorney general to \"put an end to this weaponization of the justice system and move forward constructively.\"",
      "The correspondence was written in part by defense attorneys Todd Blanche and Emile Bove, Trump's picks to serve as deputy attorney general and principal deputy attorney general in his new administration.",
      "Trump has slammed Smith's investigation as politically motivated and denied all wrongdoing in the case.",
      "The legal battle over Smith's report on Trump",
      "The Justice Department's publication of the first volume of Smith's report marked the culmination of a fast-moving legal battle that transpired over the past week and played out days before Trump is to be sworn in for a second term. If the battle had continued until the president-elect's return to the White House on Jan. 20, it's not likely the special counsel's report would have been publicly released.",
      "Cannon, who was assigned to oversee the documents case, issued a temporary order last week that temporarily blocked the Justice Department from making the report public, after which a federal appeals court declined to stop its release. The district judge's order expired at 12 a.m. Tuesday.",
      "Garland has said he wouldn't publicly release the second part of the report because proceedings involving Nauta and de Oliveira are ongoing.",
      "Smith resigned his position as special counsel last Friday, and Justice Department prosecutors have taken over the ongoing matters arising from his investigations. Smith's two probes led to separate prosecutions of Trump, but they came to a close because of his victory in the November presidential election.",
      "As is required for special counsels, Smith drafted and submitted a final report to the attorney general last week. Garland has vowed to make public all special counsel reports completed while he is attorney general, and has so far followed through on that pledge, including after the investigation into Mr. Biden's handling of classified documents. He released the special counsel's final report on the investigation into Hunter Biden's tax evasion and gun possession cases Monday night.",
      "Last week, Garland informed Congress that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. It's unclear whether the second volume, related to the classified documents case, will ever be disclosed to the American people.",
      "Smith's tenure as special counsel began in November 2022, when Garland tapped him to take over the ongoing investigations involving Trump. The president-elect repeatedly vowed to fire the special counsel when he returned to the White House.",
      "Federal grand juries returned two indictments against the president-elect, marking the first time a former president was accused of federal crimes. In the 2020 election case, brought in Washington, D.C., Trump faced four charges, including conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. In the documents case, the president-elect was charged with 40 counts, including willfully retaining national defense information and conspiracy to obstruct justice.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and accused Smith of mounting a politically charged investigation against him because he was Mr. Biden's political rival.",
      "The 2020 election case landed before the Supreme Court with Trump's claim he was entitled to presidential immunity that shielded him from prosecution, since the conduct that gave rise to the charges occurred during his first term in office.",
      "In July, the high court issued a landmark ruling finding that former presidents cannot face charges for official acts, but were not immune from prosecution for unofficial actions. The decision led to further proceedings before the federal district court overseeing the case.",
      "But the charges were dismissed in November following Trump's election to a second term, as longstanding Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",

      "The Catholic Church facilitated the agreement that would allow for the humanitarian release of dozens of political prisoners before President Biden leaves office at noon on Jan. 20, a senior administration official said. The prisoners were arrested after a government crackdown on protests in 2021 that were triggered by an economic crisis. Almost 1 million Cubans left the country amid the unrest, with a majority coming to the U.S.",
      "\"Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, United States' policy towards Cuba has focused on empowering the Cuban people to freely determine their own future, and advancing respect for human rights,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.",

      "GOP lawmakers also quickly expressed outrage over the move. In a statement, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said the removal of the designation is \"unacceptable\" and will do damage to American national security.",
      "Senior Biden administration officials said there is no evidence to support an ongoing state sponsor of terrorism designation based on a recent government assessment, and they emphasized that the Trump administration will be working off the same information if they decide to redesignate Cuba as a sponsor of terrorism. The Biden team has been in touch with their counterparts on the Trump team on the issue, the officials said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Tuesday passed a Republican measure banning transgender girls and women from competing on school sports teams that match their gender identity after the party leaned into the issue during the 2024 campaign.",
      "The bill, known as the \"Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act,\" would amend Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, to recognize a person's \"sex\" as \"based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\" Schools who allow \"a person whose sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls\" risk losing federal funding.",
      "It passed in the House with 218 voting in favor, 206 voting against and one voting present. Two Democrats from Texas \u2014 Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez \u2014 joined all Republicans in support of the bill. Democratic Rep. Don Davis of North Carolina voted present.",
      "\"An overwhelming majority of Americans believe that men don't belong in women's sports and that we must allow common sense to prevail,\" Republican Rep. Greg Steube of Florida, who introduced the bill, said during floor debate ahead of the vote.",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 3% of high school students identify as transgender. Polling in recent years has found a lack of support for transgender athletes participating on sports teams that match their gender identity and about half of states limit transgender athlete participation.",
      "House Republicans passed the bill in 2023 with no Democratic support. The Senate, which was then controlled by Democrats, did not take it up. House Republicans vowed to prioritize the issue again this year after GOP campaigns spent tens of millions of dollars on ads last year that characterized the issue as a threat to girls and women in sports. A similar measure has been reintroduced in the Republican-controlled Senate.",
      "During floor debate, Republicans argued that these athletes have biological advantages that are unfair and unsafe for other girls and women. Democrats opposed to the measure said it opens the door to intrusive genital examinations of girls.",
      "\"We're already seeing examples of harassment and questioning of girls who may not conform to stereotypical feminine roles,\" said Democratic Rep. Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon.",
      "But there are a number of moderate Democrats who have expressed some concern on the issue, especially after the Democrats' 2024 election losses. One of those Democrats is Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who voted against the ban when it came up for a vote in 2023 but since has\u00a0questioned his party's messaging on transgender rights.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 13:19:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Texas and 18 other states have recently enacted laws requiring pornography websites to verify the ages of their visitors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday is set to weigh states' efforts to require pornography websites to verify their visitors' ages amid a surge of laws that proponents say are aimed at protecting children from accessing sexual content on the internet.",
      "The requirement at the center of the case was enacted by Texas in 2023 as part of a wave of similar measures that have been passed in 18 other states. Under Texas' law, a website must use \"reasonable age verification methods\" to confirm visitors are at least 18 years old.",
      "Entities must comply with the law if more than one-third of its web content is \"sexual material harmful to minors,\" which is considered to be content that is prurient, offensive and without value to minors. Covered companies have to verify users' ages through digital identification or a government-issued ID.",
      "Violators of the age-verification requirement face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day, or fines of up to $250,000 if a violation leads to a minor accessing sexual material. Internet service providers, search engines and social media companies are effectively exempt from the law.",
      "Before Texas' age-verification law took effect, a group of companies that operate pornography websites and a trade group that represents the adult entertainment industry challenged it in federal district court, arguing it violates the First Amendment because it burdens adults' access to protected speech.",
      "A federal judge blocked enforcement of the measure, first finding that the age-verification provisions were subject to strict scrutiny, the most demanding tier of judicial review. The court then held that the requirements failed to satisfy that standard because it is under- and overinclusive, and unclear.",
      "A federal appeals court then paused the district court's order, allowing the age-verification law to take effect. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit said the lower court was wrong to apply strict scrutiny, and instead should have evaluated the law under the least-stringent level. Using that standard, the 5th Circuit said the law survives because of evidence showing \"the sort of damage that access to pornography does to children.\"",
      "The trade group, called the Free Speech Coalition, and the pornography websites asked the Supreme Court in April to temporarily block enforcement of the law, which it declined to do. Months later, the high court agreed to take up the legal battle.",
      "The question in the case is a more procedural one: whether the lower court applied the wrong standard of review when it assessed the constitutionality of the Texas law. That court, the 5th Circuit, examined the measure under what's called rational-basis review, the lowest tier of judicial scrutiny that is deferential to the government, and found it satisfied that standard.",
      "But the law's challengers and the Biden administration argue that the appeals court should've applied the most demanding level, strict scrutiny, because it impedes adults' access to constitutionally protected speech.",
      "Rational-basis review requires laws to serve a legitimate governmental purpose and be reasonably related to that purpose. Under scrutiny scrutiny, however, the government bears the burden of showing that a law is narrowly tailored to serve a \"compelling government interest.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could uphold the lower court's decision, which would leave the age-verification law intact, or rule that the 5th Circuit applied the wrong test and order it to take another look at the law under the proper standard of review.",
      "\"This case matters because it's about how the government can treat speech it doesn't like, and pornography is often the canary in the coal mine for free speech. And it also matters because it's about the future of free speech online,\" Vera Eidelman, a lawyer with the ACLU, said in a press call.",
      "Opponents of the Texas law argue that if it is allowed to stand, it could have a chilling effect on adult visitors to regulated websites. Additionally, it could open users' to privacy and security risks like data breaches, which don't arise when having an ID checked in-person, they argued in court filings.",
      "Already, Pornhub, one of the largest adult content websites, blocked access in Texas last year and did the same in Florida at the start of this year after its own age-verification law took effect.",
      "\"When an adult site tries to do age verification, most people coming to that site refuse to do a face scan, biometrics, ID upload, whatever it is. There's a huge chilling effect. People don't want to do it,\" said Mike Stabile, director of public policy for the Free Speech Coalition.",
      "The trade group argued in court papers that Texas could have employed a less-restrictive way of protecting children from sexual material: content-filtering software, which the Supreme Court backed in a 2004 decision blocking the federal Child Online Protection Act. Additionally, they said the law regulates more speech than is necessary, since it applies to an entire website if more than one-third of its content is considered sexual material harmful to minors, and sweeps in material like romance novels and R-rated movies.",
      "For example, they said, \"a website that contains 65% core political speech and 35% sexually suggestive content would be 100% subject to H.B. 1181's restrictions. That is paradigmatic overinclusivity.\"",
      "But the law is also underinclusive since search engines and social media sites do not have to comply with age-verification requirements, even though minors can access the content there that Texas is trying to shield them from, the Free Speech Coalition argued.",
      "In a friend-of-the-court brief, the Biden administration argued the law is subject to the most demanding form of judicial scrutiny. The Supreme Court, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said, should toss out the 5th Circuit's decision and send the case back to the appeals court to apply strict scrutiny.",
      "But Prelogar said in doing so, the Supreme Court \"should make clear that the First Amendment does not prohibit Congress and the States from adopting appropriately tailored measures to prevent children from accessing harmful sexual material on the Internet.\"",
      "The administration did not take a position on whether Texas' law satisfies strict scrutiny and therefore withstands the constitutional challenge. Brian Fletcher, principal deputy solicitor general, is set to participate in arguments Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Texas Attorney General Aaron Nielson said in a filing that state officials were responding to a public health crisis sparked by kids' easy access to \"hardcore pornography\" through smartphones and other devices.",
      "The age-veritification requirements, he said, \"protects children from that which is obscene by [adults'] standards, by requiring the purveyors to check whether their viewers are children \u2014 leaving adults able to access pornography by engaging in a process that they must complete potentially only once and that applies equally to viewing pornography, buying wine, or renting a car.\"",
      "Backing Texas in the dispute is a group of 24 states, officials from which are urging the Supreme Court to uphold the lower court's decision.",
      "The states wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief that age-verification laws are a routine exercise of their authority to protect children from being exposed to sexual violence and explicit images. They noted that most online pornography is not constitutionally protected, as it is considered obscene to minors and adults under a Supreme Court standard set in 1973.",
      "\"Texas's age-verification law effectuates the state's deeply important interest in protecting minors from the psychological, physical, and social harms wrought by the hardcore internet pornography petitioners purvey \u2014 an interest all agree is compelling, and that this court should hesitate to override,\" the states, led by the attorneys general of Ohio and Indiana, wrote.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June 2025.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll establish a new federal agency to collect tariffs, duties and all other foreign revenue, seemingly carving out responsibilities that are currently handled by the Commerce Department, the U.S. Trade Representative and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "The president-elect said he will establish the agency on Inauguration Day, with the goal of making other countries pay \"their fair share.\" Tariffs are taxes levied on imported foreign goods. Experts say higher tariffs are typically passed on to the consumer, and if enacted, Trump's tariff hikes will likely mean higher costs for Americans.",
      "\"Through soft and pathetically weak Trade agreements, the American Economy has delivered growth and prosperity to the World, while taxing ourselves,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"It is time for that to change. I am today announcing that I will create the EXTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE to collect our Tariffs, Duties, and all Revenue that come from Foreign sources. We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share. January 20, 2025, will be the birth date of the External Revenue Service.

      "Who would pay for Trump's promised tariffs? You will!",
      "It's not clear how establishing a new federal agency to oversee tariffs will expedite the president-elect's tariff goals, given that federal agencies are already collecting that revenue. While USTR and the Commerce Department establish tariffs, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the primary collector and enforcer of tariffs. CBP then deposits collections into the General Fund of the United States.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all goods coming from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% across-the-board tariffs on all foreign imports, and tariffs of 60% or higher on Chinese goods. Despite Trump's vows, some Wall Street economists believe it's unlikely that the new administration would enact a broad-based tariff on all imports due to the potential to reignite inflation while spurring retaliatory tariffs from other nations.",
      "Federal law allows presidents to adjust tariffs based on stated threats to national security, or to remove the practice of a foreign government that the U.S. believes is violating an international trade agreement or is unfair or discriminatory. Trump heavily relied on his tariff authority in his first term, and President Biden's team didn't undo all of his tariffs. The Biden administration even imposed additional tariff hikes, including a 100% duty on electric vehicles from China.",
      "The conservative Tax Foundation found that, despite Trump's fondness for tariffs, the Biden administration has collected more revenue through tariffs on foreign goods than did Trump's \u2014 $89.1 billion under Trump compared with $144 billion under Mr. Biden, as of March 2024. The bulk of revenue under both presidents was collected through tariffs on China.",

      "A 3.5% November-to-December increase in energy prices \u2014 led by a 9.7% increase in gasoline prices \u2014 pushed the overall index higher. Food prices dipped 0.1% in December.",
      "Still, the overall increases were slightly less than economists had forecast. U.S. markets leapt higher immediately on the new inflation data.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 0.4% in early trading Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 163 points, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6% higher.",
      "Excluding food and energy prices, so-called core wholesale inflation was unchanged from November but up 3.5% from a year earlier.",
      "The producer price report came out a day before the Labor Department reports on consumer prices. Its consumer price index is expected to rise 0.3% from November and 2.8% from December 2023, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.",
      "Wholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Inflation flared up in early 2021 as the economy rebounded with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns, overwhelming factories, ports and freight yards and leading to shortages, delays and higher prices.",
      "In response, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate \u2014 the fed funds rate \u2014 11 times in 2022 and 2023.",
      "Inflation came down from the four-decade highs it reached in mid-2022, giving the Fed enough confidence to reverse course and cut rates three times in 2024. But the progress on inflation has stalled in recent months, and year-over-year increases in consumer prices remain above the central bank's 2% target.",
      "Fed to exercise caution",
      "Fed officials signaled in December that they planned to be more cautious about cutting rates this year. They now project just two rate reductions in 2025, down from the four they forecast back in September. They are widely expected to leave rates unchanged at their next meeting Jan. 28-29.",
      "Many economists are worried that President-elect Donald Trump's promises to impose tariffs on foreign goods and cut taxes will push inflation higher.",
      "\"The Fed will not see any argument for pushing interest rates lower, sooner, in today's figures,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. \"Better-than-expected is not what necessarily what the Fed wants to see before easing monetary conditions into a fast-growing economy, with tariffs and tax cuts on the agenda of the incoming administration.''",

    "story": [
      "In November, Montana voters safeguarded the right to abortion in the state's constitution. They also elected a new chief justice to the Montana Supreme Court who was endorsed by anti-abortion advocates.",
      "That seeming contradiction is slated to come to a head this year. People on polar sides of the abortion debate are preparing to fight over how far the protection for abortion extends, and the final say will likely come from the seven-person state Supreme Court. With the arrival of new Chief Justice Cory Swanson, who ran as a judicial conservative for the nonpartisan seat and was sworn in Jan. 6, the court now leans more conservative than before the election.",
      "A similar dynamic is at play elsewhere. Abortion rights supporters prevailed on ballot measures in seven of the 10 states where abortion was up for a vote in November. But even with new voter-approved constitutional protections, courts will have to untangle a web of existing state laws on abortion and square them with any new ones legislators approve. The new makeup of supreme courts in several states indicates that the results of the legal fights to come aren't clear-cut.",
      "Activists have been working to reshape high courts, which in recent years have become the final arbiters of a patchwork of laws regulating abortions. That's because the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned federal abortion protections, leaving rulemaking to the states.",
      "How abortion is affecting state supreme court races",
      "Since then, the politics of state supreme court elections have been \"supercharged\" as fights around abortion shifted to states' top courts, according to Douglas Keith, a senior counsel at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "\"Because we're human, you can't scrub these races of any political connotations at all,\" said former Montana Supreme Court Justice Jim Nelson. \"But it's getting worse.\"",
      "The wave of abortion litigation in state courts has spawned some of the most expensive state supreme court races in history, including more than $42 million spent on the nonpartisan 2023 Supreme Court race in Wisconsin, where abortion access was among the issues facing the court. Janet Protasiewicz won the seat, flipping the balance of the court to a liberal majority.",
      "In many states, judicial elections are nonpartisan but political parties and ideological groups still lobby for candidates. In 2024, abortion surfaced as a top issue in these races.",
      "In Michigan, spending by non-candidate groups alone topped $7.6 million for the two open seats on the state Supreme Court. The Michigan races are officially labeled as nonpartisan, although candidates are nominated by political parties.",
      "An ad for the two candidates backed by Democrats cautioned that \"the Michigan state Supreme Court can still take abortion rights away\" even after voters added abortion protections to the state constitution in 2022. The ad continued, \"Kyra Harris Bolden and Kimberly Thomas are the only Supreme Court candidates who will protect access to abortion.\" Both won their races.",
      "Abortion opponent Kelsey Pritchard, director of state public affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, decried the influence of abortion politics on state court elections. \"Pro-abortion activists know they cannot win through the legislatures, so they have turned to state courts to override state laws,\" Pritchard said.",
      "Some abortion opponents now support changes to the way state supreme courts are selected.",
      "In Missouri, where voters passed a constitutional amendment in November to protect abortion access, the new leader of the state Senate, Cindy O'Laughlin, a Republican, has proposed switching to nonpartisan elections from the state's current model, in which the governor appoints a judge from a list of three finalists selected by a nonpartisan commission. Although Republicans have held the governor's mansion since 2017, she pointed to the Missouri Supreme Court's 4-3 ruling in September that allowed the abortion amendment to remain on the ballot and said courts \"have undermined legislative efforts to protect life.\"",
      "In a case widely expected to reach the Missouri Supreme Court, the state's Planned Parenthood clinics are trying to use the passage of the new amendment to strike down Missouri's abortion restrictions, including a near-total ban. O'Laughlin said her proposal, which would need approval from the legislature and voters, was unlikely to influence that current litigation but would affect future cases.",
      "\"A judiciary accountable to the people would provide a fairer venue for addressing legal challenges to pro-life laws,\" she said.",
      "A push for partisan elections for state judges",
      "Nonpartisan judicial elections can buck broader electoral trends. In Michigan, for example, voters elected both Supreme Court candidates nominated by Democrats last year even as Donald Trump won the state and Republicans regained control of the state House.",
      "In Kentucky's nonpartisan race, Judge Pamela Goodwine, who was endorsed by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, outperformed her opponent even in counties that went for Trump, who won the state. She'll be serving on the bench as a woman's challenge to the state's two abortion bans makes its way through state courts.",
      "Partisan judicial elections, however, tend to track with other partisan election results, according to Keith of the Brennan Center. So some state legislatures have sought to turn nonpartisan state supreme court elections into fully partisan affairs.",
      "In Ohio, Republicans have won every state Supreme Court seat since lawmakers passed a bill in 2021 requiring party affiliation to appear on the ballot for those races. That includes three seats up for grabs in November that solidified the Republican majority on the court from 4-3 to 6-1.",
      "\"These justices who got elected in 2024 have been pretty open about being anti-abortion,\" said Jessie Hill, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, who has been litigating a challenge to Ohio's abortion restrictions since voters added protections to the state constitution in 2023.",
      "Until the recent ballot measure vote in Montana, the only obstacle blocking Republican-passed abortion restrictions from taking effect had been a nearly 26-year-old decision that determined Montana's right to privacy extends to abortion.",
      "Nelson, the former justice who was the lead author of the decision, said the court has since gradually leaned more conservative. He noted the state's other incoming justice, Katherine Bidegaray, was backed by abortion rights advocates.",
      "\"The dynamic of the court is going to change,\" Nelson said after the election. \"But the chief justice has one vote, just like everybody else.\"",
      "Swanson, Montana's new chief justice, had said throughout his campaign that he'll make decisions case by case. He also rebuked his opponent, Jerry Lynch, for saying he'd respect the court's ruling that protected abortion. Swanson called such statements a signal to liberal groups.",
      "At least eight cases are pending in Montana courts challenging state laws to restrict abortion access. Martha Fuller, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana, said that the new constitutional language, which takes effect in July, could further strengthen those cases but that the court's election outcome leaves room for uncertainty.",
      "The state's two outgoing justices had past ties to the Democratic Party. Fuller said they also consistently supported abortion as a right to privacy. \"One of those folks is replaced by somebody who we don't know will uphold that,\" she said. \"There will be this period where we're trying to see where the different justices fall on these issues.\"",
      "Those cases likely won't end the abortion debate in Montana.",
      "As of the legislative session's start in early January, Republican lawmakers, who have for years called the state Supreme Court liberal, had already proposed eight bills regarding abortion and dozens of others aimed at reshaping judicial power. Among them is a bill to make judicial elections partisan.",
      "Montana Sen. Daniel Emrich, a Republican who requested a bill titled \"Prohibit dismembering of person and provide definition of human,\" said it's too early to know which restrictions anti-abortion lawmakers will push hardest.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday cleared the way for the Justice Department to release one of the two volumes that make up special counsel Jack Smith's final report detailing his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon declined a request from Walt Nauta, an aide to Trump, and Carlos de Oliveira, former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, to block the release of Smith's final report, writing \"the court sees an insufficient basis to grant emergency injunctive relief as to Volume I.\"",
      "A federal appeals court separately declined to stop the report's release after Cannon last week issued a temporary order precluding the Justice Department from making it public. Her order remains intact until 12 a.m. on Tuesday.",
      "Federal prosecutors have said in court filings that the first volume of Smith's report pertains to the investigation into Trump's alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. The second involves allegations the president-elect held onto classified documents after the end of his first term in 2021.",
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland has said he will not publicly release the second part of the report, on the documents case, because proceedings involving Nauta and de Oliveira are ongoing. John Irving, an attorney for de Oliveira, declined to comment on Cannon's ruling.",
      "In her five-page decision, Cannon wrote that her \"authority to enforce\" rulings is \"confined\" to the classified documents case. The case involving the 2020 election was brought in Washington, D.C., and was overseen by a different judge.",
      "Still, Cannon said there are outstanding legal issues over the Justice Department's proposed plan to give certain members of Congress access to the second volume of the report. The defense teams have argued against that limited release, writing that doing so could risk leaks.",
      "She set a hearing for Friday in her courtroom in Fort Pierce, Florida, to go over that proposal.",
      "Cannon wrote that the release of the report's second volume, even on a limited basis, \"risks irreversibly and substantially impairing the legal rights of defendants in this criminal proceeding. The court is not willing to make that gamble on the basis of generalized interest by members of Congress, at least not without full briefing and a hearing on the subject.\"",
      "She said the government has not \"presented any justification to support the suggestion\" that the second volume must be released to Congress now instead of \"after a reasonable period for an expedited hearing and judicial deliberation on the subject.\"",
      "Jack Smith's report",
      "Cannon's decision is the latest in a fast-moving legal battle over Smith's report that is playing out just days before Trump will be sworn in for a second term. Once the president-elect returns to the White House on Jan. 20, it's highly unlikely the special counsel's report would be publicly released.",
      "Smith resigned his position as special counsel last Friday, and Justice Department prosecutors are now overseeing all ongoing matters arising from his investigations. Smith's two investigations and prosecutions of Trump have since been dropped because of his victory in the November presidential election.",
      "As is required for special counsels, the special counsel drafted and submitted a final report to the attorney general last week. Garland has vowed to make public all special counsel reports completed while he is attorney general, and has so far followed through on that pledge, including after the investigation into President Biden's handling of classified documents.",
      "But Nauta and de Oliveira are fighting to keep the report shielded from the public. The two were charged for allegedly obstructing the investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents. While Cannon dismissed the case against them on the grounds the special counsel was unconstitutionally appointed, federal prosecutors are appealing her decision as it relates to Nauta and de Oliveira.",
      "Defense lawyers argued that disclosing the report to the public would unfairly prejudice potential future criminal proceedings against them. Defense attorneys simultaneously asked the 11th Circuit and Cannon last week to block the Justice Department from releasing the report.",
      "Cannon\u00a0temporarily stopped the report's release until the 11th Circuit resolved the issue. The appeals court then denied Nauta and de Oliveira's request to keep Smith's report under wraps, but Cannon's order remained in place. Just hours before the district court judge's temporary restraining order was set to expire, Trump unsuccessfully asked her to extend it to allow consideration of an earlier request to intervene.",
      "\"This sensible course will ensure full ventilation of these important issues, which are not changed by the government's representations of what is in Volume I,\" Trump's lawyers wrote in their request, which Cannon denied. \"These issues are weighty, serious, and ultimately establish that President Trump is entitled to full relief.\"",
      "The president-elect is no longer a party to the proceedings since he was dropped from the case in late November, and he accused the Justice Department of attempting to \"interfere with an incoming presidential administration in this manner, let alone on the very eve of inauguration.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors told the 11th Circuit that Garland would not release the portion of Smith's report that deals with the documents case while proceedings involving the two co-defendants are ongoing, but did plan to disclose the first volume involving the 2020 election case. They said he would make a redacted version of the second volume available for review only by top lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and only if they agreed not to share information from it.",
      "\"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests,\" prosecutors wrote.",

The attorney general reiterated his intent to make public the first volume \"in furtherance of the public interest in informing a co-equal branch and the public regarding this significant matter,\" but would not release the second volume \"to avoid any risk of prejudice\" to Nauta and de Oliveira.",

    "summary": "Pete Hegseth must be approved by the GOP-led Senate Armed Services Committee before he can go before the full Senate for confirmation.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's surprising pick to lead the Pentagon \u2014 former Fox News personality Pete Hegseth \u2014 will have to publicly address scrutiny by Democrats over allegations from his past, controversial comments and his qualifications to run the largest government employer in the country during his confirmation hearing Tuesday.",
      "When Trump announced in November over social media his intention to nominate Hegseth, it caught nearly everyone off guard. Shortly afterward, reports surfaced of an alleged sexual assault, excessive drinking and financial mismanagement of veterans' organizations Hegseth ran. To control the damage and prove his mettle, Hegseth barnstormed the Capitol for meetings with mostly Republican senators.",
      "According to his lawyer, Hegseth paid a confidential settlement to the woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017, though he denies committing the crime. Hegseth has also denied he mismanaged finances at veterans' organizations.",
      "Some Republicans who initially seemed to be less supportive of Hegseth's nomination after the reports surfaced have since rallied around him, and sources told CBS News last week that Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune has privately told Trump he believes Hegseth will have enough votes to get confirmed.",
      "Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso said when asked whether Hegseth has the votes to be confirmed that he \"certainly has the qualities that we need to lead the Pentagon.\" But Barrasso added that \"every senator gets to speak for themselves.\"",
      "\"The meetings have gone very well. Things are heading in the right direction. The hearings start Tuesday, and they're going to be consequential,\" Barraso said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"People will listen and make their own decision.\"",
      "Hegseth's attorney Tim Parlatore confirmed to CBS News that he met with the FBI for a background check interview \"a few weeks ago\" and the meeting lasted about two hours. Parlatore said in the interview with Hegseth, they \"went through everything,\" and Parlatore called it a \"very thorough investigation.\"",
      "Parlatore said the FBI \"interviewed a whole bunch of other people to follow up and corroborate. They pulled a bunch of records and just like we predicted in the beginning, the FBI background check would clear him, and you know, they found nothing remarkable.\"",
      "The FBI did not brief senators on its background check findings, according to a source familiar with the matter. In keeping with its customary practice, the FBI performed the check, and then passed the information along to the leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee.",
      "Because Republicans control the Senate, Hegseth can afford to lose three Republican votes, with Vice President-elect JD Vance breaking any tie in his capacity as president of the Senate. But first, the clearest path to advancing to the Senate floor is via a majority on the comittee. The committee has a one-seat Republican majority, so if all Democrats oppose him, it would only take one Republican to defect to complicate his nomination to the floor.",
      "Democrats on the committee have signaled they'll use their time during Tuesday's hearing to ask Hegseth about not only the allegations but also about his lack of senior leader experience.",
      "Hegseth served in the Army National Guard and deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. He retired in 2021 at the rank of major.",
      "\"I want to ask him, what's the largest organization that you've ever run? How big a budget have you ever planned and executed?\" Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois told CBS News in an interview last week.",
      "\"I mean, the secretary of defense is going to be going to NATO and negotiating with allies and going to be managing 3 million personnel, going to be managing a budget of over $800 billion dollars,\" Duckworth said. \"Is he capable of doing that?\"",
      "If Hegseth is confirmed, he will replace Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who was a four-star general and commanded U.S. Forces in the Middle East before retiring from the Army in 2016. Other recent Secretaries of Defense were James Mattis, who was a retired four-star general in the Marines, and Mark Esper, who right before becoming Secretary of Defense was the Secretary of the Army \u2014 and both of whom served under Trump in his first term.",
      "Duckworth, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee and is an Iraq War combat veteran, said Hegseth has refused to meet with her and that the dates his team proposed would be after his confirmation hearing, instead of before.",
      "A transition official told CBS News that Hegseth's team intended to meet with the Democratic leadership of the Armed Services Committee before the committee's other Democrats. In this case, that meant meeting with Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member, which occurred on Jan. 8. Hegseth's team is working to schedule meetings with more senators before and after the confirmation hearing.",
      "Reed said in a statement after the meeting, \"Today's meeting did not relieve my concerns about Mr. Hegseth's lack of qualifications and raised more questions than answers.\"",
      "One Republican senator on the Armed Services Committee who has not yet voiced her support for Hegseth is Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa. Ernst, who served in the Army National Guard, has moved closer to supporting Hegseth after meeting with him. After her first meeting, she declined in a Fox News interview to say whether she would support him, though she did say she supported the vetting process.",
      "But after another meeting, she said in a statement that she had \"encouraging conversations\" with Hegseth. She added that as she supports \"Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources.\"",
      "On \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, Barrasso called Ernst a \"warrior\" and a \"patriot\" and said she had met with Hegseth at least twice.",
      "\"She's going to ask additional questions at the hearing on Tuesday and ultimately make her decision,\" Barrasso said. \"With regard to the FBI report, reported today that the chairman and the ranking member of the committee have seen the report already.\"",
      "Democratic Sen.

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 19:10:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed David Weiss to be special counsel, giving him expanded powers to continue his investigation of Hunter Biden.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department on Monday released the final report of special counsel David Weiss, the Trump-appointed federal prosecutor elevated to special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of President Biden.",
      "In the report, which Garland submitted to Congress on Monday, Weiss wrote that he stood by his decisions to prosecute the president's son on tax and gun charges after agreements with Hunter's legal team collapsed. And Weiss pushed back on Mr. Biden's criticism of the probe.",
      "Weiss led a yearslong investigation into Hunter Biden that ultimately led to a jury conviction on felony gun charges in Delaware federal court and a guilty plea to tax evasion charges in California. In December, the president pardoned his son and claimed the charges against Hunter Biden were \"raw politics,\" a comment that was met with bipartisan criticism.",
      "\"The President's statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith,\" Weiss wrote in his report. \"The President's characterizations are incorrect based on the facts in this case, and, on a more fundamental level, they are wrong.\"",
      "\"Calling those rulings into question and injecting partisanship into the independent administration of the law undermines the very foundation of what makes America's justice system fair and equitable,\" Weiss wrote. \"It erodes public confidence in an institution that is essential to preserving the rule of law.\"",
      "In the report, Weiss defended his charging decisions, which many Republicans in Congress alleged favored the president's son.",
      "\"I concluded that the Principles of Federal Prosecution were satisfied as to both the tax offenses and the gun offenses,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "In 2023, Hunter Biden was charged with lying on a gun application about his drug use and in a separate case, he faced three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanor offenses, including failure to file and pay his taxes, tax evasion and filing a false return.",
      "Prosecutors alleged he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes while living an \"extravagant lifestyle.\"",
      "\"Not only were both cases proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but they resulted in a verdict lawfully rendered by a jury and an admission of guilt. In making my decisions, I remained impervious to political influence at all times,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "During the special counsel's probe, IRS agents who worked on the Hunter Biden tax case with Weiss' team came forward in an interview with CBS News to raise questions about what they alleged was special treatment in the probe of the president's son. The said that dating back to the Trump administration, they had repeatedly been prevented from taking steps in the IRS investigation that would have been considered routine in other cases.",
      "\"We have to make sure as a special agent for IRS Criminal Investigation that we treat every single person exactly the same,\" Gary Shapley, a 14-year veteran of the agency, told CBS News at the time. \"And that just simply didn't happen here.\"",
      "The Justice Department and Weiss denied that Hunter Biden received favorable treatment.",
      "In a letter to Garland included in the report, Hunter Biden's legal team pointed out its criticism of the probe and told the attorney general, \"you likely are aware of the arguments we have made about the initiation and conduct of the prosecutions against our client.\"",
      "\"These are not 'inconsequential' or 'technical' tax code violations,\" Weiss wrote. \"The prosecution of Mr. Biden was warranted given the nature and seriousness of his tax crimes.\"",
      "Answering criticism of the gun charges, Weiss argued, \"An analysis of Justice Department data from 2008 to 2017 shows that these charges are brought more frequently than over 90 percent of the other available firearm offenses.\"",
      "According to Garland's letter to Congress, Weiss submitted the report a few days ago, on Friday. The attorney general noted there had been no instances during the probe when Garland had to intervene because of policy violations.",
      "The report also detailed Weiss' investigation into a former FBI informant, Alexander Smirnov, who pleaded guilty earlier this year to lying to FBI agents and providing them a fake story about the Bidens. Smirnov was sentenced to six years in prison earlier this month.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:34:33 -0500",
    "summary": "President Biden spoke by phone Sunday with the families of three Americans held by the Taliban, Ryan Corbett, George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi.",
    "story": [
      "In a roughly 30-minute phone call Sunday afternoon, President Biden delivered difficult news to the families of three Americans held by the Taliban. He did not have a deal with the Taliban to free their loved ones from captivity, despite what U.S. officials described to CBS News as a significant offer the U.S. had extended in Doha days earlier. The U.S. considers Ryan Corbett and George Glezmann to be wrongfully detained by the Taliban, and describes Mahmood Habibi, who holds dual American and Afghan citizenship, as \"unjustly held\" since 2022.",
      "Ahmad Shah Habibi, the brother of Mahmood Habibi, told CBS News that during the conversation, Mr. Biden clarified that he would not agree to the Taliban's demand that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al Afghani, a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, unless the Taliban, now the government of Afghanistan, also releases Mahmood. An NSC spokesman declined to respond to a CBS inquiry about that specific claim.",
      "Mahmood Habibi disappeared in Afghanistan in 2022, and the Taliban denied abducting him. In a public notice posted by the FBI in August 2024, the agency said it \"believed\" that Habibi was taken by Taliban military or security forces and \"has not been heard from since his disappearance.\" The FBI said in its notice that Habibi was working as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecom company when he disappeared.",
      "The Taliban still say they do not have Habibi in custody.",
      "\"No, we don't have him,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News Monday.",
      "Asked whether Mahmoud had disappeared in Afghanistan, Mujahid said, \"It's not clear either, because we didn't know him before.\"",
      "Ahmad Habibi told CBS News, \"My family has every confidence that my brother is alive. There are things that neither we nor the U.S. government can say publicly, but Mahmood's case is different from the other two Americans.\"",
      "\"We know the other families are desperate to get their loved ones home and I told the president we want them home, too,\" Ahmad Habibi added. \"But anyone speculating that my brother is dead is just feeding into Taliban claims. We are grateful that President Biden committed to not leave Mahmood behind,\" and he said that national security adviser Jake Sullivan had also made similar assurances.",
      "The FBI declined to comment.",
      "Corbett, who is fluent in Pashto, was working for local nongovernmental organizations before starting a microloan and consulting business in Kabul when he was arrested with three associates \u2014 one German and two Afghans \u2014 during a business trip to northern Afghanistan in 2022.",
      "Glezmann is an Atlanta native who was detained while on a tourist visit in December 2022.",
      "The family of Ryan Corbett is publicly calling on Mr. Biden to consider a deal to bring him and Glezmann home.",
      "\"We hope that President Biden will have the courage to take the deal in front of him, given that the lives of several Americans rest on his shoulders,\" Erin Pelton, a spokesperson for the Corbett family, told CBS News.",
      "Corbett's wife, Anna Corbett, described the call with the president during an appearance on Fox News on Monday.",
      "\"He was very kind and empathetic, but what I heard him say is he's not bringing Ryan home, and that was just devastating,\" Anna Corbett said. She blasted Mr. Biden for refusing to agree to the Taliban's terms for a deal. \"It is not being taken and it is incredibly crushing to our family.\"",
      "She has launched a public campaign in recent days to urge the incoming administration to press for her husband's release, and she traveled to President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago residence in hopes of making an in-person plea to Trump. Neither Mr. Biden nor Trump have met with her yet.",
      "Anna Corbett did tell Fox News that Trump sent incoming national security adviser and current Florida Rep. Mike Waltz to meet with her. She said he spent more than an hour listening to her family's story. She expressed frustration that it took more than a year to get a similar meeting with the current national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.",
      "The Taliban have been demanding that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani, who is being held in indefinite law-of-war detention at Guantanamo Bay. A source familiar with his case said the U.S. intelligence community and Pentagon oppose Rahim's release and could not guarantee that he no longer represented a threat to the U.S. However, the president could waive that if he determined it were in the U.S. interest to finalize a prisoner swap.",
      "Rahim was captured in Pakistan in 2007 by the CIA and was the last detainee sent to the Guantanamo prison facility by the Bush administration in 2008. He has never been charged with war crimes, but the periodic review board has deemed his continued detention a national security necessity. His 2016 intelligence profile describes him as a courier for al Qaeda.",
      "In its statement acknowledging the phone call, the White House also noted that Mr. Biden had been able to bring home U.S. citizens who had been detained before the U.S. exit from Afghanistan in 2021. Corbett, Glezmann and Habibi were detained after traveling to Afghanistan following the Taliban's return to power. That ascendance of the Taliban followed a diplomatic deal negotiated by the Trump administration for U.S. troops to withdraw and a surprisingly strong Taliban military offensive that caught the Biden administration off guard, leading to a hasty and chaotic U.S. evacuation. Unwilling to remain without U.S. troops, NATO forces also pulled out.",
      "The U.S. does not officially recognize the Taliban, with its horrific human rights record, as the legitimate government of Afghanistan but has been in contact with its leaders through U.S. agencies as well as via the Qatari government. Last weekend in Doha, Special Presidential Envoy Roger Carstens and NSC official Jen Daskal pressed for a deal with the Taliban to free the Americans.",
      "A U.S. official described the Doha meetings as unsuccessful but declined to detail which other individuals the Biden administration was willing to offer to the Taliban as part of a potential trade. The White House described the Biden efforts as continuing through the end of his term.",
      "Mr. Biden has dedicated much of his career to foreign policy, and that portion of his legacy is extremely important to him. In a speech Monday at the State Department, the president will describe the chaotic U.S. exit from Afghanistan, arguably his biggest foreign policy failure, as having successfully ended America's longest war.",

    "summary": "The court fight brought in Hawaii state court is similar to others filed against the nation's largest energy companies by state and local governments in their courts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not consider whether to quash lawsuits brought by Honolulu seeking billions of dollars from oil and gas companies for the damage caused by the effects of climate change, clearing the way for the cases to move forward.",
      "The legal battle pursued in Hawaii state court is similar to others filed against the nation's largest energy companies by state and local governments in their courts. The suits claim that the oil and gas industry engaged in a deceptive campaign and misled the public about the dangers of their fossil fuel products and the environmental impacts.",
      "A group of 15 energy companies asked the Supreme Court to review a decision from the Hawaii Supreme Court that allowed a lawsuit brought by the city and county of Honolulu, as well as its Board of Water Supply, to proceed. The suit was brought in Hawaii state court in March 2020, and Honolulu raised several claims under state law, including creating a public nuisance and failure to warn the public of the risks posed by their fossil fuel products.",
      "The city accused the oil and gas industry of contributing to global climate change, leading to flooding, erosion and more frequent and intense extreme weather events. These changes, they said, have led to property damage and a drop in tax revenue as a result of less tourism.",
      "The energy companies unsuccessfully sought to have the case moved to federal court, arguing that the claims raised by Honolulu under state law were overridden by federal law and the Clean Air Act. A state trial court denied their efforts to dismiss the case.",
      "The oil and gas industry has argued that greenhouse-gas emissions \"flow from billions of daily choices, over more than a century, by governments, companies and individuals about what types of fuels to use, and how to use them.\" Honolulu, the companies said, was seeking damages for the \"cumulative effect of worldwide emissions leading to global climate change.\"",
      "The Hawaii Supreme Court ultimately allowed the lawsuit to proceed. The state's highest court determined that the Clean Air Act displaced federal common law governing suits seeking damages for interstate pollution. It also rejected the oil companies' argument that Honolulu was seeking to regulate emissions through its lawsuit, finding that the city instead wanted to challenge the promotion and sale of fossil fuel products \"without warning and abetted by a sophisticated disinformation campaign.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs' state tort law claims do not seek to regulate emissions, and there is thus no 'actual conflict' between Hawaii tort law and the [Clean Air Act],\" the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled. \"These claims potentially regulate marketing conduct while the CAA regulates pollution.\"",
      "The oil companies asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the ruling from the Hawaii high court and urged it to stop Honolulu's lawsuit from going forward. Regulation of interstate pollution is a federal area governed by federal law, lawyers for the energy industry argued.",
      "\"Rarely does a case of such extraordinary importance to one of the nation's most vital industries come before this court,\" lawyers for the companies said in a filing. \"Energy companies that produce, sell, and market fossil fuels are facing numerous lawsuits in state courts across the nation seeking billions of dollars in damages for injuries allegedly caused by global climate change.\"",
      "The oil and gas companies argued the case raises a \"recurring question of extraordinary importance to the energy industry,\" and one they urged the Supreme Court to address.",
      "\"In these cases, state and local governments are attempting to assert control over the nation's energy policies by holding energy companies liable for worldwide conduct in ways that starkly conflict with the policies and priorities of the federal government,\" they said. \"That flouts this court's precedents and basic principles of federalism, and the court should put a stop to it.\"",
      "Lawyers for Honolulu said in a filing that the case seeks to hold the oil and gas industry accountable under Hawaii law for \"deliberately concealing and misrepresenting the climate-change impacts of their fossil-fuel products.\"",
      "Its lawsuit, the city continued, does not interfere with the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions. Honolulu's legal team accused the oil and gas companies of pushing a theory in the case that \"improperly attempts to cloak the former federal common law of interstate pollution in constitutional garb, with no foundation in the Constitution's text or history.\"",
      "The Supreme Court in June asked the Biden administration to weigh in on the cases and whether it should step into the dispute. In a filing submitted to the Supreme Court before the transfer of presidential power, the Biden administration urged the justices to turn away the appeals, in part because it said it is too soon for them to intervene.",

    "story": [
      "Aircraft battling fires raging through the Los Angeles area are dousing the area with more than water: Hundreds of thousands of gallons of hot-pink fire suppressant have been dropped ahead of the flames in a desperate effort to stop them before they destroy more neighborhoods.",
      "The deadly fires have displaced thousands of residents and destroyed more than 12,000 structures since they began last Tuesday, Jan. 7. Four major fires driven by strong Santa Ana winds have charred about 62 square miles, according to Cal Fire.",
      "Fire agencies say the suppressants \u2014 most often used to fight forest fires \u2014 are an invaluable tool. But what is in them and are they safe?",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "When are fire suppressants used?",
      "The fires are burning quickly through canyons and other rugged areas that are difficult for firefighters on the ground to reach, Cal Fire said.",
      "While fire suppressants can be very effective, they do have limitations, the agency said. Strong winds can make it too dangerous to fly at the low altitudes needed for drops and can dissipate the retardant before it hits the ground.",
      "Besides Cal Fire, multiple agencies have dropped fire retardant and water, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Los Angeles and Ventura county fire departments, the city and the National Guard.",
      "What is in aerial fire suppressants?",
      "Aerial fire suppressants are generally a mixture of water, ammonium phosphate \u2014 essentially fertilizer \u2014 and iron oxide, which is added to make the retardant visible, said Daniel McCurry, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Southern California.",
      "The Forest Service, which has used 13 aircraft to dump suppressants on the Los Angeles fires, says they help starve a fire of oxygen and slow the rate of burn by cooling and coating vegetation and other surfaces.",
      "Perimeter, the company that supplies fire retardant to the Forest Service and other agencies, says the phosphate changes the way cellulose in plants decomposes and makes them non-flammable.",
      "The fire suppressants are generally considered safe for people, but many worry about their potential effects on wildlife.",
      "The Forest Service bans use of aerial suppressants over waterways and endangered species habitats, \"except when human life or public safety are threatened,\" due to potential health effects on fish and other wildlife.",
      "McCurry, from USC, said he and other researchers tested several suppressants and found heavy metals, including chromium and cadmium, in one commonly used by the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "McCurry said the study's findings suggest that it's \"plausible\" that fire suppressants could contribute to spikes of chromium and other heavy metals in waterways downstream of wildfires.",
      "\"We don't quite have a smoking gun yet because it's difficult, although not impossible, to prove where a heavy metal came from,\" McCurry said. \"We're working on that.\"",
      "Perimeter, the manufacturer of the Forest Service's fire retardant, said McCurry's research was on a formulation that wasn't used in California and is no longer used by the Forest Service. The company also says it doesn't add metals, which it says are naturally present in all ammonium phosphate fertilizers, and that its aerial suppressants \"are exhaustively tested by the USDA Forest Service and meet or exceed all health and safety standards.\"",
      "Using flame retardants to protect the power grid",
      "Several Los Angeles area power companies are also using flame retardants to try to help protect power poles and lines, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "Crews have been working for days, stopping at as many power poles as possible along the edges of the wildfires \u2014the Palisades Fire along the Los Angeles coast and the Eaton Fire in the mountains above Pasadena and Altadena.",
      "First, they clear dry shrubbery from the area surrounding the poles, then they use their trucks to douse each power pole with fire retardant \u2014 the same substance that's dropped by firefighting aircraft from above. They try to spray it as far up the pole as possible and into all the cracks, so embers can't get a foothold.",
      "\"That way, if or when the fire does make it this way, we don't have to worry about embers catching it,\" said Connor Norton, one of the PG&E employees working in North Hollywood on Sunday.",
      "\"The best way to save lives\"",
      "The use of fire retardants is imperative to putting out wildfires that expose millions of people to health risks, including from a toxic mix of microscopic particles that can cause breathing and heart problems by penetrating deep into the lungs and bloodstream.",
      "Studies have shown that wildfire smoke accounted for up to half of all health-damaging particle air pollution in the western U.S. in recent years as warming temperatures fueled more destructive blazes.",
      "And research released last year by the Alzheimer's Association found that wildfire smoke may be worse for brain health than other types of air pollution, raising the risk of dementia.",
      "\"The use of wildland fire retardant is the best way to save lives, protect communities and keep fires small,\" said Edward Goldberg, vice chairman of solutions at Perimeter.",
      "McCurry, the USC researcher, said more study is needed on fire suppressants \u2014 including in Los Angeles once the fires are out \u2014 but he understands their value: \"If there was a brush fire coming for my house, I'd still rather than paint a lot of (fire retardant) in front of it.\"",

      "When will cicadas come back?",
      "For most of their lives, cicadas live underground, and then they emerge after a specific number of years once the soil reaches 64 degrees. Brood XIV emerges every 17 years.",
      "Though it's not known exactly when they will show up in 2025, they typically appear in May and last through June. During those weeks, the cicadas mature, mate and lay eggs before dying off, and then their offspring begin the cycle anew.",
      "Climate change is also affecting the timing of the insects' arrival. Last year, the cicadas' return started in Georgia nearly two weeks ahead of schedule.",
      "Where will Brood XIV cicadas emerge?",
      "Known as the \"Great(er) Eastern Brood,\" this group is historically found in areas of north Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, southern Indiana and Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts.",
      "However, UConn researchers note that Brood XIV cicadas population are declining on Long Island and their distributions are shifting in southwestern Ohio and southeastern Indiana. The researchers said they will map and study the cicadas' 2025 emergence to address gaps in knowledge about the patterns.",
      "How many cicadas will there be in 2025?",
      "It's difficult to estimate the population of any insects, and cicadas are no exception.",
      "Hundreds of trillions, or even quadrillions, of cicadas were expected in 2024 when two massive broods emerged at the same time, UConn cicada expert John Cooley said.",
      "There will be fewer cicadas this spring, but more than a trillion of the insects could emerge. The number may sound extreme, but the cicadas won't all be at the same place at the same time.",

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0later this month if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "Specifically, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok. If ByteDance had started the process to sell TikTok, the president also could push pause on adoption of the law for 90 days.",
      "On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Elon Musk could buy TikTok's U.S. operations, effectively allowing the app to evade a ban. Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to ever sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "The Supreme Court on Jan. 11 heard arguments from government attorneys, who say TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security, and from lawyers for the social media platform. Experts said the justices seemed receptive to the government's case, increasing the likelihood of a ban. Here's what that would mean for TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",

      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",

Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

Axios was the first to report that Meta is terminating DEI programs geared to hiring, training and choosing suppliers, citing an internal employee memo.",
      "A Meta spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that it was eliminating its DEI efforts.",
      "In explaining the policy shift, Janelle Gale, vice president of human resources at Meta, said the \"legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing,\"",
      "The retreat from DEI policies by Meta and others follows a 2023 Supreme Court decision banning affirmative action in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservatives political activists. Other large companies to unwind their DEI programs include motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, hardware chain Lowe's, and farm equipment manufacturers John Deere and actor Supply.",
      "More recently, the shift away from DEI has coincided with President-elect Donald Trump's startling political comeback.",
      "\"Many global businesses will be using the second Trump presidency to finally kill off the DEI agenda, if they haven't done so already,\" Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Those attempting to curry favor with Trump are doing it publicly, while other organizations, not wishing to suffer any potential public backlash or fallout, will do so quietly and over time.\"",
      "Under fire by \"anti-woke\" factions that have targeted companies, universities and other organizations in court and on social media, a number of corporations have backtracked on diversity efforts that intensified after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd sparked the largest racial justice protests in the U.S. since the civil rights movement.",
      "Some corporate leaders have also questioned the value of diversity and its contribution to a company's bottom line, with DEI \"seen by many leaders as distracting to business performance and growth,\" Snell said.",

      "Other companies, including Apple, Costco and Target, continue to maintain and defend their DEI policies.",
      "Costco's board is recommending that shareholders vote against\u00a0proposal to dismantle its DEI program ahead of January 23 investor meeting amid calls by activists such as Robby Starbuck urging boycotts and membership cancellations of the warehouse club.",
      "\"Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring orginality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the 'treasure hunt' that our customers value,\" the retailer stated.",
      "The proposal, submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, argues that DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore to shareholders.",

    "summary": "Meta shocked the tech world this week by moving to overhaul its approach to fact checking. Here's what the changes mean for social media users.",
    "story": [
      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",
      "More information on how X's Community Notes works can be found on X's Community Notes page.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",

    "story": [
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk, alleging the X owner misled shareholders about his Twitter stock purchases in 2022.",
      "The suit alleges Musk violated federal securities laws, enabling him to purchase shares of Twitter at artificially low prices before his $44 billion takeover of the social media site. Musk has called the SEC \"just another weaponized institution doing political dirty work.\"",
      "Musk started buying shares of Twitter, which he later renamed X, in early 2022. By mid-March, he'd acquired ownership of more than 5% of the company's outstanding stock, according to the SEC filing. He was required to file a report with the SEC disclosing his purchases, but the lawsuit alleges he failed to do so in a \"timely\" manner, allowing him to underpay other investors by at least $150 million for shares they bought during that period.",
      "Musk waited until April 4, 2022, 11 days after the report was due, to publicly disclose his beneficial ownership in an SEC report, the commission says.",
      "\"Investors who sold Twitter common stock during this period did so at artificially low prices and thus suffered substantial economic harm,\" the SEC alleges in its suit.",
      "The SEC says it wants the court to order Musk to pay \"disgorgement of unjust enrichment as a result of his violation.\" The SEC is also seeking civil penalties.",
      "Musk responded to news of the suit on X on Tuesday night, calling the SEC a \"totally broken organization.\"",
      "\"They spend their time on s--- like this when there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished,\" Musk wrote.",
      "In July 2022, Musk\u00a0tried to pull out of the deal to buy Twitter, but the company sued to hold him to their agreement, and\u00a0he completed the takeover in October of that year.",
      "Musk has tangled with the SEC before. The SEC in 2018 filed a complaint alleging that Musk had misled Tesla investors. In 2023, the SEC said it was seeking a court order to compel Musk to testify as part of its investigation into his purchase of X. He later testified for the investigation.",

    "summary": "The CFPB is suing Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts.",
    "story": [
      "Capital One was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts. As a result, customers lost more than $2 billion in potential interest payments, the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a complaint filed Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took aim at Capital One's promises and handling of its \"360 Savings\" accounts, which were promoted as accounts providing one of the highest interest rates in the nation. But instead, the CFPB alleges, Capital One froze its rate at a low level for at least several years, even as rates rose nationally.",
      "At the same time, the CFPB adds, the bank created \"360 Performance Savings,\" which had a much higher rate \u2014 at one point, more than 14 times higher than the original \"360 Savings\" accounts. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates, part of its effort to fight soaring inflation. As a result, some banks have rolled out high-interest savings accounts to attract savers.",
      "But at the same time, some banks haven't boosted rates on their savings accounts, creating a gap between low-and top-paying accounts, similar to that of Capital One's two offerings. According to the CFPB, Capital One marketed the products similarly to obscure their distinction and forbade employees \"from proactively telling\" those with 360 Savings accounts about the higher-paying 360 Performance Savings, the agency said.",
      "\"Capital One did not specifically notify 360 Savings account holders about the new product, and instead worked to keep them in the dark about these better-paying accounts,\" the CFPB said in a statement. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates to fight soaring inflation, which allowed banks to roll out high-interest savings accounts after years of meager rates.",
      "In response, Capital One said that it strongly disagreed with the CFPB's allegations and plans to \"vigorously defend\" itself in court. The banking giant added that it was \"deeply disappointed to see the CFPB continue its recent pattern of filing eleventh-hour lawsuits ahead of a change in administration.\"",
      "Capital One also maintained that all of its 360 banking products \"offer great rates\" \u2014 and have \"always been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions.\"",
      "Billions in lost interest",
      "These actions mean Capital One \"illegally avoided paying billions in interest to millions of consumers,\" the CFPB wrote in its Tuesday complaint. The agency says it's seeking to impose civil penalties and provide financial relief to those impacted.",
      "\"Banks should not be baiting people with promises they can't live up to,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a prepared statement.",
      "According to disclosures on the Capital One's website, 360 Savings accounts currently carry an interest rate of just under 0.50%. 360 Performance Savings accounts have an interest rate of about 3.74%.",
      "That means the rate for 360 Performance Savings is nearly 7.5 times higher than that of 360 Savings today. But the CFPB says they've been farther apart in the past. In July 2024, the agency notes in Tuesday's complaint, the 360 Performance Savings rate was more than 14 times that of 360 Savings.",
      "The CFPB alleges that Capital One kept the rate for its 360 Savings accounts at 0.30% between December 2020 through at least August 2024. The rate for 360 Performance Savings, by contrast, climbed from 0.40% in April 2022 to as high as 4.35% at the start of 2024 \u2014 falling slightly to 4.25% by August, the agency noted Tuesday.",
      "The CFPB's complaint against Capital One comes less than one week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Despite the change in administration, some say this litigation could still survive.",
      "Analyst commentary from TD Cowen on Tuesday noted that the CFPB still brought enforcement actions under Trump's first term, for example, although such litigation may also be easier to settle under the incoming administration.",

    "story": [
      "Consuming more than one drink a day results in a steep increase of the risk of premature death, a new federal review has concluded. The draft report was published Tuesday ahead of a major update to influential federal guidelines on how much alcohol Americans should drink.",
      "\"In the United States, males and females have a 1 in 1000 risk of dying from alcohol use if they consume more than 7 drinks per week. This risk increases to 1 in 100 if they consume more than 9 drinks per week,\" the report's authors concluded, in a final draft published by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The review is one of two written by committees of outside experts to inform this year's update to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The other was published last month by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.",
      "The upcoming guidelines are important because the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies often rely on the recommendations to justify new rules, like on how to label food and drinks. Men are currently recommended to limit intake to no more than two drinks per day and women are recommended to limit to one drink per day.",
      "\"Once you're over a drink a day, your risk of dying from alcohol is already above one percent. Some people may think that doesn't sound like a lot, but in terms of a public health guideline, that would be really, really high,\" said Dr. Timothy Naimi, director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research and one of the authors of the report.",
      "Naimi was careful to say that the report was \"not endorsing any level of risk\" caused by drinking, but pointed to other countries and health regulations that have used 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 death risks as thresholds to set rules.",
      "It is unclear whether the incoming Trump administration will incorporate the findings of the latest report into any updated guidelines. In 2020, the Trump administration rejected a call by its outside expert panel to recommend limiting drinking for all Americans to no more than once per day, saying the \"emerging evidence\" did not support the move.",

      "Alcohol linked to deaths from cancer, injuries, other causes",
      "The report was designed to weigh all of the data on a range of diseases and injuries, and boiled down a complex web of studies that have looked at alcohol's health risks and benefits into \"alcohol-attributable death\" estimates.",
      "This modeling is likely underestimating the true health risks of alcohol, Naimi said, given limits in how researchers can study its health impacts.",
      "Risks can also vary widely from person to person, the report cautions, meaning some harms can be very small for some even if they add up to substantial risks at the public health level.",
      "\"The overall effect of alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality is dependent upon the risk of diseases and injuries that are causally related to alcohol. These risks are affected by numerous factors, including smoking, diet, physical activity, obesity, hepatitis infection, and genetics,\" the report states.",
      "At one drink a day, the report estimated that injuries and cancer added up to the biggest contributors of the risk for a premature death.",
      "For men, injuries made up a substantial portion of the risk of dying. This includes a variety of accidents, road injuries and intentional harm, like suicide and violence linked to drinking.",
      "Cancer, which was next largest factor, made up a third of the additional risk of death for men.",
      "For women consuming one drink a day, the risk of death from cancer was statistically similar or larger compared to the increased risk of fatal injuries.",
      "Increased risk of a number of cancers \u2014 colorectal, female breast cancer, and cancers of the liver, mouth, throat and esophagus \u2014 \"begins with any alcohol use and increases with higher levels of use,\" the report states.",

    "summary": "It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to finalize the rule on food labels.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration released on Tuesday its long-awaited proposal to require food manufacturers to put some nutrition facts on the front of packages, in a bid to nudge Americans and food companies towards healthier diets in line with similar pushes in other countries.",
      "FDA's new \"nutrition info box\" focuses on telling people whether levels of saturated fat, sodium and added sugar are \"high\" or \"medium\" or \"low\" as well as the percentage for each serving.",
      "The proposal will be open for public comment for 120 days. It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize the rule.",
      "After that, the FDA says that large food companies earning more than $10 million annually will have three years to comply with the rule. Smaller food brands will have an additional year.",
      "Up to $154 million will be spent by the food industry over the next decade to relabel their products with the new box, the FDA estimates.",
      "The agency also estimates many food brands may also spend millions more dollars to try to rework their products, changing their recipes to avoid being called out as having too much of an unhealthy nutrient.",
      "\"We assume there may be manufacturers who would want to reformulate to maybe move from the high category into the medium category, or the medium category into the low category,\" Rebecca Buckner, the associate deputy director for human food policy at the FDA, told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Trump's pick to head the federal department that oversees the FDA, has been sharply critical of federal nutrition officials for not doing enough to help Americans eat healthier diets and crack down on the food industry.",
      "Kennedy has not specifically addressed the proposal. A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Why only saturated fat, sodium and added sugars?",
      "The FDA said it will require the box to only call out saturated fat, sodium and added sugars. Food manufacturers would not be able to put other nutrients inside the FDA's information box.",
      "They cited research showing that \"simpler schemes are easier for consumers to understand\" for narrowing the box down to just these three worrying unhealthy nutrients.",
      "Designs they tested with focus groups that included nutrients Americans need more of, like fiber and calcium, confused participants.",
      "The FDA said it is still weighing whether calories should be incorporated into the label and acknowledged that some food brands are already voluntarily listing the information on the front.",
      "What determines \"high,\" \"medium\" and \"low\" levels?",
      "FDA officials said Tuesday that levels of saturated fat, sodium or added sugars will be deemed as \"high\" if they are above 20% in the daily value, a measurement of how much Americans eat each day in the \"reference\" diet. Medium was set at between 6% and 19% of the daily value. And low is 5% and below.",
      "Agency officials have used these benchmarks for \"high\" and \"low\" for decades, dating back to the formulation of the nutrition facts label back in the 1990s.",
      "At the time, officials decided against including the \"interpretive descriptions\" in the nutrition facts label. But the agency said recent data shows many Americans do not understand the percentages.",
      "\"It's really based on longstanding usage,\" McKinnon said.",
      "What will it look like?",
      "The FDA says food makers will be required to put the labels \"somewhere in the top third\" of the front of the box.",
      "The box also uses the same Helvetica font used in the nutrition facts on the back of the package and must comply with a range of more detailed rules to avoid it from being too small or obscured by other designs on the package.",
      "Some other design decisions were also abandoned during the focus group testing process, the FDA said.",
      "For example, previous mockups using the colors red, yellow and green to call out different levels did not make a statistically significant difference in helping people interpret the box.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 13:19:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Texas and 18 other states have recently enacted laws requiring pornography websites to verify the ages of their visitors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday is set to weigh states' efforts to require pornography websites to verify their visitors' ages amid a surge of laws that proponents say are aimed at protecting children from accessing sexual content on the internet.",
      "The requirement at the center of the case was enacted by Texas in 2023 as part of a wave of similar measures that have been passed in 18 other states. Under Texas' law, a website must use \"reasonable age verification methods\" to confirm visitors are at least 18 years old.",
      "Entities must comply with the law if more than one-third of its web content is \"sexual material harmful to minors,\" which is considered to be content that is prurient, offensive and without value to minors. Covered companies have to verify users' ages through digital identification or a government-issued ID.",
      "Violators of the age-verification requirement face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day, or fines of up to $250,000 if a violation leads to a minor accessing sexual material. Internet service providers, search engines and social media companies are effectively exempt from the law.",
      "Before Texas' age-verification law took effect, a group of companies that operate pornography websites and a trade group that represents the adult entertainment industry challenged it in federal district court, arguing it violates the First Amendment because it burdens adults' access to protected speech.",
      "A federal judge blocked enforcement of the measure, first finding that the age-verification provisions were subject to strict scrutiny, the most demanding tier of judicial review. The court then held that the requirements failed to satisfy that standard because it is under- and overinclusive, and unclear.",
      "A federal appeals court then paused the district court's order, allowing the age-verification law to take effect. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit said the lower court was wrong to apply strict scrutiny, and instead should have evaluated the law under the least-stringent level. Using that standard, the 5th Circuit said the law survives because of evidence showing \"the sort of damage that access to pornography does to children.\"",
      "The trade group, called the Free Speech Coalition, and the pornography websites asked the Supreme Court in April to temporarily block enforcement of the law, which it declined to do. Months later, the high court agreed to take up the legal battle.",
      "The question in the case is a more procedural one: whether the lower court applied the wrong standard of review when it assessed the constitutionality of the Texas law. That court, the 5th Circuit, examined the measure under what's called rational-basis review, the lowest tier of judicial scrutiny that is deferential to the government, and found it satisfied that standard.",
      "But the law's challengers and the Biden administration argue that the appeals court should've applied the most demanding level, strict scrutiny, because it impedes adults' access to constitutionally protected speech.",
      "Rational-basis review requires laws to serve a legitimate governmental purpose and be reasonably related to that purpose. Under scrutiny scrutiny, however, the government bears the burden of showing that a law is narrowly tailored to serve a \"compelling government interest.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could uphold the lower court's decision, which would leave the age-verification law intact, or rule that the 5th Circuit applied the wrong test and order it to take another look at the law under the proper standard of review.",
      "\"This case matters because it's about how the government can treat speech it doesn't like, and pornography is often the canary in the coal mine for free speech. And it also matters because it's about the future of free speech online,\" Vera Eidelman, a lawyer with the ACLU, said in a press call.",
      "Opponents of the Texas law argue that if it is allowed to stand, it could have a chilling effect on adult visitors to regulated websites. Additionally, it could open users' to privacy and security risks like data breaches, which don't arise when having an ID checked in-person, they argued in court filings.",
      "Already, Pornhub, one of the largest adult content websites, blocked access in Texas last year and did the same in Florida at the start of this year after its own age-verification law took effect.",
      "\"When an adult site tries to do age verification, most people coming to that site refuse to do a face scan, biometrics, ID upload, whatever it is. There's a huge chilling effect. People don't want to do it,\" said Mike Stabile, director of public policy for the Free Speech Coalition.",
      "The trade group argued in court papers that Texas could have employed a less-restrictive way of protecting children from sexual material: content-filtering software, which the Supreme Court backed in a 2004 decision blocking the federal Child Online Protection Act. Additionally, they said the law regulates more speech than is necessary, since it applies to an entire website if more than one-third of its content is considered sexual material harmful to minors, and sweeps in material like romance novels and R-rated movies.",
      "For example, they said, \"a website that contains 65% core political speech and 35% sexually suggestive content would be 100% subject to H.B. 1181's restrictions. That is paradigmatic overinclusivity.\"",
      "But the law is also underinclusive since search engines and social media sites do not have to comply with age-verification requirements, even though minors can access the content there that Texas is trying to shield them from, the Free Speech Coalition argued.",
      "In a friend-of-the-court brief, the Biden administration argued the law is subject to the most demanding form of judicial scrutiny. The Supreme Court, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said, should toss out the 5th Circuit's decision and send the case back to the appeals court to apply strict scrutiny.",
      "But Prelogar said in doing so, the Supreme Court \"should make clear that the First Amendment does not prohibit Congress and the States from adopting appropriately tailored measures to prevent children from accessing harmful sexual material on the Internet.\"",
      "The administration did not take a position on whether Texas' law satisfies strict scrutiny and therefore withstands the constitutional challenge. Brian Fletcher, principal deputy solicitor general, is set to participate in arguments Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Texas Attorney General Aaron Nielson said in a filing that state officials were responding to a public health crisis sparked by kids' easy access to \"hardcore pornography\" through smartphones and other devices.",
      "The age-veritification requirements, he said, \"protects children from that which is obscene by [adults'] standards, by requiring the purveyors to check whether their viewers are children \u2014 leaving adults able to access pornography by engaging in a process that they must complete potentially only once and that applies equally to viewing pornography, buying wine, or renting a car.\"",
      "Backing Texas in the dispute is a group of 24 states, officials from which are urging the Supreme Court to uphold the lower court's decision.",
      "The states wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief that age-verification laws are a routine exercise of their authority to protect children from being exposed to sexual violence and explicit images. They noted that most online pornography is not constitutionally protected, as it is considered obscene to minors and adults under a Supreme Court standard set in 1973.",
      "\"Texas's age-verification law effectuates the state's deeply important interest in protecting minors from the psychological, physical, and social harms wrought by the hardcore internet pornography petitioners purvey \u2014 an interest all agree is compelling, and that this court should hesitate to override,\" the states, led by the attorneys general of Ohio and Indiana, wrote.",

    "summary": "The federal government already collects tariffs, and deposits them in the General Fund of the United States.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll establish a new federal agency to collect tariffs, duties and all other foreign revenue, seemingly carving out responsibilities that are currently handled by the Commerce Department, the U.S. Trade Representative and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "The president-elect said he will establish the agency on Inauguration Day, with the goal of making other countries pay \"their fair share.\" Tariffs are taxes levied on imported foreign goods. Experts say higher tariffs are typically passed on to the consumer, and if enacted, Trump's tariff hikes will likely mean higher costs for Americans.",
      "\"Through soft and pathetically weak Trade agreements, the American Economy has delivered growth and prosperity to the World, while taxing ourselves,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"It is time for that to change. I am today announcing that I will create the EXTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE to collect our Tariffs, Duties, and all Revenue that come from Foreign sources. We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share. January 20, 2025, will be the birth date of the External Revenue Service. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "Who would pay for Trump's promised tariffs? You will!",
      "Who would pay for Trump's promised tariffs? You will!",
      "It's not clear how establishing a new federal agency to oversee tariffs will expedite the president-elect's tariff goals, given that federal agencies are already collecting that revenue. While USTR and the Commerce Department establish tariffs, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the primary collector and enforcer of tariffs. CBP then deposits collections into the General Fund of the United States.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all goods coming from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% across-the-board tariffs on all foreign imports, and tariffs of 60% or higher on Chinese goods. Despite Trump's vows, some Wall Street economists believe it's unlikely that the new administration would enact a broad-based tariff on all imports due to the potential to reignite inflation while spurring retaliatory tariffs from other nations.",
      "Federal law allows presidents to adjust tariffs based on stated threats to national security, or to remove the practice of a foreign government that the U.S. believes is violating an international trade agreement or is unfair or discriminatory. Trump heavily relied on his tariff authority in his first term, and President Biden's team didn't undo all of his tariffs. The Biden administration even imposed additional tariff hikes, including a 100% duty on electric vehicles from China.",
      "The conservative Tax Foundation found that, despite Trump's fondness for tariffs, the Biden administration has collected more revenue through tariffs on foreign goods than did Trump's \u2014 $89.1 billion under Trump compared with $144 billion under Mr. Biden, as of March 2024. The bulk of revenue under both presidents was collected through tariffs on China.",

      "\"The first obviously being that Trisha is an incredible author, but we have a ton of connections. The first glaring connection being our Jamaican roots,\" said Curry, who is married to Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry. \"This story is based in Jamaica. The culture is just running all through the pages. And so that really drew us to this story.\"",
      "The infusion of Jamaican culture, including food references like coco bread and Jamaican beef patties, adds authenticity to the narrative, something Tobias credits to her mother, who grew up in Jamaica.",
      "\"I was very inspired by my mother, who was born and raised in Jamaica, and she told me all kinds of Duppy stories growing up,\" Tobias shared.",
      "The novel explores themes of self-discovery, growing up, and navigating complex relationships, all while diving into the supernatural elements that influence Carina's life.",
      "Tobias mentioned the twists and turns in the story, saying, \"When you're writing and revising, that's where a lot of the magic happens. And for me, it kind of became a surprise, even to myself.\"",
      "Curry hopes that \"Honeysuckle and Bone\" would help foster the love of reading in young adults, especially those who are drawn to deep, meaningful stories.",

They have pledged more forceful measures to detain him after the presidential security service blocked their initial efforts on Jan. 3.",

They cited a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge \u2014 which would be Yoon. The court warrant for Yoon's detainment is valid through Jan. 21.",

      "\"Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, United States' policy towards Cuba has focused on empowering the Cuban people to freely determine their own future, and advancing respect for human rights,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.",
      "The decision is likely to be reversed by the incoming Trump administration. Sen. Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state whose family fled Cuba in the 1950s, supports strong sanctions on Havana's Communist regime.",
      "GOP lawmakers also quickly expressed outrage over the move. In a statement, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said the removal of the designation is \"unacceptable\" and will do damage to American national security.",
      "Senior Biden administration officials said there is no evidence to support an ongoing state sponsor of terrorism designation based on a recent government assessment, and they emphasized that the Trump administration will be working off the same information if they decide to redesignate Cuba as a sponsor of terrorism. The Biden team has been in touch with their counterparts on the Trump team on the issue, the officials said.",

      "More than 130 earthquakes were registered Tuesday at Iceland's large Bardarbunga volcano, a possible precursor to an eruption among the several scenarios being considered, the Icelandic meteorological office said.",
      "The aviation color code over the area has been changed from green to yellow as a precaution, the met office said, but the volcano's remote location in the heart of southern Iceland's uninhabited highlands means no infrastructure is at risk.",
      "The series of seismic events lasted for about three hours before subsiding slightly, the met office said in a statement.",
      "\"Earthquakes continue to be detected in the area and it is too early to say whether the swarm will fade away,\" it said.",
      "The largest earthquake registered a 5.1 magnitude, it said, while 17 other earthquakes with a magnitude of 3 or higher were detected, including at least two measuring magnitude 4 or above.",
      "The met office said the earthquakes were \"consistent with increased inflation due to magma accumulation\" under Bardarbunga.",
      "\"The activity will be closely monitored but it is difficult to say what the development will be at this point,\" the met office said.",
      "The caldera or hollow of the central Bardarbunga volcano is about 25 square miles and ice-filled.",
      "It is one of six volcanic systems located under Europe's biggest glacier Vatnajokull.",
      "In the event of a subglacial eruption, there is a risk of an ash eruption and subglacial flooding from under Vatnajokull.",
      "If an eruption were to occur outside the glacier, it would be a lava eruption, the met office explained.",
      "\"Seismic activity has increased in Bardarbunga in recent months,\" it said, with Tuesday's earthquake swarm the largest since Bardarbunga's last eruption in 2014-2015 which lasted six months.",
      "\"Bardarbunga is unique in that it is an unusually large volcanic system, partly covered by a glacier, and several scenarios are possible,\" the agency said. \"Extensive research, along with hazard assessments and contingency planning, was conducted during the 2014\u20132015 eruption, which will prove valuable should further volcanic activity occur.\"",
      "That eruption created Iceland's biggest basalt lava flow in more than 230 years but caused no injuries or damage.",
      "Iceland has seen seven volcanic eruptions in a year near the southwestern fishing village of Grindavik, leading to the evacuation of the town. After the seventh eruption, people were evacuated from about 50 homes in Grindav\u00edk, according to the country's\u00a0Civil Protection Agency.",
      "Iceland is home to 33 active volcanic systems, more than any other European country.",
      "It is situated on top of a rift between two tectonic plates, which makes the island nation vulnerable to\u00a0earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which have rocked portions of the country and displaced residents in recent years.",

      "The files about royal art historian Anthony Blunt are among a trove from the intelligence agency MI5 released Tuesday by Britain's National Archives. They shed new light on a spy ring linked to Cambridge University in the 1930s, whose members spilled secrets to the Soviet Union from the heart of the U.K. intelligence establishment.",
      "Blunt, who worked at Buckingham Palace as Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, was under suspicion for years before he finally confessed in 1964 that, as a senior MI5 officer during World War II, he had passed secret information to Soviet agents.",
      "In one of the newly released files, an MI5 officer notes that Blunt said he felt \"profound relief\" at unburdening himself. In return for information he provided, Blunt was allowed to keep his job, his knighthood and his social standing \u2013 and the queen was apparently kept in the dark.",
      "In 1972, her private secretary, Martin Charteris, told MI5 chief Michael Hanley that \"the queen did not know and he saw no advantage in telling her about it now; it would only add to her worries and there was nothing that could done about him.\"",
      "The government decided to tell the monarch in 1973, when Blunt was ill, fearing a media uproar once Blunt died and journalists were able to publish stories without fear of libel suits.",
      "Charteris reported that \"she took it all very calmly and without surprise,\" and \"remembered that he had been under suspicion way back\" in the early 1950s. Historian Christopher Andrew says in the official history of MI5 that the queen had previously been told about Blunt in \"general terms.\"",
      "Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022 at the age of 96.",
      "Blunt was publicly unmasked as a spy by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the House of Commons in November 1979. He was finally stripped of his knighthood, but never prosecuted, and died in 1983 at the age of 75.",
      "Files held by Britain's secretive intelligence services usually remain classified for several decades, but the agencies are inching toward more openness. Some of the newly released documents will feature in an exhibition, entitled \"MI5: Official Secrets,\" opening at the National Archives in London later this year.",
      "Two of the Cambridge spies, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess, fled to Russia in 1951. A third, Kim Philby, continued to work for foreign intelligence agency MI6 despite falling under suspicion. As evidence of his duplicity mounted, he was confronted in Beirut in January 1963 by his friend and fellow MI6 officer Nicholas Elliott.",
      "The declassified files include Philby's typed confession and a transcript of his discussion with Elliott.",
      "In it, Philby admitted he had betrayed Konstantin Volkov, a KGB officer who tried to defect to the West in 1945, bringing with him details of moles inside British intelligence \u2013 including Philby himself. As a result of Philby's intervention, Volkov was abducted in Istanbul, taken back to Moscow and executed.",
      "Elliott reported that Philby said that if he had his life to lead again, he would probably have behaved in the same way.",
      "\"I really did feel a tremendous loyalty to MI6. I was treated very, very well in it and I made some really marvelous friends there,\" Philby said, according to the transcript. \"But the overruling inspiration was the other side.\"",
      "Philby told Elliott that the choice faced now that he was exposed was \"between suicide and prosecution.\" Instead, he fled to Moscow, where he died in 1988.",

The president reestablished strong relationships with leaders of NATO countries in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and reentered the Paris climate agreement. But world leaders have been preparing for significant changes with President-elect Donald Trump's impending inauguration.",

The post Cold-War era is over. A new era has begun. In these four years, we faced crises, we've been tested, we've come through those tests, stronger in my view, than we entered those tests. This is a fierce competition underway. The future of the global economy, technology, human values and so much else. Right now, in my view, thanks to our administration, the United States is winning the world-wide competition.\"",

      "\"Today, I can report to the American people, our alliances are stronger than they've been in decades,\" he said. \"NATO is more capable than it's ever been. And many more of our allies are paying their fair share.\"",

      "Specifically, Mr. Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin has \"failed\" to subjugate Ukraine and weaken NATO. The president touted his work to rally the world around Ukraine, another central piece of his foreign policy.",
      "\"As I saw it, when Putin launched his invasion, I had two jobs \u2014 one to rally the world to defend Ukraine, and the other is to avoid war between two nuclear powers,\" Mr. Biden said. \"We did both those things. Today, Ukraine is still a free, independent country, with a potential, a potential for a bright future.\"",
      "He also argued that Iran is weaker than it's been in \"decades,\" saying Iran's main proxy Hezbollah is \"badly wounded\" and Iran's economy is in \"desperate straits.\"",
      "Something that has remained elusive for the Biden administration is the freeing of the hostages Hamas captured in Israel, which has been a top priority for the president and his aides. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said before Mr. Biden's speech on Monday the parties are \"close to a deal and it can get done this week,\" but also said he couldn't make a promise or a prediction.",
      "In his speech, the president briefly mentioned the soldiers who died during the chaotic and deadly withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, while emphasizing that he has been the president to end United States' involvement in its longest war.",
      "\"We grieve all 2,461 Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in the longest war in American history,\" he said. \"And I grieve those brave service members whose lives were lost during the withdrawal.\"",
      "Thirteen U.S. service members\u00a0died in an attack\u00a0outside of the Kabul airport amid the evacuation as the Taliban took over control of the country faster than the U.S. expected.",
      "Mr. Biden also laid out the challenges ahead for the incoming Trump administration, which will have to deal with a chaotic Middle East, Russia's nearly three-year war on Ukraine and a tenuous situation in the Red Sea.",
      "\"Make no mistake, there are serious challenges the United States must continue to deal with, in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in the Indo-Pacific,\" he said. \"Must keep the pressure on the Houthis who are attacking ships in the Red Sea, launching missiles at Israel, and firing at American forces. Must deter North Korea as they rattle their saber and draw closer to Russia. And new challenges will certainly emerge in the months and years ahead.\"",
      "\"But even \u2014 but even so, it's clear,\" he continued. \"My administration is leaving the next administration with a very strong hand to play. And we're leaving an America with more friends and stronger alliances, whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure. An America that once again is leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together behind our plans and visions.\"",
      "The president recently told USA Today that he had helped reset ties that had frayed during the Trump administration, saying he had managed an \"inflection point\" in history. He credited his long history in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with helping him \"navigate some of the fundamental changes taking place, whether it's in Europe, in Latin America, in the Middle East, in the Far East.\"",
      "\"The only advantage of being an old guy is that I've known every major world leader for a long time,\" he told USA Today's Susan Page. \"And so I had a perspective on each of them and their interests.\"",
      "Jake Sullivan said the president will argue \"America is winning that contest for the future.\"",
      "In his first foreign policy speech as president, in 2021, Mr. Biden aimed to tie foreign and domestic policy interests by arguing for a foreign policy for the middle class. The focus was meant to be on China and repairing alliances but was disrupted by crises in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "\"The United States is in a worse geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,\" says Stephen Wertheim, historian and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"The United States is immersed in a massive war on the European continent with serious escalation risks; it's back to bombing the Middle East with no end in sight; and it has entered into a full-spectrum strategic rivalry with China.\"",
      "A look at the major foreign policy issues of his presidency:",
      "Ukraine, Russia and NATO",
      "Mr. Biden has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, becoming the first president to go to a conflict zone where U.S. troops were not involved and directing over $183 billion dollars in military aid since Russia's invasion in 2021. He played a key role in getting NATO to spend more on collective defense.",
      "Yet the fierce battle continues on the frontlines with no clear plan for a peace deal. Washington deferred to Kyiv on when and how negotiations should take place with the tagline \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\"",
      "The administration was criticized early in the conflict for holding back on sending the most lethal weapons and later by some Republicans for spending too much money on Ukraine aid.",
      "Mr. Biden is expected to argue that his policies have ensured the survival of Ukraine as an independent state and thwarted Putin's ambitions, a senior administration official tells CBS News.",
      "Israel-Hamas war",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed over 1,200 civilians, Mr. Biden made it clear that Israel has the right to defend itself with his administration sending over billions of dollars worth of military assistance.",
      "As Israel launched a war on Gaza that has killed more than 45,000 people according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry and led to a humanitarian crisis, the administration did not change its stance.",
      "In April 2023, Mr. Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanhayu that future U.S. support of his country was dependent on Israel protecting civilians and aid workers in Gaza.",
      "\"Biden willingly threw away his leverage by immediately pledging military support for Israel; then he criticized the Israeli government's decisions from the self-imposed sidelines,\" Wertheim said.",
      "The State Department informed Congress earlier this month of a planned $8 billion weapons transfer to Israel. Ceasefire negotiations are still underway between Israel and Hamas as pressure mounts for a deal to be reached prior to Trump's inauguration on January 20.",
      "Chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal",
      "The most glaring foreign policy failure was the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Mr. Biden had promised to end America's longest war and assured Americans that the Afghan military was capable of holding off a Taliban takeover. Instead the Taliban expanded its control of territory across the country more quickly than the U.S. expected and seized Kabul as the Afghan government collapsed. The U.S. hastily evacuated about 125,000 people, including 6,000 Americans, over the course of its frenzied withdrawal, but dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members were\u00a0killed in a suicide bombing\u00a0outside Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul as thousands sought to flee the country.",
      "U.S. citizens and Afghan allies who supported American troops throughout the war were left behind. Thousands feared retribution from the Taliban and felt abandoned by an American government that had promised to take care of them.",
      "Images of Afghans clinging onto military planes in hopes of escape, and U.S. military weapons left behind and paraded about by the Taliban became emblematic of the missteps leading up to the evacuation.",
      "In the three years since the Taliban returned to power, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have established a presence in the country, and\u00a0Afghan women and girls have been deprived of basic freedoms\u00a0they enjoyed during two decades of Western-backed government following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.",
      "China",
      "Trump began a trade war with China\u00a0and other countries during his first term, imposing tariffs that were aimed at deterring what he saw as unfair trade practices and to encourage American consumers and businesses to buy and sell more goods made at home. While the rhetoric changed under Mr Biden, he nonetheless continued the tariff policy. And as was the case during the Trump administration, both have viewed China as a security threat, not just an economic one.",
      "The Biden administration put safeguards in place to help protect industries like chip production from relying on China. Global alliances such as the Quad \u2014\u00a0 U.S., India, Japan and Australia \u2014\u00a0 and AUKUS \u2013 Australia, the U.S. and U.K. \u2013 made diplomatic and military headway in deterrence against China. And the Biden administration has also enhanced its military alliance with Japan.",
      "Mr. Biden was vice president when former President Barack Obama delivered his \"pivot to Asia\" speech. American policymakers have been attempting to shift foreign policy focus ever since, but there has been a world of distractions along the way.",
      "\"The United States cannot expect to prioritize China while remaining the leading military power in Europe and the Middle East. If the United States truly wants to prioritize China, it needs to pull back elsewhere,\"\u00a0 Wertheim said.",

    "summary": "President Biden spoke by phone Sunday with the families of three Americans held by the Taliban, Ryan Corbett, George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi.",
    "story": [
      "In a roughly 30-minute phone call Sunday afternoon, President Biden delivered difficult news to the families of three Americans held by the Taliban. He did not have a deal with the Taliban to free their loved ones from captivity, despite what U.S. officials described to CBS News as a significant offer the U.S. had extended in Doha days earlier. The U.S. considers Ryan Corbett and George Glezmann to be wrongfully detained by the Taliban, and describes Mahmood Habibi, who holds dual American and Afghan citizenship, as \"unjustly held\" since 2022.",
      "Ahmad Shah Habibi, the brother of Mahmood Habibi, told CBS News that during the conversation, Mr. Biden clarified that he would not agree to the Taliban's demand that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al Afghani, a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, unless the Taliban, now the government of Afghanistan, also releases Mahmood. An NSC spokesman declined to respond to a CBS inquiry about that specific claim.",
      "Mahmood Habibi disappeared in Afghanistan in 2022, and the Taliban denied abducting him. In a public notice posted by the FBI in August 2024, the agency said it \"believed\" that Habibi was taken by Taliban military or security forces and \"has not been heard from since his disappearance.\" The FBI said in its notice that Habibi was working as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecom company when he disappeared.",
      "The Taliban still say they do not have Habibi in custody.",
      "\"No, we don't have him,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News Monday.",
      "Asked whether Mahmoud had disappeared in Afghanistan, Mujahid said, \"It's not clear either, because we didn't know him before.\"",
      "Ahmad Habibi told CBS News, \"My family has every confidence that my brother is alive. There are things that neither we nor the U.S. government can say publicly, but Mahmood's case is different from the other two Americans.\"",
      "\"We know the other families are desperate to get their loved ones home and I told the president we want them home, too,\" Ahmad Habibi added. \"But anyone speculating that my brother is dead is just feeding into Taliban claims. We are grateful that President Biden committed to not leave Mahmood behind,\" and he said that national security adviser Jake Sullivan had also made similar assurances.",
      "The FBI declined to comment.",
      "Corbett, who is fluent in Pashto, was working for local nongovernmental organizations before starting a microloan and consulting business in Kabul when he was arrested with three associates \u2014 one German and two Afghans \u2014 during a business trip to northern Afghanistan in 2022.",
      "Glezmann is an Atlanta native who was detained while on a tourist visit in December 2022.",
      "The family of Ryan Corbett is publicly calling on Mr. Biden to consider a deal to bring him and Glezmann home.",
      "\"We hope that President Biden will have the courage to take the deal in front of him, given that the lives of several Americans rest on his shoulders,\" Erin Pelton, a spokesperson for the Corbett family, told CBS News.",
      "Corbett's wife, Anna Corbett, described the call with the president during an appearance on Fox News on Monday.",
      "\"He was very kind and empathetic, but what I heard him say is he's not bringing Ryan home, and that was just devastating,\" Anna Corbett said. She blasted Mr. Biden for refusing to agree to the Taliban's terms for a deal. \"It is not being taken and it is incredibly crushing to our family.\"",
      "She has launched a public campaign in recent days to urge the incoming administration to press for her husband's release, and she traveled to President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago residence in hopes of making an in-person plea to Trump. Neither Mr. Biden nor Trump have met with her yet.",
      "Anna Corbett did tell Fox News that Trump sent incoming national security adviser and current Florida Rep. Mike Waltz to meet with her. She said he spent more than an hour listening to her family's story. She expressed frustration that it took more than a year to get a similar meeting with the current national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.",
      "The Taliban have been demanding that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani, who is being held in indefinite law-of-war detention at Guantanamo Bay. A source familiar with his case said the U.S. intelligence community and Pentagon oppose Rahim's release and could not guarantee that he no longer represented a threat to the U.S. However, the president could waive that if he determined it were in the U.S. interest to finalize a prisoner swap.",
      "Rahim was captured in Pakistan in 2007 by the CIA and was the last detainee sent to the Guantanamo prison facility by the Bush administration in 2008. He has never been charged with war crimes, but the periodic review board has deemed his continued detention a national security necessity. His 2016 intelligence profile describes him as a courier for al Qaeda.",
      "In its statement acknowledging the phone call, the White House also noted that Mr. Biden had been able to bring home U.S. citizens who had been detained before the U.S. exit from Afghanistan in 2021. Corbett, Glezmann and Habibi were detained after traveling to Afghanistan following the Taliban's return to power. That ascendance of the Taliban followed a diplomatic deal negotiated by the Trump administration for U.S. troops to withdraw and a surprisingly strong Taliban military offensive that caught the Biden administration off guard, leading to a hasty and chaotic U.S. evacuation. Unwilling to remain without U.S. troops, NATO forces also pulled out.",
      "The U.S. does not officially recognize the Taliban, with its horrific human rights record, as the legitimate government of Afghanistan but has been in contact with its leaders through U.S. agencies as well as via the Qatari government. Last weekend in Doha, Special Presidential Envoy Roger Carstens and NSC official Jen Daskal pressed for a deal with the Taliban to free the Americans.",
      "A U.S. official described the Doha meetings as unsuccessful but declined to detail which other individuals the Biden administration was willing to offer to the Taliban as part of a potential trade. The White House described the Biden efforts as continuing through the end of his term.",
      "Mr. Biden has dedicated much of his career to foreign policy, and that portion of his legacy is extremely important to him. In a speech Monday at the State Department, the president will describe the chaotic U.S. exit from Afghanistan, arguably his biggest foreign policy failure, as having successfully ended America's longest war.",

    "title": "Israel and Hamas may be nearing deal for ceasefire, hostage release",
    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 16:34:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Israel and Hamas have been holding indirect talks for more than a year aimed at ending the war in Gaza and returning the hostages to Israel.",
    "story": [
      "Officials in the U.S. and Israel said that Israel and Hamas were close to agreeing a ceasefire and hostage release deal on Monday, after midnight \"breakthrough\" negotiations.",
      "Qatar, which has been mediating, reportedly gave both Israel and Hamas a draft on Monday of a ceasefire agreement to end the war in Gaza, the Reuters news agency reported, citing an official familiar with the talks.",
      "\"I think the pressure is building for Hamas to come to yes, and I think Israel also has achieved a huge amount of its military objectives in Gaza, and therefore, they are in a position to be able to say 'yes,'\" U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.",
      "Sullivan said Israel and Hamas had been close to a deal before, and things had fallen through, but on Monday there was a \"general sense that this is moving in the right direction.\"",
      "\"The question is now, can we all collectively seize the moment and make this happen?\" Sullivan said.",
      "\"We are in advanced stages of negotiations,\" an Israeli political source told CBS News, saying a deal could be agreed in hours or days. \"There is progress in all components of the agreement formula.\"",
      "What has been happening with the Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks?",
      "Israel and Hamas have been holding indirect talks for more than a year aimed at ending the war in Gaza and returning scores of hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
      "The Biden administration has been pushing for a deal before the end of his term and Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. On Sunday, President Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone about the ongoing negotiations. The White House said the two leaders discussed the deal based on the arrangement outlined by Mr. Biden last year.",
      "The deal presented to Israel and Hamas appears similar to that arrangement, according to a draft ffrom mediator sources seen by CBS News and a senior Israeli official.",
      "The draft lays out three phases, according to the copy viewed by CBS News, each one to be negotiated as things progress.",
      "During the first phase, which would take place over a 42 days ceasefire period, Hamas would release 33 women and children hostages, as well as hostages over 50 years old. For each woman or child hostage returned to Israel, Israel would release 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. Hamas would release all hostages over 50 years of age, and Israel would release 30 Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older.",
      "On the first day of that ceasefire, Hamas would release 3 hostages, according to the document viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release 4 hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release 3 hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "During the exchange of hostages and prisoners, there would be a complete ceasefire in Gaza to allow aid to enter, the draft viewed by CBS News said. International aid groups and the United Nations would resume operation in Gaza, and reconstruction of its infrastructure, like water, electricity and sewage systems, would begin. There would also be negotiations over the next phase of the deal.",
      "The second phase of the deal would involve the release of all the Israeli male hostages and the withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza, according to the document viewed by CBS News.",
      "The third phase, which would be partially negotiated during earlier phases, would include the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and prisoners, the beginning of the reconstruction of Gaza, and the opening of its borders.",
      "Despite intense mediation by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, the talks have repeatedly stalled over several key issues including the details of the exchange, whether the ceasefire would be permanent and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "As each side has accused the other of backtracking, the war has ground on.",
      "Dozens of Palestinians have been killed each day in Israeli strikes, and most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are huddled in squalid tent camps, their neighborhoods in ruins. Humanitarian groups struggle to deliver desperately needed aid, and experts have warned of famine.",
      "In Israel, families of the hostages have held weekly rallies demanding a deal for their release, fearing their loved ones will die in the harsh conditions of their captivity the longer the fighting drags on.",
      "What have the main points of contention been in coming up with a ceasefire deal?",
      "Hamas and other groups are still holding around 100 hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that ignited the war, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. The Israeli military has declared a third of the hostages dead but suspects that the true number could be around half.",
      "Hamas is demanding the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants convicted of orchestrating attacks that killed civilians. Israel is reluctant to free such prisoners, especially since one of the masterminds of the 2023 attack, the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israel in October, was a former prisoner released in such a deal.",
      "The two sides have exchanged lists of names, with Israel demanding more information about which hostages are alive to ensure they come out first.",
      "Hamas has said it won't release the remaining hostages without assurances that the war will end. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 46,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities, who don't say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "Hamas likely fears that Israel will resume its offensive \u2014 and step up its intensity \u2014 once the hostages are out and the militants no longer have their most valuable bargaining chip.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to do just that. He has said Israel won't end the war until it has destroyed Hamas' military and governing abilities and ensured that the Palestinian militant group no longer poses a threat.",
      "The lack of trust goes both ways: Israelis fear that Hamas will drag out negotiations over the second phase of the deal, extending the ceasefire indefinitely while the hostages languish.",
      "Talks have almost collapsed over disagreements",
      "The talks nearly collapsed last summer when Netanyahu said Israel would maintain a lasting presence in the Philadelphi corridor, a strip of land along the Gaza-Egypt border.",
      "Israel says Hamas has long smuggled weapons into Gaza through tunnels beneath the corridor and that it must control the area to prevent Hamas from rebuilding. Egypt, a key mediator, says it blocked the tunnels years ago and is opposed to any Israeli presence on the Gaza side of its border.",
      "Israel has also demanded a mechanism for inspecting people returning to their homes in northern Gaza, from which around a million people fled following Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war. Their return is a key Hamas demand, the details of which are still being worked out.",
      "Israel says people returning to the north should be searched for weapons. That would probably require an Israeli presence in what's known as the Netzarim corridor, a strip of closed roads and military installations stretching from the border to the sea just south of Gaza City.",
      "The Palestinians are opposed to any permanent Israeli occupation, though Hamas has reportedly shown flexibility on the timetable of the Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Israel says Hamas can never again rule Gaza but has yet to endorse a realistic plan for an alternative government. With no internal rivals, Hamas has been able to quickly regroup after Israeli operations, even in the hardest-hit areas, and still controls much of the territory.",
      "The Biden administration has long pushed for a grand bargain in which a reformed Palestinian Authority would govern postwar Gaza with the support of Arab and Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, which would also take the historic step of forging ties with Israel.",
      "But Arab and Muslim leaders say they will only sign onto such plans if they include a pathway to a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem and Gaza, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Israel's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood and has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. Netanyahu says Israel will maintain open-ended security control while delegating governance to politically independent Palestinians. But none appear to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with Israel in running the territory.",
      "Hamas has said, however, that it's willing to relinquish control of Gaza to other Palestinians. Late last year, it agreed to an Egyptian-brokered plan for a group of independents to govern the territory under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority, which has yet to accept the proposal.",
      "Hamas has also demanded the lifting of a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after it seized power in 2007, which experts say is needed for Gaza to be rebuilt.",
      "The lifting of the blockade, however, would allow Hamas to claim a major victory and to eventually rebuild its military capabilities. That's another nonstarter for Israel.",

      "Kosminski's descendants have also supported the inquest, the Daily Mail reported. According to the newspaper, Kosminski's great-great-great-niece Amanda Poulos said: \"I'm more than happy to finally establish what really happened.\"",

      "His family fled the imperial Russian anti-Jewish pogroms and emigrated to east London in the early 1880s. He lived close to the murder scenes.",
      "Some reports say he was taken in by the police to be identified by a witness who had seen him with one of the victims.",
      "Although a positive identification was made, the witness refused to give incriminating evidence, meaning the police had little option but to release Kosminski.",

      "He died from gangrene in an asylum on March 24, 1919, and was buried three days later at East Ham Cemetery in east London.",
      "As CBS News previously reported, former FBI agent John Douglas referred to the homicides as \"lust murders,\" which means the killer attacked the genital areas of his victims. In Douglas' opinion, this was a way to act out his fantasy of domination, cruelty and mutilation of women.",

    "summary": "After traveling more than a million miles on the job, the secretary of state discusses the Biden administration's foreign policy report card, from a reinvigorated NATO alliance and Russian aggression in Ukraine, to the ongoing turmoil in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "No easy stroll to the exit for Antony Blinken. With exactly eight days left as secretary of state, he's only just concluded what is likely his last trip back-and-forth across the globe, with meetings in Seoul, Tokyo, Paris and, finally, Rome.",
      "Blinken has traveled more than a million miles on the job. \"Every minute, every hour, every day of the time that we have left, we're focused on getting results,\" he said.",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" flew with him in early December \u2013 three trips ago \u2013 from Washington to Brussels for the most recent NATO foreign ministers meeting. The main topic of discussion was Russian aggression in Ukraine.",
      "\"We have a new NATO strategic concept,\" said Blinken. \"It recognizes Russia as the most direct threat to the alliance.\"",
      "But there was a lot of well-wishing going on as well. Blinken stood right in the middle of the so-called \"family photo,\" and also photo-bombed a portrait of all the women foreign ministers.",
      "Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, the secretary-general of NATO, told Blinken, \"You have been a staunch ally, and people like you very much.\"",
      "All this ceremonial show & tell might be seen as subtle messaging to the incoming Trump administration about the value of nurturing alliance \u2013 the \"stronger together\" argument. Blinken said, \"The instruction I got from President Biden on Day One was, get in there, rejuvenate, re-energize, and even re-imagine our alliances and partnerships.\"",
      "Here was one more chance for Blinken to hold up the Biden administration foreign policy report card \u2026 and his own. He explained, \"If the United States is not engaged, if we're not leading, then probably either someone else is (and probably not in a way that reflects our interests and our values), or maybe just as bad, no one is. What we've done over the last four years is, we've re-engaged.\"",
      "As for Ukraine, he told the press in Brussels, \"All told, the U.S. has provided $102 billion in assistance to Ukraine, our allies and partners $158 billion. This may be the best example of burden-sharing that I've seen in the 32 years that I've been doing this.\"",
      "President-elect Trump wants to end Russia's war with Ukraine, critics fear not to Ukraine's advantage. Ever the diplomat, Blinken won't say he's trying to Trump-proof the potential outcome. \"For any of us to really speculate at this point, I don't think makes a lot of sense,\" Blinken said. \"What does make sense is to make sure that we give the next administration, we give the incoming Trump administration, the strongest possible hand for it to play around the world, whether it's on Ukraine or anything else.\"",
      "Sixty-two years old, Antony Blinken was practically born to be secretary of state.\u00a0 His father, financier and philanthropist Donald Blinken, served as ambassador to Hungary. His stepfather, international lawyer and humanitarian Samuel Pisar, was a Holocaust survivor from Poland. \"He was on a death march out of the camps, and he and some friends managed to escape the death march itself, hid out in the Bavarian woods,\" Blinken said. \"They saw a tank with a five-pointed white star. And the hatch opened up, and a very large African American GI looked down at him, and he got down on his knees and said the only words that he knew in English that his mother had taught him before the war: 'God bless America.' And the GI lifted him into the tank, into freedom, into the United States. Those are the stories that I grew up hearing, and it made me feel that there was something special about our country.\"",
      "Blinken grew up in Paris. He went to Harvard, Columbia Law School, and in 1993, during President Clinton's first term, began his diplomatic career at the State Department. During one administration after another, Blinken was always in \"the room where it happens.\" There he was (right, background) in the famous picture when President Obama took out Osama bin Laden.",
      "Blinken was national security advisor to then-Vice President Joe Biden. The two are exceptionally close. \"One of the things that's been an immense privilege is to have the kind of relationship where he would seek my counsel,\" said Blinken, \"and I always felt with him the ability to speak my mind.\"",
      "It was reported in Bob Woodward's recent book, \"War,\" that after President Biden's shaky debate performance last July, Blinken met with the president and asked him to consider whether he \"wanted to be doing this another four years?\"... adding, \"I don't want to see your legacy jeopardized.\"",
      "Blinken and Biden's legacies are inevitably linked, for better or worse. Blinken has defended the chaotic U.S. pull-out from Afghanistan on their watch, reminding the world that the first Trump administration made a deal with the Taliban, forcing the withdrawal.",
      "On their rocky relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the devastation of Gaza, in response to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, and the appearance that Netanyahu is not respecting the role that the United States is trying to play (and has helped to finance) in its support of Israel, that calls to protect and feed people have been ignored, Blinken said this: \"The quickest way, the most effective way to get people what they need is actually through what we've been trying to achieve for many months now, and that's a ceasefire, with the hostages coming home, massive assistance going in.\"",
      "Even this late in the game, Blinken is hoping a deal can be reached before Inauguration Day. But if not? He said, \"When that agreement is reached, it will be on the basis of what President Biden put forward.\"",
      "And who will get the credit? \"You know, ultimately, it doesn't matter,\" Blinken said. \"What really matters is whether the United States can bring real change, real change to people's lives.\"",
      "He still sounds idealistic. There's something a bit square about Antony Blinken. After all, he's the guy who promoted music diplomacy by performing the Muddy Waters blues standard, \"Hoochie Coochie Man,\" in a suit and tie:",
      "What will he do now? He's vague on that. As he left NATO headquarters for the last time as secretary of state, I asked, \"You can't not have strong feelings knowing that you're leaving this building?\"",
      "\"Sure,\" Blinken said. \"Look, there'll always be a moment. Someone says something to you, there's some generous recognition, and for about 30 seconds you feel that. You take it to heart. But then, it's back to work. That really is my focus. Now, talk to me on January 21.\"",

      "ANOTHER REASON TO GET MORE SLEEP AND THIS ONE MIGHT SURPRISE YOU",
      "Study senior author professor Maiken Nedergaard of the University of Rochester and the University of Copenhagen said norepinephrine (a neurotransmitter and hormone) triggers blood vessels to contract \u2014 generating slow pulsations that create a rhythmic flow in the surrounding fluid to carry away waste, news agency SWNS noted.",
      "Said Nedergaard, \"It's like turning on the dishwasher before you go to bed and waking up with a clean brain. . . . We're essentially asking what drives this process and trying to define restorative sleep based on\" this \"glymphatic clearance.\"",
      "\"It's like turning on the dishwasher before you go to bed and waking up with a clean brain.\" (iStock)",
      "The brain has a built-in waste removal process - the glymphatic system - that circulates fluid in the brain and spinal cord to clear out waste, according to the scientists.",
      "The process helps remove toxic proteins that form sticky plaques linked to neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.",
      "But the scientists indicated that what drives the system was unclear until now, according to the study.",
      "Is all sleep created equal? The researchers wanted to find out.",
      "To find clues, Nedergaard and her team looked into what happens in mice when their brains sleep, as SWNS reported of the study. The team focused on the relationship between norepinephrine and blood flow during deep sleep.",
      "TRUMP'S DAYLIGHT SAVING PLAN AND SLEEP: WHAT YOU MUST KNOW",
      "They found that norepinephrine waves correlate to variations in brain blood volume \u2014 suggesting that norepinephrine triggers a rhythmic pulsation in the blood vessels. The researchers then compared the changes in blood volume to brain fluid flow.",
      "The brain fluid flow fluctuates in correspondence to blood volume changes, suggesting the vessels act as pumps to propel the surrounding brain fluid to flush out waste.",
      "During deep sleep, toxic proteins that form sticky plaques linked to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are removed, scientists say in a new study.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Natalie Hauglund of the University of Copenhagen and the University of Oxford, the study's lead author, said, \"You can view norepinephrine as [the] conductor of an orchestra.\"",

      "To find out, the research team administered zolpidem, a common drug to aid sleep, to mice.",
      "\"If people aren't getting the full benefits of sleep, they should be aware of that, so they can make informed decisions.\"",
      "They found that the norepinephrine waves during deep sleep were 50% lower in zolpidem-treated mice than in naturally sleeping mice.",
      "Although the zolpidem-treated mice fell asleep more quickly \u2014 fluid transport into the brain dropped more than 30%, as SWNS reported.",

      "The researchers say their findings, published in the journal Cell, suggest that the sleeping aid may disrupt the norepinephrine-driven waste clearance during sleep.",
      "Hauglund said, \"More and more people are using sleep medication, and it's really important to know if that's healthy sleep. If people aren't getting the full benefits of sleep, they should be aware of that, so they can make informed decisions.\"",

      "U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy warned in a recent advisory about alcohol use increasing cancer risk.",
      "The advisory notes that alcohol can increase the risk of throat, liver, esophageal, mouth, larynx (voice box), colon and rectal cancers, making it the \"third leading preventable cause of cancer\" in the U.S.",
      "This guidance follows the rise of the \"sober curious\" trend, with younger generations scaling back on how much they drink or choosing not to partake at all.",

      "For those who are interested in curbing their alcohol use, here are six tips on how to do so safely.",
      "The surgeon general's advisory noted that alcohol-related cancer deaths even occurred in some moderate drinkers. (iStock)",
      "1. Analyze your alcohol dependence",
      "Alcohol is \"one of the most serious substances\" when it comes to detoxification, sometimes requiring medical hospitalization to manage withdrawal symptoms, according to Dr. Chris Tuell, clinical director at the Lindner Center of HOPE in Mason, Ohio.",
      "\"If you are one of the 40% of Americans who is trying to stop alcohol use, sometimes it may be necessary to seek counseling services.\"",
      "Tuell, who is also an associate professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, recommended speaking to a primary care physician before discontinuing years of extreme alcohol use.",
      "DOES \u2018DRY JANUARY\u2019 ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH? HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW",
      "Dr. Adi Jaffe, PhD, CEO of addiction recovery platform IGNTD in Los Angeles, noted that in some cases, it may be \"medically inadvisable to just quit\" if alcohol dependence is severe.",
      "People who drink heavily, or consume five to seven drinks a day, should consult their doctor before quitting, one addiction specialist recommended. (iStock)",
      "\"You must consult with a medical professional before stopping,\" said Jaffe, author of the book \"Unhooked.\" \"This is especially true if you get tremors, shaking or sweatiness when you don't drink, even for a day or two.\"",
      "\"Those are markers of somebody who's more likely to have a grand mal seizure if they just stop cold turkey.\"",
      "2. Set clear goals and track patterns",
      "For people who haven\u2019t had a \"necessarily problematic\" relationship with alcohol and are just looking to cut back, Tuell recommended setting clear goals to get there.",
      "DRINKING ALCOHOL IS LINKED TO CANCER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"With any behaviors that you plan to change, what are clear, realistic and specific goals on how much or how often you plan to drink?\" he asked.",
      "\"Perhaps you have the goal of only drinking on weekends, or perhaps you limit the amount of alcohol to two drinks per occasion.\"",
      "Writing down your drinking behaviors can help identify triggers, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Tuell suggested tracking your drinking by keeping a journal of when, where and how much you drink.",
      "\"This helps to identify patterns or triggers that may be associated with your mood, such as work stress or family stress and anxieties,\" he said.",
      "Planning alcohol-free days and then gradually increasing the number of those days each week can be effective, the expert added.",
      "3. Avoid triggers and find alternatives",
      "After tracking when, where and how much you drink, it may become clear what triggers you to drink.",
      "Tuell encouraged identifying these situations, emotions and behaviors and finding alternative ways to handle them.",
      "\u2018ALCOHOL GENE\u2019 COULD PREDICT HOW COCKTAILS MAY AFFECT YOU \u2014 AND THERE\u2019S A TEST FOR IT",
      "\"These triggers will frequently lead to behaviors that give us relief and/or a reward, and many times it is not a healthy way of coping,\" he said.",
      "\"Choose non-alcoholic beverages in social settings \u2026 like sparkling water, mocktails or herbal teas, to satisfy the habit of having a drink \u2026 or avoid places where heavy drinking occurs.\"",
      "Social pressure to drink can pose a major temptation, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Jaffe commented that focusing on less drinking won\u2019t be as effective as drinking something else, like a non-alcoholic drink, or doing a different activity instead.",
      "SEVERE HEALTH RISKS OF VAPING AND E-CIGARETTES, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUTH, SAY EXPERTS",
      "Tuell agreed that finding a healthier alternative to bad behaviors is a good way to stop them.",
      "This could include stress-relieving practices like exercising, reading, journaling or spending more time with supportive friends.",
      "Adding movement as a replacement for drinking can help curb bad habits. (iStock)",
      "Movement, mindfulness exercises and meditation can also be helpful practices throughout the day, according to Jaffe.",
      "\"You can do those practices while you're brushing your teeth or while you're making your coffee,\" he said. \"Meditation practices as short as five or 10 minutes can have an incredible impact on your stress response in life.\"",
      "4. Change your environment",
      "Removing temptations from your environment is a good way to prevent reaching for them, according to experts.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Tuell suggested removing alcohol from your home or limiting activities that make it more accessible, such as hanging out at bars.",
      "\"Smell is the strongest of the five senses connected to memory,\" he added.",
      "Jaffe agreed that environment \"plays a massive role\" in how people interact with alcohol.",
      "\"If you're looking to reduce your drinking \u2026 having other people who are participating in the journey with you will go a long way toward helping you meet your goals of reduction.\"",
      "5. Practice saying \u2018no\u2019 and surround yourself with support",
      "The social pressures of drinking can be a trigger, but learning to say \"no\" is powerful. Tuell recommended being prepared with a \"polite but firm\" response in situations where you might feel pressured to drink.",
      "\u2018I\u2019M A PSYCHOLOGIST \u2013 HERE'S HOW TO FINALLY BREAK YOUR BAD HABITS'",
      "This can be as simple as, \"No, thanks, I\u2019m taking a break from drinking\" or \"I\u2019m good, thanks.\"",
      "Tuell advises surrounding yourself with supportive individuals, like trusted friends or family members with whom you can share your goals.",
      "Experts recommend surrounding yourself with supportive individuals with whom you can share your goals. (iStock)",
      "He also suggested joining a support group, \"like Alcoholics Anonymous, SMART Recovery, Celebrate Recovery or Women for Sobriety.\"",

      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0foxnews.com/health",
      "Tuell also mentioned that methods like cognitive behavioral therapy can be effective.",
      "6. Be kind to yourself",
      "Reflecting on the reasons you're looking to reduce alcohol intake \u2014 whether it's to improve your health, save money, strengthen relationships or another motivating factor \u2014 can help keep you on the right path, according to Tuell.",
      "\"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "He also encouraged celebrating milestones by enjoying something non-alcohol-related, such as a massage, a round of golf, a shopping trip or another fun outing.",
      "\"To make changes, it takes time,\" Tuell said. \"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "\"If you keep moving forward one step at a time, you will get to a point where you're drinking substantially less.\" (iStock)",
      "While about 40% of people quit their New Year\u2019s resolutions before the end of January, according to Jaffe, the specialist said it's important to not be discouraged by slip-ups.",

The next confirmation didn\u2019t come until January 31, 2017. That was Elaine Chao, wife of former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), to be Transportation Secretary.",
      "In 2021, the Senate confirmed one of President Biden\u2019s nominees shortly after he was sworn-in. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines was the first Biden nominee confirmed \u2013 on the night of January 20, 2021. The first, full cabinet-level vote did not come until January 22, when the Senate confirmed Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.",
      "The coming weeks are littered with confirmation hearings for President-elect Trump's Cabinet picks \u2013 but the pace at which we can expect them to be confirmed and take office is an entirely different animal. (All photos via Getty Images)",
      "So, while everyone is trying to squeeze into their tux on Monday night, look for the Senate to potentially vote on a nominee or two on the evening of January 20th.",
      "Fox is told that the most likely candidates might include Rubio \u2013 since he is a known quantity in the Senate and has bipartisan support. Another possibility would be CIA Director nominee John Ratcliffe. The Senate previously confirmed Ratcliffe as the Director of National Intelligence during the first Trump Administration. He is also a known entity in the halls of Congress and served as a Republican congressman from Texas. His hearing is on for tomorrow.",
      "Frankly, the ambitious timetable of approving several of the nominees quickly could be challenging.",

      "The Senate Energy Committee had to postpone Tuesday\u2019s confirmation hearing for Interior Secretary Doug Burgum from Tuesday until Thursday due to delays over paperwork. Veterans Affairs Secretary nominee Doug Collins is not controversial. He is a former GOP congressman from Georgia. But his confirmation hearing for Tuesday was pushed back until next week. Collins may have been one figure who could have been confirmed quickly.",
      "Attorney General nominee Pam Bondi is also one who could secure relatively speedy confirmation. Her hearing is Wednesday and Thursday. So maybe next week for her? Unclear.",

      "After Lloyd Austin, the Senate confirmed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on January 25, 2021, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken on January 26. Most cabinet officials weren\u2019t confirmed until February or March. The Senate did not confirm Interior Secretary Deb Haaland until March 15, 2021, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra until March 18, 2021, and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh until March 22, 2021.",
      "You get the idea.",
      "Every nominee must go through a hearing. Committees have different rules about how they discharge a nomination to the floor. So that could consume some time as well. Some nominees could be bottled up in committee, depending on opposition or attendance problems. Then there may be debate on the floor.",

      "If Democrats filibuster a nominee, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) may need to tee up a procedural gambit to break filibusters. The process of just initiating a procedural vote to break a filibuster consumes parts of three days alone. If a nominee\u2019s opponents still don\u2019t relent, it\u2019s possible that senators could drag out debate on a nominee for day or two \u2013 even though the Senate has broken a filibuster.",
      "In February 2017, Mike Pence became the first Vice President to break a tie to confirm a cabinet official. He did so to confirm former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.",
      "In other words, floor time is at a premium. There are various parliamentary \"meridians\" for when the Senate can take certain procedural votes to advance a nominee. That\u2019s why the Senate took a procedural vote at 7 am on the DeVos nomination in February 2017. The Senate also confirmed then Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price around 2 am one morning.",
      "Mike Pence was the first Vice President whose vote was needed to break a tie in a Cabinet secretary's confirmation \u2013 that secretary being former Department of Education head Betsy DeVos. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)",
      "And we haven\u2019t even gotten to other nominations which are important to the Administration \u2013 such as Pete Hoekstra to be Ambassador to Canada or Mike Huckabee to serve as Ambassador to Israel. There are more than 800 positions which require Senate confirmation.",
      "To accelerate things, the Senate could confirm some swaths of non-controversial nominees \"en bloc.\" That means the Senate clears the nominees on both sides to make sure there are no objections. If there are none, the Senate compiles a list and confirms a group of nominees together in one fell swoop.",
      "But this is a long and tedious process. Confirming various positions in the Trump administration is going to take months. It consumes hours of floor time. That\u2019s the most precious commodity in the Senate. Keep in mind that the push to confirm Trump nominees comes as the Senate is trying to work out a time agreement and amendments to pass the Laken Riley Act and a bill to sanction the International Criminal Court over its arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",

      "But, if Trump's Section 199-A deduction expires later this year, small business owners could see their top tax rate more than double to 43.4%, which is roughly 20 points higher than what businesses in communist China face, Ways & Means Chairman Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., laid out in a report earlier this month and reiterated during Tuesday's hearing.",
      "\"If Congress fails to act \u2026 26 million small businesses will be hit with a 43.4 percent top tax rate, more than 20 points higher than what businesses pay in Communist China,\" Smith said Tuesday.",

      "\"I guess my colleagues want to go back to when we had higher tax rates than communist China,\" said Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas. \"What's pro-American about that? How are we going to unleash economic growth, job creation, and prosperity with that kind of tax rate? We reduced it to 21% and we're not even in the top quarter of the most competitive tax rates. So, I guess my colleagues want to go back to the highest business tax rate in the free world. It makes no sense.\"",
      "\"The 21% rate in the United States of America \u2013 when you add the average state rate across the United States \u2013 is at 25%,\" added Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla. \"Our greatest adversary in the world economically \u2013 no one is even close \u2013 is China at 25%.\"",

      "Allison Couch, the founder of Ignite Accounting and one of the witnesses present at Tuesday's hearing, referred to 199-A as \"the single most beneficial deduction for small business owners.\"",
      "\"Allowing this deduction to lapse when it has been in place for so many years will not feel like a sunset, but a tax increase,\" said Couch, who also submitted a report into the congressional record during Tuesday's hearing from global accounting firm Ernst & Young, which indicated 25.9 million small businesses in the United States utilize the 199-A deduction.",

      "However, Democrats at the hearing argued that an extension of Trump's tax cuts will benefit the ultra wealthy more than anyone else. They also argued that Republicans are ignoring the deficit impact, and not providing adequate solutions for how to pay for the extended cuts, noting that increased deficits could result in increased interest rates, a grater cost burden for middle-class people and less economic growth.",
      "\"There's no free lunch here,\" said Brendan Duke, senior director of economic policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. \"The tax cuts will likely be paid for eventually in the form of spending cuts or tax increases down the line. In the meantime, continued, or even higher deficits could mean continued or even higher interest rates. That makes housing, student loans and credit card debt less affordable for working people.\"",

      "\"Republican reliance on tariff taxes to off-set their tax breaks for the super wealthy will continue to shift the tax burden to some of the very type of businesses that [Republicans want to protect]\" warned Democratic Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett. \"The biggest loser of their plan overall will be our debt, but the impact that that has on the solvency of Social Security, and Medicare and other investments, is also very critical.

These companies often operate in legal gray areas, with the consent required to collect user data buried deep in the fine print.",

Last year, National Public Data made headlines for\u00a0failing to secure 2.7 billion records of individuals whose data it had harvested.

The compromise is massive, including sensitive location data that tracks precise smartphone movements, customer information and even internal infrastructure, according to a\u00a0404 Media report.",

It is baffling how companies that collect and sell user data (a practice that arguably shouldn\u2019t be allowed in the first place) failed to protect it from being leaked.",

      "This data breach highlights the serious security flaws in the location data industry. Companies like Gravy Analytics and Venntel have been profiting from collecting and selling sensitive location data, often without proper user consent. They've prioritized profit over security, and now the privacy of millions is at risk. This data could end up on black markets, endangering individuals, especially those in vulnerable situations, by making them targets for harassment or worse.",

      "The Gravy Analytics breach serves as a sobering reminder of the vulnerabilities in the digital age. While it\u2019s impossible to control how every company handles data, you can take steps to minimize your exposure and protect your privacy. Here are five actionable tips to stay safe.",
      "1) Limit app permissions: Many apps request access to location data, contacts and more, even when it's not necessary for their functionality. Regularly review the permissions for apps on your smartphone and revoke access to anything that feels excessive. For instance, a weather app doesn\u2019t need access to your microphone or camera.",
      "2) Use a VPN:\u00a0Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your IP address and encrypt your internet activity, making it harder for data brokers and hackers to track your online behavior. A good VPN adds an extra layer of security, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Opt out of data sharing where possible:\u00a0Some companies allow you to opt out of having your data collected or shared. Services like Your Ad Choices and privacy settings within platforms like Google can help you reduce the amount of data collected. Check for opt-out options with any apps or services you use frequently.",
      "4)\u00a0Avoid free apps that monetize data: Free apps often generate revenue by selling user data. Instead, consider paid versions of apps that explicitly prioritize privacy. Research the company behind the app to understand its data handling policies before downloading.",

      "Companies that collect and sell user data pose a significant threat to privacy, and when they fail to protect this data, it often ends up in the hands of even worse actors. Cybercriminals, and even some governments, can exploit this information to target individuals. It is crucial to implement stringent repercussions for these companies when they fail in their duty to safeguard user data. A mere slap on the wrist is not enough.

      "13) Try out the new Passwords app",
      "I always stress the importance of using a password manager to store your passwords. Let\u2019s be honest, we all have a ton of apps and services that require an account and password. If you use the same password everywhere, you risk having your important info stolen by cybercriminals. But it\u2019s also impossible to come up with a unique password for every app and remember them all.",
      "Password managers make life easier by storing your passwords and filling them in when you log into apps. But they usually charge a monthly or yearly fee. That\u2019s where Apple\u2019s Passwords app comes in. It works just like a password manager but without the extra cost. Open the app from the App Library, and it\u2019ll keep your login details encrypted and synced across all your devices.",
      "While Apple's new Passwords app in iOS 18 offers a convenient and cost-free solution for password management, it's important to consider its limitations. These include its exclusivity to the Apple ecosystem, lack of compatibility with Android or Linux devices and limited functionality outside of Safari and Apple apps. For those seeking a more comprehensive password management solution that works across various browsers and apps, check out my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "German automaker Volkswagen isn't having a great time. The company is planning to cut capacity at five factories, reducing production by about 700,000 vehicles, while also laying off more than 35,000 workers in its home country. Now, reports suggest the company had a massive data leak at its subsidiary software company Cariad, which exposed personal data, including geolocation data, of around 800,000 EV owners online and accessible for months. Such information could be valuable to criminals for extortion purposes. What's interesting is that a hacker association informed the company about this data leak after receiving a tip from an anonymous hacker.",

      "What you need to know about the data leak",
      "As reported by Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel magazine, Volkswagen is facing a major data security issue after movement data from 800,000 electric cars and the personal contact information of their owners were left exposed on the internet. This data revealed sensitive details, such as the precise locations where cars were parked, including private locations like people\u2019s homes, government buildings and even questionable spots like brothels.",
      "The exposed data includes detailed movement patterns of these vehicles, allowing for the creation of comprehensive profiles of individuals' daily activities. This could be particularly concerning for public figures or anyone with privacy concerns.",
      "Several car brands under the Volkswagen group, including VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda, were affected by the breach, which exposed sensitive data across multiple countries. The information was stored on Amazon cloud servers without adequate protection, leaving it vulnerable for months before the issue was discovered.",
      "For around 466,000 of the 800,000 affected vehicles, the location data was detailed enough to map out drivers\u2019 daily routines. Spiegel reported that the list of affected users included German politicians, business leaders, the entire EV fleet used by Hamburg police and even suspected intelligence agents.",
      "The breach came to light when an anonymous hacker tipped off the Chaos Computer Club. While Volkswagen left the data easily accessible during this time, there is no indication so far that anyone misused or accessed it maliciously.",
      "We reached out to Volkswagen for comment but did not hear back by our deadline.",

      "How can this data leak affect you?",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is more than just a tech issue. It is a real concern for anyone who values their privacy. With precise location data out in the open, someone could figure out where you live, work or spend your free time. This information could be misused in many ways, from targeted scams where hackers pretend to be Volkswagen or its partners to trick you into giving up sensitive information, to more personal threats like stalking or harassment.",
      "Imagine someone knowing your daily routine or identifying places you visit that you would prefer to keep private. Visits to clinics, legal offices or other sensitive locations could expose you to embarrassment or blackmail.",
      "The breach also raises concerns for business leaders, government officials and military personnel as their movements linked to high-security or restricted areas could be exposed, increasing the risk of corporate espionage or national security threats. Moreover, when paired with other vulnerabilities, such as app credentials, hackers could potentially exploit the data to unlock or even control vehicles remotely.",

      "1) Check your app settings:\u00a0Review the permissions and data-sharing settings in your car's companion app. Disable features that track or share your location if they are not essential for your use. Regularly update the app to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "2) Be alert to scams:\u00a0Keep an eye out for suspicious emails, messages or calls pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. Avoid clicking on links or sharing sensitive information without verifying the sender.",
      "3) Consider data opt-out options:\u00a0Many vehicles with online features allow you to limit or disable certain data-sharing functionalities. Check your car\u2019s settings to reduce the amount of personal data being collected.",
      "4) Strengthen your online accounts:\u00a0If you use the same email or password across multiple accounts, update them immediately. Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "5) Beware of snail mail scams: While most people focus on digital threats, physical mail scams can also follow a data breach like this. If your contact information was exposed, you might receive fraudulent letters pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. These could ask for payments, personal details or even encourage you to visit fake websites.",
      "6) Install strong antivirus software: Ensure that you have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices, especially those connected to your vehicle or its apps. This can help protect you from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is a glaring example of how companies need to take user data security more seriously. Exposing personal details and precise locations is not just a technical mistake. It is a massive breach of trust. While VW has patched the issue, the damage shows how important it is for businesses to be more responsible with the data they collect. People deserve to know their information is safe and used only when necessary. If companies cannot protect their customers\u2019 privacy, they risk losing their confidence altogether. It is time for the industry to step up and do better.",

It works like spyware, keeping an eye on what you do on your Android phone, such as reading your notifications, messages, clipboard content and more.",
      "Hackers are spreading FireScam by pretending it\u2019s a premium version of Telegram. They\u2019ve created a fake website on GitHub that looks like RuStore (a real app store in Russia). When people visit this fake site, they\u2019re tricked into downloading an app that looks like \"Telegram Premium.\" However, this app is actually a trap. Once installed, it downloads the FireScam malware onto your device and starts stealing your personal data.",
      "To avoid detection, the app is heavily disguised using a tool called DexGuard. It asks for permissions to access your storage, check installed apps and install more software. When you open the app, it shows a fake login page that looks like Telegram\u2019s. If you enter your details, it steals your credentials.",
      "The stolen data is first stored in a Firebase Realtime Database, but hackers later move it to private servers. The malware also registers each compromised device with a unique ID so hackers can keep track of their victims.",

      "6 ways to stay safe from fake apps",
      "1. Download apps only from official stores:\u00a0Always use trusted app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store to download apps. These platforms have security measures to detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites, pop-up ads or unofficial third-party stores as these are common sources of fake apps.",
      "2. Verify the app\u2019s developer:\u00a0Before installing an app, check who created it. Look at the developer's name and ensure it matches the official company behind the app. Fake apps often copy the names of popular apps but use slightly altered spellings or extra characters. For example, a fake might be called \"PayPaal\" instead of \"PayPal.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Pay attention to reviews and ratings:\u00a0Reviews and ratings can give you insight into an app's authenticity. If an app has mostly negative reviews, very few downloads or generic comments like \"Great app,\" it could be fake. Genuine apps typically have a large number of detailed reviews over time. Be cautious of apps with five-star ratings but no specific feedback.",
      "4. Be cautious of app permissions:\u00a0Check the permissions the app requests before installing. A flashlight app, for example, shouldn\u2019t need access to your contacts or messages. If an app is asking for permissions that don\u2019t align with its purpose, it could be a red flag. Always deny permissions that seem excessive or unnecessary.",
      "5. Keep your phone and apps updated:\u00a0Regular updates for your operating system and apps often include important security fixes that protect your device from malware. Turning on automatic updates can ensure you always have the latest protections.",
      "6. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install strong antivirus software on your Android. These tools can scan apps for malware, detect suspicious activity and block harmful downloads. Strong antivirus software provides an extra layer of defense, especially when browsing or downloading apps. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "The FireScam malware is a powerful tool that can steal everything on your phone, and it\u2019s tough to detect if you're not careful. Such apps can\u2019t be distributed through legitimate app stores like the Play Store or the App Store, so they rely on third-party stores and fake websites to spread. To stay safe, the best approach is to stick to verified app stores and avoid downloading from untrustworthy sources.",

Once the water reaches the surface, it is evaporated by solar-heated plasmonic materials. As the water vapor rises, the salt is left behind, ensuring that only purified water is collected. The vapor then recondenses on a clear plastic dome situated above the device. Finally, the purified water is funneled down the sides of the dome and collected in a sealed bag for easy access.",

      "Weeks earlier, on Nov. 15, Canales was arrested for an alleged gang-related armed robbery in Seattle. He was released without bail on Dec. 2 by Galvan despite objections from the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office and was awaiting trial when he allegedly mutilated the 14-year-old.",
      "\"Please understand the Rules of Ethics prohibit the Court from commenting on any specific case. If you would like, you may request a copy of the recordings of the hearings via the Clerk\u2019s Office,\" Galvan's bailiff, Sonam Lata, told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"She does not believe, especially when it comes to youth offenders, that jail works. It's not a disincentive. It doesn't change behaviors,\" Rantz told Fox News Digital. \"The problem, of course, is that it can't just be seen through the lens of wanting to reform. It's also about protecting the public every single day that someone who's dangerous isn't behind bars where they belong is another day when they can commit a felony and create another victim.",
      "\"And unfortunately, with this judge, we're seeing that happen over and over and over again with the folks that have stood before her and gotten a slap on the wrist, if that,\" Rantz continued.",

Prosecutors argued that the teens should be held behind bars for the safety of the community, KOMO News reported. However, Galvan said she wanted to see if the teens could turn things around through community support programs.",
      "\"We\u2019ve detained people for years, years, and crime is still here. Children are still committing inappropriate things, we still have behaviors that are concerning,\" she said, according to the outlet. \"This is going to take a lot more than just throwing people in and locking them up without a key.\"",
      "Rantz said that Galvan's behavior on the bench is \"a perfect example of what happens when you take your ideology, and you make it a part of your job, where you view decisions you make through a very specific social, justice focused ideological lens.\"",
      "Moreover, he said, Galvan is not the only soft-on-crime judge to regularly release suspects who have gone on to commit more grievous offenses.",
      "\"I have a basic rule on my radio show that when covering any of these kinds of stories: if I remember the name of the judge, it's almost never for the right reasons,\" Rantz said. \"It's always because of the soft on crime policies that they've enforced and have adopted. And I recognize a lot of the names of judges. Unfortunately, that's because a lot of these judges are making boneheaded, dangerous decisions that are putting dangerous people back out on the streets.\"",

      "\"It's not just about Veronica Galvan. I could have probably written a similar story on a number of judges, dozens of judges across the state. She just happened to be on a very high profile case that caught my attention,\" Rantz said.",
      "Both Seattle and Washington state have been \"living the consequences\" of progressive court rulings,\" he said.",

      "On the 350-mile drive from Houston to the Big Easy, Jabbar recorded selfie videos declaring his allegiance to ISIS and saying he initially planned to kill his own friends and family but decided on attacking innocent members of the public in order to attract more attention to what he called a \"war between the believers and the disbelievers,\" according to the FBI.",
      "He was a U.S. Army veteran and had a lucrative job at a major consulting firm, but he brought a pair of IEDs and two firearms with him to attack civilians \u2014 allegedly radicalized in just weeks.

      "\"ISIS and others are back,\" James Jay Carafano, an expert on national security and foreign policy, warned in a recent Fox News op-ed. \"Biden's humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan reignited the hope that America really was the paper tiger that Usama Bin Laden claimed we were.\"",

      "Although the shockingly violent group's \"territorial caliphate\" was destroyed during the first Trump administration, its propagandists continue to encourage and radicalize potential terrorists. Jabbar, in one of his videos, declared that he had \"joined ISIS before this summer,\" FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia told reporters in a news briefing.",
      "\"The threats from international terrorism, domestic terrorism, and state-sponsored terrorism are complex and persistent \u2014 and notably, they are all simultaneously elevated,\" Raia said. \"We continually face threats from foreign terrorist organizations, violent extremists across the ideological spectrum, and criminal actors that aim to bring violence to the United States.\"",

      "\"[Jabbar] appears to have been inspired \u2014 from afar \u2014 by ISIS, and it is, in many ways, the most challenging type of terrorist threat we face,\" Wray told the interviewer, Scott Pelley. \"You're talking about guys like this, who radicalize not in years but in weeks, and whose method of attack is still very deadly but fairly crude. And if you think about that old saying about connecting the dots, there are not a lot of dots out there to connect. And there's very little time in which to connect them.\"",

      "Rescue workers assist an illegal miner who has been trapped deep in an abandoned gold mine for months, in Stilfontein, South Africa, Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Themba Hadebe)",
      "Authorities, who removed the ropes and pulley system miners used to enter and to lower supplies, say the survivors are able to come out but refuse to because of fear of arrest. That has been disputed by the civic groups, which won a court case to force authorities to allow food, water and medicine to be sent down to the miners. But they say the supplies aren\u2019t enough and many of the miners are dying of starvation and unable to climb out because the shaft is too steep.",
      "Residents desperately waiting for news of family members gathered at the mine Tuesday near the town of Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg, some holding placards criticizing authorities for their response. One sign said there had been a \"Sacrifice at Stilfontein\" while some handcuffed survivors were led away in a line by police.",
      "The community organized its own rescue operation on Friday before the official effort by authorities began Monday. They say a proper rescue operation should have been launched months ago.",
      "\"We are happy that this operation is happening, even though we believe that if it was done earlier, we wouldn\u2019t even have one dead person,\" said Mzukisi Jam, the regional chairperson of the South African National Civics Organization, an umbrella for civic and rights groups.",
      "Authorities have grappled with informal mining for years",
      "Illegal mining is common in parts of gold-rich South Africa where companies close down mines that are no longer profitable, leaving groups of informal miners to enter them illegally in a search for leftover deposits.",
      "Large groups of miners often go underground for months to maximize their profits, taking food, water, generators and other equipment with them, but also relying on others in their group on the surface to send down more supplies.",
      "Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe visited the site Tuesday and said that more than 1,500 miners who resurfaced from the Buffelsfontein mine have been arrested since authorities began a larger crackdown on illegal mining in late 2023. He said the vast majority were foreign nationals from neighboring countries.",
      "Police have also doubled down on their assertion that the miners who are still underground aren't coming out because they are afraid of being arrested.",
      "Activists said the only way out is for miners to make a dangerous trek to another shaft, which can take days, and crawl out there, but many are too weak or ill to climb out. The mine is 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) deep with multiple shafts, many levels and a maze of tunnels. The group representing the miners said there are numerous groups in various parts of the mine.",
      "\"The last time I spoke to my brother was in July, when he told us that he is going underground,\" said Zinzi Tom, a sister of one of the miners who remained underground. \"We had not heard anything from him, but yesterday one of the miners who surfaced said he saw him about two weeks ago. Apparently he is very sick and he is struggling to survive.\"",
      "Cellphone videos emerge from underground",
      "The Mining Affected Communities United in Action group, which took authorities to court in December to force them to allow supplies to be sent down to the miners, released two cellphone videos that they said were from underground and showed dozens of dead bodies of miners wrapped in plastic. A spokesman for the group said \"a minimum\" of 100 miners had died.",
      "The cellphone videos purportedly from the depths of the mine are filmed by a man who can be heard saying, \"This is hunger. People are dying because of hunger,\" as he records emaciated-looking men sitting on the damp floor of the mine. He adds: \"Please help us. Bring us food or take us out.\"",
      "The rescue operation will go on for 10 days and authorities would then reassess, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu said. Police also said that the survivors who had been brought to the surface will be arrested and charged with illegal mining and trespassing after receiving medical attention.",
      "Authorities made clear their approach when South African Cabinet Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told reporters in November that the government would not help the miners, who they consider criminals.",

India and Pakistan are long-standing rivals, having fought three wars over Kashmir since both countries gained independence in 1947.

The weakening of Iran, due to conflicts in the Middle East and internal issues, has diminished its influence over the Taliban. At the same time, Russia, one of India's closest allies, is moving toward recognizing the Taliban government in Afghanistan, even calling the group a partner in combating terrorism.

      "Over about the next six weeks, Hindu pilgrims will gather at the confluence of three sacred rivers \u2014 the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati \u2014 where they will take part in elaborate rituals, hoping to begin a journey to achieve Hindu philosophy\u2019s ultimate goal: the release from the cycle of rebirth.",

      "Hindus venerate rivers, and none more so than the Ganges and the Yamuna. The faithful believe that a dip in their waters will cleanse them of their past sins and end their process of reincarnation, particularly on auspicious days. The most propitious of these days occur in cycles of 12 years during a festival called the Maha Kumbh Mela, or pitcher festival.",

      "The festival is a series of ritual baths by Hindu sadhus, or holy men, and other pilgrims at the confluence of three sacred rivers that dates to at least medieval times. Hindus believe that the mythical Saraswati river once flowed from the Himalayas through Prayagraj, meeting there with the Ganges and the Yamuna.",
      "Bathing takes place every day, but on the most auspicious dates, naked, ash-smeared monks charge toward the holy rivers at dawn. Many pilgrims stay for the entire festival, observing austerity, giving alms and bathing at sunrise every day.",
      "\"We feel peaceful here and attain salvation from the cycles of life and death,\" said Bhagwat Prasad Tiwari, a pilgrim.",
      "The festival has its roots in a Hindu tradition that says the god Vishnu wrested a golden pitcher containing the nectar of immortality from demons.

A smaller version of the festival, called Ardh Kumbh, or Half Kumbh, was organized in 2019, when 240 million visitors were recorded, with about 50 million taking a ritual bath on the busiest day.",

      "At least 400 million people \u2014 more than the population of the United States \u2014 are expected in Prayagraj over the next 45 days, according to officials. That is around 200 times the 2 million pilgrims that arrived in the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage last year.",

But under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the festival has become an integral part of its advocacy of Hindu nationalism.

      "Blinken made his rulings, he stated, because \"the RSF and RSF-aligned militias have continued to direct attacks against civilians, have systematically murdered men and boys\u2014even infants\u2014on an ethnic basis, and (have) deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.\"",
      "The Secretary continued,\u00a0\"Those same militias have targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.\"",
      "Blinken added that the African nation is suffering through \"a conflict of unmitigated brutality that has resulted in the world\u2019s largest humanitarian catastrophe, leaving 638,000 Sudanese experiencing the worst famine in Sudan\u2019s recent history, over 30 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, and tens of thousands dead.\"",
      "Risch has held out that the situation in Sudan has been catastrophic for well over a year, and called into question the timing of Blinken\u2019s declaration. In a statement earlier this week, he wrote, \"It has been nearly a year since I introduced a resolution calling the atrocities in Sudan what they are: a genocide. Additionally, I first called for Global Magnitsky sanctions to be imposed against the RSF and Hemedti 263 days ago \u2013 and yet these sanctions still have not been leveraged.\"",

The U.S. already had sanctioned five RSF leaders, including two of Hemedti\u2019s brothers. We also determined in December 2023 that members of the RSF committed ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

      "Salem points to the broader shift in regional politics, notably the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, which has left Hezbollah increasingly isolated. \"They are now not only cut off from Iran, but they're also isolated in the region. They're the only Shiite community between here and Basra, and it\u2019s a Sunni takeover of Damascus, which used to be dominated by a friendly Alawite, pro-Iranian regime. It\u2019s a huge historic shift that leaves the Shiites and Hezbollah deeply isolated. Hezbollah\u2019s future is worse than its present,\" he added.",
      "The U.S. and Israel, along with other Western and Arab powers, have long sought to distance Lebanon from Hezbollah\u2019s influence, and Aoun\u2019s election could be a step in that direction.",
      "Aoun, a Maronite Christian and the commander of the Lebanese army, took office with a strong message focused on Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. In his inaugural speech, he emphasized the necessity for the state to have a monopoly on the use of force.",
      "David Schenker, former head of the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs at the U.S. State Department under the first Trump administration, remarked that Aoun\u2019s speech was both a positive and pragmatic step for Lebanon. \"He talked about disarming all groups and ensuring that weapons are under the control of the state,\" Schenker said. \"This was a good move, as it shows a commitment to sovereignty and the rule of law.\"",

      "An updated graphic detailing the members of Hezbollah's leadership who have been eliminated by the Israeli Defense Forces. (IDF Spokesman's Unit)",
      "However, Schenker, who is currently the Taube Senior Fellow at The Washington Institute and director of the Linda and Tony Rubin Program on Arab Politics, cautioned that Aoun\u2019s position as president does not grant him absolute power in Lebanon\u2019s political system. \"The president is not the most powerful position in Lebanon. The key position will be the prime minister. It remains to be seen whether Aoun will show the same courage in his new role that he demonstrated as chief of staff,\" Schenker noted.",
      "Though Hezbollah has been militarily weakened by recent Israeli campaigns and the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah, among other key leaders, it still retains significant influence, particularly in southern Lebanon. However, Schenker says the organization\u2019s ability to intimidate Lebanon\u2019s population is diminishing. \"Hezbollah isn\u2019t the force it was. It can still reactivate its killing machine if needed, but it no longer dominates the way it did before,\" he said.",
      "\"Hezbollah has calculated that they\u2019ve lost this battle against Israel, and then they lost another battle in Syria. So their interest now is to lay low, have a president and government that\u2019s acceptable to the U.S. and the region, which, at the end of the day, they hope will protect them from any further Israeli incursions and help their people,\" Salem explained. \"They need a functioning government to secure international aid for the millions displaced by their actions in southern Lebanon. It\u2019s about survival for them, not just politically, but financially.\"",

      "Aoun\u2019s election is not only significant for Hezbollah\u2019s position in Lebanon, but also for the country\u2019s relations with external powers like the U.S. and Israel. Lebanon has faced economic collapse, with its currency devalued by over 99%, and nearly 80% of the population now living below the poverty line. Hezbollah\u2019s previous resistance to international pressure now seems less tenable.",
      "The U.S. has long supported Lebanon\u2019s military and is expected to strengthen its ties with Aoun, given his role in the army and his pro-sovereignty stance. Schenker said that Lebanon\u2019s future alignment with the U.S. and regional allies such as Saudi Arabia could provide the country with much-needed international support.",

      "\"The U.S. military has been close to the Lebanese military for many years,\" Salem told Fox News Digital. \"That has been the strongest link between the U.S. and Lebanon. So to have the head of the military come to power, he\u2019s a known figure in Washington. He\u2019s known to the military, and now, he\u2019s known to the diplomats and politicians, and will be known to President Trump and others over time. This realignment could put Lebanon on a much more natural path of cooperation with the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and other regional allies.\"",
      "Israel will also be closely monitoring Aoun\u2019s presidency. Schenker said that Aoun\u2019s commitment to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for disarmament in southern Lebanon, could lead to a more cooperative stance from Lebanon toward Israel. \"Israel will be invested in Lebanon\u2019s implementation of 1701,\" Schenker said. \"Aoun\u2019s stance will influence Israel\u2019s position toward Lebanon, as the Trump administration has clearly signaled a desire to end the wars in the region.\"",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Aides to Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said she was detained Thursday, followed moments later by official denials, in a confusing episode that capped a day of protests seeking to block President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from clinging to power.",
      "It's not clear exactly what transpired after Machado bid farewell to hundreds of supporters, hopped on a motorcycle and raced with her security convoy through the empty streets of eastern Caracas to an undisclosed location.",
      "At 3:21 p.m. local time, Machado\u2019s press team said in a social media post that security forces \"violently intercepted\" her convoy. Her aides later confirmed to The Associated Press that the opposition hardliner had been detained, and international condemnation immediately poured from leaders in Latin America and beyond demanding her release.",
      "But about an hour later, a 20-second video of Machado was posted online by a Maduro supporter in which the opposition leader said she was followed after leaving the rally and that she had dropped her purse. \"I'm good, I'm safe,\" Machado said in a raspy voice, adding \"Venezuela will be free.\"",
      "THOUSANDS OF VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS TAKE TO THE STREETS AHEAD OF MADURO'S THIRD INAUGURATION",
      "Her aides later said in a social media post that the proof-of-of-life video message had been coerced, and that after recording it she was freed. They said she would provide details of her \"kidnapping\" later.",
      "Meanwhile, Maduro supporters denied that she was detained and gloated that government opponents were trying to spread fake news to generate an international crisis. \"Nobody should be surprised,\" Communications Minister Freddy Nanez said. \"Especially since it's coming from the fascists, who were the architects of the dirty trick.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, Machado addressed hundreds of supporters who heeded her call to take to the streets a day before the ruling party-controlled National Assembly was scheduled to swear in Maduro to a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost the presidential election.",
      "\"They wanted us to fight each other, but Venezuela is united, we are not afraid,\" Machado shouted from atop a truck in the capital minutes before she was reported detained.",
      "Machado, 57, is a hardliner former lawmaker who stayed and fought against Maduro even after many of her allies in the opposition leadership fled, joining an exodus of some 7 million Venezuelans who\u2019ve abandoned their homeland in recent years.",
      "Loyalists who control the country's judiciary banned her from running against Maduro last year. In a deft move, she backed an unknown outsider \u2014 retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez \u2014 who crushed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin, according to voting machine records collected by the opposition and validated by international observers.",

      "Gonz\u00e1lez, invoking the title of president-elect recognized by the U.S. and other countries, was among those who demanded Machado's release in the immediate aftermath of what was believed to be her shock arrest.",
      "\"To the security forces, I warn you: don't play with fire,\" he said in a social media post from the Dominican Republic, where he met with President Luis Abinader and a delegation of former presidents from across Latin America.",
      "There was a relatively small turnout for Thursday's protests as riot police were deployed in force. Venezuelans who\u2019ve witnessed Maduro\u2019s security forces round up scores of opponents and regular bystanders since the July election were reluctant to mobilize in the same numbers as they have in the past.",
      "\"Of course, there\u2019s fewer people,\" said empanada vendor Miguel Contrera as National Guard soldiers carrying riot shields buzzed by on motorcycles. \"There\u2019s fear.\"",
      "Those demonstrators that did show up blocked a main avenue in one opposition stronghold. Many were senior citizens and dressed in red, yellow and blue, answering Machado\u2019s call to wear the colors of the Venezuelan flag. All repudiated Maduro and said they would recognize Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president.",
      "The deployment of security forces as well as pro-government armed groups known as \"colectivos\" to intimidate opponents betrays a deep insecurity on the part of Maduro, said Javier Corrales, a Latin America expert at Amherst College.",
      "Since the elections, the government has arrested more than 2,000 people \u2014 including as many as 10 Americans and other foreigners \u2014 who it claims have been plotting to oust Maduro and sow chaos in the oil rich South American nation. This week alone, masked gunmen arrested a former presidential candidate, a prominent free speech activist and even Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s son-in-law as he was taking his young children to school.",
      "\"It\u2019s an impressive show of force but it\u2019s also a sign of weakness,\" said Corrales, who co-authored this month an article, \"How Maduro Stole Venezuela\u2019s Vote,\" in the Journal of Democracy.",
      "\"Maduro is safe in office,\" said Corrales, \"but he and his allies recognize they are moving forward with a big lie and have no other way to justify what they are doing except by relying on the military.\"",
      "Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, also stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner of the election. But unlike in previous contests, authorities did not provide any access to voting records or precinct-level results.",

    "title": "Investigators comb a scorched slope to solve a mystery: How did the Palisades Fire start?",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 02:18:11 GMT",
    "summary": "The ATF's probe into the Palisades Fire is focusing on potential human causes, which could include arson, fireworks, unauthorized camping or a rekindling of an earlier fire, sources said.",
    "story": [
      "One week after the Palisades Fire rushed down a mountainside, swallowing whole communities and killing at least eight people, its cause remains unknown.",
      "The answers, when they emerge, will most likely be found on a scorched and blackened ridgeline in western Los Angeles overlooking a Pacific Palisades neighborhood that includes a popular hiking trail \u2014 an area that was also the scene of a small fire six days earlier.",
      "Understanding the catastrophic Jan. 7 fire could take months, a process that began with investigators collecting videos and photographs from nearby homes and social media, interviewing witnesses and firefighters and examining 911 calls, looking for leads.",
      "\u201cAll of this is going to take time,\u201d Jose Medina, acting special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2019 Los Angeles office, said at a news conference Tuesday. He said there were 75 federal and local investigators on the case. \u201cWe know everyone wants answers, and the community deserves answers. ATF will give you those answers, but it will be once we complete a thorough investigation. We have no timeline on when this will occur.\u201d",
      "Investigators haven\u2019t reached any conclusions, though an early focus of the probe has been on potential human causes, according to multiple law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation. The possibilities include\u00a0arson, an accidental spark, fireworks, unauthorized camping activity or a rekindling of an earlier fire extinguished on New Year\u2019s Day, the sources said.",
      "The probe has led investigators into the ash-covered area where the fire was first spotted, hunting for the smallest of clues.",
      "Windblown wildland fires like the Palisades Fire leave \u201cmovement patterns\u201d on the plants, trees, grass, rocks and other objects that, to a trained eye, reveal how the flames spread. Marking those signs, the investigators work backward to the suspected start point.",
      "\u201cIf you understand how to read those patterns, it becomes quickly evident where the origin of the fire is,\u201d said Ed Nordskog, a retired Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s fire investigator, who isn\u2019t involved in the Palisades Fire probe.",
      "Investigators try to narrow their search down to an area of about 25 square feet, then turn the spot into a grid of zones about 4 square feet each, Nordskog said. Using magnets, metal detectors and magnifying lenses, they sift for tiny objects \u2014 like fragments of molten machinery parts, a match head, glass, remnants of fireworks \u2014\u00a0 that might explain or rule out a potential cause. They may bring in a dog trained to sniff out traces of accelerants. Nearby electrical equipment, like fences or poles, or signs of gas-powered vehicles also guide them. All the while, other investigators talk to witnesses who may have seen something suspicious.",
      "The ATF\u2019s National Response Team is leading a joint investigation with local authorities of the Palisades Fire, as well as other fires that ignited last week across Los Angeles County and, fed by high winds, ripped through mountainsides and neighborhoods, destroying more than 12,000 structures, consuming more than 40,000 acres and killing at least 25 people. Some of the fires are still burning.",
      "The Palisades Fire, which is the largest, could be the most difficult to explain because of the myriad of potential factors, which investigators will have to eliminate on their way to determining a cause.",
      "The theory that the Jan. 1 fire was responsible has drawn the most public speculation.",
      "That brush fire ignited in the area of the ridgeline sometime after midnight, spotted by residents of the nearby Palisades Highlands neighborhood, which is part of Pacific Palisades. Firefighters put it out, and before 5 a.m. it was deemed contained with no structures damaged and no one hurt. The city fire department didn\u2019t report what caused it.",
      "The fire was largely forgotten until six days later.",
      "Around 8:20 a.m. Jan. 7, Darrin Hurwitz set out on his regular hike up a mountainside trail near his home in the Marquez Knolls neighborhood. It was very windy \u2014\u00a0authorities had already issued an alert that the gusty conditions put Los Angeles at high risk for fires.",
      "An hour into the hike, as he passed a boulder known as Skull Rock, he said, he noticed a swath of charred vegetation and caught a whiff of smoke. Remembering the New Year\u2019s Day fire, Hurwitz said, he didn\u2019t think much of it, assuming that the smell was left over from it \u2014 or that he was detecting fires burning somewhere else far away.",
      "Hurwitz, 49, a lawyer, said he stopped about a couple hundred feet from the burn scar and didn\u2019t see any smoke or anything else remarkable. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough to think there was anything suspicious,\u201d he said. Hours later, his family escaped the fire as it swept through the neighborhood, but their house was destroyed.",
      "By midmorning, a group of trail runners saw flames and smoke near Skull Rock and raced away, taking pictures and videos as they escaped to safety. Residents of Palisades Highlands reported seeing the growing fire from their homes around 10:30 a.m.",
      "Having two fires in roughly the same area six days apart has fueled speculation that the Palisades Fire was triggered by a rekindling of the earlier one. But experts are divided over whether that is a viable explanation. A 2023 wildfire that destroyed the town of Lahaina on the Hawaiian island of Maui was found to have been the result of a rekindling of a smaller fire, though just a few hours separated those fires.",
      "For days or weeks after a fire, embers can lodge somewhere and remain hot \u2014\u00a0and the roots of trees can burn underground, Nordskog said. This effect is often seen in mountainous forests, and it isn\u2019t common on the coastal brush of the type at Pacific Palisades, he said. But it is possible, he said.",
      "Scott Sweetow, a former ATF fire investigator, said he doubted that happened in this case.",
      "The relatively light vegetation of the Pacific Palisades landscape and the stretch of six days before the second fire ignited made rekindling \u201cunbelievably improbable,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Just weeks ago, the 9ThirtyLA venue in downtown's Arts District was known as a trendy spot for events, its wooden beams and concrete floors serving as the perfect backdrop for concerts, corporate parties and more.",
      "But after fires began to devastate the Los Angeles region, community organizers and a wave of volunteers turned an industrial venue into a makeshift refuge, with beds and tables filled with everyday essentials, like hygiene products and clothing. With help from local organizations (LoveChild Hospitality, the ANE Foundation, ImpactLA and the AFTP Foundation), the venue has become one of the countless set up across the region to help wildfire evacuees cope with the devastation.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s been beautiful is that our community has offered so much that we now have this full warehouse of things that could be a great starting point for somebody who just lost everything,\u201d said Waseel Amoura, an organizer at the 9ThirtyLA venue.",
      "Feeling helpless about the devastating natural disaster that has\u00a0killed at least 24 people\u00a0and\u00a0swept through 40,000 acres\u00a0in the Greater Los Angeles area, many Angelenos like Amoura have rushed to help those in need.",
      "In every pocket of the region, people have been organizing drives for essential and nonessential items, collaborating with nonprofit groups that have served the area for years and turning community spaces (like local YMCAs) and massive venues (like Santa Anita Park) into donation centers lined with seemingly endless piles and boxes of donations to be sorted. Some have organized food drives to deliver fresh meals and snacks to first responders and evacuees. Others have mobilized to make care packages for those in need. Animal shelters and rescue organizations have also been inundated with donations and volunteers to help support the influx of animals taken in during the wildfires. And restaurants have continued to offer free meals to first responders, with some also organizing their own donation drives.",
      "It has been a widespread effort, fueled by social media, that has not one clear leader but many \u2014 from celebrities and influencers to normal folks, all walks of life have come together to support the city and the region they call home.",
      "Across Los Angeles County, people have been amplifying fundraising campaigns from wildfire survivors by resharing posts from organizations accepting donations and volunteers. Many have circulated a regularly updated master spreadsheet of volunteer opportunities that was created by the\u00a0Mutual Aid Los Angeles Network, which shares mutual aid efforts and resources. Another popular spreadsheet created by an online user has also been put online, with similar updates. As people flocked to help, the \u201cVolunteers Needed\u201d label at many such locations have quickly flipped to \u201cFULL TODAY.\u201d",
      "Adrienne Nicole Edwards, founder of the homeless outreach organization ANE Foundation, said volunteer professionals are on call to give services such as haircuts and therapy, while real estate agents are also flying in from New York to help people navigate their newfound housing needs.",
      "Local real estate agents have also been posting on social media, helping those who have lost their homes find new spaces to rent and working to help supply them with furniture as they land on their feet.",
      "On Monday at 9ThirtyLA, dozens of volunteers crowded the trailer door of a U-Haul truck that just arrived, packed to the brim with boxes of donations for evacuees. Box by box, they unloaded the truck and began categorizing everything from makeup to bedding.",
      "In the shelter area, mattresses are fitted with fresh seats, with unopened sets of bedding resting on top. The facility is also stocked with hot meals from local restaurants, and a refrigerator is available to keep medications cold.",
      "\u201cI just try to make it comfortable. You have to give people their space, plus you have to make room for their personal stuff,\u201d Edwards said, adding: \u201cWe have pallets of brand-new sheets so people can take their choice. Some people prefer a certain color scheme. So we just want to give people that feeling of normalcy again.\u201d",
      "Across Los Angeles County in Altadena, where the Eaton Fire has heavily affected the community, many grassroots relief efforts were also underway. One of the biggest endeavors was organized by a 14-year-old middle school student named Avery Colvert, who started \"Altadena Girls\" to help collect beauty and hair care products for affected teen girls in the area.",
      "Within days, her organization gained viral traction, with celebrities like Paris Hilton and Charli XCX sharing the campaign and visitors like James Charles coming to help volunteer. In a social media post Monday showcasing bins and bags of donations piled on the street outside the donation site, Altadena Girls announced that it was \u201cbeyond full\u201d with donations.",
      "On Monday, several other locals formed Altadena Teen Boys Fire Recovery, inspired by Colvert.",
      "The organizations have joined other existing community efforts, including the Pasadena Community Job Center, which is enlisting its volunteers to sweep up debris from the streets.",
      "County residents also continue to drop bags of donations into at pop-up locations across the area.",
      "On the Westside of Los Angeles, which was hit hard by the Palisades Fire, wildfire relief drives at locations like the Westchester Family YMCA have laid out stacks of clothing, canned foods and other essentials for evacuees to pick up.",

      "In Lincoln Heights, on the Eastside of Los Angeles, similar efforts were underway at a thrift store operated by the international Catholic volunteer organization St. Vincent de Paul. Volunteers have spent days organizing hauls of donated and buying items for distribution to families affected by the wildfires.",
      "In warehouse and office spaces separate from the main thrift store, volunteers sort collections of items into baskets for recipients. Katti Fernandez, the organization\u2019s director of Vincentian services, said people have been donating everything from curling irons to jewelry to children\u2019s toys and board games.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that it took this tragedy to happen, but the beauty that came out of it is seeing what an amazing community we are of people who want to just help and give to one another,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people from San Bernardino, Orange County \u2014 one of my admins here just took a call from New York. And so there\u2019s a ton of desire to be a part of the effort, and it\u2019s just beautiful.\u201d",
      "Even amid the outpouring of goodwill, some organizers and volunteers say they have noticed damaged or unusable donations coming in, as well. Many online are urging fellow community members to donate only what they would feel comfortable using themselves.",
      "As donation centers quickly fill up, Fernandez said, the most effective way to help may be through financial rather than material contributions, especially as many families will need money to rebuild their homes. But she noted that the relief effort will be a marathon, not a sprint.",
      "\u201cDown the road, they\u2019re going to need furniture. They\u2019re going to need beds, appliances. Children just had Christmas, and they opened up amazing toys that they were so looking forward to,\u201d she said. \u201cThose little comfort items will be needed to make them feel a sense of normalcy.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Westchester Y urged people to continue the volunteering momentum.",

    "story": [
      "One of Los Angeles\u2019 two lesbian bars announced that it would close permanently because of the effect of the wildfires that have devastated the city, while the queer community is rallying to support the remaining lesbian bar.",
      "The Ruby Fruit, a \u201cSapphically inclined\u201d wine bar that opened on Sunset Boulevard in the city\u2019s Silver Lake neighborhood in February 2023, announced Saturday that operating \u201cis no longer possible due to financial impact from the current natural disaster.\u201d",
      "\u201cSadly, along with all the feelings of grief and shock that we have experienced over the last few days, also came this undeniable reality: that running our small business is no longer sustainable,\u201d owners Emily Bielagus and Mara Herbkersman said on social media. \u201cThe hospitality industry functions on a day-by-day basis and right now, as they say \u2014 the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\u201d",
      "The Los Angeles community was immediately sent reeling, with owners of other lesbian bars across the United States asking how they could help in comments on the post.",
      "The owners of The Ruby Fruit did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether they will raise funds to keep the bar open. In an update Tuesday afternoon on Instagram, they said that they would \u201chave more to share soon regarding any hopeful future plans, as well as ways y\u2019all can help,\u201d and that in the meantime, they will amplify the GoFundMe fundraiser they created for their employees.",
      "The city\u2019s other lesbian bar, Honey\u2019s at Star Love, which opened in East Hollywood the same month as The Ruby Fruit, posted on Instagram last week that it would be closed all weekend \u201cout of respect for those impacted by the wildfires in Los Angeles.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, Pearl Bar, a lesbian bar in Houston, created a call to raise money for Honey\u2019s and its staff. The post was shared by bars in San Francisco, New York and Phoenix.",
      "\u201cWe need all lesbians & queers everywhere to unite! @honeys.la had to temporarily close this weekend due to the fires and air quality,\u201d Pearl Bar said in an Instagram post that included information about how people could donate. \u201cA whole weekend closed is 25% of service employees\u2019 income. This disaster could last for a month or longer.\u201d",
      "Julie Mabry, the owner of Pearl Bar, said that she connected with one of the owners of Honey\u2019s, Kate Greenberg, and that Greenberg was hesitant to accept help. Mabry said she told Greenberg about her experiences with multiple hurricanes over the years and a tornado in Houston in May and how they affected her business.",
      "\u201cI was just telling her that maybe they could have some temporary relief for their staff, because they decided to close that weekend to help their community, which I also had a lot of respect for,\u201d Mabry said. \u201cThe concern for them is what\u2019s going to happen after this, because it\u2019s going to take a long time for that city to recover.\u201d",
      "Pearl Bar has been open for 11 years, Mabry said, and she has considered closing twice in the last nine months because of natural disasters. In May, the bar lost electricity for three days after\u00a0a tornado and had to close for three days over a weekend. Then, in July, the bar lost power for a week because of a hurricane. As a result, Mabry said, the bar lost $102,000 in revenue and damage but was able to manage because the city had just celebrated Pride Month in June, which brought in higher-than-usual revenue. She said January and February are some of the slowest months for bars.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s OK to ask for people to help Honey\u2019s, because we don\u2019t want to lose our spaces,\u201d Mabry said.",
      "Greenberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the efforts or whether Honey\u2019s faces the threat of closing.",
      "For decades, lesbian bars nationwide have been declining, with about 20 remaining in 2020, NBC News reported. The Ruby Fruit and Honey\u2019s at Star Love were among more than a dozen Sapphic spaces that opened since then, bringing the total number of lesbian bars nationwide to at least 35, according to another NBC News report last year.",
      "Erica Rose, one of the founders of the Lesbian Bar Project, a fundraising campaign and documentary about the country\u2019s remaining lesbian bars, said Los Angeles didn\u2019t have a dedicated Sapphic space for more than a decade before The Ruby Fruit and Honey\u2019s opened. She added that the two spaces complemented each other, with The Ruby Fruit offering an intimate date experience, while Honey\u2019s feels like a cocktail lounge.",
      "Elina Street, the Lesbian Bar Project\u2019s other co-founder, said: \u201cWhen we lose a space, we lose our culture, and that\u2019s tied to our identity, and we all need our spaces in order to exist. So this is really devastating news, and we really hope that the community can rally together the way they do so beautifully, and that we can find more solutions to create more spaces.\u201d"

      "The couple fled their neighborhood in Altadena last Tuesday night for a friend\u2019s guest house in Toluca Lake. The next day, they bypassed police roadblocks by maneuvering through a back street, passing a burning elementary school, downed power lines and trees and smoldering debris.",
      "When they pulled up to what had been their home, most of it was gone. A part of their Spanish-style house built in 1924 was still on fire. Some of the structure stood, including a wrought iron gate commemorating the life of their son, Justin, who died in 2013 at 16 during swimming practice from idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an undetected heart ailment.",
      "The profound grief the couple experienced nearly 12 years ago suddenly resurfaced.",
      "\u201cIt was like losing Justin all over again because that house was where he grew up and we kept it as a shrine to Justin,\u201d Susan Toler Carr said. \u201cIt was a family home where Justin\u2019s presence was everywhere. There\u2019s nothing like the pain of losing him. But our home was an extension of Justin.\u201d",
      "The couple took most of Justin\u2019s original artwork with them Jan. 7 as smoke and ember clouded the sky. Left behind, though, was so much more, like antiques belonging to Toler Carr\u2019s mother. Her father, Burl Toler, was the first Black referee in the NFL \u2014\u00a0the first Black official in any major sport. A framed jersey he autographed for his daughter hung in Justin\u2019s room. It was destroyed, among many other family heirlooms.",

      "Her voice trailed off.",
      "Justin, an only child, was an artist, athlete, volunteer and scholar. He acted in school plays. \u201cHe was a young Renaissance man,\u201d Carr said.",
      "When Justin was 4, he astonished his parents when he said grace before dinner for the first time, ending it with, \u201cI pray for world peace.\u201d",
      "When he died, Darrell Carr was hospitalized after a mild heart attack. \u201cIt was too much,\u201d he said.",
      "On Wednesday, Carr, a retired photography professor, said he got lightheaded and nearly collapsed when he and his wife saw what was left of their home. It was not the destruction, as much as it was what their home embodied.",
      "\u201cThis was Justin\u2019s home,\u201d Carr said, pausing and apologizing for weeping. He composed himself and compared his feelings to the celebrated sculpture, \u201cMelancholy\u201d by Albert Gy\u00f6rgy, which depicts a man on a bench slumped over with his insides hollowed out.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how I feel: empty, sad, hurt. I don\u2019t really have all the words,\u201d Carr said. \u201cBut that sculpture depicts how I feel. And sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have any hope. After my son died, that\u2019s the way I felt. And now this hits, and that hole in my body just got a little bigger.\u201d",
      "But the Carrs found some solace at the scene of so much heartbreak: Still standing and unscathed was the gate built by one of Carr\u2019s students with the words, \u201cJustin Carr Wants World Peace,\u201d across it and a large butterfly in the center. Justin competed in the butterfly event as a swimmer.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s what Justin would have wanted,\u201d Toler Carr said. \u201cHe cared about people, from a very young age. And everyone knew our house by that gate. It\u2019s amazing it\u2019s still standing.\u201d",

My father taught me that \u2018sometimes you gotta do the hard stuff in order to get through this life.\u2019 I\u2019ve never forgotten it. And I taught Justin that.

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Queen Elizabeth II was not officially informed about the treachery of a senior palace courtier for nearly a decade, newly declassified documents reveal.",
      "Anthony Blunt served as the chief art curator to the royal family, surveying the queen\u2019s pictures, overseeing the paintings in the royal collection and occasionally exhibiting her private treasures to the public. He endeared himself to the queen, so much so that he was given a knighthood \u2014 despite the fact that he had lived a double life as a Soviet spy.",
      "The files, among a trove from the\u00a0intelligence agency MI5\u00a0that were released Tuesday by Britain\u2019s National Archives, shed new light on the Cold War scandal at the heart of the British establishment. The saga has long captivated historians and featured in popular culture, from spy novels to Netflix's \"The Crown.\"",
      "Blunt confessed in 1964 to spying for the Soviet Union as part of the notorious Cambridge Five spy ring during World War II, but the queen would only be told the full story in 1973 \u2014 responding calmly and without surprise, according to the documents. His true identity was eventually exposed to the public by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, speaking in Parliament in 1979.",
      "The security services closely guarded Blunt's identity given his prominent position, with only a few senior officials informed, though the secret may have been known regardless. The queen\u2019s private secretary, Martin Charteris, was told only that MI5 intended to interrogate Blunt due to his close ties with fellow spy Guy Burgess, who fled to the Soviet Union.",
      "In all likelihood, the events \u201ctell us more about the inability of the state to prosecute Blunt\u201d than a concerted effort by MI5 to keep the late queen in the dark, historian Chris Smith, who authored a biography of Cambridge Five spy John Cairncross, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cTo have informed Her Majesty or anyone else for that matter would have been potentially defamatory; it would also have been deemed embarrassing to Her Majesty,\u201d Smith said.",
      "By the time Blunt was revealed to have been a spy, he had also become the consummate establishment figure, \u201cwhich was acutely embarrassing\u201d for the royal family, Smith added.",
      "As such, concealing the information \u201cwould also have allowed the palace to truthfully deny that Her Majesty had any knowledge of Blunt\u2019s espionage activities, shielding her from personal embarrassment.\u201d"

    "summary": "A sudden reversal in plans to move the 76ers' arena to near Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown has left activists breathing a little easier while still feeling some distrust.",
    "story": [
      "After years of protests against a plan to build a new arena for the NBA\u2019s 76ers near Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown, a sudden reversal in those plans has left the neighborhood\u2019s activists breathing a little easier -- but also feeling a sense of whiplash and distrust.",
      "Organizers, leaders and residents in the area say they\u2019re heartened that the previous plan, which was heavily criticized for its potential to gentrify the Chinatown area and push out Asian American businesses and families, will no longer threaten their community.",
      "But after what many said was a noninclusive process, they also do not trust developers and officials to hear them out in future proposals.",
      "\u201cI was very excited. I feel relief,\u201d said Wei Chen, an organizer with the nonprofit Asian Americans United. \u201cBut it was very unexpected. \u2026 It was a terrible process, making the community feel more anxious.\u201d",
      "The 76ers did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment. But in a 2022 interview, David Adelman, an entrepreneur who\u2019s leading the arena project for the team, said he had been involving locals in the plans.",
      "\u201cAlmost each day since we\u2019ve announced, we\u2019ve had a meeting with a different group within the community,\u201d he said.",
      "The announcement, the 76ers said in a press release, comes as a result of an agreement struck between their owners, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, and pro sports company Comcast Spectacor. The 76ers, along with hockey team the Flyers, are scheduled to move into a new facility that\u2019s expected to open in 2031. Meanwhile the companies said they still plan to \u201cinvest in the revitalization\u201d of Market East in Center City, the area where the arena was previously planned for, and that\u2019s on the edge of the Fashion District, neighboring Chinatown.",
      "Xu Lin, whose restaurant Bubblefish opened in Chinatown roughly a decade ago, said he first felt stunned with \u201cdisbelief\u201d by the arena news, before dissolving into tears of joy. The restaurant, he said, is just a half block away from the proposed arena site, and the construction, traffic and noise from the project would have kept customers away.",
      "\u201cIt would have destroyed my business,\u201d Lin said.",
      "Though he said he feels a bit of a reprieve, he\u2019s also uneasy about what\u2019s to come. Lin said he\u2019s not confident that developers and officials will take the community into consideration for any future plans in the area.",
      "\u201cI have zero trust in them. I don\u2019t think they engage the community in any meaningful way,\u201d he said.",
      "Many organizers also brought up how the emotional distress inflicted on residents could have been avoided if developers and officials listened to Chinatown locals early on.",
      "\u201cThere was not an inclusive process to hear the community\u2019s voice,\u201d Chen, whose group was part of a coalition to oppose the arena, said. \u201cWhy did you have our community suffer with this nightmare?\u201d",
      "In a press conference, hosted by the coalition on Monday, Mohan Seshadri, executive director at the Asian Pacific Islander Political Alliance, echoed a similar sentiment.",
      "\u201cWe are so proud and happy and relieved that Chinatown, a 150-year-old community, will continue to stand strong,\u201d Seshadri said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be clear, it didn\u2019t have to be like this. None of this had to be like this when we said, two and a half years ago, that this arena was the wrong site, the wrong location for a project like this. That it was going to destroy Chinatown.\u201d",
      "Fariha Khan, a co-director of the Asian American Studies Program at the University of Pennsylvania, said that while the outcome is a major victory for Chinatown, it\u2019s still unclear whether the news was influenced by cries from the community. Still, protestors deserve recognition for their efforts, she said.",
      "\u201cThe role that our community organizations played was a significant one. They were so determined, so relentless in making sure that city council and other members of the mayor\u2019s office heard their voice,\u201d Khan said. \u201cIt was admirable.\u201d",
      "Khan added that throughout the years, Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown has been treated as collateral damage for several major development projects, including the Vine Street Expressway, a highway that was completed in 1991 and essentially cut the neighborhood in half. Residents have had to defend the area against many other potential proposals, including a baseball stadium in 2000 and a casino just a few years later. However, Khan said, it\u2019s still possible for everyone to win.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s multiple ways for builders and union workers and the community members to come up with many ideas for rethinking what Chinatown could look like,\u201d Khan said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the desire. Who do we want to include in this conversation?\u201d"

      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO), which is leading a joint investigation, said the arrest warrant was executed at 10:33 a.m. (8:33 p.m. Tuesday ET), hours after hundreds of police officers arrived at Yoon\u2019s presidential compound in central Seoul.",
      "Yoon, who was impeached last month after his short-lived martial law order plunged South Korea, a key U.S. ally, into political chaos, is South Korea\u2019s first president to be arrested in office.",
      "\u201cUnlike the first execution attempt, this time there were no individuals or security staff actively obstructing the execution, and there were no significant physical clashes,\u201d the CIO said in a briefing.",
      "In an address to the nation, Yoon said that the warrant was illegal but that he decided to comply \u201cto prevent an unfortunate and bloody confrontation.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the rule of law in this country has completely collapsed,\u201d he said, according to his office.",
      "The main opposition Democratic Party hailed Yoon\u2019s arrest as \u201cthe first step towards restoring constitutional order.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough delayed, it is a relief to confirm that public authority and justice are still alive in South Korea,\u201d floor leader Park Chan-dae said in a text briefing.",
      "Investigators who arrived before dawn at Yoon\u2019s presidential residence were met by members of his security service, who blocked them from detaining Yoon during their first attempt on Jan. 3.",
      "Lawyers for Yoon and lawmakers from his People Power Party were also on the access road leading to the residence, arguing that the warrant was illegal and blocking the police from progressing toward the residence\u2019s entrance.",
      "Nearby, thousands of Yoon\u2019s supporters and critics held dueling protests in below-freezing temperatures. Many of Yoon\u2019s conservative supporters carried American flags and placards with slogans inspired by President-elect Donald Trump, such as \u201cStop the Steal\u201d \u2014 a reference to Yoon\u2019s unsubstantiated claims of election fraud which he cited among his reasons for declaring martial law.",
      "Police officers could later be seen making progress toward the hillside villa after they pushed through multiple blockades made up of vehicles and barbed wire.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal team said Wednesday that he was willing to appear for questioning voluntarily rather than be taken into custody. But a convoy of black SUVs was later seen leaving the presidential compound with a police escort, and Yoon arrived at the CIO office shortly afterward.",
      "\u201cThe president remained very composed as he was being arrested,\u201d Yoon Sang Hyun, a PPP lawmaker who was with Yoon at his residence as he was taken into custody, said in a phone interview. \u201cHe even comforted me, instead.\u201d",
      "He said he understood that Yoon planned to exercise his right to remain silent.",
      "Yoon can be held for up to 48 hours, after which investigators would need to apply for another warrant to formally indict and continue to hold him. He faces possible charges of insurrection, one of the few crimes for which South Korean presidents do not have immunity.",
      "Yoon, 64, also faces trial in South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court to determine whether to uphold his Dec. 14 impeachment by lawmakers, which suspended him from presidential duties.",
      "He did not attend the first day of proceedings Tuesday, citing security concerns. The hearing ended after about four minutes. A second hearing is set for Thursday.",
      "The warrant was executed far more smoothly Wednesday than during the first attempt, when Yoon\u2019s presidential bodyguards faced off with law enforcement officers for almost six hours, saying they were required by law to protect the president.",
      "Investigators withdrew but said they would take all necessary measures in their next attempt, and the warrant was re-issued last week after having expired.",
      "South Korea\u2019s acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, had raised concerns about possible clashes Wednesday between authorities and the presidential bodyguards.",
      "\u201cThis moment is a crucial one for maintaining order and the rule of law in the Republic of Korea,\u201d he said, using South Korea\u2019s formal name. \u201cThe entire nation and the international community are closely watching this situation.\u201d",
      "The CIO had said about 1,000 police officers would be deployed Wednesday to assist with executing the warrant. Authorities also warned that anyone who tried to obstruct them could face arrest themselves.",
      "Yoon\u2019s supporters have said that opponents are trying to humiliate him and that dragging him out of his residence in handcuffs could spark a\u00a0\u201ccivil war\u201d\u00a0in a country deeply divided along ideological and generational lines.",
      "\u201cHe is being treated as though he were a member of a South American drug cartel,\u201d Chung Jin-suk, Yoon\u2019s chief of staff, said Tuesday.",
      "Lawyers for Yoon said that the warrant was invalid for jurisdictional reasons and that the law does not allow searches of locations that could contain military secrets, such as the presidential compound, without consent.",
      "Yoon, who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term, has struggled to advance his legislative agenda against the opposition-controlled parliament.",
      "In a\u00a0surprise late-night address on Dec. 3, he accused \u201canti-state forces\u201d of paralyzing the government and sympathizing with communist\u00a0North Korea\u00a0and declared emergency martial law, which included a ban on all political activity.",
      "He lifted the martial law order, South Korea\u2019s first since 1980, about six hours later, after lawmakers voted unanimously to reject it.",

      "The episode has deeply shaken South Korea, which has a\u00a0long history of military-authoritarian rule\u00a0but has transitioned into one of Asia\u2019s most vibrant democracies and the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",

John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in an interview. \u201cThe more that we have this debate about one bill or two bills, that means we\u2019re not passing a budget and we\u2019re not dealing with reconciliation instructions. So I think we need to break the glass and acknowledge that the House may not be able to pass what the Senate can pass. ... We need to all get on the same page. The limiting factor really, in my view, is what the House can pass.\u201d",

      "The clash over one versus two bills persists a week after Trump met privately with Senate Republicans to discuss strategy for his agenda. Senators said it was a spirited debate in which Trump voiced his preference for one bill but sounded agnostic about the process, which has encouraged both camps to dig their heels in.",

      "Jon Traub, a managing principal at Deloitte Tax LLP and former Republican staff director on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said Johnson\u2019s April target is aggressive.",
      "That's partly because of the maze of obstacles the Senate budget process will present to let Republicans evade the 60-vote threshold, requiring the bill to be limited to matters of taxing and spending.",

But putting them together with whatever revenue constraints they will self-impose \u2014 and getting agreement on the revenue targets in the first place \u2014 will be difficult.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 02:36:54 GMT",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump designated Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism shortly before he left office in January 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Cuba said it will release 553 political prisoners after the Biden administration announced Tuesday it is removing Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and taking other \u201cgoodwill\u201d actions.",
      "The Catholic Church had been negotiating with the communist-run government over the release of the prisoners. Most of them were jailed following unprecedented islandwide protests in July 2021. A brutal crackdown initially led to the arrests of more than 1,000 people. Many faced prison sentences of up to 30 years.",
      "\"I thank all those who contributed to the decision announced today by the United States to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, where it should never have been,\" Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel wrote on X. \"Together with two other measures adopted, they have had a high cost for the country and Cuban families.\"",
      "Before Cuba's announcement, a senior administration official told reporters that to support the Catholic Church and facilitate the agreement, Biden would notify Congress that he seeks to remove Cuba from the terrorism list, as well as to take other actions.",
      "\u201cAn assessment has been completed, and we do not have information that supports Cuba\u2019s designation as being a state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d the Biden official said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump designated Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism shortly before he left office in January 2021, five years after President Barack Obama removed it. Trump can reverse Biden\u2019s actions as soon as he takes office next week.",
      "Three Cuban American Republican members of Congress from Florida, Mario D\u00edaz Balart, Maria Elvira Salaz\u00e1r and Carlos Gimenez, posted a video on X, rejecting Biden's moves and calling them \"pathetic.\"",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, whose father is Cuban, criticized Biden\u2019s actions. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is unacceptable on its merits,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cThe terrorism advanced by the Cuban regime has not ceased. I will work with President Trump and my colleagues to immediately reverse and limit the damage from the decision.\u201d",
      "In Cuba, Havana residents welcomed the news about Biden's actions.",
      "\"This is definitely good for our country, because we would have more possibilities, more resources. It's an advancement. One step at a time,\" said Dainerys Hern\u00e1ndez, a bartender.",
      "Joel Rivera, a public worker, agreed. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good decision. It\u2019s true that we need to be taken off that list, because we shouldn't be there in the first place,\" he said.",
      "In addition to removing Cuba from the list, the Biden administration will issue a waiver for Title III of the Helms Burton Act, which allows the original owners of Cuban properties confiscated decades ago to sue foreign companies \u201ctrafficking\u201d in them.",
      "In 2019, Trump was the first president not to waive Title III. Every president before him had waived the 1996 law, officially called the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, every six months, fearing it could harm U.S. trade.",
      "\u201cWe expect and anticipate that these measures announced today will bring very quick relief to the many dozens of Cubans who were arrested in conjunction with the July 2021 protests, as well as bring relief to their family members,\u201d the Biden official said.",
      "Biden is also easing some economic pressure on Cuba by rescinding National Security Presidential Memorandum 5, which was originally established on June 16, 2017.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s actions demonstrate that President Biden\u2019s Cuba policy, which is focused on achieving practical results with respect to human rights in Cuba, will pay dividends for the Cuban people,\u201d the senior administration official said.",
      "Speculation over Trump\u2019s foreign policy has swirled, particularly because of the potential influence of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a Cuban American who is Trump's pick for secretary of state. Rubio, a foreign policy hawk, has always advocated for a hard-line policy toward Cuba.",
      "Mauricio Claver-Carone, the architect of some of Trump's tough Latin America policies during his first administration, was chosen as special envoy for Latin America.",
      "CORRECTION (Jan. 14, 2025, 9:36 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the status of political prisoners in Cuba. They will be released; they have not been released."

    "title": "As Los Angeles-area wildfires rage, Trump homes in on a FEMA administrator",
    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:11:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, is at the top of Trump's list of potential FEMA nominees, three sources tell NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "After he won another term last fall, President-elect Donald Trump began rapidly revealing the names of those he will nominate to serve in top jobs in his next administration.",
      "But days away from his inauguration \u2014 with wildfires ravaging the Los Angeles area in what California Gov. Gavin Newsom predicts will be one of the worst natural disasters in history \u2014\u00a0a key position remains unaddressed: administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
      "It\u2019s a substantial unanswered question in such a crisis. And while Trump, given his social media habits and unpredictable impulses, could announce his FEMA pick at any minute, he instead is responding to the fires by hurling unsubstantiated blame at Newsom and other Democrats.",
      "Trump, though, has identified a front-runner for the FEMA job. Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, is at the top of the list of potential nominees, three sources told NBC News.",
      "Since he was appointed to lead the Florida agency in 2021, Guthrie has led the state\u2019s response to four major hurricanes, including a Category 4 storm, and the response to a South Florida condominium collapse that led to the deaths of 98 people. In the process, he has generally gotten high marks across the political spectrum for the state\u2019s responses to those disasters.",
      "Guthrie has worked in the emergency management industry his entire three-decade career. Then-Gov. Rick Scott, who is now a Republican senator, appointed him as chief of staff to the state\u2019s top emergency management department in 2018. Gov. Ron DeSantis, also a Republican, appointed him to lead the division in 2021.",
      "Trump\u2019s transition team began considering Guthrie for the key post last week, sending a quick signal through Florida\u2019s political world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be Kevin, I believe,\u201d said a longtime Florida Republican, who said the state is already preparing to fill the void left by Guthrie\u2019s potential appointment. \u201cHe makes so much sense, and all the signals we are getting is that he is the pick.\u201d",
      "Trump spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "A former DeSantis administration official called Guthrie a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe has led this state through some horrific storms. He\u2019s not political, and he just gets the job done. FEMA would be lucky to have him,\u201d the person said. \u201cThere are clear signals here from the incoming Trump administration that he\u2019s the top pick, and I don\u2019t blame them.",
      "\u201cIt is who I would pick,\u201d the person added.",
      "While Florida is much more accustomed to hurricanes, the state does experience fires, though they are significantly less damaging than those currently ravaging California. Last year, more than 24,000 acres in the state burned, including four significant wildfires.",
      "Guthrie is generally seen as a nonpartisan presence who has not been directly involved in the state\u2019s many high-profile culture war fights, even as DeSantis, who appointed him, has built his political brand on those clashes.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see how Democrats could have a real issue with the pick,\u201d the former DeSantis administration staffer said. \u201cHe\u2019s in the game of responding to emergencies, not partisan politics.\u201d",
      "Feeding off high winds and dry conditions, the Los Angeles-area wildfires have multiplied since they broke out Jan. 7. As of Monday night, 24 people had been killed and more than 12,000 buildings and structures had been destroyed. Evacuation orders remain in place.",
      "Federal agencies, staffed by career employees who do not serve at the pleasure of a president, are used to covering for political appointees when one administration transitions to another and a new president\u2019s nominees await Senate confirmation. FEMA is no different. Career staff members will \u201cstep up in an acting capacity\u201d during the transition, giving political appointees time to \u201ctrickle in,\u201d said Daniel Llargues, a spokesperson for the agency.",
      "Tony Robinson \u2014 a regional administrator with 37 years of experience who oversees Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas \u2014 will be acting administrator until a Trump nominee is confirmed, Llargues said.",
      "Trump has not publicly shared ideas for how his administration will handle the wildfires once he returns to office next week. Privately, with Republican members of Congress, he has discussed tying future wildfire aid to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling, Politico and the news site NOTUS reported Monday.",
      "Lori Lodes, executive director of the progressive group Climate Power, raised concerns about Trump and Republicans\u2019 making aid contingent on unrelated legislative items.",
      "\u201cThe only reason why wildfire aid is not already moving is because Donald Trump thinks he can use a tragedy to wring out some political concessions,\u201d Lodes said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cHe can make the choice right now to help the American people. Or he can begin his presidency by making a disaster even worse.\u201d",
      "Trump, in an interview with Newsmax on Monday, said he was assessing the damage by \u201cputting my developer cap on\u201d before he marveled at the destruction.",
      "\u201cI believe it\u2019s greater damage than if they got hit by a nuclear weapon. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it \u2014 vast miles and miles of houses just burned to a crisp,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing standing, and they\u2019re going to find many bodies. You know, only the dogs will find them, right? You know, German shepherds will.\u201d",
      "Newsom has invited Trump to survey wildfire damage. And Trump\u2019s team has been discussing a visit to Los Angeles, sources familiar with the conversations told NBC News this week. It is not clear whether the trip would happen before or after Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday.",
      "In an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last week, Newsom blasted Trump for spreading what he said were \u201cmis- and disinformation\u201d about the fires. Trump has targeted President Joe Biden, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom with blame at a time when the initial cause of the fires is unknown and the circumstances surrounding their spread are complex. Without basis, Trump has connected conservation efforts around the Delta smelt, a small, endangered fish, to water supply issues that have hamstrung firefighters.",
      "\u201cThe Governor is focused on protecting people, not playing politics, and making sure firefighters have all the resources they need,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Izzy Gardon wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday.",
      "Newsom expressed hope in the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview that he could work with Trump and praised Biden for how his outgoing administration has responded.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m blessed on behalf of 40 million Americans that happen to live in California that Joe Biden is president of the United States and did what he did immediately,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cAnd to the extent that we can work with the same relationship and that same spirit with Donald Trump, I hope we can.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The SEC filed a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0against\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0on Tuesday, alleging the billionaire committed securities fraud in 2022 by failing to disclose he had amassed an active stake in Twitter, a secrecy that allowed him to buy shares at \u201cartificially low prices.\u201d",
      "Musk, who is also CEO of Tesla and SpaceX,\u00a0purchased Twitter\u00a0for $44 billion in late 2022 and changed the name to X the following year. Prior to the acquisition, he\u2019d built up a position in the company of greater than 5%, which would\u2019ve required disclosing his holdings to the public within 10 calendar days of reaching that threshold.",
      "According to the SEC\u2019s civil complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., Musk was more than 10 days late in reporting that material information, \u201callowing him to underpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his financial beneficial ownership report was due.\u201d Investors may have bid up the stock had they known about Musk\u2019s purchases and interest in the company.",
      "The SEC had been\u00a0investigating\u00a0whether Musk, or anyone else working with him, committed securities fraud in 2022 around the Twitter disclosures. Musk\u00a0said\u00a0in a post on X last month that the SEC issued a \u201csettlement demand,\u201d pressuring him to agree to a deal, including a fine within 48 hours or \u201cface charges on numerous counts\u201d regarding the purchase of shares.",

      "Musk\u2019s lawyer, Alex Spiro, said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that the SEC\u2019s action is an admission that \u201cthey cannot bring an actual case.\u201d Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel, added that Musk \u201chas done nothing wrong\u201d and called the suit a \u201csham\u201d and the result of a \u201cmulti-year campaign of harassment,\u201d culminating in a \u201csingle-count ticky tak complaint.\u201d",
      "An SEC spokesperson declined to comment \u201cbeyond the litigation release and the complaint, which is, literally, an actual case brought by the SEC.\u201d",

      "Musk is just a week away from having unparalleled influence in the White House, as President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0second term begins on Jan. 20. Musk, who was a major financial backer of Trump in the latter stages of the campaign, is poised to lead an advisory group that will focus in part on reducing regulations, including those that affect Musk\u2019s various companies.",
      "In July, Trump vowed to fire SEC chairman\u00a0Gary Gensler, whose term began in 2021 under President Joe Biden. After Trump\u2019s election victory, Gensler announced that he would be resigning from his post instead. Trump plans to nominate Paul Atkins as the next chair of the SEC.",
      "In a separate civil lawsuit concerning the Twitter deal, the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System sued Musk in 2022, accusing him of deliberately concealing his progressive investments in the social network and intent to buy the company. The pension fund\u2019s attorneys argued that Musk, by failing to clearly disclose his investments, had influenced other shareholders\u2019 decisions and put them at a disadvantage.",
      "That case,\u00a0Rasella v. Musk, was filed in April 2022 in a federal court in the Southern District of New York.",
      "The SEC said in Tuesday\u2019s complaint that Musk crossed the 5% ownership mark in his Twitter ownership in March 2022, and would have been required to disclose his holdings by March 24.",
      "\u201cOn April 4, 2022, eleven days after a report was due, Musk finally publicly disclosed his beneficial ownership in a report with the SEC, disclosing that he had acquired over nine percent of Twitter\u2019s outstanding stock,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cThat day, Twitter\u2019s stock price increased more than 27% over its previous day\u2019s closing price.\u201d",
      "The SEC alleges that Musk spent over $500 million purchasing more Twitter shares during the time between the required disclosure and the day of his actual filing. That enabled him to buy stock from the \u201cunsuspecting public at artificially low prices,\u201d the complaint says. He \u201cunderpaid\u201d Twitter shareholders by over $150 million during that period, according to the SEC.",
      "In the complaint, the SEC said it\u2019s seeking a jury trial and asks that Musk be forced to \u201cpay disgorgement of his unjust enrichment\u201d as well as a civil penalty.",
      "The suit is the latest chapter in an almost three-year saga.",
      "For a brief period in April 2022, after Musk\u2019s ownership had been made public and it was known that he was the biggest shareholder, Musk was set to join Twitter\u2019s board. However, he quickly abandoned that plan,\u00a0telling the board\u00a0he would not take a seat.",
      "What followed was a six-month drama that began with Musk submitting an unsolicited bid in mid-April that was opposed by the board. Twitter\u2019s board eventually accepted Musk\u2019s offer later that month. Soon thereafter, Musk tried to back out, alleging that Twitter was misstating the number of \u201cbots\u201d on its service.",

      "Tesla shares seesawed for weeks after that, and the deal never materialized. Musk and Tesla eventually\u00a0agreed to a settlement, but\u00a0revised it in 2019. Under those terms, Musk and Tesla each had to pay $20 million in fines, and Musk had to temporarily relinquish his role as chairman of the Tesla board.",
      "In the latest complaint, the SEC didn\u2019t allude to Musk\u2019s prior civil securities fraud charges or settlement agreement."

    "story": [
      "YouTubers Myka Stauffer\u00a0and James Stauffer ignited a firestorm of controversy when they gave up custody of their adopted 4-year-old son with special needs in 2020. Now a new HBO documentary series, \"An Update on our Family,\" revisits the Stauffers' story.",
      "The limited three-part series, which will premiere on HBO on Wednesday, Jan. 15, uses the Stauffer controversy to explore wider issues about what happens when parents decide to make their private family lives public.",
      "But why are the Stauffers' decisions so controversial? Take a look at how the family rose to social media stardom ... and then enraged their followers.",
      "Who is Myka Stauffer and her husband James?",
      "Myka Stauffer had a parenting and lifestyle YouTube channel with more than 700,000 subscribers.\u00a0Together with her husband, she and her four biological children \u2014 Nakova, Jaka, Radley and Onyx \u2014 had a family YouTube channel, The Stauffer Life, with more than 300,000 followers.",
      "Neither channel is publicly accessible on YouTube at the time of this story's publication.",
      "The Ohio-based vlogger parents\u00a0began inviting viewers into their international adoption journey in 2016, via social media. Myka Stauffer produced 27 videos with the boy they named Huxley, sharing everything from fundraising to grappling with the ever-changing rules surrounding international adoption to learning about their potential child\u2019s special needs.",
      "Why did Myka and James Stauffer adopt a child?",
      "In an article for Parade\u00a0in September 2019, Myka wrote, \"My husband was resistant (to adoption) at first, but after letting him reflect on the idea for several months, we both agreed to start researching and see what surfaced.\"",
      "The couple felt compelled to pursue an international adoption, \"and we kept being lead to China,\" Myka Stauffer wrote. Because Chinese adoption laws would only allow U.S. couples to adopt children with special needs, the couple had to decide if they were prepared to take on additional challenges.",
      "And then, Myka Stauffer wrote, she \u201csaw a little face that I couldn\u2019t walk away from.\u201d This little boy had a brain tumor; Myka Stauffer said that since she was an oncology nurse, \u201ctumors didn\u2019t scare me.\u201d",
      "She wrote, \u201cUltimately, his sad little face won our hearts over and we just knew that he was our little guy.\u201d",
      "Who is Huxley, the boy the Stauffers adopted?",
      "The boy was 2.5 years old when the whole Stauffer family flew to China to meet him and bring him to their home in America. They renamed him Huxley.",
      "Over the years, the Stauffers updated their followers on their experience adopting a child with special needs, sometimes on posts that featured advertising from major companies.",
      "Not all videos about Huxley were monetized, but many of the videos about adoption were some of the most watched on the channel, raising the Stauffers\u2019 profile and clout online. In the last two years, the video on their channel with the most views, 5.5 million, was\u00a0\u201cHuxley\u2019s EMOTIONAL Adoption VIDEO!! GOTCHA DAY China Adoption.\u201d",
      "Why did the the Stauffers find a new home for their adopted son?",
      "At the age of 4, Huxley was just starting to form words verbally and had learned a few words in sign language.",
      "Myka Stauffer said, in her Parade essay and in now-deleted videos, the family learned eventually that Huxley did not, in fact, have a brain tumor. Instead, they shared, he had a number of different medical issues: he suffered a stroke in utero, and had autism and sensory processing disorder.",
      "Eagle-eyed followers began to notice that Huxley was missing from photos and other posts on the family\u2019s social media and YouTube channel. In May 2020, the Stauffers posted a video that was viewed by TODAY.com and has since been deleted, explaining what was happening with their adopted son.",
      "\u201cOnce Huxley came home, there was a lot more special needs that we weren\u2019t aware of, and that we were not told,\u201d James Stauffer said in the video, titled \u201can update on our family.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor us, it\u2019s been really hard hearing from the medical professionals, a lot of their feedback, and things that have been upsetting,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve never wanted to be in this position. And we\u2019ve been trying to get his needs met and help him out as much as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not an ounce of our body that doesn\u2019t love Huxley with all of our being,\u201d Myka Stauffer added. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a minute that I didn\u2019t try our hardest and I think what Jim is trying to say is that after multiple assessments, after multiple evaluations, numerous medical professionals have felt that he needed a different fit and that (with) his medical needs, he needed more.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I feel like a failure as a mom? Like, 500%,\u201d Myka Stauffer said, adding that Huxley was living with a \u201cnew mommy\u201d in a \u201cforever home.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last couple months have been like the hardest thing I could have ever imagined to going to choosing to do ... after pouring our guts and our heart into this little boy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is thriving, he is happy, he is doing really well, and his new mommy has medical professional training, and it is a very good fit.\u201d",
      "Why are people upset by the Stauffers' decision?",
      "An online uproar followed the Stauffers' announcement.",
      "Almost 50,000 people (as of publication of this article) have signed a\u00a0Change.org petition\u00a0demanding that the Stauffers remove all monetized content featuring Huxley from YouTube.

      "Some people have defended Gomez\u2019s use of Spanish in the film.",
      "Annie Abbott, a professor of Spanish at the University of Illinois, argued that the criticism of Gomez mirrors the judgment sometimes experienced by heritage speakers \u2014 i.e., people with a Latino cultural and familial background who are not formally fluent in Spanish \u2014 from native Spanish speakers.",
      "\u201cGomez is critiqued for experiencing the typical challenges of heritage speakers while being held to native speaker standards \u2014 a no-win situation that a rapidly growing number of Americans can relate to,\u201d Abbott wrote in a recent opinion piece for The Fulcrum.",
      "A 2023 study from the Pew Research Center found that 24% of U.S. Latino adults say they carry on a conversation in Spanish \u201ca little or not at all.\u201d",
      "According to the study, 54% of U.S. Latinos who say that only speak a little Spanish \u201csay another Hispanic person has made them feel bad for it.\u201d",
      "However, one commenter on X responding to Abbott argued that the issue wasn\u2019t with Gomez's language ability or identity, but with the fact that her Spanish skills did not match the demands of her role in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe author misses the point completely. This has nothing to do with racism. Selena Gomez should be proud of her Spanish,\u201d the X user wrote. \u201cBut her accent doesn\u2019t match the character that she plays in the movie. And that\u2019s very distracting for viewers who know exactly how Mexicans speak.\u201d",
      "Director Audiard has addressed issues with the actors' varying Spanish accents in the movie.",
      "\u201cThroughout the shoot we had problems, for instance, with Selena\u2019s accent in Spanish. She is Texan. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n speaks Castilian Spanish. She\u2019s from Madrid,\u201d he told The New York Times in November. \u201cGiven that I don\u2019t speak Spanish, the nuances of the Mexican accent versus the Castilian were lost on me. We had all these problems with accents, but we fixed them in the edit. We did a lot of dubbing.\u201d",
      "Some argue the movie perpetuates harmful trans stereotypes",
      "Some viewers have criticized the movie\u2019s depiction of trans people and the trans experience.",
      "GLAAD, the LGBTQ advocacy group formerly known as the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, called \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\" a \u201cstep backward for trans representation\u201d and said the film \u201crecycles the trans stereotypes, tropes, and clich\u00e9s of the not-so-distant past.\u201d",
      "Some critics say the film perpetuates the harmful narrative that transitioning is a form of lying. Emilia keeps her past a secret from her wife, posing as Manitas' aunt.",
      "\u201cIts protagonist\u2019s transition is seen as duplicitous and dishonest, an act of manipulation through which she continues her selfish attempts to control those that she abandoned,\u201d Mattie Lucas wrote in a November review for Trans | Cendental Cinema.",
      "\u201cNot only is her transition portrayed as more of a disguise to evade the authorities, it\u2019s an act of continued selfishness that ends up destroying not only her own life, but the lives of those she loves,\u201d Lucas added.",
      "Film critic Juan Barquin called the movie \u201ca regressive picture masquerading as progressive\u201d and criticized the way masculinity and femininity were portrayed in the film.",
      "\u201cAny time Emilia \u2018reverts\u2019 to her \u2018old ways,\u2019 Gascon lowers her vocal register as if to equate masculinity with evil and femininity with good,\u201d Barquin wrote for Little White Lies magazine.",
      "Reviewer David Opie echoed this criticism, pointing to a scene when Emilia throws her wife Jessi onto a bed \u201cand threatens her using the same low, masculine voice she used pre-surgery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as if the so-called 'evil' in Emilia is a separate entity, the 'man' she was raised to be, rather than her being the same person going through a transitional journey,\u201d Opie wrote for Yahoo! Movies.",
      "Several critics and viewers, including Barquin, also took issue with one line from the movie in which Emilia describes herself as \u201chalf male, half female.\u201d",
      "Some transgender commentators shared counterpoints to these arguments and defended the film\u2019s representation of its trans protagonist.",
      "Journalist and critic Mey Rude, who is trans, rejected the argument that Emilia uses a \u201cmale voice\u201d in moments of anger.",
      "\u201cShe simply is a woman with a lower register, and when she gets angry, it shows,\u201d Rude wrote in a piece for Out Magazine. \u201cIf you listen to the scenes where Gasc\u00f3n is playing the character as Manitas, you can clearly hear a difference in the voice she uses in the fight scene with Gomez.\u201d",
      "Rude also argues that the film does not lean into \u201charmful trans tropes about trans women being deceptive or liars.\u201d",
      "\u201cEmilia isn\u2019t a liar because she\u2019s trans, she\u2019s a liar because she\u2019s a bad person and she\u2019s in many ways, afraid,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe movie shows that if you live a lie, whether you\u2019re trans or not, your lies will catch up with you.\u201d",
      "Writer Julie River, who is trans, argues in a piece for Out Front magazine that Emilia is portrayed sensitively as a \u201cmorally complex\u201d character who makes \u201ca desperate attempt to atone for her sins in her former life.\u201d",
      "River also argues that Emilia hides her transition not because the movie is painting trans people as duplicitous, but because as a cartel leader, Emilia \"was hardly surrounded by people who were easy to come out to or who were likely to accept her transition.\u201d",
      "\u201cI may be amongst the minority in the LGBTQ+ community doing this, but I\u2019ll be applauding it for every award it wins,\u201d River wrote.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n herself has pushed back at people calling her \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d character transphobic.",
      "\u201cThere are some that say, \u2018I want to see LGBTQ or trans characters outdoing what people do in real life,\u2019 but we do bad things too ... I don\u2019t understand the criticism about the representation of portraying Emilia P\u00e9rez this way,\u201d she told Vanity Fair in January. \u201cThe reality is that the trans experience is not the same for everybody \u2014 my trans experience is different from somebody else\u2019s.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, go and make your own movie,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n also said. \u201cGo create the representation you want to see for your community.\u201d"

    "summary": "Mike Leigh's \"Hard Truths,\" starring Marianne Jean-Baptiste, is leaving audiences with a lot of questions about its ending. Here's what the star says it means.",
    "story": [
      "If you\u2019re paying attention to this year\u2019s film awards season, you\u2019ve probably heard of Mike Leigh's new British drama called \u201cHard Truths.\u201d",
      "Set in London, the 97-minute film centers on Pansy (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a woman deeply unhappy with the world and takes it out on everyone around her, including her long-suffering husband Curtley (David Webber), her adult son Moses (Tuwaine Barrett) who lives at home, and even her seemingly happy sister Chantelle (Michele Austin).",
      "\u201cHard Truths\u201d is somewhat of a reunion for director Mike Leigh and Jean-Baptiste who worked together nearly 30 years ago on his Oscar-nominated film \"Secrets & Lies.\" The two also teamed up the following year when he used some of her music in his film \"Career Girls.\"",
      "Similar to his latest film, \"Secrets & Lies\" also centered on Jean-Baptiste, but as an adopted Black woman who traces her family history and discovers her biological mother is white. It also generated much critical-acclaim, including five Oscar nominations.",
      "\"Hard Truths\" appears to be following suit; it has already received early award season buzz \u2014 and accolades. It won a National Board of Review award, and Jean-Baptiste has won awards from critics organizations in New York, San Diego, Toronto, Chicago and Los Angeles.",
      "With the film's release in theaters on Jan. 10, there will be many who see the film who'll likely have a slew of questions as the final credits roll. Namely, happened to Pansy and Curtley and what is the takeaway?",
      "Let\u2019s dive a little deeper, and hear from the film\u2019s star, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and directer to understand the film's cryptic ending.",
      "Note: Spoilers about the end of \u201cHard Truths\u201d ahead.",
      "What is \u2018Hard Truths\u2019 about?",
      "\u201cHard Truths\u201d is a small independent film that focuses on Pansy, the matriarch of a small family living in London. Pansy is deeply unhappy with the world, and takes it out on everyone around her, including her husband Curtley, son Moses, and sister Chantelle.",
      "As Jean-Baptiste tells TODAY.com, \u201c(Pansy) is somebody who has a lot of anxiety and fear\u2026 She\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t enjoy life and doesn\u2019t quite understand why, and blames other people for it\u2026. I\u2019ve seen people that are quite similar to her, and observed that way they present in the world.\u201d",
      "But, as viewers soon learn, Pansy's temperament isn't solely based on her interactions with others; her frustration also comes from unresolved grief. There's an important scene in the film where Pansy and Chantelle go to their mother's gravesite; Pansy is abrasive and dismissive at first, but the sisters end up talking about their mother, Pearl's, death.",
      "\"Your memory of Pearl is not the same as mine,\" insists Pansy. She is resentful that she had to be the one who found their mother \"lying stiff in the bed\" with her eyes still open, \"Accusing. Disappointed.\"",
      "One of the film's critical moment comes when Pansy reveals that she thinks everyone hates her, to which Chantelle responds that she loves her \"but I don't understand you.\"",
      "Pansy\u2019s revelation helps shed insight on her complicated relationship with the world, and how she\u2019s surrounded herself with people she can barely stand. Chantelle offers Pansy an opportunity for respite amid her suffering: she tells her to simply walk away. But Pansy doesn't seem ready to do that.",
      "Leigh said he used locations, like Pansy's house, as way to highlight and reflect her inner mental health struggles.",
      "\"The choice of locations is critical... In this film, most obviously, you can see that Pansy\u2019s house is a function of her paranoia, her fear of stuff and things and plants and insects and all the rest of it, whereas (her sister) Chantal\u2019s flat is a celebration of color and light and plants and joy,\" he told Film Comment in Oct. 2024. \"For me, that\u2019s what it\u2019s always been about.\u00a0\"",
      "What happens at the end of \u2018Hard Truths\u2019?",
      "Don\u2019t expect some big twist or denouement at the end of the film. It seems to just \u2026 end. But \u201cHard Truths\u201d isn\u2019t a movie that\u2019s going to give easy answers or wrap things in a bow.",
      "The last twenty minutes or so of \u201cHard Truths\u201d stops being about Pansy taking everything out on the world, and becomes a bit more of the world reacting to her. Following a series of increasingly tense moments \u2014 a meltdown at her Mother\u2019s Day gathering, throwing her husband's clothes out of their bedroom, calling him \u201cdisgusting\u201d \u2014 Curtley is injured while at work.",
      "His co-worker brings him home and tells Pansy what\u2019s going on, but she doesn\u2019t appear to want to leave the bedroom after being woken up \u2014 instead she quietly sits in a chair by the bed.",
      "The final scenes are close-ups of Curtley, a single tear running down his face as he waits for his wife to come down and comfort him; and Pansy, also in a close-up, her expression almost unreadable. She\u2019s not happy or sad. She lets out a small breath. And then the film ends.",
      "So what does the ending of \u2018Hard Truths\u2019 mean?",
      "Leigh is not going to do your homework for you. He\u2019s been open about working with a very loose script, and has said his actors do a certain amount of improvisation.",
      "\"For me, every film is a learning curve. And the great thing about being able to work, in this particular case, with actors with this particular background, is they\u2019re able to come up with what this character would say,\" Leigh said during a tastemakers screening attending by TODAY.com. \"I'm there to learn from and to take from (them). And if you like to put it more crudely, to exploit their experience, their knowledge and understanding.\"",
      "Jean-Baptiste also shared her thoughts on the significance of the ending, telling TODAY.com that they \"leave it to the audience\" to figure out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intentional on Mike Leigh\u2019s part (to keep things ambiguous). As far as I was concerned, I didn\u2019t know it was the ending when we were doing that scene, because you don\u2019t know what the film\u2019s about or what\u2019s happening. You don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s going to film stuff after that,\u201d she says.",
      "In fact, the first time she saw the ending was when she saw the completed film. As Jean-Baptiste explains, until the end of the film you\u2019ve been watching a woman who \u201cis unable to help themselves.\u201d So when she has an injured husband downstairs, \u201cHow is she going to help anyone else? And that\u2019s as much as I can give you. The rest is for the audience to take in, to argue about with their friends and come up with whatever ending they want to put on it.\u201d",
      "What did you think of the ending of \u201cHard Truths\u201d?",

      "U.S. authorities\u00a0said the\u00a0plot was part of Iran\u2019s efforts to avenge the death of a top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in Baghdad in a U.S. drone strike Trump\u00a0ordered during\u00a0his first term in office.",
      "In mid-October of last year,\u00a0Iran sent a written message via Swiss diplomats saying that it would not seek to kill\u00a0Trump, according to a U.S. official, NBC News has reported.",
      "U.S. and European governments say Iran for years has sought to silence Iranians abroad who have criticized the regime.",
      "The United Kingdom last year\u00a0summoned\u00a0Iran\u2019s top diplomat in London after Tehran targeted Iranian journalists based in Britain for intimidation. One journalist was stabbed in the leg in an attack blamed on Iran. Tehran denies the accusations.",
      "Past tensions with Trump",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term in office, tensions between the United States and Iran spiked. In 2018, Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers that limited the country\u2019s nuclear program in return for an easing of U.S. economic sanctions.",
      "Trump reimposed the sanctions and introduced additional punitive measures. The Biden administration then held indirect talks with Iran to try to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, but the discussions failed to produce an agreement.",
      "Pezeshkian, who has portrayed himself as a relative moderate, said Iran in principle is open to dialogue with the second Trump administration. But he said that the United States has not lived up to its commitments in the past and that it has sought to topple the Iranian government.",
      "\u201cThe problem we have is not in dialogue,\" Pezeshkian said. \"It\u2019s in the commitments that arise from talk and dialogue that we\u2019ll have to commit to.\u201d",
      "When Iran held talks with major powers about its nuclear program, \u201cwe upheld all the commitments that we had to commit to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut unfortunately it was the other party that did not live up to its promises and obligations.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cWe have this doubt that, no matter how much we engage in conversation and dialogue, they are trying to\u00a0topple\u00a0the government, not solve the problems.\u201d",
      "Since Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018, Iran has ignored its provisions, blocked some U.N. inspections and made advances in its uranium enrichment work. According to U.S. officials, Iran has dramatically increased its stockpile of enriched uranium and most likely has enough fissile material to make more than a dozen nuclear weapons if it decided to build an atomic arsenal.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House and Iran\u2019s advancing nuclear program have prompted speculation that the United States and Israel might take military action to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb.",
      "Pezeshkian said Iran is not seeking war but would be ready to defend itself if its nuclear sites came under attack.",
      "\u201cYou see, naturally enough, we will react to any action. We do not fear war, but we do not seek it,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI solemnly hope that this will not transpire because it will be to the detriment of all the actors, not only and merely us.\u201d",
      "Pezeshkian said Iran\u2019s adversaries were accusing Tehran of trying to build the bomb \u201cto fabricate some sort of a pretext.\u201d",
      "But he added, \u201cThis is not true.\u201d",
      "Recent Setbacks for Tehran",
      "Since Pezeshkian was elected in July, Iran has suffered a series of severe setbacks to its \u201caxis of resistance\u201d proxy network in the region. Israel\u2019s military has heavily damaged Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, and Hamas militants in the Gaza strip, the Assad regime in Syria \u2014 a close ally of Tehran\u2014 collapsed last month. And Israel has hit targets in Iran with apparent impunity.",
      "But Pezeshkian denied Iran\u2019s position had been weakened.",
      "\u201cI do not see any link,\u201d he said. He added that, \u201ccomparing to last year inside the country, we\u2019re more coherent. We\u2019re more robust. We have better participation. We have a more solid security in the country.\u201d",
      "The United States has accused Iran of being complicit in Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, citing Tehran\u2019s long history of arming and funding the group.",
      "The interview came during intensive diplomatic talks aimed at achieving a ceasefire deal in Gaza between Israel and Hamas after months of indirect talks involving Egypt, Qatar, the United States and other countries.",
      "Asked whether Iran had a role to play in brokering a possible deal, Pezeshkian said: \u201cWe do whatever we can in order for peace to prevail in the region.\u201d"

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korean authorities detained President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over his botched declaration of martial law, weeks after a first attempt ended in a dramatic standoff at the residence where he had been holed up\u00a0since\u00a0he was impeached.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO), which is leading a joint investigation, said the arrest warrant was executed at 10:33 a.m. (8:33 p.m. Tuesday ET), hours after hundreds of police officers arrived at Yoon\u2019s presidential compound in central Seoul.",
      "Yoon, who was impeached last month after his short-lived martial law order plunged South Korea, a key U.S. ally, into political chaos, is South Korea\u2019s first president to be arrested in office.",
      "\u201cUnlike the first execution attempt, this time there were no individuals or security staff actively obstructing the execution, and there were no significant physical clashes,\u201d the CIO said in a briefing.",
      "In an address to the nation, Yoon said that the warrant was illegal but that he decided to comply \u201cto prevent an unfortunate and bloody confrontation.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the rule of law in this country has completely collapsed,\u201d he said, according to his office.",
      "The main opposition Democratic Party hailed Yoon\u2019s arrest as \u201cthe first step towards restoring constitutional order.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough delayed, it is a relief to confirm that public authority and justice are still alive in South Korea,\u201d floor leader Park Chan-dae said in a text briefing.",
      "Investigators who arrived before dawn at Yoon\u2019s presidential residence were met by members of his security service, who blocked them from detaining Yoon during their first attempt on Jan. 3.",
      "Lawyers for Yoon and lawmakers from his People Power Party were also on the access road leading to the residence, arguing that the warrant was illegal and blocking the police from progressing toward the residence\u2019s entrance.",
      "Nearby, thousands of Yoon\u2019s supporters and critics held dueling protests in below-freezing temperatures. Many of Yoon\u2019s conservative supporters carried American flags and placards with slogans inspired by President-elect Donald Trump, such as \u201cStop the Steal\u201d \u2014 a reference to Yoon\u2019s unsubstantiated claims of election fraud which he cited among his reasons for declaring martial law.",
      "Police officers could later be seen making progress toward the hillside villa after they pushed through multiple blockades made up of vehicles and barbed wire.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal team said Wednesday that he was willing to appear for questioning voluntarily rather than be taken into custody. But a convoy of black SUVs was later seen leaving the presidential compound with a police escort, and Yoon arrived at the CIO office shortly afterward.",
      "\u201cThe president remained very composed as he was being arrested,\u201d Yoon Sang Hyun, a PPP lawmaker who was with Yoon at his residence as he was taken into custody, said in a phone interview. \u201cHe even comforted me, instead.\u201d",
      "He said he understood that Yoon planned to exercise his right to remain silent.",
      "Yoon can be held for up to 48 hours, after which investigators would need to apply for another warrant to formally indict and continue to hold him. He faces possible charges of insurrection, one of the few crimes for which South Korean presidents do not have immunity.",
      "Yoon, 64, also faces trial in South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court to determine whether to uphold his Dec. 14 impeachment by lawmakers, which suspended him from presidential duties.",
      "He did not attend the first day of proceedings Tuesday, citing security concerns. The hearing ended after about four minutes. A second hearing is set for Thursday.",
      "The warrant was executed far more smoothly Wednesday than during the first attempt, when Yoon\u2019s presidential bodyguards faced off with law enforcement officers for almost six hours, saying they were required by law to protect the president.",
      "Investigators withdrew but said they would take all necessary measures in their next attempt, and the warrant was re-issued last week after having expired.",
      "South Korea\u2019s acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, had raised concerns about possible clashes Wednesday between authorities and the presidential bodyguards.",
      "\u201cThis moment is a crucial one for maintaining order and the rule of law in the Republic of Korea,\u201d he said, using South Korea\u2019s formal name. \u201cThe entire nation and the international community are closely watching this situation.\u201d",
      "The CIO had said about 1,000 police officers would be deployed Wednesday to assist with executing the warrant. Authorities also warned that anyone who tried to obstruct them could face arrest themselves.",
      "Yoon\u2019s supporters have said that opponents are trying to humiliate him and that dragging him out of his residence in handcuffs could spark a\u00a0\u201ccivil war\u201d\u00a0in a country deeply divided along ideological and generational lines.",
      "\u201cHe is being treated as though he were a member of a South American drug cartel,\u201d Chung Jin-suk, Yoon\u2019s chief of staff, said Tuesday.",
      "Lawyers for Yoon said that the warrant was invalid for jurisdictional reasons and that the law does not allow searches of locations that could contain military secrets, such as the presidential compound, without consent.",
      "Yoon, who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term, has struggled to advance his legislative agenda against the opposition-controlled parliament.",
      "In a\u00a0surprise late-night address on Dec. 3, he accused \u201canti-state forces\u201d of paralyzing the government and sympathizing with communist\u00a0North Korea\u00a0and declared emergency martial law, which included a ban on all political activity.",
      "He lifted the martial law order, South Korea\u2019s first since 1980, about six hours later, after lawmakers voted unanimously to reject it.",

      "The episode has deeply shaken South Korea, which has a\u00a0long history of military-authoritarian rule\u00a0but has transitioned into one of Asia\u2019s most vibrant democracies and the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",

      "In-person diplomacy was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept China\u2019s borders closed for three years. During this time, the previous Trump administration ratcheted up criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, which began in China.",
      "When Burns arrived in Beijing in March 2022 to take up his post, he spent most of the first month of his job in quarantine at the ambassador\u2019s residence, unable to meet anybody even as the relationship he was tasked with steering was heading to new lows.",
      "At the same time, Chinese nationalism and anti-Western sentiment surged across state media and online platforms here, and the people-to-people exchanges that Burns likes to call the \u201cballast\u201d of the relationship have never really recovered.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has the tightest grip on power here since Mao Zedong, and has carried out an internal campaign against corruption that, during Burns\u2019 term alone, saw a foreign minister and two defense ministers expelled from their positions and the public eye. The heightened scrutiny has made some Chinese officials, academics and average citizens more reluctant to engage with foreigners.",
      "Relations hit their lowest point in decades in August 2022, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House speaker at the time, visited the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan over China\u2019s objections. They sank even lower in early 2023, when the American military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been spotted over the continental United States.",
      "\u201cIt took us a while to dig out of that,\u201d Burns said. Since then, both sides have moved to stabilize ties.",
      "China has only recently resumed direct military and other communications that were cut off in protest over Pelosi\u2019s visit. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has since had two meetings with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s significant because we\u2019re trying to drive down the probability or the chance of any kind of accident or misunderstanding between our military forces,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Another example of improved cooperation, he said, is in addressing the U.S. fentanyl crisis, one of the areas where Biden and Xi agreed to cooperate at a summit in California in November 2023. Many of the precursor chemicals used to make the deadly opioid originate in China before being processed into fentanyl in Mexico and other countries, then smuggled into the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have begun to see action from the government of China,\u201d Burns said, including 300 arrests, the shutdown of online sales of illicit chemicals and the scheduling of 55 synthetic opioids and precursor chemicals as prohibited for export.",
      "Burns pointed to other successes in the Biden administration, including the release of four Americans who had been detained in China for years: David Lin in September, and Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung in November.",
      "\u201cTo meet them at the airport, to give them their passports, to tell them that they were free people again was an extraordinary moment, certainly for me as the American ambassador,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Though all Americans the State Department considered wrongfully detained by China have been released, hundreds of others remain imprisoned on various charges, more than in any other foreign country. They continue to receive consular assistance.",
      "In the interest of keeping the lines of communication open, Burns urged members of Congress from both parties to make greater efforts to visit China.",
      "\u201cI have hawkish views on the relationship between China and the United States. Many members of Congress do, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be here to understand the adversary and to talk to the adversary and to know the reality on the ground.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Cuba said it will release 553 political prisoners after the Biden administration announced Tuesday it is removing Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and taking other \u201cgoodwill\u201d actions.",
      "The Catholic Church had been negotiating with the communist-run government over the release of the prisoners. Most of them were jailed following unprecedented islandwide protests in July 2021. A brutal crackdown initially led to the arrests of more than 1,000 people. Many faced prison sentences of up to 30 years.",
      "\"I thank all those who contributed to the decision announced today by the United States to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, where it should never have been,\" Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel wrote on X. \"Together with two other measures adopted, they have had a high cost for the country and Cuban families.\"",
      "Before Cuba's announcement, a senior administration official told reporters that to support the Catholic Church and facilitate the agreement, Biden would notify Congress that he seeks to remove Cuba from the terrorism list, as well as to take other actions.",
      "\u201cAn assessment has been completed, and we do not have information that supports Cuba\u2019s designation as being a state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d the Biden official said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump designated Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism shortly before he left office in January 2021, five years after President Barack Obama removed it. Trump can reverse Biden\u2019s actions as soon as he takes office next week.",
      "Three Cuban American Republican members of Congress from Florida, Mario D\u00edaz Balart, Maria Elvira Salaz\u00e1r and Carlos Gimenez, posted a video on X, rejecting Biden's moves and calling them \"pathetic.\"",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, whose father is Cuban, criticized Biden\u2019s actions. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is unacceptable on its merits,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cThe terrorism advanced by the Cuban regime has not ceased. I will work with President Trump and my colleagues to immediately reverse and limit the damage from the decision.\u201d",
      "In Cuba, Havana residents welcomed the news about Biden's actions.",
      "\"This is definitely good for our country, because we would have more possibilities, more resources. It's an advancement. One step at a time,\" said Dainerys Hern\u00e1ndez, a bartender.",
      "Joel Rivera, a public worker, agreed. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good decision. It\u2019s true that we need to be taken off that list, because we shouldn't be there in the first place,\" he said.",
      "In addition to removing Cuba from the list, the Biden administration will issue a waiver for Title III of the Helms Burton Act, which allows the original owners of Cuban properties confiscated decades ago to sue foreign companies \u201ctrafficking\u201d in them.",
      "In 2019, Trump was the first president not to waive Title III. Every president before him had waived the 1996 law, officially called the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, every six months, fearing it could harm U.S. trade.",
      "\u201cWe expect and anticipate that these measures announced today will bring very quick relief to the many dozens of Cubans who were arrested in conjunction with the July 2021 protests, as well as bring relief to their family members,\u201d the Biden official said.",
      "Biden is also easing some economic pressure on Cuba by rescinding National Security Presidential Memorandum 5, which was originally established on June 16, 2017.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s actions demonstrate that President Biden\u2019s Cuba policy, which is focused on achieving practical results with respect to human rights in Cuba, will pay dividends for the Cuban people,\u201d the senior administration official said.",
      "Speculation over Trump\u2019s foreign policy has swirled, particularly because of the potential influence of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a Cuban American who is Trump's pick for secretary of state. Rubio, a foreign policy hawk, has always advocated for a hard-line policy toward Cuba.",
      "Mauricio Claver-Carone, the architect of some of Trump's tough Latin America policies during his first administration, was chosen as special envoy for Latin America.",
      "CORRECTION (Jan. 14, 2025, 9:36 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the status of political prisoners in Cuba. They will be released; they have not been released."

    "story": [
      "A group of global experts is proposing a new way to define and diagnose\u00a0obesity, reducing the emphasis on the controversial body mass index and hoping to better identify people who need treatment for the\u00a0disease caused\u00a0by excess body fat.",
      "Under recommendations released Tuesday night, obesity would no longer be defined solely by BMI, a calculation of height and weight, but combined with other measurements, such as waist circumference, plus evidence of health problems tied to extra pounds.",
      "Obesity is estimated to affect more than 1 billion people\u00a0worldwide. In the U.S., about 40% of adults have obesity, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\u201cThe whole goal of this is to get a more precise definition so that we are targeting the people who actually need the help most,\u201d said Dr. David Cummings, an obesity expert at the University of Washington and one of the 58 authors of the report published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal.",
      "The report introduces two new diagnostic categories: clinical obesity and pre-clinical obesity.",
      "People with clinical obesity meet BMI and other markers of obesity and have evidence of organ, tissue or other problems caused by excess weight. That could include heart disease, high blood pressure, liver or kidney disease or chronic severe knee or hip pain. These people would be eligible for treatments, including\u00a0diet\u00a0and\u00a0exercise\u00a0interventions and\u00a0obesity medications.",
      "People with pre-clinical obesity are at risk for those conditions, but have no ongoing illness, the report says.",
      "BMI has long been considered a flawed measure that can over-diagnose or underdiagnose obesity, which is currently defined as a BMI of 30 or more. But people with excess body fat do not always have a BMI above 30, the report notes. And people with high muscle mass \u2014 football players or other athletes \u2014 may have a high BMI despite normal fat mass.",
      "Under the new criteria, about 20% of people who used to be classified as obese would no longer meet the definition, preliminary analysis suggests. And about 20% of people with serious health effects but lower BMI would now be considered clinically obese, experts said.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t dramatically change the percentage of people being defined as having obesity, but it would better diagnose the people who really have clinically significant excess fat,\u201d Cummings said.",
      "The new definitions have been endorsed by more than 75 medical organizations around the world, but it\u2019s not clear how widely or quickly they could be adopted in practice. The report acknowledges that implementation of the recommendations \u201cwill carry significant costs and workforce implications.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the health insurance trade group AHIP, formerly known as America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said \u201cit\u2019s too early at this point to gauge how plans will incorporate these criteria into coverage or other policies.\u201d",
      "There are practical issues to consider, said Dr. Katherine Saunders, an obesity expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-founder of the obesity treatment company FlyteHealth. Measuring waist circumference sounds simple, but protocols differ, many doctors aren\u2019t trained accurately and standard medical tape measures aren\u2019t big enough for many people with obesity.",
      "In addition, determining the difference between clinical and pre-clinical obesity would require a comprehensive health assessment and lab tests, she noted.",
      "\u201cFor a new classification system to be widely adopted, it would also need to be extremely quick, inexpensive, and reliable,\u201d she said.",
      "The new definitions are likely to be confusing, said Kate Bauer, a nutrition expert at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\u201cThe public likes and needs simple messages. I don\u2019t think this differentiation is going to change anything,\u201d she said.",
      "Overhauling the definition of obesity will take time, acknowledged Dr. Robert Kushner, an obesity expert at the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine and a co-author of the report.",
      "\u201cThis is the first step in the process,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to begin the conversation.\u201d"

The saga has long captivated historians and featured in popular culture, from spy novels to Netflix's \"The Crown.\"",
      "Blunt confessed in 1964 to spying for the Soviet Union as part of the notorious Cambridge Five spy ring during World War II, but the queen would only be told the full story in 1973 \u2014 responding calmly and without surprise, according to the documents. His true identity was eventually exposed to the public by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, speaking in Parliament in 1979.",
      "The security services closely guarded Blunt's identity given his prominent position, with only a few senior officials informed, though the secret may have been known regardless. The queen\u2019s private secretary, Martin Charteris, was told only that MI5 intended to interrogate Blunt due to his close ties with fellow spy Guy Burgess, who fled to the Soviet Union.",
      "In all likelihood, the events \u201ctell us more about the inability of the state to prosecute Blunt\u201d than a concerted effort by MI5 to keep the late queen in the dark, historian Chris Smith, who authored a biography of Cambridge Five spy John Cairncross, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cTo have informed Her Majesty or anyone else for that matter would have been potentially defamatory; it would also have been deemed embarrassing to Her Majesty,\u201d Smith said.",
      "By the time Blunt was revealed to have been a spy, he had also become the consummate establishment figure, \u201cwhich was acutely embarrassing\u201d for the royal family, Smith added.",
      "As such, concealing the information \u201cwould also have allowed the palace to truthfully deny that Her Majesty had any knowledge of Blunt\u2019s espionage activities, shielding her from personal embarrassment.\u201d"

    "title": "When U.S. allies have undersea cables severed, suspicion falls on Russia and China",
    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 10:38:50 GMT",
    "summary": "A series of incidents involving undersea cables has drawn attention to their vulnerability and cast suspicion on vessels from Russia and China.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 First the Baltics, now Taiwan. This month, in the latest in a spate of such incidents, crucial undersea cables connecting U.S. allies were damaged or severed.",
      "Some have been cast as acts of sabotage, pinning blame on Russia and China amid heightened geopolitical tensions.",
      "Early this month, Taiwan\u2019s coast guard said it had intercepted the Xing Shun 39 \u2014 a Hong Kong-owned freighter carrying the Cameroonian and Tanzanian flags \u2014 after Taiwan\u2019s biggest telecom company, Chunghwa Telecom, alerted authorities that an international undersea cable had been damaged on Jan. 3.",
      "A \u201cpreliminary assessment\u201d suggested the damage might have been caused by the freighter, which \u201ctransited the area at the time of the incident,\u201d the coast guard said.",
      "With an average of about 200 cable faults a year, according to the International Cable Protection Committee, damage to undersea communications infrastructure is not uncommon. The majority are caused by ship anchors or fishing activity such as trawling, where heavy equipment is dragged across the seafloor.",
      "But the Taiwanese government says this may have been an example of Chinese \u201cgray-zone interference,\u201d irregular military and nonmilitary tactics that aim to wear down an opponent without engaging in an actual shooting war.",
      "It also comes amid an uproar in Europe, where NATO is stepping up patrols of Baltic Sea cables that provide power and enable almost all intercontinental communication, including the internet.",
      "In Helsinki on Tuesday, members of the defense bloc with access to the Baltic Sea agreed at a summit on regional security threats \u2014 including Russian cable sabotage \u2014 to deploy frigates, patrol aircraft and naval drones in the Baltic Sea to help protect critical infrastructure.",
      "NATO members said they reserved the right to take action against ships suspected of posing a security threat as part of a broader action, dubbed \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d in response to\u00a0a string of incidents\u00a0in which power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines have been damaged in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "The damage from the Jan. 3 incident did not disrupt communications in Taiwan, as the data was routed to other cables.",
      "However, \u201cif enough cables were cut you can potentially cause something as severe as an internet blackout,\u201d said Ian Li Huiyuan, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \u201cEspecially for Taiwan\u2019s case, since it\u2019s an island and there\u2019s no overland alternatives.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office said last week that undersea cables were damaged by \u201ccommon maritime accidents\u201d and that Taiwan, which is self-governed but which Beijing claims as its territory, was making accusations \u201cout of thin air\u201d and intentionally hyping up the \u201cso-called gray zone threat,\u201d according to Reuters.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council, which makes China policy, responded that the investigation would proceed based on the evidence.",
      "It said Chinese \u201cflag-of-convenience\u201d ships \u201chave a bad reputation in the international community,\u201d pointing to similar cases in Baltic states in which Chinese vessels were suspected.",
      "The race to protect cables",
      "It can be difficult to determine whether a cable was damaged by accident or deliberately, but heightened geopolitical tensions have raised suspicions of sabotage.",
      "Estonia said last month that it would deploy naval assets to protect cables connecting it with Finland after its Estlink 2 cable was damaged on Christmas Day. Finland is investigating a Russian oil tanker that was seized after the incident and may have been dragging its anchor along the seabed.",
      "\u201cThree cases in one year cannot be a coincidence,\u201d Finnish President Alexander Stubb said last month.",
      "NATO is also deploying at least two ships to the Baltic Sea area for surveillance.",
      "While the alliance\u2019s heightened alert mostly involves Russia\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of smuggling ships, Chinese-owned vessels have come under suspicion as well, including in November when one freighter was detained for weeks in Danish waters after two fiber-optic cables were damaged.",
      "The ship, Yi Peng 3, was alleged to have damaged cables that ran between Sweden and Lithuania and Finland and Germany after leaving the Russian port of Ust-Luga, on the Gulf of Finland. The ship continued its journey after investigators from Sweden and other countries were allowed to board.",
      "Swedish authorities said they were satisfied with the inspection and did not say whether any evidence had been found. China has said it will continue to cooperate with regional authorities in the investigation.",
      "Though European authorities have detained ships when sabotage is suspected, in the absence of concrete proof they have stopped short of directly blaming Moscow or Beijing.",
      "Still, the anxiety in Taiwan is heightened.",
      "\u201cPatrol of undersea cables is really time-consuming. It adds an extra burden and becomes more resource-consuming for the coast guard,\u201d said Yisuo Tzeng, a Taipei-based researcher at Taiwan\u2019s defense ministry-funded Institute for National Defense and Security Research.",
      "The Taiwanese coast guard said that although the intentions of the Xing Shun 39 on Jan. 3 were \u201cimpossible to confirm,\u201d it could not rule out the possibility of the vessel \u201cengaging in gray-zone interference.\u201d",
      "The coast guard said it was unable to board the vessel due to bad weather, but had asked South Korean authorities in Busan, its destination port, to collect evidence.",
      "Data from Marine Traffic showed the freighter making erratic movements that day a few miles off Taiwan\u2019s northern city of Keelung, where a submarine cable connects the island to both the U.S. and China.",
      "Because the cable is also connected to China, some analysts say it may be premature to blame Beijing for the disruption.",
      "\u201cIf there is an outage of a particular cable for half a day, for one hour, we\u2019re talking billions of dollars of investment loss,\u201d said Gerard Parr, who has worked on submarine cable projects and is a professor of telecommunications engineering at the University of East Anglia in Britain.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be gained by this because there\u2019s economic value in maintaining the cable,\u201d he added.",
      "While Chunghwa Telecom has not said which cable was damaged, the Taiwanese giant co-owns the Trans-Pacific Express, a nearly 11,000-mile undersea system that connects Taiwan with China, Japan, South Korea and the U.S.",
      "Companies from all of those places share ownership of the cables.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a shared infrastructure, shared risk situation, because Taiwan and China are part of the same networks. And this fact should not be overlooked,\u201d said Cynthia Mehboob, who studies undersea cables in the Indo-Pacific at the Australian National University.",
      "All seven crew members aboard the freighter were Chinese nationals, the Taiwan coast guard said. It said the ship was owned by a Hong Kong company called Jie Yang Trading, which according to public records was incorporated in 2020.",
      "Its Chinese-national director, Guo Wenjie, denied that his ship was responsible for the damage, saying \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cI spoke to the ship captain and for us it was a normal trip,\u201d he told Reuters.",
      "NBC News was unable to reach Guo.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s suspicion toward Beijing stems in part from a 2023 incident in which the 14,000 people who live on the Taiwan-controlled Matsu islands, close to the Chinese mainland, were disconnected from the internet after two undersea cables connecting the islands were cut.",
      "At the time, authorities said a Chinese fishing vessel and freighter had damaged the cables, but said there was no evidence that it was deliberate.",
      "The same year, another Chinese ship called NewNew Polar Bear damaged a gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland. It took months for Beijing to admit that its ship was responsible, saying it was an accident.",
      "\u201cWhat this has done in recent years is expose the vulnerability of these cables that have been out of sight, out of mind,\u201d Parr said."

      "Sydney\u2019s popular Manly Beach and other beaches around the Australian city were closed on Tuesday as authorities investigated marble-sized balls of white and gray debris that had washed on shore, in the latest such mysterious incident in recent months.",
      "The Northern Beaches Council said most of the samples identified were marble-sized, though some were larger. It said it was organizing the safe removal of the debris, the makeup and origin of which is unknown.",

      "The closures come at the peak of the Australian summer.",
      "The council said it was collecting samples of the debris for testing in close coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency of New South Wales, the state that includes Sydney.",
      "The agency advised members of the public not to touch the balls of debris, which are similar in appearance to those that washed up on beaches in the east of the city in October, including the famous Bondi Beach.",
      "That debris, which was initially thought to be tar balls, was found to be a combination of decomposed cooking oils, hair and food waste."

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court adjourned the opening session of the impeachment trial of suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol within minutes on Tuesday, after the embattled leader did not attend court.",
      "A lawyer advising Yoon had said the president, who has been holed up in his hillside villa in Seoul for weeks, would not attend, saying a bid by authorities to detain him prevented Yoon from expressing his position at the trial.",
      "The next trial session is scheduled for Thursday and if Yoon also does not attend, the trial proceedings will go ahead with his legal team representing him, acting chief justice Moon Hyung-bae said.",

      "\u201cA legitimate warrant must exist, and... it must be legally presented and executed,\u201d which does not mean \u201cjumping fences or damaging property without presenting a warrant,\u201d his lawyer Yoon said, repeating that the current arrest warrant was invalid.",
