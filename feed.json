      "An heirloom piano takes on immense significance for one family in 1936 Pittsburgh in August Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d",
      "An heirloom piano takes on immense significance for one family in 1936 Pittsburgh in August Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d Generational ties also permeate the film adaptation, in which Malcolm Washington follows in his father Denzel Washington\u2019s footsteps in helping to bring the entirety of The Pittsburgh Cycle \u2014 a series of 10 plays \u2014 to the screen.",
      "Malcolm Washington did not start from scratch in his accomplished feature filmmaking debut. He enlisted much of the cast from the recent Broadway revival with Samuel L. Jackson (Doaker Charles), his brother, John David Washington (Boy Willie), Ray Fisher (Lymon) and Michael Potts (Whining Boy). Berniece, played by Danielle Brooks in the play, is now beautifully portrayed by Danielle Deadwyler. With such rich material and a cast for whom it\u2019s second nature, it would be hard, one imagines, to go wrong. Jackson\u2019s own history with the play goes back to its original run in 1987 when he was Boy Willie.",
      "It\u2019s not the simplest thing to make a play feel cinematic, but Malcolm Washington was up to the task. His film opens up the world of the Charles family beyond the living room. In fact, this adaptation, which Washington co-wrote with \u201cMudbound\u201d screenwriter Virgil Williams, goes beyond Wilson\u2019s text and shows us the past and the origins of the intricately engraved piano that\u2019s central to all the fuss. It even opens on a big, action-filled set piece in 1911, during which the piano is stolen from a white family\u2019s home. Another fleshes out Doaker's monologue in which he explains to the uninitiated, Fisher\u2019s Lymon, and the audience, the tortured history of the thing. While it might have been nice to keep the camera on Jackson, such a great, grounding presence throughout, the good news is that he really makes narration shine as well.",
      "Wilson purists will certainly have opinions on these artistic choices; But they let the film breathe a bit, offering some respite from the living room with the looming piano. And most of the film stays right there, in 1936. Boy Willie and Lymon descend early one morning, uninvited, on the Pittsburgh home of Berniece and her uncle Doaker. It\u2019s a family reunion with an agenda: They\u2019ve driven a truck full of watermelons up north from Mississippi, and Willie, Berniece\u2019s younger brother, wants to sell the watermelons and then the piano. The dusty old instrument represents to him a chance to let the past go and start a future. With the money, he wants to buy the land that his enslaved ancestors worked. Berniece has other ideas about the piano, namely keeping it. It\u2019s a connection to the past, not an anchor. Besides, it might be haunted.",
      "Yes, \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d in theaters Friday and streaming on Netflix on Nov. 22, isn\u2019t just a meditation on family history. It\u2019s also a literal ghost story, with creaks, spooks and shadows lurking when the piano is disturbed. Deadwyler is electric as Berniece, who bears the brunt of the haunting, walking on eggshells in her life, trying to care for her young daughter and fend off passes from men who assume she can only be fulfilled with one at her side. Now she must deal with her somewhat manic brother who might, Doaker wisely reminds, actually, annoyingly, have a point. Perhaps the film academy will make up for their snub of her performance in \u201cTill\u201d with this turn.",
      "Regardless of your familiarity with Wilson's Pittsburgh Cycle, \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d is a worthwhile, captivating and moving watch full of charismatic performers. Talent isn\u2019t always genetic, but the Washington family is putting in the work to prove otherwise. And with \u201cFences,\u201d\u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d and now \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d they\u2019re making a mark with a bold and ambitious project that is probably long overdue. Only seven more to go.",
      "\u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d a Netflix release in theaters Friday and streaming Nov. 22, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong language, violent content, some suggestive references and smoking.\u201d Running time: 125 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine has struck a deal to end his current jail stint, agreeing to serve a month behind bars for violating the terms of his release after a felony conviction",
      "NEW YORK -- Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine struck a deal to end his current jail stint, agreeing to serve a month behind bars for violating the terms of his release after a felony conviction, prosecutors said Wednesday.",
      "The deal with federal prosecutors was described in a letter partially endorsed by a Manhattan federal judge. It calls for the entertainer to be sentenced to a month in jail, followed by a month of home incarceration, a month of home detention and a month of curfew. He would also be subject to electronic monitoring.",
      "Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said he will sentence the performer whose real name is Daniel Hernandez immediately after he admits to the violations at a Nov. 12 hearing. He said he will require each side to explain why a one-month jail sentence followed by three months of home incarceration, detention or curfew are sufficient for repeated violations of probation.",
      "The terms of the deal also call for Tekashi 6ix9ine to submit to supervision from the court's Probation Department for another year.",
      "Tekashi 6ix9ine, 28, was within a few months of being free from court supervision when he was arrested on Oct. 29 after his probation officer complained that he wasn't following rules about obtaining permission in advance to travel and that he had failed drug tests.",
      "In 2019, Engelmayer sentenced him to two years in prison in a racketeering case after the musician pleaded guilty that same year to charges accusing him of joining and directing violence by the gang known as the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods.",
      "In April 2020, Tekashi 6ix9ine was freed months early from his prison sentence after complaining that his ailments made him particularly susceptible to the coronavirus, which was spreading through the nation's jails and prisons.",
      "Engelmayer, expressing dismay at the artist's apparent failure to follow the rules, noted at a hearing last month that he had granted compassionate release to him during the coronavirus crisis.",
      "The rapper apologized and told the judge he was \u201cnot a bad person.\u201d"

      "British filmmaker Andrea Arnold specializes in capturing souls, human and otherwise, in soulless environments",
      "\u201cIs it too real for ya?\u201d blares in the background of Andrea Arnold\u2019s latest film, \u201cBird,\u201d a 12-year-old Bailey (Nykiya Adams) rides with her shirtless, tattoo-covered dad, Bug (Barry Keoghan), on his electric scooter past scenes of poverty in working-class Kent.",
      "The song\u2019s question \u2014 courtesy of the Irish post-punk band Fontains D.C. \u2014 is an acute one for \u201cBird.\u201d Arnold\u2019s films ( \u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d \u201cFish Tank\u201d) are rigorous in their gritty naturalism. Her fiction films \u2014 this is her first in eight years \u2014 tend toward bleak, hand-held verit\u00e9 in rough-and-tumble real-world locations. Her last film, \u201cCow,\u201d documented a mother cow separated from her calf on a dairy farm.",
      "Arnold specializes in capturing souls, human and otherwise, in soulless environments. A dream of something more is tantalizing just out of reach. In \u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d peace comes to Star (Sasha Lane) only when she submerges underwater.",
      "In \u201cBird,\u201d though, this sense of otherworldly possibility is made flesh, or at least feathery. After a confusing night, Bailey awakens in a field where she encounters a strange figure in a skirt ( Franz Rogowski ) who arrives, like Mary Poppins, with a gust a wind. His name, he says, is Bird. He has a soft sweetness that doesn\u2019t otherwise exist in Bailey\u2019s hardscrabble and chaotic life.",
      "She\u2019s skeptical of him at first, but he keeps lurking about, hovering gull-like on rooftops. He cranes his neck now and again like he\u2019s watching out for Bailey. And he does watch out for her, helping Bailey through a hard coming of age: the abusive boyfriend (James Nelson-Joyce) of her mother (Jasmine Jobson); her half brother (Jason Buda) slipping into vigilante violence; her father marrying a new girlfriend.",
      "The introduction of surrealism has the ironic effect of breaking the spell that has marked Arnold\u2019s best films. \u201cBird,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, is, like the writer-director\u2019s vivid previous work, a movie only she could make. Arnold has described it as the hardest thing she\u2019s ever created, and it\u2019s easy to applaud her for grasping at something in \u201cBird\u201d that ultimately is just out of reach. A resolutely realistic filmmaker turning to magical realism has the uncomfortable effect of making the whole movie, not just the Rogowski bits, feel inauthentic. Instead of being \u201ctoo real for ya,\u201d \u201cBird,\u201d with its in-your-face poverty and narrative extremes, never feels particularly real at all.",
      "The most incongruous parts of \u201cBird,\u201d though, might not be the mysterious avian friend. (Rogowski, a compelling performer, only ever feels half in the movie, as if \u201cBird\u201d can\u2019t quite commit to him being there, either.) Keoghan is a reliably arresting actor who here feels out of place. He doesn\u2019t seem even vaguely fatherly, and while that might be part of the point, too many other things about Bug feel more performative than genuine. There\u2019s his scheme to use hallucinogenic slime from a toad to pay for his wedding, for starters. Add in some karaoke scenes and the sensation creeps in that \u201cBird\u201d is being less compelled by its own story than it is by a pursuit of Arnold\u2019s previous style.",
      "\u201cBird\u201d may go down as a rare miss for Arnold but you can still see the keenness of her eye and the nimbleness of her camera, with her regular cinematographer Robbie Ryan. And that\u2019s true never so much as when the camera is on Adams, a talent, whose melancholy eyes say more than all the theatrics around her.",
      "\u201cBird,\u201d a Mubi release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201clanguage throughout, some violent content and drug material.\u201d Running time: 118 minutes. Two stars out of four."

      "On election night 2020, Fox News sparked an internal crisis with a bold call that Joe Biden would beat Donald Trump in the crucial state of Arizona, putting the Democrat on the path to victory",
      "Four years ago, Fox News precipitated an internal crisis with a bold election night call that President Joe Biden would beat Donald Trump in the crucial state of Arizona. This year illustrated the difference that four years can make.",
      "Fox News wasn't the first network early on Wednesday to declare Trump had sealed his victory over Kamala Harris \u2014 upstart NewsNation, conservative rival Newsmax and Scripps Networks led the way \u2014 but its ultimate call came nearly four hours before ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and The Associated Press made theirs.",
      "Judging by the cheers that erupted when Fox's call was shown to the Trump faithful gathered at his West Palm Beach victory party, it was a decision that surely was received much better by its viewers than the 2020 call was.",
      "\u201cWhen you don't like how the cake tastes, you're not going to like the recipe,\u201d said Chris Stirewalt, politics editor at NewsNation. \u201cWhen you like the cake, you'll love the recipe.\u201d",
      "Fox's Bret Baier called Trump's victory \u201cthe biggest political phoenix from the ashes story that we have ever seen,\u201d and Fox can claim a comeback of its own.",
      "Fox's Arizona call in 2020 infuriated Trump and many of the network's viewers. While it ultimately proved correct, it set in motion furious internal second-guessing and led some Fox personalities to embrace conspiracy theories, which ultimately cost the network a staggering $787 million to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems.",
      "NewsNation, which used information from the elections forecasting company Decision Desk HQ, made its call at 1:22 a.m. on Wednesday. Scripps and Newsmax, which also use DDHQ, were within a minute of making the same declaration.",
      "At about that time, Baier said that \u201cwe're not there yet,\u201d but noted there was no path to victory for Harris. Fox made its call at 1:47 a.m.",
      "The AP called the election for Trump at 5:34 a.m. ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and the AP all made their calls within a few moments of each other. The AP explained that its declaration that Trump had won came after awarding Wisconsin to the former president by determining that remaining uncounted votes from around the Milwaukee area would not be enough for Harris to overcome Trump's lead there.",
      "For NewsNation's Stirewalt, his network's early call on Wednesday provided a rich irony. He was politics editor at Fox News in 2020 and he and a fellow executive, Bill Sammon, were essentially fired following the outcry over the Arizona call \u2014 even though they were proven right.",
      "\u201cIt would be easy to overstate the results and I want to be careful not to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI will say this, it is a victory for the way things used to be done and a personal vindication.\u201d",
      "He said Decision Desk HQ and NewsNation let the numbers do the talking with their calls. He would not criticize rivals for waiting longer, saying it was a natural reaction to be careful in making race calls following what happened in 2020.",
      "The happiness of some viewers at Fox's call was evident in some social media posts. Fox rejects any suggestion that its calls are politically motivated and its decision desk, led by veteran Arnon Mishkin, is widely respected in the industry. Stirewalt called Mishkin \u201csuperb\u201d and said \u201cit is to Fox's credit that they kept him when they didn't keep Bill Sammon and me.\u201d",
      "A vigorous conservative media ecosystem has built up in recent years to compete with Fox. But the network remains king of the hill, illustrated again Wednesday by the Nielsen company's preliminary ratings of television election night coverage.",
      "Fox averaged 9.7 million viewers for its coverage in the prime-time hours, well above second-place ABC News, which had 5.7 million. Newsmax, Fox's chief rival for conservative viewers, had 947,000 viewers and NewsNation had 237,000, Nielsen said.",
      "\u201cI am extremely proud of our team\u2019s commitment to delivering the top reporting and analysis to the largest and most politically diverse audience in news,\u201d Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott said of Tuesday night\u2019s ratings, according to the network.",
      "Trump's complicated relationship with the network also attests to its continued influence. The Republican candidate was a regular guest on its shows during the campaign, particularly the morning \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d yet also complains bitterly on social media if he doesn't like something that is said there.",

      "After months of reporting on what polls described as a remarkably close race, news outlets finally have the chance to report on actual results",
      "For all the concerns about a tumultuous process that could leave Americans waiting for days to learn who its next president would be, news outlets instead experienced an election night that hewed close to tradition.",
      "Fox News Channel declared Donald Trump had reclaimed the presidency at 1:47 a.m. on Wednesday. Broadcast networks and The Associated Press had Trump on the precipice of returning to the presidency when he took the stage in Florida at 2:25 a.m. to declare victory. \u201cThis is, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,\u201d Trump said onstage at his victory party in West Palm Beach.",
      "His opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, would speak later Wednesday morning, her campaign manager said, dispersing a crowd that had gathered to celebrate her at Howard University.",
      "Broadcast, cable news networks, digital news sites and one streaming service \u2014 Amazon \u2014 covered the count steadily into Wednesday morning. Many of their journalists had warned viewers that determining the winner could be a protracted process that could take several days, like it had in 2020.",
      "Yet from the first hints provided by exit poll results shortly after 5 p.m. Eastern time, the election night story moved methodically in Trump's direction. The dam broke at 11:18 p.m. on Tuesday, when the AP called the first of seven battleground states, North Carolina, for the former president.",
      "The networks moved quickly into the post-mortem stage.",
      "\u201cThis looks a lot more like 2016 to me than 2020,\u201d NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd said, a reference to Trump\u2019s victory that year over Democrat Hillary Clinton.",
      "Fox News Channel pointed to exit poll results that showed Trump making gains among young voters and Latinos. \u201cThe Biden-Harris people pushed them into Trump\u2019s open arms,\u201d said Fox\u2019s Dana Perino, a former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush.",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d Fox News' Brit Hume said, \u201cit's time for his enemies to stop it.\u201d",
      "In his speech, Trump praised his running mate, JD Vance, for \u201cgoing into the enemy camp\u201d for interviews on places like CNN and MSNBC. \u201cHe absolutely obliterated them,\u201d he said.",
      "Hours earlier, when the first exit poll results showed the unpopularity of President Joe Biden and Americans with a dim view of where the country was headed, CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace said that \u201cit would be a miracle if Harris could win with that.\u201d His colleagues, Dana Bash and Audie Cornish, warned him of jumping to conclusions that Harris would be blamed for that, but Wallace sounded more prescient as the night progressed.",
      "\u201cShe was trying to do something as a sitting vice president that had never been done before \u2014 succeed an unpopular president,\u201d Todd said.",
      "Former Sen. Claire McCaskill, an NBC News analyst, said the element of race could not be discounted. Some Americans were more comfortable with President Joe Biden, a white man, than Harris, who was attempting to be the first woman of color to be elected president, she said.",
      "\u201cCan you imagine a woman of color acting the way Donald Trump acted \u2014 even for one day?\u201d CNN analyst Van Jones said. \u201cThe kinds of stuff that he said, the kinds of stuff that he did, the way that he would insult people. If you're a person of color, you don't feel like you have the freedom.\u201d",
      "Trump had \u201ca license to just be a fool, just to be an obnoxious ass ... and he gets to be president,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Due to remarkably close pre-election polls, the outcome was considered a mystery that could take many days to resolve. In his last pre-election prediction, statistician Nate Silver said it was no better than a coin flip, giving an ever-so-slight edge to Harris.",
      "The New York Times' predictive Needle judged the contest a \u201ctoss-up\u201d in the beginning of the evening, leaning slightly toward Trump. But it moved steadily in Trump's direction, to the point where the Times by midnight judged Trump with a 90 percent likelihood of capturing the presidency again.",
      "Also by midnight, CNN's count had Trump leading Harris in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 the so-called blue wall that was central to her strategy for victory.",
      "\u201cIt's not mission impossible\u201d for Harris to come back and win Pennsylvania, CNN's John King said, looking over voter statistics. \u201cBut it's becoming mission improbable.\u201d Within two hours, CNN awarded Pennsylvania to Trump.",
      "For much of the night, the journalists who stood before \u201cmagic boards\u201d \u2014 King, Bill Hemmer on Fox News Channel, Steve Kornacki on MSNBC \u2014 took up much of the airtime with granular reports on results. State-by-state, county-by-county, they showed numbers where Trump was outperforming his 2020 campaign and Harris lagged behind Biden\u2019s results.",
      "If anything, the networks relied too much on their numbers czars than on their reporters.",
      "The presence of actual results were a tonic to news organizations that had weeks \u2014 and an excruciatingly long day of voting \u2014 to talk about an election campaign that polls have repeatedly shown to be remarkably tight. They tried to extract wisdom from anecdotal evidence.",
      "\u201cDixville Notch is a metaphor for the entire race,\u201d CNN\u2019s Alyssa Farah Griffin said, making efforts to draw meaning from the tiny New Hampshire community that reported its 3-3 vote for Harris and Trump in the early morning hours.",
      "Former NBC News anchor Brian Williams, during his one-night leading Amazon's streamcast appearance, had one unexpected guest in the California studio where he was operating. Puck reporter Tara Palmeri was supposed to report from Trump headquarters in West Palm Beach but was denied credentials to attend by the former president's team.",
      "Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita described her as a \u201cgossip columnist\u201d in a post on the social media site X. Palmeri told Williams she had accurately reported some anxiety within the Trump camp about who was voting early.",
      "Neither Axios nor Politico would immediately confirm reports that some of their reporters were similarly banned, and the Trump campaign did not immediately return a call for comment.",

      "Invited to the stage in Pittsburgh, Kelly defended Trump against recent controversies, including his repeated pledge to be the \u201cprotector\u201d of women, and pressed his case on border security and his opposition to transgender athletes participating in sports.",
      "\u201cHe got mocked by the left by saying he would be a protector of women,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe will be a protector of women and it\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for him. He will close the border and he will keep the boys out of women\u2019s sports where they don\u2019t belong.\u201d",

      "Referring to Kelly\u2019s questions during the debate, Trump said, \u201cThere was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\u201d The comment was widely viewed as a sexist reference to menstruation.",

      "After decades in romantic comedies, Hugh Grant has spent the last few years playing narcissists, weirdos and murders, often to the greatest acclaim of his career",
      "NEW YORK -- After some difficulties connecting to a Zoom, Hugh Grant eventually opts to just phone instead.",
      "\u201cSorry about that,\u201d he apologizes. \u201cTech hell.\u201d Grant is no lover of technology. Smart phones, for example, he calls the \u201cdevil\u2019s tinderbox.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re killing us. I hate them,\u201d he says. \u201cI go on long holidays from them, three or four days at at time. Marvelous.\u201d",
      "Hell, and our proximity to it, is a not unrelated topic to Grant\u2019s new film, \u201cHeretic.\u201d In it, two young Mormon missionaries (Chloe East, Sophie Thatcher) come knocking on a door they\u2019ll soon regret visiting. They\u2019re welcomed in by Mr. Reed (Grant), an initially charming man who tests their faith in theological debate, and then, in much worse things.",
      "After decades in romantic comedies, Grant has spent the last few years playing narcissists, weirdos and murders, often to the greatest acclaim of his career. But in \u201cHeretic,\u201d a horror thriller from A24, Grant\u2019s turn to the dark side reaches a new extreme. The actor who once charmingly stammered in \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral\u201d and who danced to the Pointer Sisters in \u201cLove Actually\u201d is now doing heinous things to young people in a basement.",
      "\u201cIt was a challenge,\u201d Grant says. \u201cI think human beings need challenges. It makes your beer taste better in the evening if you\u2019ve climbed a mountain. He was just so wonderfully (expletive)-up.\u201d",
      "\u201cHeretic,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, is directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, co-writers of \u201cA Quiet Place.\u201d In Grant\u2019s hands, Mr. Reed is a divinely good baddie \u2014 a scholarly creep whose wry monologues pull from a wide range of references, including, fittingly, Radiohead's \u201cCreep.\"",
      "In an interview, Grant spoke about these and other facets of his character, his journey from rom-com idol to horror villain and his abiding affection for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d",
      "GRANT: Yes, thank you. It\u2019s not easy for any actor.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s hard to remember which was the writers, which was me. But I\u2019m pretty sure doing the Jar Jar Binks impersonation was my idea.",
      "GRANT: No, I didn\u2019t. I just thought it would be fun if the character did that because it\u2019d be just weird. And, in fact, what\u2019s odd about me is that I\u2019ve never seen a \"Star Wars\u201d film.",
      "GRANT: I can\u2019t. They\u2019re too frightening for me. I watched \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d when I was too young and I\u2019ve been in counseling ever since. I watched one by mistake recently, which was \u201cMidsommar.\u201d I thought it looked like a jolly, Swedish comedy. I put it on one evening for my Swedish wife who needed cheering up and she\u2019s still very, very traumatized.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s fascinating, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t know. Maybe these are the end of times, the end days, the apocalypse. We know it deep down but for some reason we won\u2019t confront it. I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s wonderful that it sends people into the cinemas.",
      "GRANT: It is. Talk about the end of days. To me, one of the gloomiest signs or omens is the gradual closing of cinemas \u2014 and not just that, where I live in London, but the closing of bars. The bar where I met my wife, which was party night every night of the week, is now largely closed. I think the fact that we\u2019re all staying in, staring at our devil\u2019s tinderboxes is deeply tragic, or watching things on streaming by ourselves with maybe one or two other family members. These things should be collective experiences.",
      "GRANT: My ability to gauge what\u2019s entertaining, I used to be very proud of it. In the old days, my old career, I used to say, \u201cI\u2019m not so proud of my acting but I\u2019m proud of the fact that the films I\u2019ve done, on the whole, have been entertaining and I\u2019ve been good at choosing them.\u201d And then, suddenly overnight, I became very bad at choosing them. I don\u2019t know, I lost the zeitgeist, I suppose. That can happen. Now, I feel like I\u2019ve found something again. If the character amuses me and I think I\u2019m going to enjoy being that person, then I tend to do the job. Sometimes, when actors are enjoying it, it works.",
      "GRANT: Yes, I\u2019ve got nothing else to go on. And I\u2019m not the lead character, the film doesn\u2019t rest on me. I don\u2019t have to worry that much if it does well, medium or badly. I just go by: Do I think I\u2019m going to have some fun in this?",
      "GRANT: The big shift was after \u201cDid You Hear About the Morgans?\u201d That was sort of officially the end of romantic comedy for me. Nothing much happened after that in showbiz terms. I went off and did political campaigning and I was quite happy, in fact. But in drips and drabs, strange little projects, like the Wachowskis' \u201cCloud Atlas,\u201d then Stephen Fears came along with \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d and \u201cA Very English Scandal.\u201d \u201cPaddington 2.\u201d These interesting, complex, often not very nice, narcissistic weirdos started to emerge from the woods.",
      "GRANT: Looking back, I was very lucky. I had Richard Curtis on the one hand, who is not only a gifted comic writer \u2013 he can just do flat-out comedy like \u201cBlack Adder\u201d \u2013 but he\u2019s an unrecognized dramatist. Those comedies are based on pain. The comedy is there to deal with pain. It\u2019s people with unrequited love, lost love, bereavement, brothers with mental illness \u2014 proper pain. So I was lucky with him.",
      "And I think I was very lucky with Marc Lawrence who just had a wonderful gift for the celebration of life. He actually likes people, which is so weird. So films like \u201cMusic and Lyrics\u201d have a very sustaining and uplifting buoyancy to them. He\u2019s an unrecognized talent.",
      "GRANT: You know who really loves them? The most surprising person in the world. Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino pushed his way through a crowd at a party in London once to say, (does Tarantino impression) \u201cMan, I loved \u2018Music and Lyrics\u2019 and \u2018Two Weeks Notice.\u2019\u201d He told me the whole plot of both films and how he was watching one of them on a plane and the plane landed and he had to rush off to a DVD shop to buy the disc so he could watch the end of it. I thought maybe he was joking but I don\u2019t think he was. Someone told me at his cinema here in Hollywood, a rather cool, 35mm-showing theater, he\u2019s been showing \u201cMusic and Lyrics,\u201d no less.",
      "GRANT: Yes, my enthusiasm for that film has spread. I\u2019ve just been invited to a 60th anniversary next year in Salzburg. I might go. I might wear lederhosen. Or I might wear a white dress with a blue satin sash, as I did in school when I played Brigitta Von Trapp.",
      "GRANT: Yeah, I was at all-boys English school and I played, I think, the third youngest daughter.",
      "GRANT: The older I get the more I love song and dance. I find myself watching a lot more Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, things like that. Because life is so stressful and the news is so ghastly that it\u2019s hard to watch very serious stuff and pick yourself up afterwards. I did watch \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d coming over from London the other day. And I have to say that\u2019s just about as good as filmmaking gets. Short of \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d obviously.",
      "GRANT: Yes, weirdly it has, and it\u2019s hard to say why. Is it a sort of exorcism or something? I don\u2019t know. Way back in my 20s, when I started out acting, the only thing I thought I could ever bring to entertainment was doing silly characters, doing voices. I did them as a kid to the point where I drove people mad. I was never myself. My parents and my school teachers used to say, \u201cCome on, just drop it. Who\u2019s the real Hugh Grant?\u201d So it was a bit weird to have a career as a leading-man romantic comedies where I didn\u2019t get to be anyone unusual or weird. So I feel like this is something I can do, and quite like doing. At the same time, I learned some tricks of film acting and got a little bit better.",
      "GRANT: The big thing for me was I learned to trust myself a bit more when you\u2019re actually in front of the camera. There\u2019s a terrible danger when people do film acting. They\u2019re so frightened of this big, pressure moment that\u2019s coming up that they sort of pre-rehearse and think, \u201cI\u2019m going to say the line this way, and it\u2019s excellent that way, and I shall just try to reproduce that on the day.\u201d But that\u2019s no good. You\u2019ve got to reinvent it on the day.",
      "The prep work should not be how you\u2019re going to say the lines, the prep work should be \u2014 well, for me, anyway \u2014 a kind of absurdly prolonged in-depth marinade like a piece of old meat that you leave soaking for weeks and months in sauce until it\u2019s full of flavor. So my marinade takes the form of very, very painstaking, minute examination of the script: Why do I say this? Why do I do this? What happened in childhood for this person to behave like this? What was his mother like? What was his father like?",
      "In the case of Mr. Reed in \u201cHeretic,\u201d it\u2019d be: Let\u2019s look at some serial killers. Let\u2019s look at some cult leaders. Let\u2019s look at some atheists. It\u2019s funny how important costume is. Suddenly some thing, one thing, one visual, physical thing makes you go: That\u2019s him. With Mr. Reed it was the idea of double denim. I don\u2019t actually wear double denim in the film but I realized, yes, he\u2019s Mr. Double Denim. He thinks he\u2019s a groovy teacher at university, the one who\u2019s down with the kids, making jokes.",
      "GRANT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. But doing it on those romantic comedies, I\u2019m not sure I really got anywhere particularly. I wasn\u2019t really creating monsters. It\u2019s easier when you\u2019re creating monsters. I\u2019m fascinated by the bizarre, weird distortions that human beings twist themselves into emotionally, intellectually, physically from the trials and tribulations of life. I\u2019m not sure that any of my characters in the romantic comedies were sufficiently twisted to fully get my juices flowing.",
      "GRANT: Not necessarily from the point of view of religion. But there is a part of me \u2014 probably a not very attractive part of me \u2014 that likes to smash people\u2019s idols. Anyone I feel is being a bit too smug or too pretentious, I don\u2019t like to see that. I like to just take them apart a little bit. My mother did it. She didn\u2019t like me or my brother being too up and she\u2019d find some way to bring us back to ground level.",
      "GRANT: I agree.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s a very good question that I do not have the answer to. As a matter of fact, there is one thing sitting on my desk in the other room here which is pretty weird and relatively fresh. I agree, I\u2019m not quite sure where to go from here. Maybe it\u2019s song and dance."

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Pop superstar Taylor Swift returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Monday night to see the Kansas City Chiefs and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after wrapping up the U.S. leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.",
      "It wound up being a good night for both of them.",
      "Swift was able to celebrate Kelce's big night, which included 14 catches for 100 yards in a driving rain, along with a victory for the Chiefs. They trailed by a touchdown in the fourth quarter, scored twice to take the lead, then headed to overtime, where they won the coin toss and drove for a touchdown that gave them a 30-24 win.",
      "Kelce, who had fumbled earlier in the game, had two of his catches on the decisive drive in overtime. His total receptions was a career-best for a regular-season game, matching a 14-catch performance in a 2023 playoff win over Jacksonville, while his 16 targets from Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was just one shy of his career high.",
      "\u201cHe does a great job of finding space,\u201d Mahomes said, \u201cand I think with having DeAndre (Hopkins) out there, it takes pressure off where not all the attention is on him the entire time. And whenever he gets going, man, he's hard to stop.\u201d",
      "Swift is finally getting a chance to stop herself after playing the last of three shows at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Sunday to conclude the U.S. portion of her tour. The rest of her tour heads to Canada with the first of six shows at Rogers Centre in Toronto on Nov. 14 and three shows in December at BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. Since then, the two have spent plenty of time together, often with cameras following every move.",
      "Swift's arrival in a black outfit and Chiefs coat Monday night came on the eve of the presidential election, in which the 14-time Grammy winner has thrown her support behind Vice President Kamala Harris. That generated a stir when Harris' rival, Donald Trump, began to reference Swift's friend and Mahomes' wife, Brittany, as a supporter of his campaign.",
      "Patrick Mahomes has declined to endorse anyone in the election, instead urging people to register to vote.",

      "As dusk falls over the City of Light, a new spectacle is illuminating Saint-Sulpice church, a monument whose interiors are even larger than Notre Dame\u2019s",
      "PARIS -- As dusk falls over the City of Light, a new spectacle is illuminating Saint-Sulpice church, a monument whose interiors are even larger than Notre Dame's \u2014 and arguably just as breathtaking.",
      "The cavernous walls of the neoclassical gem on Paris' Left Bank are coming alive with 360-degree video projections, sparkling cutting-edge technology and actors, all telling the story of the church and its place in French history.",
      "Blending centuries of intrigue, revolution and family drama, the show reimagines the Saint-Germain district during the Fronde, the 17th-century civil war, and the lead-up to the French Revolution.",
      "\u201cParis C\u0153ur de Lumi\u00e8res\u201d (Paris Chancel of Lights), which runs until Nov. 23, transforms the church\u2019s sprawling 6,000-square-meter (65,000-square-foot) interior into a digital stage through advanced video mapping.",
      "\u201cFrom a technological standpoint, it\u2019s a laser scan of the entire building that allows us to reconstruct the space in three dimensions,\u201d director Damien Fontaine explained.",
      "\u201cWe then \u2018unfold\u2019 it like origami ... and put it back into 3D to be projected as a single unified image. We have over 45 projectors, each covering a part of the vaults, a section of a pillar, or a piece of the nave. It\u2019s ... a mosaic of images to form one large picture.\u201d",
      "Projections transform stone carvings into animated storytellers, while immersive soundscapes, paired with an original score, wrap the audience in a sensory experience.",
      "The actors brought history to life. Over 350 performers and volunteers, clad in more than 500 historical costumes, move among the audience portraying local families and rivalries, threading personal narratives into the broader history.",
      "Many of those who volunteered themselves marveled at learning about little known aspects of French history.",
      "Anne Dubosc, a 65-year-old amateur actress, played Anne of Austria, mother of Sun King Louis XIV.",
      "\u201cShe was a remarkable woman, very involved in politics and religion,\u201d Dubosc said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realized how important she was. If Louis XIV became the man he was, it was partly thanks to this woman, this mother who was like a tigress, doing everything to protect her son and teaching him to be a great statesman.\u201d",
      "Performing in Saint-Sulpice, she added, was extraordinary: \u201cIt\u2019s exceptional. You lose track of what\u2019s happening, of where fiction ends and history begins.\u201d",
      "Her historic costume shaped her performance \u2014 literally.",
      "\u201cI have a corset that squeezes me so tightly,\u201d she said. \u201cYou realize there\u2019s a very 18th-century way of holding yourself, of carrying your shoulders and neck, which gives a natural majesty. The costume really impacts how you carry your body, and that posture influences your mind, giving character to this woman of state.\u201d",
      "The production underscored a growing trend in Paris of using light technology to show off the city's storied church interiors. A similar illuminations display took place at Saint-Eustache church until September, featuring video projections, lighting effects and spatialized electronic soundtrack.",

      "To mark 30 years of his career, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli has released a new compilation album, \u201cDuets,\u201d featuring previously released and new collaborations across some of his best-known work",
      "NEW YORK -- It's one of the most immediately recognizable voices on the planet: Andrea Bocelli's tenor is beloved across generations, cultures and borders, known to induce tears in as few as three simple words: \u201cCon Te Partir\u00f2,\u201d or in its English performance, \u201cTime to Say Goodbye.\u201d",
      "This year, he's celebrating the 30th anniversary of his career with a new compilation album, \u201cDuets,\u201d featuring both previously released and brand-new collaborations of his best-known work \u2014 as well as a few surprising contemporary covers \u2014 and the release of a new concert film, \u201cAndrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration,\u201d which will arrive in theaters on Friday.",
      "So, why duets?",
      "\u201cI've loved voices since when I was a child, and I like very much to share the stage with the best artists and voices. So, this album, there are the best duets that I did in my life,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cFrom the first, \u2018The Prayer\u2019 with Celine Dion, until the last, like \u2018Perfect\u2019 with Ed Sheeran and many, many others. And the album has been remastered and remixed. So, I hope the sound can be better.\"",
      "He says: \u201cThe most important thing in voices... is to be recognizable, to give emotion.\"",
      "Sheeran was an interesting collaboration because when Bocelli first attempted to sing \u201cPerfect,\" the English singer-songwriter wasn't a fan. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like what I did because I sang in a pop style,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe wanted to listen to my voice, like in an operatic style.\u201d So, Sheeran traveled to Bocelli's home in Tuscany, and the song was transformed. \u201cHe was right because this song had a huge success.\u201d",
      "When asked if there is anyone he would've loved to add to the \u201cDuets\u201d collection, Bocelli says of course \u2014 but \u201cthey passed away before I began to sing. For example, I would like very much to sing with Maria Callas or (Renata) Tebaldi or Magda Olivero. Many great, incredible singers. They are not anymore with us, unfortunately.\u201d",
      "Three decades into his career, Bocelli has performed for presidents, popes, and sold-out stadiums across the globe \u2014 in addition to having sold nearly 90 million records worldwide, according to a press release. \u201cReality exceeded my wildest dreams,\u201d he says.",
      "How he reflects on that time should come as no surprise. \u201cI like to sing to the future. Honestly, I don\u2019t like to think with nostalgia to the past,\" he says. \u201cMy first time on stage, for me it is like yesterday. The time is gone so quickly, so fast. And, yeah, now I like to think to the future.\u201d",
      "So, what, then, does he hope becomes his legacy in the next 30 years, 300 years? \u201cIn Italy, we have a very famous expression: The people that come after us will judge us,\u201d he says with a translator. \u201cSo I can\u2019t force the judge(ment) of the people. But I feel that my audience has a big affection for me, and this is my goal. When somebody in the street comes to me and says (to) me, \u2018Thank you for your voice, for your music,\u2019 I think mission is accomplished.\"",
      "Across \u201cDuets,\u201d Bocelli sings in Italian, English, French and Spanish. \u201cThere are many languages, but it\u2019s so difficult. I remember the day I tried to sing in Chinese, only few lines, but it has been so hard for me,\u201d he laughs.",
      "He also performs across genres, working with everyone from Latin superstars like Karol G and Jennifer Lopez to country musicians like Chris Stapleton and Shania Twain. \u201cI would like to try to sing jazz,\" he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s too difficult for me because you must live in an atmosphere, to learn step by step, day by day. I like jazz but it\u2019s too far from the experience of my life.\u201d",
      "There is little he hasn't done across these last three decades, but the ultimate goal now, he says, is steeped in faith. \u201cI have been very lucky and I reached the affection of the people. Now I must try to deserve the affection of the God. It\u2019s more difficult.\"",
      "But he will continue to perform for those who love him. On Dec. 4, Bocelli's U.S. tour kicks off in San Diego and runs through the month, before commencing again in February and June 2025. The final dates will be held in Napa Valley, California, on June 21 and 22."

      "Quincy Jones has died at age 91",
      "Quincy Jones, the multitalented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson\u2019s historic \u201cThriller\u201d album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.",
      "Jones\u2019 publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family. Jones was to have received an honorary Academy Award later this month.",
      "\u201cTonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones\u2019 passing,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cAnd although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.\u201d",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and leaving behind a vast musical catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American song and rhythm. Over the past half century, it was hard to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with Jones\u2019 name on it or someone in the music, television or movie industries who did not have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \u201cRoots\u201d and \u201cIn the Heat of the Night,\u201d organized President Clinton\u2019s first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \u201cWe Are the World.\u201d",
      "In a career that began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, singling out any work seems unfair. But honors likely go to his productions with Jackson on \u201cOff the Wall,\u201d \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cBad,\u201d albums universal in their style and appeal. Jones\u2019 versatility and imagination fit perfectly with the bursting talents of Jackson as he sensationally transformed from child star to the \u201cKing of Pop.\u201d On such classic tracks as \u201cBillie Jean\u201d and \u201cWanna Be Startin\u2019 Somethin\u2019,\u201d Jones and Jackson drew upon disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \u201cThriller,\u201d some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-defying \u201cBeat It\u201d and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\u201cThriller\u201d sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone, helped Jackson become the first major Black artist to have a video played on MTV and influenced countless performers.",
      "\u201cMichael had the look and the voice, and I had every sound you can think of,\u201d Jones would explain.",
      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \u201cQ\u201d: 28 Grammys (out of 80 nominations), an honorary Academy Award and an Emmy for \u201cRoots.\u201d He also received France\u2019s Legion d\u2019Honneur and the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy. In 2001, Jones was named a Kennedy Center Honoree for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \u201cListen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones,\u201d and his memoir made him a bestselling author.",
      "\u201cDespite all the Grammys and the special awards and testimonials that maturity bestows, it will always be the values you carry within yourself \u2014 of work, love, and integrity \u2014 that carry the greatest worth, because these are what get you through with your dreams intact, your heart held firm and your spirit ready for another day,\u201d he wrote in his book.",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, telling Oprah Winfrey that \u201cThere are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don\u2019t. Nothing\u2019s in between.\u201d Jones\u2019 mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \u201csenseless\u201d for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "Music was his passion, and, almost literally, his salvation. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\u201cI went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cThat\u2019s where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\u201d",
      "Within a few years he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\u201cWe had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\u201d Jones later told Musician magazine. \u201cThat\u2019s when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\u201d",
      "His survivors include actor Rashida Jones and five other daughters: Jolie Jones Levine, Rachel Jones, Martina Jones, Kidada Jones and Kenya Kinski-Jones; son Quincy Jones III; brother Richard Jones and sisters Theresa Frank and Margie Jay.",

      "Three clucks to Sy Montgomery, who 14 years after publishing \u201cBirdology,\u201d is still finding ways to make money off the charming stories she told in that book about various avian species. \u201cWhat the Chicken Knows,\u201d subtitled \u201cA New Appreciation of the World\u2019s Most Familiar Bird\u201d was a chapter in \u201cBirdology,\u201d but is being re-released as a mini hardcover.",
      "Readers who haven\u2019t read it will be, briefly, captivated. In just 67 pages (16 of which are glossy color photographs) Montgomery introduces us to her \u201cLadies,\u201d the ever-changing flock of hens she raised on her New Hampshire farm for decades starting in the 1980\u2019s. Blending her personal experiences as queen of the coop with everything you\u2019ve ever wanted to know about chicken behavior, it\u2019s a fun and informative way to spend an hour.",
      "Here\u2019s a sampling of what you\u2019ll learn: Chickens outnumber people 4:1, they have more in common, anatomically, with dinosaurs than humans, you can mail order up to 350 different varieties of chicks, and roosters really are much meaner than hens. Montgomery sprinkles in those facts and plenty more as she shares stories about how her chickens behaved over the years and what they taught her about \u201chow rich and varied their lives are, as fraught and joyous and changeable as our own.\u201d",
      "Montgomery is wary of anthropomorphizing her feathered friends, so while she names them, she also tells plenty of stories that could be rebranded for a TV show called \u201cWhen Chickens Attack!\u201d The funniest involves her minister, who makes the mistake of running his hand down one of the hens\u2019 backs, a gesture that makes them assume a distinctive mating crouch. Across the yard, Alex \u201csaw a moral travesty, an insult to his roosterhood: the minister was trying to have sex with his hen.\u201d The minister survives the bloody \u201cspurs first\u201d attack to the back of his calves, but learns to tend his own flock.",
      "\u201cWhat the Chicken Knows\u201d joins \u201cA Hummingbird\u2019s Gift\u201d and \u201cThe Hawk\u2019s Way\u201d as standalone mini-books pulled from the pages of \u201cBirdology.\u201d Each has a new introduction by the author and would make nice stocking stuffers for bird lovers in anyone\u2019s life.",

My life changed forever for the better after meeting him. I had never experienced, nor have since, anyone who\u2019s heart was so filled with love. He walked around with his heart wide open, and he treated everybody as if they were the most important person he\u2019d ever met. He was the Light. No shadows. He was love lived out loud in human form and he was the first person I ever loved unconditionally. That\u2019s how we signed all our notes to each other, \u201cUnconditionally\u2026\u201d Oprah Winfrey on Instagram.",
      "\u2014 \u201cHe was supremely talented, and I felt privileged to have known him for many years. He was friends with George Martin, the Beatles\u2019 producer and, between the two of them, produced some very fine music. Quincy or \u2018Quince\u2019 or \u2018Q\u2019, as he was known, always had a twinkle in his eye and had a very positive, loving spirit which infected everyone who knew him. His work with Michael Jackson is, of course, legendary and he had so many other strings to his musical bow,\u201d Paul McCartney on Instagram.",
      "\u2014 \"Quincy is the reason why I decided to become a record producer. His records were my go-to when I started engineering. All of the time that I spent hanging out with him was priceless and I love how open he was- the advice he gave me, the conversations we had have helped me in my life and career. Forever inspired by the incomparable Quincy Jones,\u201d Dr. Dre, on Instagram.",
      "\u2014 \u201cI was honored to call Quincy a friend. I will always remember his generosity of spirit, his selfless support, and his deep kindness. Our world has lost a giant.

He inspired me. He checked me when he needed to. He let me use his wings until mine were strong enough to fly,\u201d - Will Smith on Instagram.",
      "\u2014 \u201cI am speechless at the moment. What this man means to me goes extremely deep. What a life. What an expression of authenticity. What a teacher. I am humbled that I was given the gift of your openness and friendship. I am still processing,\u201d Lenny Kravitz on X.",

      "The orchestra said Monday it issued a notice of non-reengagement to the two effective Sept. 21, 2025.",
      "Wang and Muckey were fired in September 2018 following allegations of misconduct dating to 2010. Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians filed a grievance and the two were ordered reinstated in April 2020 by arbitrator Richard I. Bloch. Both men deny any wrongdoing.",
      "New York Magazine in April detailed allegations and the two were placed on paid leave. They then sued the orchestra and the union.",
      "Local 802's executive board said in a nine-page decision issued Tuesday that every member of the orchestra's nine-member dismissal review committee \u201cexpressed revulsion at the abuse of power and pattern of behavior.\u201d",
      "Philharmonic executive adviser Deborah Borda said 11 women made accusations against Wang and three against Muckey during the latest investigation.",
      "\u201cIt found that both gentlemen had been involved in sexual abuse and rape as well as abuse of power,\u201d Borda said. \u201cThis is all new information that came out and I think the reason is that people were afraid to speak up before and they are not now.\u201d",
      "Borda said some of the allegations were made by students.",
      "Steven J. Hyman, a lawyer for Muckey, accused the union of a \"baseless smear campaign, ignoring clear evidence to the contrary.\"",
      "\u201cLocal 802\u2019s decision is deeply troubling and raises serious questions about potential collusion with the philharmonic in their effort to terminate Matthew Muckey without just cause,\u201d Hyman said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThey reference an alleged encounter from 2008 with a young woman, claiming she did not provide meaningful consent; however, contemporaneous text messages directly contradict this allegation.\u201d",
      "Alan S. Lewis, a lawyer for Wang, called the union's decision \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "\u201cTroublingly, the philharmonic has gone down the road of public character assassination instead of due process, throwing a lot of mud against the wall to see what sticks,\u201d he wrote Monday in an email to The Associated Press. Lewis described the most serious allegation against Wang involving a person unaffiliated with the orchestra and \"with whom, more than a decade ago, Liang had a long-term consensual relationship.\u201d",
      "He called the other allegations against Wang false.",
      "The philharmonic this spring hired Tracey Levy of Levy Employment Law to investigate and issued a letter of non-re-engagement on Oct. 15 following Levy\u2019s conclusions that the orchestra said were based on new accusations. Muckey said in his lawsuit the New York Magazine story contained \"a reiteration of the same 2010 allegations.\"",
      "The guild's executive committee decision said in Wang's case 11 witnesses \u201ctestified to specific instances of rape, sexual assault, grooming of a young female musician, inappropriate touching and comments, unwelcome kissing, and other sexually harassing behavior.\u201d",
      "The report said a woman six years younger than Muckey testified they \u201chad sex when she was 18 years old and was too incapacitated by alcohol to voluntarily consent.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile the allegations concerning Muckey are not as numerous as those involving Wang, we cannot ignore the fact that they demonstrate a similar abuse of power and failure to acknowledge the importance of a woman\u2019s consent to sexual relations,\u201d the report said.",
      "Under the orchestra\u2019s labor contract, the philharmonic must give notice of a non-reengagement by the Feb. 15 prior to the season in question. The two had the right to contest the decision, which the orchestra said must be \u201cappropriate\u201d under the collective bargaining agreement instead of a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard.",
      "\u201cLocal 802\u2019s decision is not to arbitrate the termination,\u201d local 802 president Sara Cutler wrote in an email to the orchestra members on Monday.",
      "The executive board's unanimous report said it was not determining whether criminal conduct took place but only \u201cwhether the notices of non-reengagement were appropriate.\u201d",
      "\u201cConsidering the 11 witnesses who testified about Wang\u2019s pattern of sexual violence and harassment over many years, we do not credit his denials or failure to remember these events,\u201d the report said. \u201cWith respect to Muckey, we similarly do not find his denials sufficient to overcome the testimony of the witness whom the investigator found credible and the pattern of conduct she described. Additionally, the lack of any contrition and the absence of any empathy shown towards the victims reinforces our view that the dismissal was appropriate.\u201d",
      "The report said two-thirds of the orchestra members had said they would refuse to appear on stage with the two.",
      "Muckey was hired by the orchestra in June 2006 and was given tenure in January 2008. Wang was hired as principal oboe in September 2006.",
      "\u201cThey are barred from the building,\u201d Borda said. \u201cThey will never appear on the stage again with the philharmonic.\u201d"

      "Peter Ames Carlin writes a cultural history of the rock bank in \u201cThe Name of This Band is R",
      "The best way to read \u201cThe Name of This Band is R.E.M.\u201d is with a pair of headphones and a collection of the band's albums on streaming services or CDs. Opt for the cassettes or vinyl if you want to go old school.",
      "Peter Ames Carlin's book isn't just a cultural biography of the band going back to its formation in the-then sleepy college town of Athens, Georgia. It's also a poetic meditation on what made so many of the band's songs stand out, and continue to shine.",
      "\u201cIt was a new kind of post-punk, alternative music that straddled obscurity and directness, dissent and delicacy, unapologetic and unashamed pure pop,\u201d he writes about the reaction to the band's music in the early 1980s.",
      "Carlin's book offers plenty of behind the scenes details and trivia about R.E.M.'s rise. Fans will enjoy reading about how record executives were wary of making \u201cLosing My Religion,\u201d the band's iconic hit, the first single from its album \u201cOut of Time.\u201d",
      "It's also a fascinating history of a different era in music before social media created viral stars, when bands like R.E.M. rose up through college radio. The early sections of the book offer a vivid description of the music scene in Athens and the band's beginning.",
      "The book also explores the band's political activism, including their work on environmental causes and promotion of the Rock the Vote campaign.",
      "The band members didn't agree to interviews for Carlin's book, and that's one of the few weaknesses of what is an otherwise well-researched history. Anyone hoping to discover major new revelations about the band and its members will likely be disappointed, but Carlin ably demonstrates the impact R.E.M.'s music has had and why its history is worth revisiting.",

      "\u201cMpox is very infectious in households with close contact and so it is not unexpected to see further cases within the same household,\u201d said Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor of the U.K. Health Security Agency.",
      "The new variant of mpox was first detected earlier this year in eastern Congo. Scientists believe it causes milder symptoms that are harder to notice, which makes it easier to spread because people may not know they are infected. Its spread in Congo and elsewhere in Africa prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency in August.",
      "Britain recorded more than 3,000 cases of another type of mpox during a 2022 outbreak that hit more than 100 countries.",
      "The new variant of mpox has also caused outbreaks in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Single cases in travelers have also been reported in Sweden, India, Germany and Thailand.",
      "To date, there have been about 43,000 suspect cases of mpox in Africa, including more than 1,000 deaths, mostly in Congo.",
      "On Wednesday, WHO said it had allocated 899,900 vaccine doses to nine African countries struggling with mpox epidemics.",

      "RICHMOND, Va. -- U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat representing Virginia's most populous county in Congress, said Thursday that he is battling esophageal cancer.",
      "The announcement comes after Connolly, 74, handily won his ninth House term on Tuesday by defeating Republican Mike Van Meter, a Navy veteran and former FBI agent, in Virginia's 11th District.",
      "\u201cI will attack this the only way I know how \u2013 with Irish fight and humor,\u201d Connolly said in a statement.",

Last year, a man with a history of mental illness went to Connolly's Fairfax, Virginia, district office looking to kill him with a baseball bat.

      "Health officials say it's important to get flu and COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the holidays when respiratory bugs tend to spread",
      "WASHINGTON -- If you missed the early fall push for flu and COVID-19 vaccines, it's not too late.",
      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",
      "And that coincides with flu season, which tends to start in November or December and peak in January or February.",
      "It takes the body about two weeks to build up immunity after either shot \u2014 meaning vaccination is needed before these viruses start spreading. A lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.",
      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",
      "\u201cIt may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.\u201d",
      "Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot.",
      "\u201cOur best defense to protect ourselves, our loved ones and all those around us is a simple shot,\u201d Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a recent statement.",
      "While it may have faded from the headlines, the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year.",
      "\u201cMaybe we believe that it\u2019s not going to be me but let\u2019s not take a chance,\u201d said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. \u201cWhy not get a vaccine that\u2019s going to help you reduce that risk?\u201d",
      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",
      "About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access. Call your local health department to ask about options.",
      "Check the government website, vaccines.gov, for availability at local pharmacies.",

    "story": [
      "Federal health officials are calling for more testing and treatment of workers on farms with bird flu",
      "Federal health officials on Thursday called for more testing of employees on farms with bird flu after a new study showed that some dairy workers had signs of infection, even when they didn't report feeling sick.",
      "Farmworkers in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered treatment even if they show no symptoms, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new guidance comes after blood tests for 115 farmworkers in Michigan and Colorado showed that eight workers \u2014 or 7% \u2014 had antibodies that indicated previous infection with the virus known as Type A H5N1 influenza.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the transmission of H5 to humans and to reduce the possibility of the virus changing,\u201d Shah told reporters.",
      "The CDC study provides the largest window to date into how the bird virus first detected in March in dairy cows may be spreading to people. It suggests that the virus has infected more humans than the 46 farmworkers identified in the U.S. as of Thursday. Nearly all were in contact with infected dairy cows or infected poultry.",
      "Outside experts said it\u2019s notable that the study prompted the CDC to take new action. Previous recommendations called for testing and treating workers only when they had symptoms.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant move towards the assessment that these H5N1 viruses are a greater risk than the CDC estimated before,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "Every additional infection in animals or humans gives the virus the chance to change in potentially dangerous ways, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt shows yet again that we are not responding effectively to the H5N1 cattle outbreak in humans or animals and if we continue to let this virus spread and jump from species to species, our luck will eventually run out,\u201d Rasmussen said in an email.",
      "The CDC study included 45 workers in Michigan and 70 in Colorado tested between June and August. Of the eight workers with positive blood tests, four reported no symptoms. All eight cleaned milking parlors and none used respiratory protection such as face masks. Three said they used eye protection.",
      "High levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows, increasing the risk of exposure and infection, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said that efforts to monitor dairy workers for illness have been hindered by several barriers including the reluctance of farm owners and farmworkers to allow testing.",
      "Rasmussen and others have criticized the federal response to the outbreak as too slow and \u201clackluster.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese studies should have been performed months ago and should have been prioritized,\u201d she said.",
      "The virus has been confirmed in at least 446 cattle herds in 15 states. Last week, the Agriculture Department said a pig at an Oregon farm was confirmed to have bird flu, the first time the virus was detected in U.S. swine.",

      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- A former health care worker who illegally accessed the health records of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she died was sentenced Thursday to two years in prison.",
      "Trent Russell, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, who worked at the time as a transplant coordinator for the Washington Regional Transplant Community and had access to hospital records all over the region, was convicted earlier this year of illegally accessing health care records and destroying or altering records at a jury trial.",
      "He was also charged with publishing that information on the internet in 2019, at a time when public speculation about Ginsburg's health and her ability to serve as a justice was a matter of public debate. Prosecutors said he posted the information along with a false claim that Ginsburg had already died. But the jury acquitted Russell on that count.",
      "Ginsburg served on the court until her death in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors said Russell disclosed the health records on forums that trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories, including conspiracy theories that Ginsburg was dead, but Russell's motivations for his actions were unclear. Indeed, Russell himself never admitted that he accessed the records, at one point suggesting that perhaps his cat walked across the keyboard in a way that mistakenly called up Ginsburg's data.",
      "Russell's excuses and refusal to accept responsibility prompted blistering critiques from prosecutors, who sought a 30-month sentence.",
      "\u201cHe offered completely implausible excuses with a straight face,\u201d prosecutor Zoe Bedell said.",
      "Russell's lawyer, Charles Burnham, sought a sentence of probation or home detention. He cited Russell's work saving lives as a transplant coordinator and his military record which included a deployment to Afghanistan as mitigating factors.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell has lived a quietly heroic life,\u201d Burnham wrote in court papers. He chalked up the criminal conduct to \u201cbeing stupid.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff's 24-month sentence , calling his crime \u201ctruly despicable conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have made it extremely difficult to understand what motivated you,\u201d Nachmanoff said. He said Russell made matters worse by lying to investigators and on the witness stand.",
      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",
      "Russell and his lawyer declined to comment after Thursday's hearing on whether they plan to appeal."

The Brazilian online sports gambling addict lowered his profile after a loan shark threatened to put bullets in his head if he didn\u2019t pay up.",
      "Broke and embarrassed, King sought treatment and support earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI was once addicted to slot machines, but then sports betting was so easy that I changed. I got carried away all the time,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "King\u2019s story is that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years. The country has become the third-biggest market in the world for sports betting, following the U.S. and the U.K., a report by data analysis company Comscore said last year. But unlike those countries, rampant advertising and sponsorship have been coupled with an unregulated market. The government is now \u2014 belatedly, some say \u2014 striving to get a handle on the epidemic.",
      "On a recent evening, King's Gamblers Anonymous meeting took place in an improvised classroom inside a church, with coffee and cookies to keep everyone awake, and supportive messages scrawled onto the blackboard. One that's become ubiquitous in Brazil and beyond: \u201cOnly for today I will avoid the first bet.\u201d",
      "King and other attendees, all Christian, started a prayer and the meeting began.",
      "King said his financial problems arose from his addiction to online sports betting, chiefly on soccer.",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for Brazilians embracing sports betting. King said he transformed almost every sale during that time into a bet. His hook was the non-stop advertising on TV, radio, social media as well as sponsorship of local soccer teams' jerseys. He asked for bank loans to pay his gambling debts and then, to cover those, went to the moneylender. His total debt now amounts to 85,000 reais ($15,000) \u2014 impossible to pay off with his monthly income of 8,000 reais.",
      "Digging oneself out of debt in Brazil is especially daunting with its sky-high interest rates. Loans from Brazilian banks could add interest of almost 8% per month to the borrowed sum, and from loan sharks could be even more.",
      "Four Gamblers Anonymous meetings attended by the AP in October featured discussions about difficulties paying down debts, forcing working-class members to postpone housing payments and cancel family vacations.",
      "Some members of impoverished Brazilian families have used welfare money for betting instead of paying for groceries and housing, official data suggests. In August, beneficiaries of Brazil\u2019s flagship program Bolsa Familia spent 3 billion reais ($530 million) on sports betting, according to a report from the central bank. That was more than 20% of the program\u2019s total outlay in the month.",
      "Sports betting was made legal in 2018 in a bill signed by former President Michel Temer. The subsequent turmoil has recently been setting off alarm bells, with addicts venting on social media and media reports of people losing huge sums.",
      "On Oct. 1, the economy ministry prevented more than 2,000 betting companies from operating in Brazil for having failed to provide all the required documents. Soccer-loving President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in an interview on Oct. 17 that he will shut down the entire market in Brazil if his administration\u2019s new regulations \u2014 presented at the end of July\u2014 fail to work. And Brazil\u2019s Senate on Oct. 25 opened an investigation into betting companies, focusing on crime and addiction.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tax evasion, money laundering of organized crime, the use of influencers to trick people into betting. These companies need to be audited,\u201d Sen. Soraya Thronicke, who proposed the inquiry, told journalists in Brasilia.",
      "S\u00e9rgio Peixoto, a ride-sharing app driver in Rio, is one of many lower-middle-income Brazilians who have reduced their spending due to sports betting debt. Peixoto\u2019s debt currently amounts to 25,000 reais ($4,400). His monthly income is four times less than that.",
      "\u201cIt stopped being a game, it wasn\u2019t fun. I just wanted to get the money back, so I lost even more,\u201d said Peixoto, 26. \u201cI could have invested that money. It would surely have given me more benefits.",
      "Pressure on people to gamble is everywhere. Current and former soccer players, including Vinicius J\u00fanior, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio and Roberto Rivellino, are among the poster boys for local and foreign brands. All but one of the top-tier soccer clubs have betting companies among their main sponsors, with their name and logo emblazoned on their kits. There have been cases of kids and teenagers setting up accounts using their parents' personal information and money, multiple local media outlets have reported.",
      "Brazil's economy ministry estimates that Brazil's sports betting market had $21 billion in transactions last year, a 71% increase compared with the first year of the pandemic, 2020.",
      "The ministry's newly presented regulations include facial recognition systems for gamblers to bet, the identification of a single bank account for transactions involving sports betting, new protections against hackers and the government-authorized domain, bet.br, which will host all betting sites that are legal in Brazil. Once they are in place, come January, between 100 and 150 betting companies will continue to operate in the South American nation.",
      "The changes in Brazil have prompted some companies to take preemptive action. A report by Yield Sec, a technical intelligence platform for online marketplaces, said several betting companies voluntarily restricted their operations in different places after the latest editions of the European Championships and Copa America in the hopes of presenting \u201cthe best possible license application face to the Brazilian authorities.\u201d",
      "Magnho Jos\u00e9 Santos de Sousa, the president of the Legal Gambling Institute, a betting think tank, said Brazil is currently \u201cinvaded by illegal websites that have licenses in Malta, Cura\u00e7\u00e3o, Gibraltar and the United Kingdom.\"",
      "De Sousa expressed hope that the new regulations for advertising, responsible gambling and qualification of sports betting companies will transform the country's deregulated arena into a more serious one that doesn't exploit the vulnerable.",
      "\"The whole operation could turn from water into wine,\u201d he said.",
      "Meantime, the demand for Gamblers Anonymous meetings in Sao Paulo has grown so much in recent years that the weekly gathering, in place since the 1990s, was no longer enough. Many groups have added a second day in the week to help new people recover, mostly sports bettors.",

      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them leaders,\u201d Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans \u201csee on television.\u201d He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",

      "Abortion rights advocates prevailed in ballot measures in seven states, but that doesn't resolve the issue",
      "WASHINGTON -- Abortion rights advocates prevailed on seven ballot measures across the U.S. in Tuesday's election and lost on three.",
      "The losses are the first on statewide reproductive rights ballot measures anywhere in the U.S. since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a ruling that struck down the nearly 50-year nationwide right to abortion, proving that abortion opponents can win on ballot measures.",
      "There were firsts on the other sides, too: Three amendments call for rolling back abortion bans, including one in Missouri that bars it at all stages of pregnancy with exceptions only under limited circumstances to save the life of the woman.",
      "Here's a look at takeaways from the results.",
      "Missouri is the most populous state where a ballot measure could roll back a current ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy.",
      "But the work isn\u2019t done there.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri filed in a state court Wednesday seeking to invalidate the state's abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead, the measure left it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood leaders said Wednesday on a Zoom call with reporters that they want to start offering abortions at clinics in Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis if they get the judicial ruling they're requesting \u2014 starting with blocking enforcement of laws on the book.",
      "\"This is only the first step to realizing and fully implementing the protections of Amendment 3. It\u2019s certainly not the last step,\u201d said Richard Muniz, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.",
      "Clinics had stopped providing abortions in Missouri even before the state\u2019s ban took effect in 2022. They said a list of regulations made it impossible for them to operate. In its legal filing, the Planned Parenthood affiliate that covers much of the state says the onerous requirements include clinicians who provide abortion have surgical licenses and that they conduct pelvic exams on all patients \u2014 even if they offer only medication abortions.",
      "\u201cSome of these patients choose medication abortion precisely because they do not want instruments inserted into their vagina,\u201d Dr. Selina Sandoval, an associate medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a legal filing. \u201cI cannot and will not subject my patients to unnecessary exams.\u201d",
      "Planned Parenthood also objects to laws requiring clinicians to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, mandating a 72-hour waiting period for abortions and banning telemedicine for abortion. Besides the ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, the group is calling for having other bans that kick in after eight, 14, 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to be struck down.",
      "Abortion rights advocates heralded victories at the ballot box as a signal of widespread support for abortion rights, even in conservative states.",
      "The three states where abortion measures were defeated had special circumstances that weren't present in the others.",
      "In Florida, the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment is 60% while most states require a simple majority. Most voters supported adding abortion rights \u2014 but it fell short of the requirement.",
      "There, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, also presented a challenge to proponents by steering state GOP funds to counter the measure and defending a state agency for publishing a webpage attacking it, among other government efforts.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure is different from the others because it would have allowed the state to regulate abortion in the second trimester \u2014 but only in ways that protect the health of the woman. Because of that provision, most national abortion rights groups did not put money into promoting it, which could have been a factor in its failure in a conservative state.",
      "In Nebraska, both sides had questions on the ballot. Voters passed the one that bars abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 which is in line with current state law \u2014 and also allows the possibility of more stringent bans. They also rejected the measure that aimed to enshrine into the state constitution the right to abortion until viability, which is considered to be sometime after 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there's not a fixed time.",
      "Abortion rights advocates condemned the novel strategy by anti-abortion groups of putting a competing measure on the ballot as an attempt to confuse voters. The approach was considered by anti-abortion groups elsewhere.",
      "Republican Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency, despite his consistently shifting stances on reproductive rights.",
      "If Republicans win the House, in addition to their victories in the Senate and White House, it could open the door to the passage of a national ban.",
      "Trump has said he would veto a national ban, despite previously declining to answer questions about it.",
      "But Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as \u201cminimum national standards\u201d in order to distort their own stances on the issue, given the political unpopularity of the GOP\u2019s position on abortion.",
      "Judicial appointments have already shaped the national abortion landscape. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned Roe v. Wade. It's not just the Supreme Court. Trump-nominated U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has issued rulings with nationwide consequences, including one impacting access to the abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "Through executive power, a president could also restrict abortion pills sent through the mail and declare that a law that requires doctors to stabilize emergency room patients does not require them to provide abortion. A new administration could also pull back on a federal lawsuit that challenges aspects of Idaho's ban.",
      "One interpretation of the presence of some of the ballot measures was that they were put up in part to drive turnout of Democratic voters in candidate elections.",
      "If that was the plan \u2014 and some abortion rights advocates say it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t seem to sway other statewide races.",
      "The mostly Republican states of Montana and Missouri passed abortion rights protections and also elected GOP candidates for president, U.S. Senate and governor.",
      "In Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy defeated three-term incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, who attempted to pair his campaign with the abortion rights push.",
      "Three other Republican states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 rejected abortion ballot measures and supported Trump for president and GOP senators where they were on the ballot.",
      "The Democratic states of Colorado and Maryland expanded abortion rights and voted for Democrats in statewide elections. The same is true in New York, where the ballot measure bars discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and does not mention abortion specifically \u2014 but was championed by abortion rights advocates, who say it will preserve access.",
      "The measures also passed in Arizona and Nevada, where the presidential and U.S. Senate races had not been called by midday Wednesday.",
      "Democrats in the most competitive Senate races centered their closing argument and ads around abortion, an issue they hoped to capitalize on after it has previously motivated voters up and down the ballot. But abortion rights failed to put them over the top \u2014 including in Montana.",
      "Texas Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat, failed in his bid to defeat Sen. Ted Cruz after investing $5 million in an ad campaign focused on abortion and invoking the issue in campaign trail speeches and during an October debate. Allred leaned on the personal stories of Texas women impacted by the state's abortion ban that have sparked national outrage.",
      "In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno defeated incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown after Brown and his allies pounced on cellphone video that emerged late in the campaign showing Moreno criticizing suburban women who base their votes on abortion rights.",
      "A hotly contested race between Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican Eric Hovde has also focused heavily on abortion and appeared to be close enough early Wednesday for a recount to be requested.",
      "In the Texas city of Amarillo, located in the state\u2019s conservative Panhandle region, voters overwhelming rejected an anti-abortion proposal that would have essentially banned travel for those seeking abortions out of state by allowing civil lawsuits against anyone who helps a local resident obtain an abortion.",
      "The \u201cSanctuary Cities for the Unborn\u201d ordinance was rejected by nearly 60% of voters.",
      "\u201cWe hope to set the tone for not only the state, but the nation, that we will not penalize anyone for seeking health care when they\u2019re facing an extreme travel ban in their own state,\" said Lindsay London, a nurse who helped found a group to oppose the effort.",

      "The former president was asked twice after casting his ballot in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday about a question that the state's voters are considering. If approved, it would prevent state lawmakers from passing any law that penalizes, prohibits, delays or restricts abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks.",
      "If it\u2019s rejected, the state\u2019s restrictive six-week abortion law would stand.",
      "The first time he was asked, Trump avoided answering.

      "Voters are getting a say on abortion policy in Tuesday's election with ballot measures and elections to offices from president to local prosecutors",
      "WASHINGTON -- Voters in nine states are deciding whether their state constitutions should guarantee a right to abortion, weighing ballot measures that are expected to spur turnout for a range of crucial races.",
      "Passing certain amendments in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota likely would lead to undoing bans or restrictions that currently block varying levels of abortion access to more than 7 million women of childbearing age who live in those states.",
      "The future legality and availability of abortion hinges not only on ballot measures, as policies could shift depending on who controls Congress and the presidency. Same with state governments \u2014 including legislatures that pursue new laws, state supreme courts that determine the laws' constitutionality, attorneys general who decide whether to defend them and district attorneys who enforce them.",
      "If all the abortion rights measures pass, \"it\u2019s a sign of how much of a juggernaut support for reproductive rights has become,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and an expert on the history of reproductive rights in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf some of them fail,\" she added, \"then you\u2019re going to see some conservatives looking for guidance to see what the magic ingredient was that made it possible for conservatives to stem the tide.\u201d",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on all seven measures that have appeared since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the nationwide right to abortion. That decision opened the door to bans or restrictions in most GOP-controlled states \u2014 and protections of access in most of those controlled by Democrats.",
      "The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this year. Their opponents' efforts are focused on portraying the amendments as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before women often realize they\u2019re pregnant. Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents of the states with bans.",
      "The bans also are part of a key argument in the presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris calls them \u201cTrump abortion bans,\u201d noting former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Harris, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as a direct, consistent advocate for reproductive health and rights, including Black maternal health.",
      "Trump has struggled to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights, leaning on his catch-all response that abortion rights should be left up to individual states.",
      "His shifting stances on reproductive rights include vowing in October to veto a national abortion ban, just weeks after the presidential debate when he repeatedly declined to say. Trump also has regularly taken credit for appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "After voting in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, Trump was asked twice how he voted on the abortion measure there \u2014 and didn't answer directly. The first time he said he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d The second time, he snapped at a reporter, saying \u201cyou should stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s attempt to find a more cautious stance on abortion echoes the efforts of many Republican congressional candidates as the issue has emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP. In competitive congressional races from coast to coast, Republicans distanced themselves from more aggressive anti-abortion policies coming from their party and its allies, despite their records on the issue and previous statements opposing abortion rights.",
      "While the ballot questions have similar aims, each one occupies its own political circumstances.",
      "There\u2019s an added obstacle to passing protections in reliably Republican Florida: Supporters of the amendment must get at least 60% of the vote.",
      "Passing it there and rolling back a 6-week ban that took effect in May would be a blow to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, who has steered state GOP funds to the cause and whose administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial supporting it.",
      "Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would allow abortion further into pregnancy. The other would enshrine in the constitution the state\u2019s current law, which bars most abortions after 12 weeks \u2014 but would allow for further restrictions.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure would allow some regulations related to the health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most national abortion-rights groups are not supporting it.",
      "In some states, notably Missouri, passing amendments may not expand access immediately. Courts would be asked to invalidate the bans; and there could be legal battles over that. Clinics would need to staff up and get licenses. And some restrictions could remain in effect.",
      "Arizona, a battleground in the presidential election, bans abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The ballot measure there gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "In the Democratic-controlled Colorado and Maryland, the ballot measures would largely put existing policies into the state constitutions, though Colorado\u2019s version could also remove financial barriers to abortion. It would take 55% of the vote to pass there.",
      "Measures maintaining access also are on the ballot in Montana, where a U.S. Senate race could help determine control of the chamber, and Nevada, a battleground in the presidential election.",
      "In Nevada, where control of the state government is divided, the ballot measure would have to be passed this year and again in 2026 to take effect.",
      "New York also has a measure on the ballot that its supporters say would bolster abortion rights. It doesn\u2019t contain the word \u201cabortion\u201d but rather bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d"

      "Nebraska has a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot, including two competing ones pertaining to abortion abortion rights",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Nebraska will have a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot Tuesday, including two competing ones that address abortion rights. Nebraska is the first state to feature competing abortion amendments on the same ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending the nationwide right to abortion and allowing states to decide for themselves.",
      "Initiative 434, which appears at the top of the ballot list, would enshrine in the state constitution Nebraska\u2019s current 12-week abortion ban, which the Legislature passed in 2023 and which includes exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to protect the life of the pregnant woman.",
      "Appearing last on the list is Initiative 439, which would amend the constitution to guarantee the right to have an abortion until viability \u2014 the standard under Roe that is the point at which a fetus might survive outside the womb. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation. The measure includes some exceptions, including allowing abortions later in pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant woman.",
      "Because they\u2019re competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the one that gets the most \u201cfor\u201d votes would be adopted, the secretary of state\u2019s office said.",
      "Elections officials expect the competing measures to help drive high voter turnout, along with the hotly contested presidential race.",
      "Abortion is on the ballot in several other states, as well. Coming into the election, voters in all seven states that have decided on abortion-related ballot measures since the reversal of Roe have favored abortion rights, including in some conservative states.",
      "The measure that would enshrine the 12-week ban in the constitution has been bankrolled by some of Nebraska's wealthiest people, including Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, who previously served as governor and donated more than $1.1 million. His mother, Marlene Ricketts, gave $4 million to the cause. Members of the Peed family, which owns publishing company Sandhills Global, also gave $1 million.",
      "The effort organized under the name Protect Women and Children is heavily backed by religious organizations, including the Nebraska Catholic Conference, a lobbying group that has organized rallies, phone banks and community townhalls to drum up support for the measure.",
      "The effort to enshrine viability as the standard is called Protect Our Rights Nebraska and has the backing of several medical, advocacy and social justice groups. Planned Parenthood has donated nearly $1 million to the cause, with the American Civil Liberties Union, I Be Black Girl, Nebraska Appleseed and the Women\u2019s Fund of Omaha also contributing significantly to the roughly $3.7 million raised by Protect Our Rights.",
      "Two measures, Initiative 437 and Initiative 438, would legalize the possession and use of medical marijuana, and allow for the manufacture, distribution and delivery of it.",
      "Initiative 437 would let patients and caregivers possess up to 5 ounces (142 grams) of marijuana if recommended by a doctor. Initiative 438 would create the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which would oversee the private groups that would manufacture and dispense marijuana.",
      "The initiatives have been challenged in court over allegations that the petition campaign to put them on the ballot broke election rules. That means a judge could invalidate them even if voters approve them.",
      "Also on the ballot, Referendum Measure 435 asks voters to retain or repeal a new conservative-backed law that allocates millions of dollars in taxpayer money to fund private school tuition.",
      "And Initiative 436 would require all Nebraska employers to provide at least 40 hours of paid sick leave to their employees."

      "The Tobacco and Vapes Bill would also bar smoking and vaping in some outdoor spaces such as playgrounds and the entrances to schools and hospitals. But a proposed ban on smoking in pub beer gardens has been dropped after opposition from bar owners.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the hospitality industry had \u201ctaken a real battering in recent years\u201d and it is not \u201cthe right time\u201d to ban smoking outside pubs.",

      "It also continues a plan by the previous Conservative government, which was ousted in July\u2019s general election, to raise the minimum age for buying tobacco by one year each year, so that no one born after Jan. 1, 2009 will ever be able to buy cigarettes legally in Britain.",
      "It is currently illegal to sell cigarettes, tobacco products or vapes to people under 18.",
      "If passed \u2013 as is likely because of the governing Labour Party\u2019s large majority in Parliament -- the bill would give Britain some of the toughest anti-smoking measures in the world.",

    "story": [
      "Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution \u2014 a vote that could cement access after the presidential battleground came close to a near-total ban earlier this year.",
      "Arizona is one of nine states with abortion on the ballot.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates are hoping for a win that could expand access beyond the state's current 15-week limit to the point of fetal viability, a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Doctors say it's sometime after 21 weeks, though there's no defined time frame.",
      "Advocates also are counting on the measure to drive interest among Democrats to vote the party line up and down the ballot. When Republicans running in tough races address the ballot measure, they generally don\u2019t dissuade voters from supporting it, though some like Senate candidate Kari Lake say they\u2019re personally voting against it. GOP U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, whose battleground congressional district encompasses Tucson, ran an ad saying he rejects \"the extremes on abortion.\u201d",
      "Arizona has been whipsawed by recent legal and legislative battles centered on abortion. In April, the state Supreme Court cleared the way for enforcement of a long-dormant 1864 law that banned nearly all abortions. The Legislature swiftly repealed it.",
      "In addition to the abortion ballot measure itself, the issue could sway state legislative races and lead to elimination of the voice voters have over retention of state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices.",
      "Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition leading the ballot measure campaign, has far outpaced the opposition campaign, It Goes Too Far, in fundraising. Opponents argue that the measure is too far-reaching because its physical and mental health exemption post-viability is so broad that it effectively legalizes abortion beyond viability. The measure allows post-viability abortions if they are necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the mother.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion-rights supporters prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions, including in conservative-leaning states.",
      "Voters in Arizona are divided on abortion. Maddy Pennell, a junior at Arizona State University, said the possibility of a near-total abortion ban made her \u201cdepressed\u201d and strengthened her desire to vote for the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cI feel very strongly about having access to abortion,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle Lee, an independent Arizona voter, does not support the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cAll abortion is pretty much, in my opinion, murder from beginning to end,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The Civil War-era ban also shaped the contours of tight legislative races. State Sen. Shawnna Bolick and state Rep. Matt Gress are among the handful of vulnerable Republican incumbents in competitive districts who crossed party lines to give the repeal vote the final push \u2014 a vote that will be tested as both parties vie for control of the narrowly GOP-held state Legislature.",
      "Both of the Phoenix-area lawmakers were rebuked by some of their Republican colleagues for siding with Democrats. Gress made a motion on the House floor to initiate the repeal of the 1864 law. Bolick, explaining her repeal vote to her Senate colleagues, gave a 20-minute floor speech describing her three difficult pregnancies.",
      "While Gress was first elected to his seat in 2022, Bolick is facing voters for the first time. She was appointed by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to fill a seat vacancy in 2023. She has not emphasized her role in the repeal vote as she has campaigned, instead playing up traditional conservative issues \u2014 one of her signs reads \u201cBolick Backs the Blue.\u201d",
      "Another question before voters is whether to move away from retention elections for state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices, a measure put on the ballot by Republican legislators hoping to protect two justices who favored allowing the Civil War-era ban to be enforced.",
      "Under the existing system, voters decide every four to six years whether judges and justices should remain on the bench. The proposed measure would allow the judges and justices to stay on the bench without a popular vote unless one is triggered by felony convictions, crimes involving fraud and dishonesty, personal bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure.",
      "Shawnna Bolick\u2019s husband, Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, is one of two conservative justices up for a retention vote. Justice Bolick and Justice Kathryn Hackett King, who were both appointed by former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, sided with the high court\u2019s majority to allow the enforcement of the 1864 near-total ban. Abortion-rights activists have campaigned for their ouster, but if the ballot measure passes they will keep their posts even if they don\u2019t win the retention election."

The station reported that members of Ivey's staff then ran up to her. An ambulance was called to the scene.",

      "An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes.\u201d",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution that would bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes\" is up for a final vote Tuesday amid debate over how much it might affect future abortion and transgender rights.",
      "Supporters and opponents disagree sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1.",
      "New York\u2019s constitution currently forbids discrimination based on race, creed or religion. The amendment would add language that says someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or \u201creproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders put the amendment on the ballot partly in hopes of boosting turnout by voters passionate about protecting abortion access, in an election year where U.S. House races in New York could help decide which party controls Congress.",
      "Several other states also have abortion-related constitutional amendments on their ballots Tuesday. Most of those ballot questions address head-on when it should be legal to end a pregnancy. But in New York, state lawmakers took the indirect approach of writing the amendment as an antidiscrimination measure.",
      "Democrats who support the amendment have argued that the new language would create a legal framework where any restrictions on abortion would amount to an unconstitutional form of discrimination in medical care. The New York City Bar Association has agreed with that assessment, as have some other legal experts.",
      "Still, the fact that the amendment itself does not use the word abortion has caused headaches for its supporters. It also opened the door for opponents to claim its other language would lead to a raft of unintended consequences.",
      "Republicans have run a strong messaging campaign against the amendment, choosing not to focus on what protections it might provide for abortion, but to target other parts of the proposal. Their main attack line has been to argue the amendment would provide a constitutional right for transgender athletes to play on girls\u2019 sports teams.",
      "They\u2019ve also argued that its language on national origin could result in noncitizens being allowed to vote, that its ban on age discrimination might take away price discounts for senior citizens, and that it could also wind up stopping parents from having a say in their child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Previous state court decisions have found that existing language in the state constitution bars noncitizens from voting. And the New York City Bar Association says the amendment would not block existing state laws requiring parental consent for a child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Legal battles are already underway in New York over whether existing state and federal laws give transgender people the right to play on sports teams that match the gender identity.",
      "Democrats in the state legislature voted to put the amendment on the 2024 ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters elsewhere have shown support for abortion access in previous elections. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll recently found that 7 in 10 Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Uncertainty over the New York amendment\u2019s impact on abortion was pronounced enough, however, that it caused even the state Board of Elections to throw up its hands. The board is responsible for writing simple explanations of proposed amendments that voters will see on their ballots. But rather than interpret the measure or include the word abortion in its description, the board decided to reiterate the amendment\u2019s language verbatim.",
      "Supporters of the amendment objected and filed lawsuit, but the judge in the case, David A. Weinstein, eventually declined to make the board rewrite its description, in part because he could not say for certain how courts would interpret the amendment\u2019s language.",
      "Abortion is currently legal in New York up through 24 weeks from the beginning of pregnancy. After that, it is only legal if the pregnant person\u2019s life, physical health or mental health is at risk, or if a medical provider determines the fetus is not viable. Although there is no defined time frame, viability is a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus.",
      "Democrats have firm control of state government in New York, making any new abortion restrictions unlikely in the near future.",
      "Backers of the proposal argue that if the amendment passes it would create a strong layer of abortion protections in New York that would be difficult for a future legislature to repeal. That's because New York requires the legislature to pass an amendment to the constitution two times before it goes to voters for final approval."

      "Maryland is the first state to sign an agreement with the federal government designed to improve health care and lower costs",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland became the first state on Friday to join a federal program designed to improve health care quality and equity while lowering costs for all health care payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers.",
      "It builds on Maryland\u2019s Total Cost of Care Model, which sets a per capita limit on Medicare\u2019s total cost of care in Maryland and encompasses the state\u2019s unique all-payer hospital payment system, which reduces per capita hospital expenditures and supports improved health outcomes, as encouraged by the Affordable Care Act.",

Wes Moore, a Democrat who signed the agreement with U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure.",
      "Since the 1970s, Maryland has had a hospital all-payer system that enables the state to set its own rates for hospital services, and all payers must charge the same rate for services at a given hospital.",
      "It\u2019s designed to provide equitable access to care, eliminate the need for charity hospitals and ensure patients are treated the same regardless of insurance status. State law authorizes the system, which bases costs on rates set by hospitals. It has continued to be the foundation of each subsequent evolution of the Maryland health care model.",
      "\u201cMaryland has this unique system that we\u2019ve developed over a period of decades now,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, told reporters after a news conference in Annapolis. \u201cWe\u2019re taking it to the next level by signing this AHEAD agreement, and the bottom line is it helps us accomplish three top priorities: equity, quality, affordability. That\u2019s the goal.\u201d",
      "The Maryland Department of Health will now begin planning to implement the AHEAD model starting Jan. 1, 2025. That will include establishing targets for cost growth, quality and equity improvements, population health, and primary care investments as well as identifying regional partnerships to drive AHEAD goals.",
      "Sen. Ben Cardin said the agreement keeps in place state policy that health care providers receive the same pay for services, so hospitals have incentives to provide equal care, whether you have private insurance, government insurance, or no insurance.",
      "\u201cSecondly, we are now committed to making sure that we have the most effective quality care,\u201d said Cardin, a Democrat. \u201cSo, we invest in primary care. We invest in early detection, prevention, so that we can keep you healthier, so you don\u2019t have to spend as much time with health care needs.\u201d",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has selected five other states \u2014 Vermont, Connecticut, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and regions of New York\u2014 for participation in the AHEAD Model.",
      "\u201cMaryland\u2019s participation in the AHEAD Model is a critical step forward in improving the overall health of its residents, supporting primary care, transforming health care in communities throughout the state, and addressing disparities in the health care system,\u201d Brooks-LaSure said."

      "Southwest District Health appears to be the first in the nation to be restricted from giving COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccinations are an essential function of a public health department.",
      "While policymakers in Texas banned health departments from promoting COVID vaccines and Florida's surgeon general bucked medical consensus to recommend against the vaccine, governmental bodies across the country haven't blocked the vaccines outright.",
      "\u201cI'm not aware of anything else like this,\u201d said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials. She said health departments have stopped offering the vaccine because of cost or low demand, but not based on \u201ca judgment of the medical product itself.\u201d",
      "The six-county district along the Idaho-Oregon border includes three counties in the Boise metropolitan area. Demand for COVID vaccines in the health district has declined \u2014 with 1,601 given in 2021 to 64 so far in 2024. The same is true for other vaccines: Idaho has the highest childhood vaccination exemption rate in the nation, and last year, the Southwest District Health Department rushed to contain a rare measles outbreak that sickened 10.",
      "On Oct. 22, the health department\u2019s board voted 4-3 in favor of the ban \u2014 despite Southwest's medical director testifying to the vaccine's necessity.",
      "\u201cOur request of the board is that we would be able to carry and offer those (vaccines), recognizing that we always have these discussions of risks and benefits,\u201d Dr. Perry Jansen said at the meeting. \u201cThis is not a blind, everybody-gets-a-shot approach. This is a thoughtful approach.\u201d",
      "Opposite Jansen's plea were more than 290 public comments, many of which called for an end to vaccine mandates or taxpayer funding of the vaccines, neither of which are happening in the district. At the meeting, many people who spoke are nationally known for making the rounds to testify against COVID vaccines, including Dr. Peter McCullough, a Texas cardiologist who sells \u201ccontagion emergency kits\u201d that include ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine \u2014 drugs that have not been approved to treat COVID-19 and can have dangerous side effects.",
      "Board Chairman Kelly Aberasturi was familiar with many of the voices who wanted the ban, especially from earlier local protests of pandemic measures.",
      "Aberasturi, who told The Associated Press that he's skeptical of COVID-19 vaccines and national public health leaders, said in the meeting and in an interview with the AP that he was supportive of but \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the board's decision.",
      "He said the board had overstepped the relationship between patients and their doctors \u2014 and possibly opened a door to blocking other vaccines or treatments.",
      "Board members in favor of the decision argued people can get vaccinated elsewhere, and that providing the shots was equivalent to signing off on their safety. (Some people may be reluctant to get vaccinated or boosted because of misinformation about the shots despite evidence that they\u2019re safe and have saved millions of lives.)",
      "The people getting vaccinated at the health department \u2014 including people without housing, people who are homebound and those in long-term care facilities or in the immigration process \u2014 had no other options, Jansen and Aberasturi said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been homeless in my lifetime, so I understand how difficult it can be when you\u2019re ... trying to get by and get ahead,\u201d Aberasturi said. \u201cThis is where we should be stepping in and helping.",
      "\"But we have some board members who have never been there, so they don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like.\u201d",
      "State health officials have said that they \u201crecommend that people consider the COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d Idaho health department spokesperson AJ McWhorter declined to comment on \u201cpublic health district business,\u201d but noted that COVID-19 vaccines are still available at community health centers for people who are uninsured.",
      "Aberasturi said he plans to ask at the next board meeting if the health department can at least be allowed to vaccinate older patients and residents of long-term care facilities, adding that the board is supposed to be caring for the \u201chealth and well-being\u201d of the district's residents. \"But I believe the way we went about this thing is we didn't do that due diligence.\u201d",

      "The Prince of Wales set up the Earthshot Prize in 2020 to help entrepreneurs develop their climate-friendly businesses and he took the annual awards ceremony to Africa \u2014 the continent where he conceived the idea \u2014 for the first time this week.",
      "\u201cWe want to make this the decade in which we transform the world for good, one solution at a time, from the ground up,\u201d William said in a speech on stage in a giant reusable dome that was put up for the ceremony near Cape Town's harbor.",
      "The Earthshot Prize, which William set up through his Royal Foundation, awarded $1.2 million in grants to five businesses for their sustainable, eco-friendly innovations. The winners included an American company that developed technology to use heat waste from heavy industries to generate electricity, a Ghanaian organization that trains people to collect and manage waste, and a Kazakhstan conservation group that is protecting a vast grassland and saving the Saiga antelope from extinction.",
      "William, wearing his no-plastic sneakers and a classic double-breasted gray blazer, said his Earthshot Prize was created \u201cto champion the dreamers, the thinkers and the innovators from every walk of life who share an ambition to build a better, more sustainable world.\u201d",
      "The Earthshot Prize said it has raised around $110 million to support its projects.",
      "William pulled in some star power, with \u201cAmerica's Got Talent\u201d judge Heidi Klum, Canadian model Winnie Harlow and rapper Tobe Nwigwe, who has Nigerian heritage, presenting awards. Actor-singer Billy Porter was a co-host for the evening.",
      "William arrived in Cape Town on Monday and his engagements throughout the week have been heavily focused on climate change and conservation. He met with young environmentalists from his Earthshot youth program, went on a nature walk near Cape Town's Table Mountain to highlight the work of conservation rangers, attended a global wildlife summit, and visited a botanical garden. He will spend time at a sea rescue base and meet local fishermen on the final day of his visit on Thursday.",
      "William's wife Kate, the Princess of Wales, and their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis did not travel with him, although William wore a bracelet with the letters \u201cPapa\u201d that he said Charlotte made for him.",
      "Kate has only recently returned to some public duties after treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer. Ahead of Wednesday's awards, William told the BBC that Kate was doing \u201creally well\u201d and has been \u201camazing this whole year.\u201d",
      "William has long-standing links to Africa and traveled to the continent as a boy after his mother, Princess Diana, was killed in a car crash in 1997. Kate and William got engaged at a wildlife conservancy in Kenya in 2010.",
      "William met South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the president's Cape Town residence this week and South Africa's second biggest city has paid tribute to the prince's visit by lighting up the face of its iconic Table Mountain in green to recognize his environmental awards.",
      "\u201cAfrica\u2019s been a big part of my life since I\u2019ve been a young boy, since I first came to Africa,\u201d William said. \"Every time I come here I can be myself and get away from all the stuff that happens in my normal life. And so it\u2019s a really special place, a home from home for me.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG -- China's exports rose 12.7% in October from a year earlier, the fastest monthly growth in more than two years, according to customs data released Thursday.",
      "The report came a day after former President Donald Trump won Tuesday\u2019s election, gaining a second term as president. Trump has pledged to increase tariffs on imports from China to 60%, adding to uncertainty over the outlook for exports to the U.S.",
      "It showed imports fell 2.3% in October from a year earlier, while China\u2019s trade surplus rose to $95.7 billion in October, up from $81.7 billion in September.",
      "Exports far surpassed analyst\u2019s estimates of about 5.5% growth and outpaced September\u2019s growth of just 2.4%. It was the fastest expansion since July 2022.",
      "The growth in October\u2019s exports signaled sustained demand for Chinese goods abroad, while demand in the domestic market remains subdued.",
      "China\u2019s exports to Russia rose almost 27% from the same time last year, customs data showed, the fastest pace in 11 months. Exports to the U.S. increased by 8% year-on-year, while shipment to the European Union climbed nearly 13%.",
      "China\u2019s exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \u2014 China's largest trading partner by region \u2014 jumped 16%.",

      "\u201cAlthough Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs would hurt the export sector, their impact would be less significant than many fear \u2013- we think they could lower export volumes by around 3% \u2013 and may not be felt until the second half of 2025,\u201d Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "\u201cMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s return could create a short-term boost to Chinese exports as U.S. importers increase their purchases to get ahead of the tariffs,\u201d Huang said.",

      "The U.S. and Europe recently raised tariffs on China\u2019s exports of electric vehicles and other products, darkening the outlook for China\u2019s trade as an engine of growth. A prolonged slump in the property industry also remains a major drag on the Chinese economy.",
      "Chinese policymakers have already announced a slew of measures to boost the economy, including frontloading 200 billion yuan ($28.2 billion) from next year\u2019s budget for spending and construction projects.",

    "summary": "For the last six years, Mexico bragged about its oft-questioned policy of &ldquo;hugs, not bullets,&rdquo; in which the country&rsquo;s leaders avoided confrontations with drug cartels that were gradually taking control of large parts of the country",
    "story": [
      "For the last six years, Mexico bragged about its oft-questioned policy of \u201chugs, not bullets,\u201d in which the country\u2019s leaders avoided confrontations with drug cartels that were gradually taking control of large parts of the country",
      "MEXICO CITY -- For the last six years, Mexico bragged about its oft-questioned \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d strategy, in which its leaders avoided confrontations with drug cartels that were gradually taking control of large parts of the country. The thinking was that social programs, not shootouts, would gradually drain the pool of cartel gunmen.",
      "Now, a month into the term of new President Claudia Sheinbaum, a string of bloody confrontations suggests the government is quietly abandoning the \u201cno bullets\u201d part of that strategy and is much more willing to use the full force of the military and the militarized National Guard.",
      "But the challenge Mexico now faces is different from that during the country\u2019s 2006-2012 drug war. Cartels today are more diversified, more deeply entrenched in migrant smuggling and more willing to use foreign recruits and adolescents to fill their ranks.",
      "All of that has led to a string of violent clashes in which security forces who shoot at suspected drug cartel convoys wind up killing bystanders and migrants, and reporting lopsided death tolls in which soldiers aren\u2019t harmed but most of the suspects are wiped out.",
      "Sheinbaum has studiously avoided using the \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d slogan popularized by her predecessor and mentor, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30. She has, after all, pledged to continue each and every one of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "But Sheinbaum has had to perform some verbal gymnastics to avoid disowning the policy entirely.",
      "\u201cClearly, it isn\u2019t a question of hugs for criminals, nobody has ever said that,\u201d Sheinbaum said soon after taking office. The hugs, she said, were meant for impoverished youths, to avoid having them recruited as cartel gunmen.",
      "\u201cThere are traces of a change in tone toward organized crime, but it\u2019s too early to call,\u201d said Falko Ernst, a security analyst. \u201cIt seems unlikely that the Sheinbaum administration would risk a politically inconvenient, steady stream of violent imagery by betting on wholesale balazos (bullets)-only strategy,\u201d but there may be more willingness to confront \u201cthe most overt and brazen displays of power\u201d by the cartels.",
      "But it is hard to imagine Sheinbaum issuing public praise for drug lords for behaving themselves, or saying \u2014 as L\u00f3pez Obrador did \u2014 that she will \u201ctell on them to their fathers and grandfathers\u201d if they cause too much violence.",
      "She has also been unwilling to tolerate criminals taking police and soldiers hostage, or to crow about reductions in Mexico\u2019s \u201clethality index\u201d \u2014 the measure of suspects killed, wounded or taken into custody, versus casualties on the law enforcement side \u2014 the way her predecessor did.",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador famously called off the 2019 arrest of drug lord Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, and ordered his release, after his Sinaloa cartel threatened to plunge the northern city of Culiacan into chaos to win his freedom. L\u00f3pez Obrador said he made the decision to avoid bloodshed.",
      "Sheinbaum\u2019s administration has been a tad different. On her first day in office, soldiers in the southern state of Chiapas opened fire on a truck that \u201clooked like one used by criminal groups.\u201d But after shooting up the truck, they found only migrants, six of whom were killed and 10 wounded.",
      "Ten days later, army and National Guard troops killed three innocent bystanders as they were pursuing suspected gunmen. And this weekend, the National Guard opened fire on a truck carrying migrants, killing two Colombians and wounding at least four.",
      "Then there are the lopsided death tolls: L\u00f3pez Obrador always criticized previous administrations for shootouts in which all the suspects were killed, and very few were taken alive. But in Sheinbaum\u2019s third week in office, soldiers in Sinaloa killed 19 drug cartel suspects and arrested one in a confrontation, but suffered not a scratch themselves.",
      "And toward the end of her first month in office, soldiers pursuing cartel gunmen who had killed two local policemen killed 17 of them but lost no soldiers. Most of the dead, and 10 of the 15 gunmen arrested in the confrontation, were Guatemalan.",
      "\u201cThe hugs not bullets strategy ended some time ago,\u201d said security analyst David Saucedo, pointing to an increased number of high-level drug arrests and extraditions of suspects. \u201cThe U.S. government pressured Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador to resume the capture of high-level drug lords.\u201d",
      "One of the key differences Sheinbaum faces is that Mexican cartels have gotten involved in the lucrative trade of smuggling migrants from far-away countries.",
      "In the old days, the cartels took a cut from smugglers moving Central Americans, who used to make up the vast majority of those crossing Mexico to reach the United States. Those migrants paid hundreds or a few thousand dollars apiece.",
      "Since smugglers opened up a new route through the Darien Gap, people from farther away have been crossing Mexico, and they can pay far higher smuggling fees.",
      "Simultaneously, an immigration crackdown in the U.S. and Mexico has meant a significant number of Central and South Americans now have no avenue to get into the United States, said military analyst Juan Ibarrola, noting, \u201cIt is big business, and it is a far more profitable business than drugs.\u201d",
      "Ibarrola claims the cartels are now using migrants both as human shields, and sometimes as cannon fodder for their squads of hitmen.",
      "\u201cThe recruitment of larger batches of foreign fighters is yet another sign of the gradual deepening of Mexico\u2019s armed conflicts,\u201d said Ernst. \u201cLeft unchecked \u2014 much like the employment of homemade explosive devices \u2014 it\u2019s a trend that\u2019s been allowed to expand.\u201d",
      "Expand is exactly what the cartels did during L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s six-year term from late 2018 to 2024.",
      "\u201cFor six years we were ruled by the policies of a president who did not understand, or who did not realize, that the worst thing he could have done, the worst error he could have made, was not to use legal force against criminal violence,\u201d said Ibarrola, who is convinced the policy has now changed.",
      "The other problem Sheinbaum faces is the result of her determination to continue with L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s strategy of militarizing Mexican law enforcement \u2014 essentially giving soldiers a task they weren\u2019t trained to do.",
      "Together with the mix of migrants and drug traffickers, it seems almost a certain recipe for more deaths of innocent bystanders.",
      "\u201cIt is a fact that the National Guard does not correctly apply the rules of engagement on the use of force,\u201d said Saucedo. \u201cThey tend to open fire before investigating or trying to detain criminal suspects.\u201d",

      "Lone Russian drones and also swarms of drones entered Ukrainian airspace from various directions and at a variety of altitudes, officials said, in what was an apparent attempt to stretch air defense systems and unnerve city residents.",
      "Ukrainian air defenses \u201cneutralized\u201d three dozen drones, but falling debris caused damage to a hospital as well as residential and office buildings in Kyiv, local authorities said. A fire was ignited on the 33rd floor of an apartment building.",
      "At least two people were reported injured.",
      "Drone attacks on Kyiv have recently been occurring almost every day, with nighttime explosions and the continuous buzzing sound of drones keeping the city on edge. Russia is deploying about 10 times more Iranian-made Shahed drones than it was this time last year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s forces are struggling to match the might of Russia\u2019s military, which is much bigger and better equipped. Western support is crucial for Ukraine to sustain the costly war of attrition. The uncertainty over how long that aid will continue deepened this week with Donald Trump elected as the next U.S. president. Trump has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine.",
      "Russia, meanwhile, is trying to grind down Ukraine\u2019s appetite for the fight and sap the West\u2019s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict.",

      "Russia is aiming to save and stockpile its missiles, which are much more powerful than drones, Kovalenko claimed on Thursday, though Russia has used missiles effectively in its campaign to knock out Ukraine\u2019s power grid.",
      "Also, the drone attacks gradually wear down Ukraine\u2019s air defenses, making it more vulnerable to future missile launches.",
      "During the day on Thursday, Russia launched five attacks using missiles and glide bombs on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, killing at least four people and injuring 18. The attacks also damaged residential buildings and a hospital, Ukraine\u2019s National Police said.",
      "The injured included three children \u2014 a four-month-old girl and two boys, aged 1 and 10, officials said.",
      "Power outages were reported in the Zhytomyr region, which borders Kyiv to the west, following a Russian attack there, according to the energy company Zhytomyroblenergo.",
      "Another Russian drone attack injured one person in the southern city of Odesa, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said, and drone debris damaged an 11-story residential building.",

      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",
      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",

      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",
      "TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.",
      "Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver.",
      "Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that \"banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.\u201d",
      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",
      "Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China\u2019s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.",
      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell."

      "The last time the rate was cut in Sweden was in September and it was by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "The interest rate cut was the largest reduction in over 10 years, Swedish news agency TT wrote. At its highest in February 2023, the 12-month inflation rate was 12.0%.",
      "The cut was effective from Oct. 13, the central bank said.",
      "In neighboring Norway, the central bank Thursday maintained the policy rate unchanged at 4.5% Thursday. Norges Bank Governor Ida Wolden Bache said it \u201cwill most likely be kept\" there to the end of 2024.",
      "The Norges Bank said that in recent years, the policy rate has been raised significantly to bring down inflation, with the rate held at 4.5% since December 2023. The interest rate has contributed to cooling down the Norwegian economy and dampening inflation. In Norway, the consumer price index was 3.0% for the period September 2023-September 2024.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 09:06:18 -0500",
    "summary": "The Bank of England has cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point after inflation across the U.K. fell below its target rate of 2%",
    "story": [
      "The Bank of England has cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point after inflation across the U.K. fell below its target rate of 2%",
      "LONDON -- The Bank of England cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75% on Thursday after inflation across the U.K. fell significantly, relieving some pressure on borrowers who have faced elevated mortgage and loan costs.",
      "The bank said eight of the nine members of its rate-setting panel backed the reduction \u2014 the second in three months \u2014 while one opted to keep borrowing costs on hold. The latest cut comes after inflation in the U.K. fell to an annual rate of 1.7%, its lowest level since April 2021.",
      "Though inflation has fallen below the bank's target of 2%, Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned that interest rates would not be falling too fast over coming months, partly because last week's budget measures from the new Labour government would likely see prices rise by more than they would otherwise have done.",
      "\u201cWe need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can\u2019t cut interest rates too quickly or by too much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the economy evolves as we expect it\u2019s likely that interest rates will continue to fall gradually from here.\u201d",
      "He added that it's very unlikely that interest rates will fall to the very low levels that persisted in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008. During the coronavirus pandemic, which erupted in early 2020, interest rates around the world fell to zero, or just above zero in the case of the Bank of England.",
      "Central banks worldwide dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have recently fallen from multi-decade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also expected to cut interest rates later Thursday.",
      "Economists have warned that worries about the future path of prices following last week's tax-raising budget from the new Labour government and the economic impact of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may limit the number of cuts next year.",
      "\u201cEven though interest rates have further to fall, the upward pressure on inflation from the budget and growing global risks, including possible new U.S. tariffs, could mean that policy is loosened more modestly than many anticipated,\" said Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.",
      "The decision comes a week after Treasury chief Rachel Reeves announced around 70 billion pounds ($90 billion) of extra spending, funded through increased business taxes and borrowing. Economists think that the splurge, coupled with the prospect of businesses cushioning the tax hikes by raising prices, could lead to higher inflation next year.",
      "Rate-setters considered the budget measures during their deliberations and concluded they would likely boost growth by 0.75 percentage points and inflation by 0.5 percentage points over the coming year.",
      "The rate decision also comes a day after Trump was declared the winner of the U.S. presidential election. He has indicated that he will cut taxes and introduce tariffs on certain imported goods when he returns to the White House in January. Both policies have the potential to be inflationary both in the U.S. and globally, thereby prompting Bank of England policymakers to keep interest rates higher than initially planned.",
      "Bailey said it was \u201cnot useful or wise to enter into speculation\u201d about what policies might be introduced by the incoming Trump administration and that the Bank of England only factors in policies that have already been announced when it compiles its economic projections."

      "In a statement, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to the slain officers.",
      "No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, has stepped up its assaults in the region since its ally the Afghan Taliban seized power in neighboring Afghanistan in 2021.",

      "JERUSALEM -- Armed Israeli police forced their way into a French-owned church compound in the contested city of Jerusalem on Thursday, the French foreign ministry said, briefly detaining two consulate employees and prompting the top French diplomat to abandon his planned visit to the site.",
      "The unusual incident threatened to further strain relations between Israel and France weeks after French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s call for an arms embargo on Israel prompted backlash from right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "The French Foreign Ministry said it would summon the Israeli ambassador in protest in the coming days.",
      "A strongly worded statement from France said Israeli security forces had intruded on the courtyard of the Church of the Pater Noster, angering French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot and prompting him to abandon his scheduled visit there.",
      "The ministry said Israeli police detained two staff members of the French Consulate in Jerusalem despite their diplomatic status, adding that the employees were released only after Barrot intervened.",
      "Barrot was meeting with Israeli officials Thursday in Jerusalem, where he pleaded for a cease-fire to stop the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and called for a diplomatic solution in Lebanon \u2014 a former French protectorate that Israel invaded last month in its broadening military campaign against the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group.",
      "\u201cThese actions are unacceptable,\u201d the French Foreign Ministry statement said of Thursday's fracas between Israeli security forces and French diplomatic staffers. \u201cFrance condemns (these actions) all the more vigorously as they come at a time when it is doing everything it can to work towards de-escalating the violence in the region.\u201d",
      "Israeli police portrayed the controversy as a misunderstanding, saying that two church workers who declined to identify themselves had refused entry to Israeli security guards accompanying Minister Barrot on his church visit.",
      "Israeli police said they held the men for some 20 minutes and released them once they were identified as employees of the French Consulate in Jerusalem, which is the protector of French holy sites and religious communities in the city.",
      "The Israeli police said all foreign ministers on official visits to Israel are assigned Israeli security guards for the duration of their trips. It said the logistics of Barrot's visit were worked out beforehand with the French Embassy in Israel, warning the public against contributing to \u201cmisleading narratives\" about the altercation.",
      "The original church that Barrot had planned to visit was built by the Crusaders who believed that it was on this site, on the Mount of Olives overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem, that Jesus taught the Pater Noster, or Lord\u2019s Prayer. The compound includes the ruins of the Byzantine Eleona Church and was entrusted to the Carmelite nuns in 1874.",
      "Thursday's incident was reminiscent of several others skirmishes over the years between irritated French officials and assertive Israeli bodyguards.",
      "In 2020, President Macron lost his temper at Israeli security officers who had insisted on accompanying him inside another French church in Jerusalem.",
      "In 1996, then-French President Jacques Chirac accused Israeli security forces of pushing and shoving his entourage in a spat that even drew an apology from a young Prime Minister Netanyahu during his first year in office.",
      "Such stand-offs take on symbolic significance in Jerusalem, among the most fiercely contested swaths of real estate on earth.",
      "Israel has viewed Jerusalem as its \u201cunified, eternal\u201d capital since capturing east Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians want those territories for their future state, with east Jerusalem serving as their eventual capital. Israel annexed the eastern part of the city in a move not recognized internationally.",
      "Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel more than a year ago, President Macron has stressed his support of Israel and its right to defend itself. But tensions have escalated in recent weeks as Macron has demanded that Israel do more to avoid the rapidly mounting civilian casualties in its campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon.",

      "Scholz announced the move at a news conference following weeks of disputes among the coalition partners over ways to boost the country's ailing economy. He said he would seek a vote of confidence in January that he said might lead to early elections that otherwise would be due next September.",

There is no basis of trust for further cooperation. Serious government work is not possible like this.\u201d",
      "He accused Lindner of publicly calling for a fundamentally different economic policy, including what Scholz said would be tax cuts worth billions for a few top earners while at the same time cutting pensions for all pensioners. \u201cThat is not decent,\u201d Scholz said.",
      "Scholz said he would seek the vote of confidence in Germany's Bundestag, or parliament, on Jan. 15, which would \"allow the members of the Bundestag to decide whether to clear the way for early elections.\u201d The election could then \u201ctake place by the end of March at the latest, in compliance with the deadlines set out in constitution,\" he said.",
      "The regular election is scheduled for September 2025.",
      "Germany\u2019s economy is expected to shrink in 2024 for the second year in a row, or at best stagnate, battered by external shocks and home-grown problems including red tape and a shortage of skilled labor.",
      "Scholz\u2019s center-left Social Democrats, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck\u2019s environmentalist, left-leaning Greens and Lindner\u2019s pro-business Free Democrats \u2014 a party that in recent decades has mostly allied with conservatives \u2014 set out in 2021 to form an ambitious, progressive coalition straddling ideological divisions that would modernize Germany.",
      "The government can point to achievements: preventing an energy crunch after Russia cut off its gas supplies to Germany, initiating the modernization of the military and a series of social reforms. But the impression it has left with many Germans is of deepening dysfunction.",

      "Trump Media and Technology Group reported late Tuesday that much of that loss stemmed from more than $12 million in legal fees, along with a decline in revenue, according to the surprise Election Day earnings report. Its stock price surged Wednesday but that was more likely due to Trump\u2019s defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris to retake the presidency than on its profit prospects.",

      "His brother managed to survive, clinging to a fence. He and his family had been caught in traffic driving home to Paiporta on Valencia's southern outskirts, Tarazona said. They had no chance to escape when the tsunami-like wave quickly overflowed the nearby drainage canal and swept away everything in its path.",
      "\u201cThey did not have time to do anything,\u201d Tarazona told The Associated Press, a week after the Oct. 29 flash floods. \u201cMy brother was dragged away and ended up clinging to a fence.\" His sister-in-law \"could not get out and died with her little girl.\u201d",
      "Tarazona had ridden a bike back to the site and taped a note on the car asking for whoever eventually removed the wreck off the side of the highway, to call him.",
      "\u201cIt all happened so fast,\u201d he said, tears coming to his eyes. \u201cIn half an hour the current had carried away the car. There was no time, no time. She managed to send me the location of their car hoping for a rescue.",

      "\u201cPaiporta is a strong village, but this overwhelms out capacities as a local administration,\u201d she said.",
      "The air-throbbing \u201cthup, thup, thup\u201d of the huge, two-propeller Chinook helicopters that have flown overhead with the arrival of the army has added to the post-apocalyptic atmosphere.",
      "The destruction, however, went far beyond Paiporta and covers a huge swath of municipalities, above all on the southern flank of Valencia city on the Mediterranean coast. Seventy-eight localities had at least one person die from the floods. Police have expanded their search to the nearby marshes and coastline, where the waters carried some away.",
      "The residents, businesses and town councils of the affected localities can apply for financial help from a 10.6-billion-euro relief package from Spain's government. The regional Valencia government, which is being slammed for not alerting the populace of the danger in time, has asked the central government in Madrid for 31 billion euros to ensure the recovery.",
      "Over a week later, the cleanup goes on to get rid of tons of mud and debris that clog street after street, filling thousands of ground floors, destroying living rooms and kitchens. Neighborhoods were left without shops and supermarkets after all their products were ruined. Many houses still don\u00b4t have drinking water.",

    "summary": "A new study says private jet carbon pollution soared 46% from 2019 to 2023",
    "story": [
      "A new study says private jet carbon pollution soared 46% from 2019 to 2023",
      "Carbon pollution from private jets has soared in the past five years, with most of those small planes spewing more heat-trapping carbon dioxide in about two hours of flying than the average person does in about a year, a new study finds.",
      "About a quarter million of the super wealthy \u2014 worth a total of $31 trillion \u2014 last year emitted 17.2 million tons (15.6 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide flying in private jets, according to Thursday's study in the Nature journal Communications Earth & Environment. That's about the same amount as the 67 million people who live in Tanzania,",
      "Private jet emissions jumped 46% from 2019 to 2023, according to the European research team that calculated those figures by examining more than 18.6 million flights of about 26,000 airplanes over five years.",
      "Only 1.8% of the carbon pollution from aviation is spewed by private jets and aviation as a whole is responsible for about 4% of the human-caused heat-trapping gases, the study said.",
      "It may seem like a small amount, but it's a matter of fairness and priorities, said the study's lead author, Stefan Gossling, a transportation researcher at the business school of Sweden's Linnaeus University.",
      "\u201cThe damage is done by those with a lot of money and the cost is borne by those with very little money,\" Gossling said.",
      "The highest emitting private jet user that the team tracked \u2014 but did not identify by name \u2014 spewed 2,645 tons (2,400 metric tons) of carbon dioxide in plane use, Gossling said. That's more than 500 times the global per person average of either 5.2 tons (4.7 metric tons) that the World Bank calculates or the 4.7 tons (4.3 metric tons) that the International Energy Agency figures and Gossling cites.",
      "\u201cThis report presents further proof that billionaires are causing the climate crisis,\u201d said Jonathan Westin, executive director of the advocacy organization Climate Organizing Hub. \u201cThey are clinging to their private jets and oil profits while regular people see increasing floods, hurricanes and wildfires.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year the International Energy Agency calculated that the world's top 1% of super-emitting people had carbon footprints more than 1,000 times bigger than the globe's poorest 1%.",
      "Gossling's study counted more than 35,600 tons (32,300 metric tons) of carbon pollution from just five global events \u2014 2022\u2019s World Cup in Qatar, 2023\u2019s World Economic Forum, 2023\u2019s Super Bowl, the 2023 Cannes film festival and the 2023 United Nations climate negotiations in Dubai. That came from 3,500 private jet flights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a grim joke that the billionaire class is flying private jets to the annual climate conferences, and the United Nations should crack down on this hypocritical practice,\u201d said Jean Su, energy justice director for the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "Researchers also examined more than 1,200 flights by celebrity actors, singers and directors, but Gossling declined to give the public figures\u2019 names.",
      "Many private flights aren't even for business \u201cnor are they necessary,\u201d Gossling said. \u201cThey are very often lifestyle related.\u201d",
      "While the study \u201cdoes shine a bright light on some of the most gluttonous emitters, i.e. the very wealthy,\u201d University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann said the focus shouldn't be on individual behaviors and someone's carbon footprint. He called that \u201ca distraction from the primary task at hand, which is decarbonizing our societal infrastructure through systematic change and policy.\u201d",
      "That's the problem, Gossling said.",
      "\u201cWe have been told for a long time that it is the system that needs to change, not the individual,\u201d Gossling said. \u201cThat has meant that nobody has been responsible for their lifestyles.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem is that the 26,000 aircraft and the individuals using them will say \u2018We are just a small group. We are not relevant in terms of emissions.\u2019 But everybody else will look at the small group and say, 'Look these are the super-emitters, if they are not relevant, how can we be relevant?\u201d Gossling said. \u201cAnd then you have this pointing at each other of two different groups that locks us in a circular argument.\u201d",
      "About 51% of those private jets burn at least 239 gallons of fuel per hour. That's translates to more carbon emissions in two hours and one minute than the IEA's estimate of the average person's yearly 4.7 tons (4.3 metric tons) of pollutants, the study calculated.",
      "\u201cGiven that technology is not going to resolve (climate change), I think the answer is clear. We need to start at the top,\u201d Gossling said.",
      "Gossling said the way to address the high-flying emissions is to charge a tax or landing fee equivalent to the damage done by each ton of emissions. That's about $200 or 200 euros. Westin called for a private jet ban.",
      "The United States is by far the hub of private jets with more than 68% of the globe's private aircraft, about 5 per 100,000 people, the study found. But Gossling said private jets are everywhere, even in poor countries.",
      "In the United States, Alaska has the most private jet flights per person, at nearly 5,000 per 100,000 residents, according to a different study by the student travel company Rustic Pathways.",

Having said that, we will be watching closely what changes management will make and how those changes may translate into sustainable sales and earnings growth rates.\u201d",
      "The company earned $87 million in the three months ended in September, down 96% from a year ago. Results were weighed down by hefty restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share totaled $1.09, falling short of the average Street forecast of $1.44 per share. Revenue rose 6.3% to $95.43 billion, topping analysts' estimates of $92.72 billion, according to a FactSet survey.",
      "The company said Oct. 18, when it announced the resignation of CEO Karen Lynch, that adjusted earnings in the quarter would fall between $1.05 and $1.10 per share. Analysts at the time expected $1.69 per share.",
      "CVS Health has cut its forecast three times this year. The company is slashing costs but, like some rivals, has been dogged by rising claims from its Medicare Advantage coverage.",
      "That involves privately run versions of the federal government\u2019s coverage program mainly for people age 65 and older.",
      "CVS Health also said it has been hurt by a quality ratings drop for those plans and pressure from Medicaid coverage it manages in several states.",
      "The performance has drawn criticism from shareholders like the hedge fund Glenview Capital Management, which has said the company was operating well below its potential.",
      "Glenview said last month that CVS Health\u2019s struggles in Medicare Advantage \u201creflect the poor decisions and risk management of a select few.",

      "The company also said earlier this fall that it will trim its workforce by about 2,900 people, or less than 1% of its total.",
      "In October, CVS Health also said that its third-quarter results would include a charge of around $1.2 billion tied to store closures next and its cost cutting plan.",

But Republican control could mean big shifts in the winning and losing industries underneath the surface, and investors are adding to bets built earlier on what the higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation that Trump favors will mean.",
      "\u201cThe markets are scrambling to figure out what happens next, but for the time being, the market is pricing in a higher growth and higher inflation outlook,\u201d Peter Esho of Esho Capital said.",
      "Of course, how much change Trump effects in his second term will likely depend on whether his fellow Republicans win control of Congress, and that\u2019s still to be determined. That could leave room for snaps back in some of Wednesday\u2019s big knee-jerk movements.",
      "Nevertheless, the market is cleaving between rather clear winners and losers following Trump\u2019s dramatic win. Among them:",
      "Bank stocks led the market higher, in part on hopes that a stronger economy would mean more customers getting loans and paying them back with interest. They also rallied on hopes for lighter regulation from a Republican White House. JPMorgan Chase soared 11.5%, and financial stocks had the biggest gain by far among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500. Capital One Financial climbed 15%, and Discover Financial jumped 20.2% for some of the market's biggest gains on speculation their pending merger will more easily get federal clearance under Trump.",
      "Trump has pledged to make the country \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high above $76,480, according to CoinDesk, and was recently just under $76,100. Companies in the crypto industry also jumped, including trading platform Coinbase\u2019s 31.1% leap.",
      "Musk has become a close ally of Trump, exhorting the former president\u2019s run. While Trump may end up hurting the electric-vehicle industry broadly by limiting government subsidies, analysts say Tesla could gain somewhat of an advantage by already being such a big player in the industry. Tesla revved 14.8% higher, while rival Rivian Automotive fell 8.3%.",
      "The company behind Trump\u2019s Truth Social platform rose 5.9% after jumping nearly 35% earlier in the day. It regularly trades more on Trump\u2019s popularity than on prospects for its profits. Its rise came even after it filed unaudited financial documents with regulators on Tuesday saying it lost $19.2 million during the latest quarter and that its sales weakened from a year earlier.",
      "A Trump-led Washington could push for tougher enforcement of the nation\u2019s borders, which could mean more business for companies that work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. GEO Group, which runs ICE processing centers, surged 42.1%.",
      "Trump\u2019s America-First policies could help companies that focus on customers within the United States, rather than big multinationals that could be hurt by increased tariffs and protectionism. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, which are seen as more domestically focused than the big stocks in the S&P 500, jumped 5.8%. That was more than double the S&P 500\u2019s gain.",
      "Investors see Trump\u2019s policies potentially leading to stronger economic growth, which helps push prices down for Treasurys and their yields up. Tax cuts under Trump could also further swell the U.S. government\u2019s deficit, which would increase its borrowing needs and force yields even higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.43% from 4.29% late Tuesday, which is a major move for the bond market. It\u2019s up substantially from August, when it was below 4%.",
      "Investors also see Trump\u2019s policies likely adding to future inflation, particularly tariffs, which can add costs to U.S. households\u2019 bills.",
      "\u201cTrump keeps openly telling people that he will increase tariffs not just on China but with every trade partner,\u201d said Andrzej Skiba, head of BlueBay U.S. Fixed Income at RBC Global Asset Management. \u201cWe\u2019re talking 10% tariffs across all global partners. This is a big deal because this could add 1% to inflation. If you add 1% to next year\u2019s inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts.\u201d",
      "A drop-off in immigration could also mean a crunch of available workers for employers, which could force companies to raise wages for workers faster and put more upward pressure on inflation.",
      "Much of Wall Street\u2019s run to records this year was built on expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, now that inflation seems to be heading back down to its 2% target. Easier interest rates help boost the economy, but they can also give inflation more fuel.",
      "The Fed will announce its latest decision on interest rates Thursday, where the expectation is still for a cut, according to data from CME Group. But traders are already paring back forecasts for how many cuts the Fed will provide through the middle of next year.",
      "Trump has vowed to sharply hike tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and other countries, raising worries about trade wars and disruptions to the global economy. A measure of the U.S. dollar\u2019s value against several major currencies climbed 1.6%, which means that those other currencies fell.",
      "The euro sank 1.5%, and the South Korean won fell 1.2% The Mexican peso, which has been falling against the dollar since the summer, in part on worries about a possible Trump re-election, fell early in the day but then pared its loss.",
      "Trump is a fan of fossil fuels, encouraging production of oil and natural gas. His win sent solar stocks sharply lower, including a 10.1% fall for First Solar and 16.8% slide for Enphase Energy.",
      "The only stock with a bigger loss in the S&P 500 was Super Micro Computer, which said its sales for the latest quarter could come in below its prior forecast. Its stock sank 18.1%.",
      "All told, the S&P 500 rose 146.28 points to 5,929.04. The Dow surged 1,508.05 to 43,729.93, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 544.29 to 18,983.47.",

      "Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump\u2019s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.",
      "\u201cTesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, in a note to investors. \u201cThis dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players.\u201d",

      "Four years ago, Fox News precipitated an internal crisis with a bold election night call that President Joe Biden would beat Donald Trump in the crucial state of Arizona. This year illustrated the difference that four years can make.",
      "Fox News wasn't the first network early on Wednesday to declare Trump had sealed his victory over Kamala Harris \u2014 upstart NewsNation, conservative rival Newsmax and Scripps Networks led the way \u2014 but its ultimate call came nearly four hours before ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and The Associated Press made theirs.",
      "Judging by the cheers that erupted when Fox's call was shown to the Trump faithful gathered at his West Palm Beach victory party, it was a decision that surely was received much better by its viewers than the 2020 call was.",
      "\u201cWhen you don't like how the cake tastes, you're not going to like the recipe,\u201d said Chris Stirewalt, politics editor at NewsNation. \u201cWhen you like the cake, you'll love the recipe.\u201d",
      "Fox's Bret Baier called Trump's victory \u201cthe biggest political phoenix from the ashes story that we have ever seen,\u201d and Fox can claim a comeback of its own.",
      "Fox's Arizona call in 2020 infuriated Trump and many of the network's viewers. While it ultimately proved correct, it set in motion furious internal second-guessing and led some Fox personalities to embrace conspiracy theories, which ultimately cost the network a staggering $787 million to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems.",
      "NewsNation, which used information from the elections forecasting company Decision Desk HQ, made its call at 1:22 a.m. on Wednesday. Scripps and Newsmax, which also use DDHQ, were within a minute of making the same declaration.",
      "At about that time, Baier said that \u201cwe're not there yet,\u201d but noted there was no path to victory for Harris. Fox made its call at 1:47 a.m.",
      "The AP called the election for Trump at 5:34 a.m. ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and the AP all made their calls within a few moments of each other. The AP explained that its declaration that Trump had won came after awarding Wisconsin to the former president by determining that remaining uncounted votes from around the Milwaukee area would not be enough for Harris to overcome Trump's lead there.",
      "For NewsNation's Stirewalt, his network's early call on Wednesday provided a rich irony. He was politics editor at Fox News in 2020 and he and a fellow executive, Bill Sammon, were essentially fired following the outcry over the Arizona call \u2014 even though they were proven right.",
      "\u201cIt would be easy to overstate the results and I want to be careful not to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI will say this, it is a victory for the way things used to be done and a personal vindication.\u201d",
      "He said Decision Desk HQ and NewsNation let the numbers do the talking with their calls. He would not criticize rivals for waiting longer, saying it was a natural reaction to be careful in making race calls following what happened in 2020.",
      "The happiness of some viewers at Fox's call was evident in some social media posts. Fox rejects any suggestion that its calls are politically motivated and its decision desk, led by veteran Arnon Mishkin, is widely respected in the industry. Stirewalt called Mishkin \u201csuperb\u201d and said \u201cit is to Fox's credit that they kept him when they didn't keep Bill Sammon and me.\u201d",
      "A vigorous conservative media ecosystem has built up in recent years to compete with Fox. But the network remains king of the hill, illustrated again Wednesday by the Nielsen company's preliminary ratings of television election night coverage.",
      "Fox averaged 9.7 million viewers for its coverage in the prime-time hours, well above second-place ABC News, which had 5.7 million. Newsmax, Fox's chief rival for conservative viewers, had 947,000 viewers and NewsNation had 237,000, Nielsen said.",
      "\u201cI am extremely proud of our team\u2019s commitment to delivering the top reporting and analysis to the largest and most politically diverse audience in news,\u201d Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott said of Tuesday night\u2019s ratings, according to the network.",
      "Trump's complicated relationship with the network also attests to its continued influence. The Republican candidate was a regular guest on its shows during the campaign, particularly the morning \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d yet also complains bitterly on social media if he doesn't like something that is said there.",

      "TORONTO -- Canada announced Wednesday it won\u2019t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it.",
      "Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc.",
      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",
      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",

TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",

      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",
      "Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China\u2019s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.",
      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell."

      "DANBURY, Conn. -- Caroline Ellison, a former top executive in Sam Bankman-Fried \u2019s fallen FTX cryptocurrency empire, began her two-year prison sentence Thursday for her role in a fraud that cost investors, lenders and customers billions of dollars.",
      "Ellison, 30, reported to the federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. She had pleaded guilty and testified extensively against Bankman-Fried, her former boyfriend, before he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.",

      "U.S. prosecutors accused Bankman-Fried and other top executives of looting customer accounts on the exchange to make risky investments, make millions of dollars of illegal political donations, bribe Chinese officials and buy luxury real estate in the Caribbean.",

      "The El Segundo, California-based company said Wednesday its revenue rose 7.6% to $81 million in the July-September period. That was higher than the $80.1 million Wall Street was expecting, according to analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "Still, Beyond Meat's shares fell nearly 6% in after-hours trading after it said it expects full-year net revenue in the range of $320 million to $330 million. That's at the low end of its previous forecast.",
      "Beyond Meat said it saw a 7% decrease in the volume of products sold but a 15.8% increase in net revenue per pound. The company has been trying to rely less on discounting and position its newer, lower-fat burgers, sausages and grounds as premium products.",
      "Among those new products is Beyond Sun Sausage, which is filled with bell peppers, spinach, lentils and other vegetables. Unlike previous products, Beyond Meat said the new sausage isn\u2019t intended to replicate meat but to be a healthier protein option.",
      "Beyond Meat President and CEO Ethan Brown said prices are rising on some products with premium ingredients such as avocado oil.

      "Beyond Meat said its U.S. retail volume in terms of pounds sold fell 6.6% in the third quarter but food service sales were up nearly 8%. Food service sales benefited from an expansion of Beyond Meat sales at Panda Express during the quarter.",
      "Outside the U.S., that pattern reversed; Beyond Meat's international retail sales were up 6% but its food service sales dropped 22%. Brown said Beyond Meat began selling its products at German retailers after working to meet their shelf-life requirements. It also launched plant-based nuggets at 1,500 McDonald's stores in France, although it saw lower sales in some other European markets.",
      "Beyond Meat said it narrowed its net loss to $26.6 million for the quarter, compared to $70.5 million in the third quarter a year ago. That loss, of 41 cents per share, also beat analysts' forecast of a 48-cent loss.",

      "The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point in response to the steady decline in the once-high inflation that had angered Americans and helped drive Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory this week",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate Thursday by a quarter-point in response to the steady decline in the once-high inflation that had angered Americans and helped drive Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory this week.",
      "The rate cut follows a larger half-point reduction in September, and it reflects the Fed\u2019s renewed focus on supporting the job market as well as fighting inflation, which now barely exceeds the central bank\u2019s 2% target.",
      "Thursday's move reduces the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate to about 4.6%, down from a four-decade high of 5.3% before September's meeting. The Fed had kept its rate that high for more than a year to fight the worst inflation streak in four decades. Annual inflation has since fallen from a 9.1% peak in mid-2022 to a 3 1/2-year low of 2.4% in September.",
      "In a statement after its latest meeting ended, the Fed said the \u201cunemployment rate has moved up but remains low,\u201d and while inflation has fallen closer to the 2% target level, it \u201cremains somewhat elevated.\u201d",
      "After their rate cut in September \u2014 their first such move in more than four years \u2014 the Fed\u2019s policymakers had projected that they would make further quarter-point cuts in November and December and four more next year. But with the economy now mostly solid and Wall Street anticipating faster growth, larger budget deficits and higher inflation under a Trump presidency, further rate cuts may have become less likely.",
      "Speaking at a news conference, though, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that \"in the near term, the election will have no effects on our (interest rate) decisions.\u201d",
      "Powell said the Fed intends, over time, to keep reducing its key rate toward what the central bank calls \u201cneutral\u201d \u2014 a level that neither restricts nor stimulates growth. He and other officials have acknowledged that they don\u2019t know exactly where the neutral rate is.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re on a path to a more neutral stance,\" the Fed chair said. \"That has not changed at all. We\u2019re just going to have to see where the data is.\u201d",
      "Beyond its economic consequences, Trump\u2019s election has also raised the specter of meddling by the White House in the Fed\u2019s policy decisions, with Trump having proclaimed that as president he should have a voice in the central bank\u2019s interest rate decisions. The Fed has long guarded its role as an independent institution able to make difficult decisions about borrowing rates, free from political interference. Yet during his previous term in the White House, Trump publicly attacked Powell after the Fed raised rates to fight inflation, and he may do so again.",
      "The economy, too, is clouding the picture by flashing conflicting signals, with growth solid but hiring weakening. Consumer spending, though, has been healthy, fueling concerns that there is no need for the Fed to reduce borrowing costs and that doing so might overstimulate the economy and even re-accelerate inflation.",
      "Financial markets are throwing yet another curve at the Fed: Investors have sharply pushed up Treasury yields since the central bank cut rates in September. The result has been higher borrowing costs throughout the economy, thereby diminishing the benefit to consumers of the Fed\u2019s half-point cut in its benchmark rate, which it announced after its September meeting.",
      "Broader interest rates have risen because investors are anticipating higher inflation, larger federal budget deficits, and faster economic growth under a President-elect Trump. Trump\u2019s plan to impose at least a 10% tariff on all imports, as well as significantly higher taxes on Chinese goods, and to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would almost certainly boost inflation. This would make it less likely that the Fed would continue cutting its key rate. Annual inflation as measured by the central bank\u2019s preferred gauge fell to 2.1% in September.",
      "Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that Trump\u2019s proposed 10% tariff, as well as his proposed taxes on Chinese imports and autos from Mexico, could send inflation back up to about 2.75% to 3% by mid-2026.",
      "Rate cuts by the Fed typically lead to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses over time. Yet this time, mortgage rates fell in anticipation of rate cuts but have since bounced back up as the economy has grown briskly, fueled by consumer spending. High borrowing costs not only for mortgages but also for car loans and other major purchases, even as the Fed is reducing its benchmark rate, has set up a potential challenge for the central bank: Its effort to support the economy by lowering borrowing costs may not bear fruit if investors are acting to boost longer-term borrowing rates.",
      "The economy grew at a solid annual rate just below 3% over the past six months, while consumer spending \u2014 fueled by higher-income shoppers \u2014 rose strongly in the July-September quarter.",
      "But companies have scaled back hiring, with many people who are out of work struggling to find jobs. Powell has suggested that the Fed is reducing its key rate in part to bolster the job market. If economic growth continues at a healthy clip and inflation climbs again, though, the central bank will come under growing pressure to slow or stop its rate cuts.",

      "The United States Nordic combined program has been salvaged for the upcoming World Cup season, receiving desperately needed financial help from the International Ski and Snowboard Federation.",
      "FIS gave Nordic Combined USA a grant last week, a contingency the Steamboat Springs, Colorado-based nonprofit needed to enter a new partnership with its Norwegian counterpart.",
      "\u201cDefinitely an extreme relief,\u201d Niklas Malacinski, a 2026 Olympic hopeful, told The Associated Press. \u201cI don't know how else this would've been done.\u201d",
      "Americans who compete internationally in Nordic combined, which encompasses ski jumping and cross-country skiing, lost funding for training and coaching from USA Nordic Sport last June.",
      "That decision sent athletes, their parents and supporters of the sport scrambling to save the season for the U.S. men and women after they showed signs of improvement during a two-year partnership with the traditionally powerful Norwegians.",
      "Nordic Combined USA was created to pick up the pieces. The all-volunteer nonprofit led by president Jill Brabec, whose daughter, Alexa, is a Nordic combined athlete and four-time Olympian Taylor Fletcher asked donors for funds and made a grant request with FIS.",
      "About $350,000 has been raised toward the organization's $500,000 budget for the 2024-25 season.",
      "\u201cWe've come a long way, but we still have a long way to go,\u201d said Fletcher, who is on the Nordic Combined USA board.",
      "The Americans will share coaches, training facilities, sports science data and efforts to attract sponsors with Norges Hopplandslaget. Even though Norway competes with the U.S., it wants the country to be a part of a sport that is often overlooked outside of Norway, Germany and Austria.",
      "\u201cWe need the U.S. team up there to make Nordic combined stronger short term and long term,\u201d Team Norway sport director Ivar Stuan said.",
      "In the past, Americans have had some success in the sport. Bill Demong became the first from the U.S. to win Olympic gold in Nordic combined at the 2010 Vancouver Games, where the Americans also earned two silver medals.",
      "It is in sports' best interest to have an American presence because Nordic combined could potentially be cut from the 2030 Winter Games in the French Alps. That would be one way to address the discipline being the only Olympic sport without gender equality.",
      "\u201cThere's always that risk,\u201d Fletcher said. \"The Olympics are always looking at keeping the program fresh and adding sports can come at a cost of other sports.",
      "\u201cWe're going to focus on building the sport to create a great TV product in as many nations as possible. We're fortunate to have this partnership with Norway again to allow our athletes to showcase the sport in the U.S. and across the world.\u201d",
      "Nordic combined, which was part of the first Winter Olympics in 1924, challenges athletes in a unique way. They need to have finesse and be fearless for ski jumping and the strength and stamina necessary for a 10-kilometer cross-country course.",
      "The Nordic combined World Cup season begins Nov. 28 in Ruka, Finland.",
      "FIS Nordic combined race director Lasse Ottesen declined to say how much money was given to Nordic Combined USA.",
      "\u201cThe amount of the grant is confidential, but we hope the support will contribute to further development of the cooperation with Norway and the youth development,\u201d Ottesen said Tuesday. \u201cThe U.S. is an important part of the Nordic Combined family and we are of course looking forward to come back to Salt Lake in 2034 for the Olympic Games.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Alex Ovechkin scored his 130th career game-winning goal to keep his hot streak going, the Washington Capitals winning and the Nashville Predators losing",
      "WASHINGTON -- Alex Ovechkin scoring to hand the Nashville Predators another defeat and keep his Washington Capitals rolling was not surprising to the folks on the other side who have seen him a lot over the years.",
      "\u201cYou knew it was coming,\u201d said Predators coach Andrew Brunette, whose final seven seasons as a player overlapped with Ovechkin's first seven in the NHL. \"You\u2019re on the bench and I guess I\u2019ve seen him too many times. I\u2019ve played against him, I\u2019ve coached against him, I\u2019ve watched him and he just finds that and when it\u2019s on his stick it\u2019s gone.",
      "\"That\u2019s a big-time shot from obviously arguably the greatest goal-scorer of all time.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin is now six away from breaking Jaromir Jagr's record for the most career game-winning goals. His 130th helped the Capitals improve to 9-3-0 this season and sent the Predators to their ninth loss in 13 games.",
      "\u201cIt (stinks) that he scored against us tonight and got the game-winner, but a guy that is still producing at this age is impressive,\u201d said Predators forward Steven Stamkos, who played his first 16 years in the league with Tampa Bay. \u201cTo keep doing it at this age is very impressive.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin has six goals in his past five games to reach 861 for his career. He's 34 away from breaking Wayne Gretzky's career mark that for decades had seemed unapproachable.",
      "Washington's longtime captain also became just the third player age 39 or older to score in five or more consecutive games, after Johnny Bucyk in 1974 and Brett Hull in 2003.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to go down as the guy with the most goals ever at some point here,\u201d Stamkos said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a generational goal scorer and a guy that I\u2019ve always looked up to in terms of how he scores goals. It\u2019s the hardest thing to do in the NHL is score and he\u2019s found a way to do it better than \u2014 soon \u2014 anyone ever.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin also continued his streak of scoring every game the Capitals wear their black \u201cScreaming Eagle\u201d jersey, on this occasion the first time in this, their 50th season. The player known as the \u201cGreat Eight\u201d is now 8 for 8 in this uniform.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know the stats, but I love this jersey,\" Ovechkin said. \"Fans love it, so it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin set up Aliaksei Protas earlier in the game, too, and has eight goals and eight assists.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always having fun,\" Ovechkin said. \"But when you're winning games, when you're producing opportunities to have a chance to score goals, it\u2019s always fun to play.\u201d",

      "Florida coach Billy Napier is getting a fourth season to try to get the Gators back to their winning ways",
      "GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- Florida coach Billy Napier is getting a fourth season to try to get the Gators back to their winning ways.",
      "Athletic director Scott Stricklin made the announcement in a \u201cletter to Gator Nation\u201d on Thursday that said the team is \u201cbuilding a foundation that promises greater success next season and beyond.\u201d",
      "The Gators (4-4, 2-3 Southeastern Conference) have made significant strides since lopsided losses to Miami and Texas A&M during the first month of the season. Napier shored up the team's shaky defense, found a potential star in freshman quarterback DJ Lagway and developed young talent on both sides of the ball.",
      "It\u2019s the kind of progress that made Stricklin's decision a relatively easy one despite Napier's 15-18 mark in Gainesville ahead of Saturday's game at No. 5 Texas.",
      "\u201cUF's commitment to excellence and a championship-caliber program is unwavering,\u201d Stricklin wrote. \u201cIn these times of change across college athletics, we are dedicated to a disciplined, stable approach that is focused on long-term, sustained success for Gator athletes, recruits and fans.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Billy will meet the challenges and opportunities ahead.\u201d",
      "The Gators went toe-to-toe with then-No. 8 Tennessee in Knoxville last month and again with second-ranked Georgia last week in Jacksonville.",
      "Florida lost 23-17 in overtime to the Volunteers after squandering several chances to pull off a stunner. And there are plenty who believe the Gators would have won \u201cThe World\u2019s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party\u201d had Lagway not pulled his hamstring in the second quarter while leading 10-3.",
      "\u201cBefore the season started, nobody expected us to be anything,\" running back Ja'Kobi Jackson said Wednesday. \"But we\u2019re proving to people day-in and day-out that we can play in the SEC, that we\u2019re capable of beating teams.\u201d",
      "In September, no one saw that coming. And it appeared Napier wouldn\u2019t even finish the season.",
      "Florida was inept on both sides of the ball in a 41-17 loss to rival Miami to open the season and showed no improvement in a 33-20 loss to Texas A&M two weeks later. Under first-year coach Mike Elko, the Aggies ran for 310 yards, got three touchdowns from a freshman quarterback making his first collegiate start and ended a 10-game road skid.",
      "But Napier\u2019s popularity started to turn with a dominant victory at Mississippi State and then a bye week that became a series of ultra-competitive practices \u2014 on-field work that players point to as the key to getting on track.",
      "While some wondered if the Gators would start giving up or opting out, they dug in for Napier.",
      "\u201cEverything Coach Napier says, everybody\u2019s bought into it,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing for each other at the end of the day. We play for everyone that\u2019s in this building.\"",
      "Florida would owe Napier roughly $26 million by firing him in 2024. His buyout drops to around $19 million in 2025, although that figure would be considerably higher with his legion of assistants and behind-the-scenes help.",
      "Even with Napier remaining in place, he's still likely to open next year on the proverbial hot seat. And for good reason.",
      "Florida is 2-12 against ranked teams and 1-10 against rivals Florida State, Georgia, LSU, Miami and Tennessee. And Napier\u2019s in-game mistakes continue to mount (see Tennessee), although at a much slower pace.",
      "Nonetheless, growth outweighs growing pains. And with November being a key recruiting month, Florida administrators opted to give Napier a vote of confidence, especially with his team so banged up. The Gators could be down their top two quarterbacks, including Lagway, their top two running backs, two of their top four receivers and four cornerbacks when they take the field in Austin.",

      "A prosecutor overseeing the case told local radio that Lozano had been under investigation for over a year. Although he has not been criminally charged, authorities ordered his arrest because they deemed he is a flight risk and could obstruct their investigation.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- DeMar DeRozan scored 27 points in a record-setting performance and the Sacramento Kings beat the Toronto Raptors 122-107 on Wednesday night.",
      "Domantas Sabonis added 17 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds for his third triple-double of the season for Sacramento. He shot 6 for 6 from the field and 5 for 5 at the free-throw line.",
      "Keegan Murray chipped in with 22 points and 12 rebounds, and De\u2019Aaron Fox scored 21.",
      "The 35-year-old DeRozan has scored at least 20 points in each of his first eight games with the Kings, breaking a franchise mark established by Chris Webber when he reached 20 in his first seven games with Sacramento in 1999.",
      "DeRozan spent the past three seasons with the Chicago Bulls. The six-time All-Star also has played for Toronto and San Antonio during his 16-year NBA career.",

      "Sabonis had the eighth game in the NBA since at least 1982-83 with a triple-double while missing no shots from the field or foul line. The previous player to do it was Josh Giddey for Oklahoma City against Portland on Jan. 11.",

      "A remarkable era of parity in Major League Baseball hit a bit of a snag this October when the big-spending New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets finished as three of the top four teams in this year\u2019s postseason",
      "SAN ANTONIO -- A remarkable era of parity in Major League Baseball hit a bit of a snag this October when the big-spending New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets finished as three of the top four teams in this year's postseason.",
      "Sometimes, all that money really is an advantage.",
      "Now it's time for the sport's middle-sized and small-market franchises to look for ways to counter during this offseason. Given several factors \u2014 particularly cash flow uncertainty due to the collapse of the regional sports network model \u2014 that could prove difficult.",
      "\u201cIt's going to be a challenge for Major League Baseball leadership,\u201d St. Louis Cardinals GM John Mozeliak said on Wednesday. \u201cHow do you remain with some level of competitive balance when there are so many teams that have so much higher revenues than the lower end?\u201d",
      "The fact that the Cardinals are worried about their financial future should be fairly alarming. This is a franchise that's been among baseball's most consistent over the past several decades, winning World Series titles in 2006 and 2011. They may not spend like the Dodgers, Yankees or Mets, but they've usually had reasonably deep pockets.",
      "\u201cWe've always punched above our weight, so to speak,\u201d Mozeliak said. \u201cBut now we're having the realization that we're going to be affected from our media package, our ticket sales, so our reality is changing.\u201d",
      "The Cardinals' dilemma is one shared by several other teams. MLB announced in October it will produce and distribute local broadcasts for the Cleveland Guardians, Milwaukee Brewers and Minnesota Twins next year. All three teams had contracts with Diamond Sports Group that expired at the end of the regular season.",
      "The Texas Rangers, whose deal also expired last month, announced they will no longer be partnering with Diamond. They are assessing their options for next season.",
      "The addition of the Guardians, Brewers and Twins means MLB will be handling the production and distribution of at least six teams going into 2025. The Arizona Diamondbacks, Colorado Rockies and San Diego Padres were the first three to make the switch.",
      "MLB could be taking over more teams as Diamond continues to go through bankruptcy proceedings.",
      "The Cardinals reached a new media rights on Thursday, though financial terms were not disclosed. They are one of five teams that are part owners of their regional sports network, along with the Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Angels and Miami Marlins. The stations are FanDuel Sports Network affiliates after Diamond reached a naming rights deal with FanDuel last month.",
      "MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has remained bullish about the long-term financial prospects of all 30 teams, but has also acknowledged that there might be some short-term pain as the transition continues.",
      "D-backs general manager Mike Hazen has always believed that a lower payroll is no excuse for poor performance. Arizona advanced to the World Series in 2023 despite having ranked No. 21 in the league in that category.",
      "The team spent more last offseason thanks to postseason revenue, rising to the middle of the MLB pack. He said his team is ready to be active in free agency once again, even if he conceded that there are challenges.",
      "\u201cObviously, it builds in some sort of uncertainty for us, but we get with (ownership) and figure out what we have to spend, what we can add and then we act accordingly,\u201d Hazen said.",
      "The Mets ($332 million), Yankees ($311 million) and Dodgers ($266 million) had the top three payrolls in baseball last season, though those numbers will change slightly this winter when bonuses are calculated. The Guardians ranked No. 23 at $109 million. Unlike the NFL, NBA and NHL, baseball does not have a salary cap.",
      "As the Guardians showed, it's not impossible to go deep into the playoffs with a modest payroll. But it's not easy and it's not getting any easier.",
      "\u201cYou have to scratch and claw and match up and make moves, take shots and hope that it works,\u201d Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said last month. \u201cWhereas for the other three teams, for the majorities, they set their lineup and go play.\u201d",
      "Not everyone believes that MLB teams are suffering much financial hardship. Baseball super agent Scott Boras called the regional sports network uncertainty \u201clast year's news\u201d and doesn't believe it will have much affect on the free agent market this winter.",
      "\u201cClubs have been offered contracts from RSNs and they've rejected them, they're building their own platforms, they're using different methods for streaming,\u201d Boras said. \"You've seen it with Texas, Milwaukee. They're offered money but they feel they can do better with other elements.",
      "\u201cThat should tell you about their evolution of thought \u2014 how they feel going forward with streaming.\u201d",

      "Agent Scott Boras indicated Juan Soto may be seeking to top Shohei Ohtani\u2019s record $700 million contract because he is three years younger than the Japanese two-way star was when he reached his deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers",
      "SAN ANTONIO -- Agent Scott Boras indicated Juan Soto may be seeking to top Shohei Ohtani\u2019s record $700 million contract because he is three years younger than the Japanese two-way star was when he reached his deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "Boras gave a pun-filled, 48-minute assessment of the market at the general managers meetings on Wednesday, calling Soto \u201cthe Mona Lisa of the museum.\u201d Boras said only a handful of players have matched Soto\u2019s accomplishments at age 26, mentioning Willie Mays, Hank Aaron and Ted Williams, and boasted \u201che has literally 15 years more of his prime to offer.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a business opportunity where you can make literally billions of dollars by acquiring somebody,\u201d Boras said. \u201cYou can really see that owners, general managers, that they\u2019re kind of called upon to be championship magicians. ... It\u2019s hard to do, to put together that magic of a championship run, but behind every great magician obviously is the magic Juan.\u201d",
      "Ohtani agreed to his 10-year contract late last year and helped lead the team to its second World Series title in five years. The deal contains $680 million in deferred money payable from 2034-43, reducing its average annual value for purposes of baseball\u2019s luxury tax to approximately $46.08 million.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Ohtani has much to do with Juan Soto, at all,\u201d Boras said. \"It\u2019s not something we discuss or consider. Juan Soto is \u2014 he\u2019s in an age category that separates him from all.\u201d",
      "He wouldn\u2019t publicly discuss specifics of what Soto is seeking.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about dollars and cents. That\u2019s something we\u2019ll take care of with the clubs,\u201d Boras said.",
      "He dismissed the idea of Soto accepting deferred money similar to Ohtani.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that tax considerations are the focal point when you\u2019re talking about a business opportunity where you can make literally billions of dollars by acquiring somebody,\u201d he said.",
      "Boras sprinkled in attempts at humor when discussing several of his top free agents:",
      "\u2014First baseman Pete Alonso, nicknamed the Polar Bear: \u201cWe hear a lot about the bear market for power-hitting first baseman and for Pete\u2019s sake, it\u2019s the polar opposite.\u201d",
      "\u2014Pitcher Corbin Burnes: \u201cHe continues to be a Corbin copy of his previous seasons.\u201d",
      "\u2014Pitcher Blake Snell: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Snelling salts have created a lot of whiffs.\u201d",
      "\u2014Third baseman Alex Bregman: \u201cHe\u2019s provided the Astros with an infusion of championship blood. I\u2019d say everything about him is AB positive.\u201d",
      "Soto was traded from Washington to San Diego in 2022 after turning down a $440 million, 15-year offer. He was dealt to the New York Yankees last December and hit .288 with 41 homers, 109 RBIs and 128 runs, hitting second in the batting order ahead of Aaron Judge. The Yankees want to retain Soto after he helped them reach the World Series for the first time since 2009.",
      "Soto is expected to be pursued by the New York Mets and billionaire owner Steve Cohen.",
      "\u201cThe Mets are obviously trying to get to their goal, which is winning a world championship,\u201d Boras said. \u201cI think they\u2019ve been very clear about pursuing this aggressively.\u201d",
      "Soto intends to meet with owners who want him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to commit my career to it and I want the owner to commit his resources to it,\u201d Boras said of his client\u2019s mindset. \u201cThat\u2019s really why Juan Soto became a free agent.\u201d",
      "Boras said Soto would be a moneymaker for whichever team he signs with.",
      "\u201cWhen the owners win repeatedly, their revenues skyrocket. They develop the impact of postseason play, attendance, rights in the streaming world,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus the international branding.\u201d",
      "Boras maintained that disruption in broadcast revenue should not be a factor in the market, which was slow last offseason after Diamond Sports Group filed for bankruptcy. MLB took over broadcasts of the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks during the 2023 season, the Colorado Rockies this year and the Cleveland Guardians, Milwaukee Brewers and Minnesota Twins for 2025.",

      "For a World Series that was supposed to feature an epic battle between sluggers Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani, guys like Mark Leiter Jr., Luke Weaver, Alex Vesia and Anthony Banda sure got a lot of face time",
      "SAN ANTONIO -- For a World Series that was supposed to feature an epic battle between sluggers Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani, guys like Mark Leiter Jr., Luke Weaver, Alex Vesia and Anthony Banda sure got a lot of face time.",
      "This year's Fall Classic provided further proof that a great bullpen is essential in baseball, particularly in the postseason. It also has led to concerns from people ranging from superagent Scott Boras to players' association head Tony Clark that the sport is abusing arms.",
      "Regardless, building a quality bullpen remains a challenge.",
      "\u201cYou need so many arms over the course of the season, and in the postseason, it\u2019s even more magnified,\u201d Los Angeles Angels general manager Perry Minasian said. \u201cQuality arms, quality strikes. But quantity is a big deal, too. Where do you get it?\u201d",
      "The bullpen is usually an afterthought for casual baseball fans, particularly middle relievers, who don't get the spotlight of the ninth inning. They toil in relative anonymity while getting tough outs in tough situations and are much like NFL offensive linemen \u2014 noticed only when something goes terribly wrong.",
      "The Dodgers used Vesia, Banda and Michael Kopech in four out of the five games of the World Series while Blake Treinen and Brusdar Graterol appeared in three games. They combined to throw 15 1/3 innings \u2014 often in high-leverage situations \u2014 and gave up five runs.",
      "That's a 2.93 ERA.",
      "For a bunch of guys only serious seamheads know, that's not too shabby.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of good players, and they understand that it\u2019s about getting 27 outs a night,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cIt could be anyone at any given moment.\u201d",
      "Building a big league bullpen is intriguing because cost isn't really the prohibitive factor, making it arguably the most egalitarian position in a sport that doesn't have a salary cap. Banda ($740,000), Vesia ($1 million), Treinen ($1 million), Kopech ($3 million) and Graterol ($2.7 million) made pocket change compared with their teammate Ohtani, who signed a record $700 million, 10-year deal last offseason.",
      "Instead, it comes down to scouting, development and sometimes dumb luck. It's sometimes more art than science.",
      "\u201cI wish we knew,\u201d said Erik Neander, Tampa Bay's president of baseball operations. \u201cWe would have won more games last year.\u201d",
      "Boras is among those who aren\u2019t pleased with the way relievers are being used. Clay Holmes pitched for the Yankees in all five games of the World Series and there\u2019s little doubt that pitchers \u2014 particularly relievers \u2014 are being pushed to exhaustion in October.",
      "\u201cWe have got to stop burning up our beautiful young arms by pitching them in a way, in a manner, that we would never do during the (regular) season,\u201d Boras said Wednesday.",
      "Over the past 10 years, the average fastball velocity has risen from 93.3 mph to 95.5 during the 2024 regular season. Injury rates also have skyrocketed, with 484 pitchers going on the injured list this year, nearly double the 2014 total.",
      "Regardless of how GMs feel about bullpen usage, the injury explosion is one more reason that finding consistent relievers is a difficult task.",
      "Using valuable young arms in the bullpen is risky, but pursuing veteran relievers in free agency is also a crapshoot. Take the case of Treinen, a 36-year-old who has had a career that typifies the ups and downs of being a reliever.",
      "He was an All-Star in 2018 with the Oakland Athletics, with a microscopic 0.78 ERA and 100 strikeouts over 80 1/3 innings. The next year, he fell off drastically with a 4.91 ERA.",
      "The Dodgers thought he could bounce back in 2020 and they were right \u2014 he had a solid season and helped lead LA to a World Series title. It went so well that the Dodgers signed him to a two-year deal after the season. He was great again in 2021 but suffered a serious shoulder injury and missed almost the entire 2022 season.",
      "He signed an extension but missed the 2023 season with the same shoulder injury and didn't return until 2024, when he bounced back again with a 1.93 ERA and another championship.",
      "Now Treinen is back on the market.",
      "\u201cYou can look at it multiple ways,\u201d said Minasian, who was speaking generally and not about Treinen. \u201cYou might say: 'Wow, he's taken the ball a ton. He's been used drastically over the last three, four years, so I'm not sure what it's going to look like going forward,' or it could be: \u2018Hey, he\u2019s held up. He pitches. He's been consistent and takes the ball.'\u201d",
      "The Houston Astros are a team that's had a great bullpen over the last several years with pitchers like Hector Neris and Ryan Pressly. General manager Dana Brown said there's always volatility in the bullpen, but that's not all due to injuries.",
      "\u201cIt's just the game today,\u201d Brown said. \u201cYou have all this information, and sometimes the hitters, they study you. The film \u2014 they look at it. They find your weak spots and try to exploit you.\u201d",
      "Brown said one quality he likes in relievers is a sense of humility, understanding that they might have to change their strategy on the mound as their body deals with a long career.",
      "\u201cThe guys who don't have a teachable spirit, or the aptitude, they sometimes get lost in the sauce,\u201d Brown said.",

      "Magic: Lost fifth in a row in a humbling road trip. Orlando's last win was at home against the Pacers on Oct. 28. Suggs disappeared early as the 17.6-point scorer mustered just two points in the first 19 minutes.",
      "Pacers: After a sluggish 1-3 start, Indiana has won three of four because the Pacers are sharing the ball better and pushing the pace. It helps that Haliburton has regained more of his All-Star form after being slowed by a back injury.",
      "Down 97-96 with 8:45 remaining, the Pacers went on a 16-6 run in 4:05 as four players contributed. Turner hit a 3 with a dunk and Haliburton sank a trey with a layup. The Magic never led again.",
      "Walker, a second-year pro, set a new career best in points as he made all seven shots, including three 3s. He also had six rebounds.",
      "The Magic host New Orleans on Friday, and the Pacers visit Charlotte on Friday.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Fernando Valenzuela was remembered for \u201chaving the heart of a lion\u201d throughout his stellar pitching career with the Los Angeles Dodgers during a funeral highlighting his Catholic faith on Wednesday.",
      "Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Gomez sprinkled holy water on Valenzuela's casket and later waved incense over it. Nearby a portrait of a smiling Valenzuela rested against the altar.",
      "\u201cHis death came too soon,\u201d the Rev. James Anguiano said in his sermon.",
      "The public Mass at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in downtown Los Angeles included fans wearing Dodgers gear, some in Valenzuela\u2019s No. 34 jersey. Many held up cell phones to record moments.",
      "Valenzuela died on Oct. 22 at age 63, three days before the Dodgers began their eventual run to the franchise's eighth World Series championship, beating the New York Yankees in five games last week. No cause of death was given.",
      "\u201cI really think Fernando hoped to witness the Dodgers win the World Series this year but you know he did witness the Dodgers as champions,\u201d Anguiano said. \u201cFernando had a front-row seat, perfect from heaven.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know like I\u2019m standing here that Fernando is up there, he\u2019s letting us know he\u2019s doing well and he\u2019s celebrating along with the Dodgers in their World Series championship,\u201d said Mike Scioscia, who caught Valenzuela in many of his starts in 1981, including a five-hit shutout on Opening Day.",
      "The Dodgers went on to win the World Series that year, in six games against the Yankees. The Mexican-born Valenzuela is the only player to earn the NL Cy Young Award and Rookie of the Year honors in the same season.",
      "Scioscia, at times speaking in Spanish, eulogized Valenzuela for having \u201cthe heart of a lion.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was 20-years-old in 1981 when he was going through Fernandomania and he just kept perspective the whole way,\u201d Scioscia said. \u201cFernando never got too big for his britches. He was always well-grounded, he knew that he had a talent and he wanted to go out there and do it every time. He always felt he was the best in the world but he never told anybody about it.\u201d",
      "Fernando Valenzuela Jr. gave a tearful eulogy of his pap\u00e1 in Spanish, pausing to wipe his face with a white cloth. Valenzuela\u2019s wife, Linda, and other children Ricardo, Linda and Maria sat in the front row, along with his grandchildren.",
      "\u201cFernando no longer has to look up nor does he have to look down,\u201d Anguiano said, referring to Valenzuela's skyward glance during his unusual delivery. \u201cFernando is alive and present in our hearts and in our lives.\u201d",
      "The nine-member Mariachi Sol de Mexico played and sang throughout the service. It concluded with eight pallbearers ushering his casket covered in white roses to a waiting hearse.",
      "Former Dodgers Orel Hershiser, Ron Cey, Reggie Smith, Jerry Reuss, Manny Mota, Justin Turner, Rick Sutcliffe, Nomar Garciaparra and Jesse Orosco were among the mourners. They were joined by former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley, current president and CEO Stan Kasten, team COO Bob Wolfe, team general counsel Sam Fernandez and actor Edward James Olmos.",
      "Valenzuela's colleagues on the team's Spanish-language broadcasts, Jaime Jarr\u00edn who retired in 2022 and, Jos\u00e9 Mota, were there.",

      "A person with knowledge of the situation says Dak Prescott\u2019s injured hamstring is partially torn away from the bone and surgery for the star quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys is possible",
      "FRISCO, Texas -- Dak Prescott's injured hamstring is partially torn away from the bone and surgery for the star quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys is possible, a person with knowledge of the situation said Thursday.",
      "The injury, known as a partial avulsion, is likely to lead to an absence longer than the minimum of four games that would be required by putting Prescott on injured reserve.",
      "Potentially season-ending surgery is among the options being considered, the person told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team hasn't disclosed details of Prescott's injury publicly. The NFL Network was the first to report the extent of Prescott's injury.",
      "In training camp two years ago, former Cowboys left tackle Tyron Smith sustained what is called a full avulsion, a complete tear of the hamstring off the bone that requires surgery, and missed 13 games.",
      "Prescott was injured in the second half of the Cowboys' 27-21 loss to Atlanta on Sunday. Dallas (3-5) is preparing for Cooper Rush to start multiple games, beginning Sunday at home against NFC East rival Philadelphia.",
      "Rush went 4-1 filling in two years ago after Prescott broke the thumb on his throwing hand in a season-opening loss. He also won a game in 2021 when Prescott was out with a strained calf.",
      "The Cowboys have made the playoffs three consecutive years with a 12-5 record, but have already matched that loss total and are three games behind Washington and the Eagles in the loss column in the NFC East.",
      "If Prescott doesn't return, it will be the second time in five years the 2016 AP Offensive Rookie of the Year has been sidelined most of the season. He broke an ankle in Week 5 of the 2020 season and missed 11 games.",

      "Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes practiced as usual Wednesday and plans to be ready for this weekend\u2019s game against the Broncos",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes practiced as usual Wednesday and plans to be ready for this weekend's game against the Broncos, two days after tweaking his left ankle while throwing a touchdown pass in a win over the Buccaneers.",
      "Mahomes was rolling to his right and thinking about running for a first down as the Chiefs were trying to rally in the second half against Tampa Bay on Monday night. He suddenly saw Samaje Perine coming open and flicked a pass to him in the end zone, just as his ankle caught in the soggy turf of Arrowhead Stadium and sent a sharp pain rocketing through it.",
      "Mahomes lay on the sideline for a moment before he was helped partway across the field, then trotted without any assistance the rest of the way to the Kansas City sideline. He was examined there but did not miss a play, eventually helping the Chiefs to another touchdown in regulation and the winning drive in overtime for a 30-24 victory over the Bucs.",
      "\u201cIt's doing good,\" Mahomes said of his ankle Wednesday. \"Obviously went on a little bit of a roll. It's a little sore. But I'm able to move around and looking forward to getting out in practice and seeing how I can push it as the week goes on.\u201d",
      "Mahomes has plenty of experience nursing ankle injuries.",
      "The most high-profile one occurred during the playoffs two seasons ago, and he needed every bit of help recovering in time to face the Eagles in the Super Bowl. Mahomes tweaked it again in the first half but returned to lead the Chiefs to victory.",
      "\u201cWe won't have to back off,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said of the two-time NFL MVP. \u201cHe manages it. He stays on top of it.\u201d",
      "That process began immediately after Monday night's game, then continued at home \u2014 every day made more important by the fact that Kansas City is facing the Broncos on a short week Sunday. Mahomes was in the practice facility early Tuesday to watch game film and get additional treatment, and he was ready for the first practice of the week Wednesday.",
      "\u201cYou can only do so much,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cIt was pretty late getting some stuff in the training room after the game, getting some stuff to take home. Stuff you can put on overnight to reduce swelling. You come in early in the morning \u2014 it was a long day of watching film and getting treatment, and preparing yourself for a short week.\u201d",
      "In other injury news, Reid said wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster still would not practice as he nurses a hamstring injury that has kept him out of most of the past three games. Defensive tackle Tershawn Wharton also was out with a bruised knee.",
      "Reid also had no update on Charles Omenihu and Isiah Pacheco, both of whom the Chiefs hope to get back for the stretch run.",
      "Omenihu tore the ACL in his right knee in their AFC title win over Baltimore and had surgery in February, and he has spent the entire season on the physically unable-to-perform list. Pacheco has been out since Week 2, when he fractured his fibula in a win over Cincinnati and landed on injured reserve following surgery.",
      "The Chiefs have been able to overcome a host of injuries \u2014 including devastating ones to Rashee Rice and Marquise Brown that thinned out their wide receiver corps \u2014 by making some savvy moves in the front office.",
      "Kansas City traded for Patriots defensive end Joshua Uche just before the deadline, and he made his debut as a pass-rushing specialist in Monday night's win over the Buccaneers. The Chiefs also signed Kareem Hunt after Pacheco's injury, and their one-time star has delivered: He has logged at least 21 carries in each of the last four games, scoring touchdowns in all of them, and has twice eclipsed 100 yards, including the winning two-yard TD plunge in overtime against Tampa Bay.",
      "Perhaps none of the moves has been as high-profile as the Chiefs' trade with Tennessee for DeAndre Hopkins, though.",
      "The three-time All-Pro wide receiver practiced just two days before playing a limited role in a win in Las Vegas. Then, he logged a full week of work and showed out Monday night, catching eight passes for 86 yards and two scores against the Bucs.",
      "\u201cYou just continue to get him more and more comfortable in the offense,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cWe move him around and let him do what he's special at, and that's catching the football and winning those one-on-one matchups.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Jayden Daniels has not thought much about his rookie year",
      "ASHBURN, Va. -- Jayden Daniels has not given much thought to how he has handled half a season playing quarterback in the NFL.",
      "\"I still have some ways to go,\" he said. \"I\u2019ll sit back and reflect after my rookie year is done.\"",
      "That's OK. The rest of the sport has plenty to say about Daniels taking the league by storm, leading the Washington Commanders to their first 7-2 start since 1996 and becoming not only the favorite to be the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year but putting himself firmly in the MVP conversation.",
      "\u201cYou guys got to stop calling him a rookie quarterback,\" veteran tight end Zach Ertz said. \"He may be a rookie quarterback in terms of years in this league. But his maturity, his poise is that of a 10-year vet.\u201d",
      "Daniels' breakout season has come as no surprise to those who knew the San Bernadino, California, native during stints at Arizona State and then LSU, where he blossomed into the 2023 Heisman Trophy winner and the second pick in the draft. Teammates turned friends and coaches over the years have seen a player determined to be the best and a person humble enough to make these past nine weeks look like just the start of a lengthy career with no limit on what Daniels could accomplish.",
      "Inheriting the pressure of being Washington's face of the franchise for an organization decades removed from its glory days did not seem to get to Daniels, who teammates have said has had the same approach since the first day of offseason workouts through throwing a Hail Mary touchdown pass to Noah Brown in Week 8 to beat Chicago.",
      "That is one of his first 163 completions on 228 attempts \u2014 a success rate of 71.5% that ranks among the best QBs in the NFL of any experience level. He has thrown for nine touchdowns, run for four more and has just two interceptions.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t turn the ball over a lot,\u201d said Herm Edwards, who coached Daniels for three seasons at Arizona State. \u201cThat isn\u2019t part of his DNA. That\u2019s not what happens. You never worry about that as far as him with the football in his hand, whether he\u2019s throwing it or running. He\u2019s become a smarter runner, obviously, and that\u2019s needed in this league.\"",
      "The biggest blip for Daniels came when he injured his ribs getting tackled and landing awkwardly at the end of a long run. He left that game \u2014 a 40-7 rout of Carolina \u2014 and might have played if the stakes were higher, then he was right back on the field a week later.",
      "Daniels, even with sore ribs, has thrown for 535 yards and three TDs and ran 16 times for 87 yards.",
      "\"It\u2019s not a surprise to me,\" said San Francisco receiver Brandon Aiyuk, a teammate of Daniels' at Arizona State. \u201cHe\u2019s just nice. He\u2019s real good. He\u2019s just always been that good.\u201d",
      "Malik Nabers heard the chatter about Daniels when he was transferring to LSU in 2022, and that first season finished with some great numbers: 17 touchdowns, three interceptions and a 10-4 record. Then, after training with C.J. Stroud and others in California, Nabers noticed a shift in Daniels' mindset and demeanor.",
      "\u201cHe was just like picking defenses apart,\u201d said Nabers, the sixth pick in the draft and now the No. 1 receiver for the NFC East-rival New York Giants. \"He was working extra, staying extra long, making sure we got the plays after practice. He was the ultimate leader. I think that\u2019s what he changed: He became like the ultimate leader and started leading by example, leading by vocalness and just taking the offense over.\u201d",
      "Daniels led the country with 40 TD passes in 2023, ran for 10 more and won the Heisman as the final accomplishment of his college career. But the arriving early and staying late did not stop, from walkthroughs in the team's practice bubble before spring workouts with rookie receiver Luke McCaffrey to nights coach Dan Quinn observed Daniels studying film well after dark during the Commanders' week in Arizona between games.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not any magic that\u2019s going into this. ... He really puts in the work,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic pixie dust that we\u2019re throwing into him. It is absolutely grinding, working, and a lot of confidence comes from that.\u201d",
      "It's not just sweat equity. At LSU, Daniels underwent cognitive processing tests on a computer, and with the school's director of performance innovation, Jack Marucci, developed a program with a virtual reality headset to work on his anticipation.",
      "\u201cYou could see his efficiency and speed improving and how he was scanning,\" Marucci said, pointing out it was like Daniels got another 250 snaps a week and 2,600 over the course of a season. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing and anticipating where he\u2019s going to end up and now you have to hit a spot on the field.\u201d",
      "Daniels still uses the VR device, which offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury is \u201call-in on.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a great tool, not just for me, but the other quarterbacks \u2014 the guys that want to use it to get an edge and get the reps without having to go out there and physically do stuff,\u201d Daniels said.",
      "Kingsbury interviewed for multiple jobs around the NFL. After coaching Patrick Mahomes at Texas Tech, Kyler Murray with the Arizona Cardinals and then (as an adviser) with Caleb Williams at Southern California, the chance to work with Daniels \u2014 who was drafted a few months after he was hired in Washington \u2014 and the Commanders made too much sense.",
      "\u201cKliff Kingsbury is an outstanding fit for him,\" LSU coach Brian Kelly said. \u201cAnd the kind of offense that they run, it\u2019s something that I think is seamless for him.\"",
      "Cam Taylor-Britt derided it as \u201csimple\u201d and a \u201cnice college offense.\u201d Daniels burned the Cincinnati Bengals cornerback and his teammates on 21 of 23 passing for 254 yards and two touchdowns in a 38-33 victory in prime time on \u201cMonday Night Football.\"",
      "When the Bears-Commanders game was flexed to national TV, it provided Daniels' signature moment so far when he scrambled for nearly 13 seconds and lofted up a pass that sailed 65 yards in the air before tipping up and into Brown's hands in the end zone.",
      "Edwards, who still texts Daniels on a regular basis, almost foreshadowed it talking about the 23-year-old two weeks before the Chicago game.",
      "\u201cHe has the ability to extend plays, and what he does \u2014 and people can already see it and it\u2019s not luck \u2014 he can throw the deep ball,\u201d said Edwards, who's now an ESPN analyst. \u201cHe can throw it with accuracy on the run or from the pocket. He has a feel for throwing the ball down the field.\u201d",
      "The Hail Mary exemplified what everyone around Daniels raves about: his poise under pressure. Edwards calls it Daniels' \u201cability to keep his composure when the lights got the brightest.\u201d",
      "Terry McLaurin, who has been Washington's top receiver since being drafted in 2019, said Daniels came into the league more ready than most rookies at the most important position in sports.",
      "That has been obvious even to opponents. Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson after outdueling Daniels said his counterpart has been proving himself and playing amazing.",
      "\u201cWashington is in good hands with him,\u201d Ravens linebacker Roquan Smith said \u201cHe\u2019s the truth.\"",
      "Only Jackson, Buffalo's Josh Allen, Mahomes and Detroit's Jared Goff have shorter MVP odds on BetMGM Sportsbook, which now has Daniels at 10-1. Nabers, who initially made a friendly $10,000 bet with Daniels about which one would be AP Offensive Rookie of the Year before canceling it, said his friend's success stems from a desire to win that he doesn't see in many others.",
      "\u201cI know when he is in that moment, he\u2019s not scared of it,\u201d Nabers said. \"He\u2019s not scared of the hype, the big plays to be made. If it is crunch time, he wants to ball.\u201d",

      "Whenever a team is trailing by seven points late in a game and driving, the talk quickly turns to whether it will go for 2 and the win if it happens to score a touchdown.",
      "Tampa Bay, New England and Seattle all opted against it in Week 9 and ended up as overtime losers.",
      "The situations weren't entirely identical, with the Seahawks scoring with 51 seconds left, the Patriots on the final play with an exhausted Drake Maye and the Buccaneers with 27 seconds left and Patrick Mahomes on the other side. But the decisions and the outcomes were the same.",
      "Were those necessarily bad decisions?",
      "The data says maybe not, with teams opting to kick the extra point in the final minute of regulation having a slightly higher winning percentage than teams that go for 2 historically.",
      "According to numbers tracked by Sportradar back to 2000, teams that attempted the extra point have a 37-49-2 (.432) record in those scenarios even after the three losses this week.",
      "That includes two defeats when the kicker missed the extra point, 10 more losses when the opposing team scored before the end of regulation and six wins when the team got the ball back and scored \u2014 with five of those following turnovers.",
      "Teams that tried for 2 had a 10-15 (.400) record, having made 12 of the 2-point tries. But two of those makes led to losses when the opposing team drove for a late field goal \u2014 including a game in 2019 when the Bears converted a fourth down after giving up the go-ahead 2-point try to Denver on the way to kicking a game-winning field goal.",
      "Complicating the decision this year is that teams are converting 2-point tries at a record-low rate. From 2010-23, making the 2-point try had been essentially a coin-flip proposition, with teams converting 48.7% of tries. That has dropped to 32.4% during the first half of this season.",
      "Kansas City's overtime victory against Tampa Bay delivered another tight win to a Chiefs team that just seems to have a knack for pulling out nail-biters.",
      "The Chiefs improved to 8-0, becoming the sixth Super Bowl champion to start the following season with eight straight wins \u2014 with six of those victories coming by seven points or fewer.",
      "The Chiefs are the 41st team overall to start a season 8-0 and their average margin of victory of 7.0 points per game is the lowest of any of those teams, beating out the 2006 Colts, who were at 7.4 points per game on the way to winning it all.",
      "Kansas City has won 14 straight since a Christmas loss to Las Vegas last year for the longest NFL winning streak since Carolina began the 2015 campaign with a 14-0 record. A win on Sunday against Denver would give the Chiefs the first 15-game streak since Green Bay won 19 in a row from 2010-11.",
      "Winning close games is nothing new for Mahomes, who has a 49-12 (.712) career record in the regular season and playoffs in games decided by seven points or fewer. Only Daryle Lamonica has a better win percentage (.771) among quarterbacks who have started in at least 30 close games.",
      "When it comes to \u201c perfect\u201d passer ratings, Lamar Jackson now stands alone.",
      "Jackson completed 16 of 19 passes for 280 yards, three TDs and no interceptions in Baltimore's win over Denver on Sunday to record his fourth career game with the highest attainable passer rating of 158.3.",
      "Jackson has the most career regular-season games with at least 15 attempts and a perfect rating, having also done it once last season and twice in his first full season as a starter in 2019.",
      "Four other QBs have done it three times: Peyton Manning, Kurt Warner, Tom Brady and Ben Roethlisberger. Manning also had a fourth in the playoffs, doing it in a 2003 wild-card win over Denver.",
      "Jackson has seven straight games this season with a rating of 100 or better, tied for the eighth-longest streak ever.",
      "Jared Goff and Amon-Ra St. Brown have an almost perfect connection this season.",
      "St. Brown has caught his last 30 targets from Goff after the two went 7 for 7 in Detroit's win over Green Bay. That is tied with Buffalo's Khalil Shakir for the longest streak of catches without an incompletion for a wide receiver since NextGen stats began tracking the stat in 2016.",
      "Zebra Sports calculated the probability that a player would have caught all of those targets based on the difficulty of each throw and said it had a probability of about 1 in 780,000.",
      "For the season, St. Brown has caught 48 of 59 passes from Goff, with the 133.3 passer rating on those throws ranking No. 1 among all duos with at least 40 attempts, according to Sportradar.",

      "A person with knowledge of the situation says Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey could miss at least two weeks with a right hamstring injury",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- The trio of 76ers\u2019 stars looked majestic on opening night as their images covered the arena\u2019s 4K kinetic scoreboard. Joel Embiid palmed a basketball. Tyrese Maxey in the middle appeared ready to burst off the screen for a dunk. Paul George looked fierce as he squeezed a basketball with both hands.",
      "Embiid. Maxey. George. They were the expected anchors of a Philadelphia team that counted on this season as the one to finally make a deep run in the playoffs, all three with massive contracts to match the lofty expectations.",
      "George bolted the Clippers to sign a four-year, $212 million free-agent contract. Maxey, a first-time All Star last season, reached a five-year, $204 million extension. Embiid, an NBA MVP and an Olympic gold medalist, agreed to a $193 million extension.",
      "What has all that lavish spending on three players with 17 combined All-Star nods got the Sixers two weeks into the season?",
      "Try a 1-6 record headed into Friday's game at the Lakers \u2014 tied with Milwaukee and Utah for worst in the NBA \u2014 and no games played together because of injuries and suspension by Embiid, Maxey and George.",
      "The 24-year-old Maxey is the latest Sixer sidelined by injury, and he could miss at least two weeks with a right hamstring injury, a person with knowledge of the situation said Thursday.",
      "The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team hasn\u2019t disclosed details of Maxey\u2019s injury publicly. The Sixers hope to know more after Maxey, who was injured a night earlier in a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, received additional medical evaluation on Thursday.",
      "\u201cNot very good luck,\u201d coach Nick Nurse said Thursday night. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to hang in there and still find a way to compete and play better.\u201d",
      "Maxey leads the Sixers with 27.6 points and led the NBA with 39.7 minutes played per game.",
      "Maxey's hamstring woes are the latest setback for a franchise that is already watching a playoff berth turn more into an outside shot rather than the guarantee it seemed at training camp in the Bahamas.",
      "George, who scored 18 points and was booed by Clippers fans in his return to Los Angeles, has played only two games this season because of a bone bruise on his left knee suffered in a preseason game.",
      "The 76ers have played all season without Embiid, both for what the team calls left knee management and because of a three-game suspension for shoving a member of the media.",
      "The 76ers have been under more NBA investigations (two) than they have wins (one) this season.",
      "The NBA fined the 76ers $100,000 last month for public statements, including by president of basketball operations Daryl Morey and Nurse, that were inconsistent with Embiid\u2019s health status and in violation of NBA rules, including the league\u2019s player participation policy.",
      "Embiid was suspended three games without pay after he shouted at and eventually shoved a newspaper columnist in a locker room altercation Saturday night.",
      "The 76ers have lost four straight games headed into Friday's game against the Lakers, then return home Sunday against Charlotte and have another home game Tuesday against New York. Embiid is set to make his season debut against the Knicks in the first game of NBA Cup play.",
      "\u201cWe've got to play better,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cWe're taking two (steps) forward and two back. We've got to develop some consistency and play a little better.\u201d",

      "Aston Villa started the week atop the 36-team table but its winning run ended after a bizarre penalty was awarded when defender Tyrone Mings picked up the ball in the area at Club Brugge, resulting in a 1-0 loss that sent the English club plummeting to eighth place.",

      "Shakhtar Donetsk playmaker Heorhiy Sudakov had a fine assist and an even better goal in a 2-1 win for the Ukrainian champion against Young Boys. Shakhtar\u2019s No. 10 showed why he is expected to be the club\u2019s next big-money sale.",
      "Liverpool, which on Tuesday routed Bayer Leverkusen 4-0, leads the standings at the midway point of the eight-round program.",

      "Two Italian teams \u2013 Inter Milan and Atalanta \u2013 have yet to concede a goal in four games. Another Italian side, Bologna, is the only team with no goals scored.",
      "Villa had led the standings in the new league-phase format after three straight wins without conceding a goal \u2014 and it took a bizarre incident before goalkeeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez was eventually beaten.",
      "Mings was punished for picking up the ball when Mart\u00ednez seemed to restart play with a goal kick passed forward to his teammate. Mings walked a couple steps to gather the ball with his left hand and returned to place it in the six-yard box.",
      "\"It\u2019s the biggest mistake I witnessed in my career,\u201d Villa coach Unai Emery said. \u201cIt has only happened one time in all my life. Today.\u201d",
      "Brugge captain Hans Vanaken placed the 52nd-minute spot-kick to Mart\u00ednez's left as the World Cup-winning Argentina goalkeeper dived to his right.",
      "It was the standout result of the inaugural week of the new Champions League in September: Bayern Munich 9, Dinamo Zagreb 2.",
      "It was the first time a team had scored nine times in a game in the 32-year Champions League era, and Dinamo fired its coach two days later.",
      "Since then? Bayern lost twice, including a 4-1 rout at Barcelona, and Dinamo won twice. At the end of play Wednesday, Bayern was 17th on six points, one place below Dinamo on seven. If those placings hold until January, they meet again twice more in the knockout playoffs round.",
      "The fifth round in three weeks' time has perhaps the stellar attraction of 144 games in the league phase: Liverpool vs. Real Madrid.",
      "That game on Nov. 27 is a rematch of the 2022 and 2018 finals, both won by Madrid, and the 1981 European Cup title match that Liverpool won.",
      "There is another final rematch: Bayern Munich hosts PSG on Nov. 26 in a repeat of the pandemic-season final played in August 2020 without fans in Lisbon. Also, sixth-place Barcelona hosts Brest, a fixture which might have been overlooked when the draw was made in August yet the French team is currently fourth.",

      "Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are poised to add another entry into their rapidly developing rivalry when the ATP Finals open Sunday without any members of the Big Three for the first time in nearly a quarter century",
      "TURIN, Italy -- TURIN, Italy (AP) \u2014 Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are poised to add another entry into their rapidly developing rivalry when the ATP Finals open on Sunday without any of the Big Three for the first time in 23 years.",
      "The top-ranked Sinner and No. 3 Alcaraz evenly split the year\u2019s Grand Slam titles between them with two apiece and it would be fitting if the pair meet again in Turin.",
      "Sinner and Alcaraz were placed in different groups in Thursday's draw.",
      "The Ilie Nastase Group features Sinner, Daniil Medvedev, Taylor Fritz and Alex de Minaur.",
      "The John Newcombe Group features Alexander Zverev, Alcaraz, Casper Ruud and Andrey Rublev.",
      "After the round-robin stage, the top two finishers in each group advance to the semifinals.",
      "Sinner withdrew from last week\u2019s Paris Masters due to a virus and showed up early in Turin for training.",
      "\u201cThis is for me the main event of the end of the year,\u201d Sinner said.",
      "The big name missing is that of defending champion Novak Djokovic, who withdrew on Tuesday due to an unspecified injury.",
      "Not since 2001 has the finals been held without at least one of Djokovic, Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal. This season also was the first since 2002 without at least one Grand Slam title for a member of that trio.",
      "Djokovic has won the ATP Finals a record seven times. He beat Sinner in the final last year.",
      "Federer, who retired in 2022, won the event six times after making his debut in 2002; Nadal, who is retiring after playing in the Davis Cup the week after finals, was the runner-up twice at the finals but never won it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s strange to not see Novak here, just because of all the success he had,\u201d Zverev said. \u201cThe first time I won in 2018, you had to beat both or at least two of the three players. I beat Federer in the semis and then I beat Djokovic in the finals. You had to beat those guys to have a chance at the title. So it does feel different.",
      "\"But I feel like now with Jannik and Carlos it kind of moved toward the same way, just with new guys. You have to go through them to win big tournaments. It\u2019s as simple as that. They both won two Grand Slams this year and they\u2019re the two best players in the world for sure. You have to beat them to win a Slam and I think it\u2019s going to be the same here as well,\u201d Zverev added.",
      "As an Italian, Sinner will be the main focus of attention in Turin.",
      "It\u2019s the first time Sinner is playing at home since it was announced before his U.S. Open title that he tested positive in two separate drug tests this year.",
      "A decision to clear Sinner of wrongdoing was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency in September and the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is expected to make a final ruling on the case early next year.",
      "Asked by The Associated Press if a date had been set for a hearing at CAS or if there has been any update on the case, Sinner responded: \"No, we don\u2019t know nothing yet. Look, I\u2019ve been in this position three times now already, so it\u2019s not that great a place to be. But it always came out very positively so I\u2019m very positive.\u201d",
      "Sinner opened this year by winning the Australian Open to become the first Italian man to win a Grand Slam singles title in nearly a half-century \u2014 since Adriano Panatta raised the French Open trophy in 1976.",
      "Alcaraz then claimed the French Open and Wimbledon titles to raise his career total to four Grand Slams.",
      "Sinner responded by winning the U.S. Open.",
      "Alcaraz won all three official meetings with Sinner this year and holds a 6-4 advantage in their career head-to-head rivalry. Last month, Sinner beat Alcaraz in the Six Kings Slam exhibition in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The only two players in the field to have won the finals are Zverev and Medvedev.",
      "Zverev won in London in 2018 and in Turin in 2021; Medvedev triumphed in 2020, the final year the event was held in London.",
      "Zverev enters in solid form coming off a title at the Paris Masters and leapfrogged Alcaraz into No. 2 in the rankings this week.",

      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved for centuries",
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\u201cWe were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\u201d said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \u201cIt opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\u201d",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \u201cthe house of the golden bracelet,\u201d the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \u201cthe story that was long spun around these individuals\u201d was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\u201cThey have a better overview of what\u2019s happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \u201cWe actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\u201d",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would institute an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing harm to our kids and I\u2019m calling time on it,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced in Parliament during its final two weeks in session this year, which begin on Nov. 18. The age limit would take effect 12 months after the law is passed, Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The proposal comes as governments around the world are wrestling with how to supervise young people's use of technologies like smartphones and social media.",
      "Social media platforms would be penalized for breaching the age limit, but under-age children and their parents would not.",
      "\u201cThe onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. The onus won\u2019t be on parents or young people,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "Antigone Davis, head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the company would respect any age limitations the government wants to introduce.",
      "\u201cHowever, what\u2019s missing is a deeper discussion on how we implement protections, otherwise we risk making ourselves feel better, like we have taken action, but teens and parents will not find themselves in a better place,\u201d Davis said in a statement.",
      "She added that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. TikTok declined to comment.",
      "The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, described the age limit as a \u201c20th Century response to 21st Century challenges.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement.",
      "More than 140 Australian and international academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Jackie Hallan, a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut, opposed the ban. She said 73% of young people across Australia accessing mental health support did so through social media.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\u201d Hallan said.",
      "Child psychologist Philip Tam said a minimum age of 12 or 13 would have been more enforceable.",
      "\u201cMy real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground,\u201d Tam said.",
      "Australian National University lawyer Associate Prof. Faith Gordon feared separating children from there platforms could create pressures within families.",
      "Albanese said there would be exclusions and exemptions in circumstances such as a need to continue access to educational services.",
      "But parental consent would not entitle a child under 16 to access social media.",
      "Earlier this year, the government began a trial of age-restriciton technologies. Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, the online watchdog that will police compliance, will use the results of that trial to provide platforms with guidance on what reasonable steps they can take.",

      "\u201cThere does need to be enhanced penalties to ensure compliance,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "\u201cEvery company that operates in Australia, whether domiciled here or otherwise, is expected and must comply with Australian law or face the consequences,\u201d she added.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support for an age limit at 16.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Paul Fletcher said the platforms already had the technology to enforce such an age ban.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really a technical viability question, it\u2019s a question of their readiness to do it and will they incur the cost to do it,\u201d Fletcher told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThe platforms say: \u2019It's all too hard, we can\u2019t do it, Australia will become a backwater, it won\u2019t possibly work.' But if you have well-drafted legislation and you stick to your guns, you can get the outcomes,\u201d Fletcher added."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan\u2019s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour.",
      "As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan.",
      "Perhaps the biggest consequence for China \u2014 if Trump stays true to his campaign promises \u2014 is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "Tariffs like that would be a blow to China\u2019s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China\u2019s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS.",
      "During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised.",
      "President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles.",
      "Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade.",
      "\u201cGiven the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.\u201d",
      "Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump\u2019s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he\u2019ll be able to do quickly, without saying how.",
      "Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.",
      "\u201cChina is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,\" Wang wrote in a recent commentary. \"These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.\u201d",
      "There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs \u2014 150% to 200% \u2014 on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.",
      "Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979.",
      "Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing.",
      "China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cWill (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,\u201d he said.",
      "As for China\u2019s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m (expletive) crazy.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. weapons this year.",
      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said.",
      "Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe are clear about the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence.",
      "But Trump has criticized Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.",
      "The island\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.",
      "Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago.",
      "\u201cRather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan\u2019s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,\u201d Goto said."

      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday morning.",
      "The Rhesus macaque primates escaped from the Alpha Genesis facility Wednesday when a new employee didn't fully shut an enclosure, Alexander said.",
      "The monkeys are females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms) and are so young and small that they haven't been used for testing, police said.",
      "Alpha Genesis employees \u201ccurrently have eyes on the primates and are working to entice them with food,\u201d police said in a statement issued around noon Thursday.",
      "The company usually handles escapes on site, but the monkeys got outside the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee, Alexander said.",
      "\u201cThe handlers know them well and usually can get them back with fruit or a little treat,\u201d Alexander told The Associated Press by phone.",
      "But rounding up these escapees is taking some more work. Alpha Genesis is taking the lead, setting up traps and using thermal imaging cameras to recapture the monkeys on the run, the chief said.",
      "\u201cThere is almost no danger to the public,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "People living nearby need to shut their windows and doors so the monkeys can't find a place to hide inside and if they see the primates, call 911 so company officials and police can capture them.",
      "Alpha Genesis provides primates for research worldwide at its compound about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia, according to its website. The company did not respond to an email asking about Wednesday's escape.",
      "In 2018, federal officials fined Alpha Genesis $12,600 after dozens of primates escaped as well as for an incident that left a few others without water and other problems with how the monkeys were housed.",
      "Officials said 26 primates escaped from the Yemassee facility in 2014 and an additional 19 got out in 2016.",
      "The group Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture asking the agency to immediately send an inspector to the Alpha Genesis facility, conduct a thorough investigation and treat them as a repeated violator. The group was involved in the 2018 fine against the company.",
      "\u201cThe clear carelessness which allowed these 40 monkeys to escape endangered not only the safety of the animals, but also put the residents of South Carolina at risk,\u201d Michael Budkie, the executive director of the group, wrote in the Thursday morning letter."

      "\u201cTesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, in a note to investors. \u201cThis dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players.\u201d",

      "TOKYO -- A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",
      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "The first sample alone is not enough and additional small-scale sampling missions will be necessary in order to obtain more data, TEPCO spokesperson Kenichi Takahara told reporters Thursday. \u201cIt may take time, but we will steadily tackle decommissioning,\u201d Takahara said.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the. plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",
      "That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",
      "The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel.",
      "Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them.",
      "The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said there have been some delays but \u201cthere will be no impact on the entire decommissioning process.\u201d",
      "No specific plans for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal have been decided."

      "The Canadian government is ordering the dissolution of TikTok\u2019s Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind the social media app but said it won\u2019t block access",
      "TORONTO -- Canada announced Wednesday it won\u2019t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it.",
      "Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc.",
      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",
      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement that the shutdown of its Canadian offices will mean the loss of hundreds of local jobs.",
      "\u201cWe will challenge this order in court,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.\u201d",
      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",
      "TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.",
      "Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver.",
      "Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that \"banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.\u201d",
      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",
      "Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China\u2019s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.",
      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell.",

      "It\u2019s no surprise that students are pushing back on cellphone bans in classrooms",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- It\u2019s no surprise that students are pushing back on cellphone bans in classrooms. But school administrators in one South Florida county working to pull students\u2019 eyes away from their screens are facing some resistance from another group as well \u2013 parents.",
      "Since the beginning of the 2024 school year in August, students in Broward County Public Schools, the country\u2019s sixth largest district, have been barred from using cellphones during the school day, including during lunch and breaks, unless given special permission.",
      "The schools are some of the many across the country wrestling with how to crack down on cellphones, at a time when experts say social media use among young people is nearly universal \u2013 and that screen time is linked to higher rates of anxiety and depression among kids.",
      "But a survey sent out by the South Florida school district earlier this fall found that of the more than 70,000 students, teachers and parents surveyed, nearly one in five parents believe the cellphone ban is having a negative impact on their student\u2019s wellbeing.",
      "Among the top concerns for the students and parents surveyed is not being able to communicate with their family members, especially in an emergency \u2014 an anxiety that cuts deep in the district that\u2019s home to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a 2018 shooting killed 17 people.",
      "District officials have said students can use their phones during an emergency and that teachers have the flexibility to grant kids access for other reasons too.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us thinks kids should be on their phones during class,\u201d said Erin Gohl, a parent and advocate in the district.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really talking about giving kids tools during those times when they need it,\u201d she added, including letting students use their phones for \u201cpositive mental health purposes\u201d.",
      "Officials in the Fort Lauderdale-area district have acknowledged that implementation of the policy has been inconsistent. Some teachers have struggled to monitor students\u2019 phone use, and are facing the reality that for some kids, phones can be a needed tool to access online lessons and turn in assignments, especially for those who don\u2019t have a school-issued laptop. And parents have argued their students are better off with their phones, helping them coordinate afternoon pickup times or text their parents for advice about a school bully.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t expect students to say \u2014 or parents of high schoolers to say \u2014 right, that, they don\u2019t want their kids to have cellphones,\u201d said Howard Hepburn, Broward superintendent of schools. \u201cThe expectation that we\u2019re going to just have a hard stop is not reality. It takes time.\u201d",
      "Landyn Spellberg, a student advisor to the Broward school board, said there are a lot of benefits to phones \u2014 and that the district's blanket ban isn't helping students with something many adults still struggle with: learning how to use technology in a healthy way.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s important that we teach students about the negatives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t inform students of those things.\u201d",

      "A small facility in Cyprus is hosting senior government officials from as far as Algeria, Iraq and Georgia for training by top U.S. experts to prevent the kinds of materials used to build weapons of mass destruction from crossing their borders",
      "LARNACA, Cyprus -- From as far as Algeria, Iraq and Georgia, an assortment of senior government officials converge on this small facility for training by top U.S. experts to prevent the kinds of materials used to build weapons of mass destruction from crossing their borders.",
      "In just its third year of operation, the U.S.-funded Cyprus Centre for Land, Open Seas and Port Security (CYCLOPS) has far exceeded expectations. From the dozen courses that officials were initially hoping to hold annually, demand has skyrocketed, with scheduled training sessions for next year expected to surpass 50, says the center\u2019s director Chrysilios Chrysiliou.",
      "So far, over 2,000 officials from 20 countries including Yemen, Libya, Armenia and Ukraine, have received training on radiological and nuclear detection for customs officers, methods of smuggling weapons of mass destruction, and chemical terrorism investigations among a host of other topics.",
      "On Monday, a group of Cypriot and Egyptian officials started a two-day seminar on maritime cybersecurity led by the U.S.-based Sandia National Laboratories.",
      "\u201cThis uniqueness has actually brought ... a lot of success which could not had been foreseen when Cyclops was initially being created,\u201d Chrysiliou told the Associated Press.",
      "According to Chrysiliou, key to the center\u2019s success has been the top-notch level of instruction participants receive from U.S.-based experts, including from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, that specialize in counter-proliferation programs.",
      "The center also boasts an array of the latest in cutting-edge detectors able to sniff out radiological, chemical and biological agents and explosives that countries in the wider region don\u2019t possess or have access to.",
      "\u201cHere, the participants have the opportunity to see the latest technology in in detecting all of the range of the threats,\u201d said Chrysiliou. \u201cIt\u2019s like a showcase of what exists out in the market.\u201d",
      "For instance, trainees are taught on how to detect and properly dispose of the radiological elements of discarded medical equipment that militants could use to fashion a weapon. Another emerging threat is the possible use of off-the-shelf drones to disperse chemical or biological agents over populated centers.",
      "CYCLOPS has been the product of ever-closer Cypriot-U.S. defense and security ties, earning plaudits from U.S. officials all the way up to the White House. During Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides\u2019 meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden last week, the center figured prominently as an example of enhanced bilateral security cooperation.",
      "The center was built on a $7 million U.S. government grant, $2 million of which was for the purchase of border security equipment. The island nation's proximity to the Middle East was seen as an asset to helping train officials from the region, whose options for such training would otherwise be very limited. The Cypriot government has secured another $5.6 million in European Union funding to expand the center and purchase additional high-tech equipment.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s such a huge interest by different agencies of the U.S. and the U.N. too, because they have seen the value of utilizing CYCLOPS because of its proximity to their neighboring countries,\u201d Chrysiliou said.",
      "Another selling point for the center is that it\u2019s situated a stone\u2019s throw away from Cyprus\u2019 main international airport of Larnaca and is close to top-flight accommodations that this tourism-reliant country is known for.",
      "The center's managers want to procure an expansive virtual reality system enabling officials to safely train on biological, chemical and radiological agents. Chrysiliou liaises daily with Kevin Keeler from the U.S. State Department\u2019s Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program, who called the VR system a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d",
      "Although the center does have small quantities of radiological and other dangerous substances for training, a virtual simulator would greatly enhance the center\u2019s training capacity.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already put the word out about this new virtual simulator and we have agencies like, okay, how can we get on the schedule next year when it\u2019s not even been built yet? Yes, because it\u2019s a big factor in today\u2019s world,\u201d said Keeler.",
      "It\u2019s still early days for the center to count on headline-grabbing cases where WMD materials have been seized at any given border. Chrysiliou said what\u2019s equally important in acting as a potent deterrent is to send out the message that trained professionals \u201chave the means and the ways to check and stop you.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if we teach Iraqis or Yemenis or Libyans or from other countries to do a better job in controlling their borders, in controlling the dispersion of weapons of mass destruction ... it makes their citizens much safer and more secure,\u201d said Chrysiliou."

      "It was the latest in a series of penalties against Meta by South Korean authorities in recent years as they increase their scrutiny of how the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, handles private information.",
      "Following a four-year investigation, South Korea\u2019s Personal Information Protection Commission concluded that Meta unlawfully collected sensitive information about around 980,000 Facebook users, including their religion, political views and whether they were in same-sex unions, from July 2018 to March 2022.",
      "It said the company shared the data with around 4,000 advertisers.",

      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too.",
      "Returnless refunds are a tool that more retailers are using to keep online shoppers happy and to reduce shipping fees, processing time and other ballooning costs from returned products.",
      "Companies such as Amazon, Walmart and Target have decided some items are not worth the cost or hassle of getting back. Think a $20 T-shirt that might cost $30 in shipping and handling to recover. There are also single-use items, such as a package of plastic straws, that might be difficult to resell or medicines that could be unsafe to market again.",
      "Analysts say the companies offering returnless refunds do it somewhat sporadically, typically reserving the option for low-cost objects or ones with limited resale value. But some online shoppers said they've also been allowed to keep more pricey products.",
      "Dalya Harel, 48, received a return-free refund recently after ordering a desk from Amazon that cost roughly $300. When the desk arrived, she noticed it was missing some key pieces and would be impossible to put together, Harel said. She couldn't request a replacement and have it within a reasonable time for the office of her New York lice detection removal service because the item was out of stock.",
      "Harel, who routinely buys towels and other products from Amazon for her business, said her team reached out to the company's customer service line. She was pleasantly surprised to hear she would get a refund without having to send back the desk.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one less headache to deal with,\u201d Harel said. \u201cIt was really nice for us to not have to make an extra trip up to the post office.\u201d",
      "She used the desk pieces to create makeshift shelves in her office in Brooklyn.",
      "While the retail practice of letting customers keep merchandise and get their money back is not exactly a trade secret, the way it works is shrouded in mystery. Companies are not keen to publicize the circumstances in which they issue returnless refunds due to concerns over the potential for return fraud.",
      "Even if brands don't provide details about such policies on their websites, returnless refunds are expanding in at least some retail corners.",
      "Amazon, which industry experts say has engaged in the practice for years, announced in August that it would extend the option to the third-party sellers who drive most of the sales on the e-commerce giant's platform. Under the program, sellers who use the company\u2019s fulfillment services in the U.S. could choose to offer customers a traditional refund for purchases under $75 along with no obligation to return what they ordered.",
      "Amazon did not immediately respond to questions about how the program works. But publicly, it has pitched returnless refunds more directly to international sellers and those who offer cheaper goods. Items sold in an upcoming section of Amazon's website, which will allow U.S. shoppers to buy low-cost goods shipped directly from China, will also be eligible for returnless refunds, according to documents seen by The Associated Press.",
      "In January, Walmart gave a similar option to merchants who sell products on its growing online marketplace, leaving it up to sellers to set price limits and determine if or how they want to participate.",
      "China-founded e-commerce companies Shein and Temu say they also offer returnless refunds on a small number of orders, as does Target, the online shopping site Overstock and pet products e-tailer Chewy, which some customer said had encouraged them to donate unwanted items to local animal shelters.",
      "Wayfair, another online retailer cited by some customers as offering returnless refunds, did not reply to a request for comment on its policies.",
      "Overall, retailers and brands tend to be careful about how often they let customers keep items for free. Many of them are deploying algorithms to determine who should be given the option and who should not.",
      "To make the decision, the algorithms assess multiple factors, including the extent to which a shopper should be trusted based on prior purchasing \u2013 and returning \u2013 patterns, shipping costs and the demand for the product in the customer\u2019s hands, according to Sender Shamiss, CEO of goTRG, a reverse logistics company that works with retailers like Walmart.",
      "Optoro, a company that helps streamline returns for Best Buy, Staples and Gap Inc., has observed retailers assessing the lifetime value of a customer and extending returnless refunds as a type of unofficial, discreet loyalty benefit, according to CEO Amena Ali.",
      "The king of online retail appeared to verify the process works that way.",
      "In a statement, Amazon said it offers returnless refunds on a \u201cvery small number\u201d of items as a \u201cconvenience to customers.\u201d",
      "The company also said it's hearing positive feedback from sellers about its new program that authorized them to tell customers they could keep some products and still be reimbursed. Amazon said it was monitoring for signs of fraud and setting eligibility criteria for sellers and customers. It didn't provide additional details on what that encompassed.",
      "Some retailers also are stiffening the liberal return policies they long employed to encourage online orders. Shoppers who enjoyed making purchases on their computers or cellphones became accustomed to loading up their digital shopping baskets with the intent of returning items they ended up not liking.",
      "Shopping online also grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homebound consumers reduced their trips to stores and relied on sites like Amazon for everyday items. Retail companies have talked in recent years about returns becoming more expensive to process due to the growing volume, rising inflation and labor costs.",
      "Last year, U.S. consumers returned $743 billion worth of merchandise, or 14.5% of the products they purchased - up from 10.6% in 2020, according to the National Retail Federation. In 2019, returned merchandise was valued at $309 billion, according to loss prevention company Appriss Retail.",
      "Last year, roughly 14% of returns were fraudulent, costing retailers $101 billion in losses, according to a joint report from the National Retail federation and Appriss Retail. The problem spans from low-level forms of fraud - such as shoppers returning already worn clothing - to more complicated schemes by fraudsters who return shoplifted merchandise or items purchased on stolen credit cards.",
      "To deter excessive returns, some retailers, including H&M, Zara and J. Crew, started charging customers return fees in the past year. Others have shortened their return windows. Some shopping sites, such as the Canadian retailer Ssense, have threatened to kick frequent returners off their platforms if they suspect abuse of their policies.",
      "However, retailers don't all view frequent returners in the same way. Such customers could be seen as \u201cgood returners\u201d if they purchase \u2013 and keep \u2013 many more items than they send back, Ali said.",
      "\u201cOftentimes, your most profitable customers tend to be high returners,\u201d she said."

      "MAUMERE, Indonesia -- Indonesia\u2019s National Disaster Management Agency said Monday that at least 10 people have died as a series of volcanic eruptions widens on the remote island of Flores.",
      "The eruption at Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki around midnight spewed thick brownish ash as high as 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) into the air and hot ashes hit several villages, burning down houses including a convent of Catholic nuns, said Firman Yosef, an official at the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post.",
      "He said volcanic material was thrown up to 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from its crater, blanketing nearby villages and towns with tons of volcanic debris and forcing residents to flee.",
      "Rescuers were still searching for more bodies buried under collapsed houses, said Abdul Muhari, the National Disaster Management Agency\u2019s spokesperson. Muhari said all the bodies, including a child, were found with a 4-kilometer (2.4 mile) radius of the crater.",
      "He said at least 10,000 people have been affected by the eruption in six villages of Wulanggitang District, and four villages in Ile Bura district. Some have fled to relatives\u2019 houses while the local government is readying schools to use as temporary shelters.",
      "The country\u2019s volcano monitoring agency increased the volcano\u2019s alert status to the highest level and more than doubled the exclusion zone to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius after midnight on Monday as eruptions became more frequent.",

No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed since then due to seismic activity.",
      "In a video conference on Monday, Muhammad Wafid, the head of Geology Agency at the Energy and Mineral Resources ministry said there was a different character between January\u2019s eruption and Monday\u2019s eruption due to a blockage of magma in the crater, which reduced detectible seismic activity while building up pressure.",

      "NEW YORK -- Online video production company MrBeast said Friday it has fired somewhere between 5 to 10 employees following an investigation into the YouTube empire's workplace culture.",
      "A company spokesman declined to put a precise number on the firings, say which employees were let go or for what reasons. But the shakeup comes as Jimmy Donaldson, who draws millions of views under the MrBeast alias with highly produced stunts and giveaways, deals with accusations of impropriety against himself, his collaborators and others within his multimillion-dollar production company that have threatened his family-friendly image.",
      "Investigators only identified \u201cseveral isolated instances of workplace harassment and misconduct,\" according to a two-page letter sent Friday by Alex Spiro, a trial lawyer who led the investigation by white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and whose clients have included Jay-Z and Elon Musk.",
      "The nearly three-month probe concluded that there was no basis behind allegations that MrBeast team members committed sexual misconduct or \u201cknowingly\u201d employed people with \u201cproclivities or histories towards illegal or questionable legal conduct.\"",
      "Spiro said the team interviewed 39 current and former employees. Millions of documents from phones, emails, and messaging platforms including Discord and Slack were also reviewed, according to the letter.",
      "The controversies surrounding the so-called King of YouTube began snowballing this summer. Ava Tyson, a Donaldson friend and fellow creator accused of sharing inappropriate sexual messages with minors over multiple years, left the channel in July. Also circulated online by YouTuber Rosanna Pansino was a 2017 recording of Donaldson making racist comments and using homophobic slurs.",
      "A preliminary July shoot for his ambitious \u201cBeast Games\u201d Amazon Prime Video show was quickly hit with safety complaints from some contestants who said they faced \u201climited sustenance\u201d and \u201cinsufficient medical staffing\u201d while competing for a $5 million grand prize.",
      "MrBeast in turn has hired new executives, including a head of personnel and a general counsel, according to Spiro, and additional employees are getting \u201ctargeted training and executive coaching\u201d for undisclosed violations of company policy.",
      "The company \u201chas grown exceedingly quickly from a YouTube start-up comprised of a group of talented young individuals to a much larger entity,\u201d Spiro wrote to MrBeast's Board of Directors. \u201cIt is not uncommon that policies and practices essential in a mature company would lag behind commercial success.\u201d",
      "Donaldson has largely remained silent on the matters. He recently launched a prepacked lunch brand alongside internet personalities Logan Paul and KSI \u2014 marking his latest entrance into the food market after his chocolate bar and burger chain were met with mixed reviews. His 325 million YouTube subscribers have continued to see their feeds filled with outlandish, high-energy videos like the recently titled \u201c100 Identical Twins Fight For $250,000.\u201d",
      "In a Friday post on X sharing Spiro's letter, Donaldson wrote that he \u201cwas asked to refrain from making public statements to enable a detailed and unbiased investigation.\u201d",
      "Pansino, one of Donaldson\u2019s most vocal critics, responded on X that the findings of \u201cworkplace harassment and misconduct\u201d and \u201cmultiple firings\u201d mean \"it might be time for a bigger investigation.\u201d",
      "Donaldson's level of fame and growth place him in \u201cpretty rare company,\u201d said advertising lawyer Robert Freund, whose practice helps creators resolve disputes. He said he suspects the letter was released in attempt to assure stakeholders \u201cthat he's running a professional operation.\u201d",

      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",

      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d",

      "The amount of funding for the project is not yet set. But it's seen as one key way to help the country cope with soaring deliveries.",
      "A computer graphics video made by the government shows big, wheeled boxes moving along a three-lane corridor, also called an \u201cauto flow road,\u201d in the middle of a big highway. A trial system is due to start test runs in 2027 or early 2028, aiming for full operations by the mid-2030s.",
      "\u201cWe need to be innovative with the way we approach roads,\u201d said Yuri Endo, a senior deputy director overseeing the effort at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.",
      "Apart from making up for a shrinking labor force and the need to reduce workloads for drivers, the system also will help cut carbon emissions, she said.",
      "\u201cThe key concept of the auto flow-road is to create dedicated spaces within the road network for logistics, utilizing a 24-hour automated and unmanned transportation system,\u201d Endo said.",
      "The plan may sound like a solution that would only work in relatively low-crime, densely populated societies like Japan, not sprawling nations like the U.S. But similar ideas are being considered in Switzerland and Great Britain. The plan in Switzerland involves an underground pathway, while the one being planned in London will be a fully automated system running on low-cost linear motors.",

      "Japan's shortage of truck drivers is worsening due to laws that took effect earlier this year that limit the amount of overtime drivers can log. That's seen as necessary to avoid overwork and accidents and to make the jobs tolerable, but in Japanese logistics, government and transportation circles, it\u2019s known as the \u201c2024 problem.\u201d",

      "That's a fraction of what's moving in a massive country like the U.S. About 5.2 trillion ton-miles of freight are transported in the United States each year, and that's projected to reach more than 8 trillion ton-miles of freight by 2050. A ton-mile measures the amount of freight shipped and how far it\u2019s moved, with the standard unit being one ton being moved one mile.",

    "story": [
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to clarify remarks he made at a New York campaign rally where he suggested that Republicans may try to repeal legislation that has spurred U.S. production of semiconductor chips",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that Republicans \u201cprobably will\u201d try to repeal legislation that spurred U.S. production of semiconductor chips, a statement he quickly tried to walk back by saying he would like to instead \u201cstreamline\u201d it.",
      "Johnson made the initial comment while campaigning for a vulnerable New York GOP congressman in a district that is anticipating a large new Micron semiconductor manufacturing plant.",
      "A reporter asked Johnson whether he would try to repeal the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had disparaged last week. \u201cI expect that we probably will, but we haven\u2019t developed that part of the agenda yet,\" Johnson replied.",
      "Democrats quickly jumped on the Republican speaker\u2019s comments, warning that it showed how Johnson and Trump are pursuing an aggressive conservative agenda bent on dismantling even popular government programs. The White House has credited the CHIPS Act for spurring hundreds of billions of dollars of investments as well as hundreds of thousands of jobs. Vice President Kamala Harris has pointed to the legislation on the campaign trail as proof that Democrats can be entrusted with the U.S. economy.",
      "Johnson, who voted against the legislation, later said in a statement that the CHIPS Act, which poured $54 billion into the semiconductor manufacturing industry, \u201cis not on the agenda for repeal.\"",
      "\u201cTo the contrary, there could be legislation to further streamline and improve the primary purpose of the bill\u2014to eliminate its costly regulations and Green New Deal requirements,\u201d the speaker's statement said.",
      "It wasn't the first recent comment Johnson has had to walk back. Earlier this week he had to clean up comments he made saying he wanted to \u201ctake a blow torch to the regulatory state\u201d and make \u201cmassive\u201d changes to the Affordable Care Act. After facing political blowback, he said that repealing the health care law was \u201cnot on the table.\u201d",
      "The incident was emblematic of Johnson's struggle working closely with Trump and at the same time campaigning for his House colleagues, especially those locked in tough reelection battles that are crucial to Republicans holding a narrow majority. The speaker was campaigning for Rep. Brandon Williams, a New York Republican who worked in the tech industry before running for Congress and supported the CHIPS Act.",
      "Williams said in a statement that he spoke privately with Johnson after he suggested that the act could be repealed.",
      "\u201cHe apologized profusely, saying he misheard the question,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Williams' district is anticipating a large new Micron semiconductor manufacturing plant. The company has said it received grants of $6.1 billion from the CHIPS Act to support its plans.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement Friday, \u201cAnyone threatening to repeal the CHIPS & Science Act is threatening more than 50,000 good-paying jobs in Upstate New York and $231 billion worth of economic growth nationwide.\u201d",
      "Democrats are hoping that the comments give them a late boost as they try to court working class voters in regions that depend on factory jobs. Harris, during a campaign stop in Saginaw, Michigan earlier this week, toured another semiconductor factory to bring attention to the 2022 law.",
      "In response to Johnson's comments Friday, a spokesperson for Harris' campaign, Ammar Moussa, said, \"Harris is running to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and make us competitive globally. The only way to guarantee these Republicans never get a chance to repeal these laws that are creating jobs and saving Americans money is to elect her president.\u201d",
      "As of August, the CHIPS and Science Act had provided $30 billion in support for 23 projects in 15 states that would add 115,000 manufacturing and construction jobs, according to the Commerce Department. That funding helped to draw in private capital and would enable the United States to produce 30% of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips, up from 0% when the Biden-Harris administration succeeded Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "Viet Shelton, spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said, \u201cMost politicians usually go to a community promising to create jobs in the town they\u2019re visiting\u2026 Mike Johnson, ever the trendsetter, decided to visit a town and promise to kill jobs in that town.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 23:41:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Democrats hoped that voters wanted to move on from Donald Trump. Instead, they wanted more of him.",
    "story": [
      "\"Clearly, voters thought the country was on the wrong track,\" one Democrat said.",
      "In the end, most voters did want to go back.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats pounded away at a message of turning the page on former President Donald Trump and his brand of politics, promoting former aides who questioned his commitment to democracy and producing their own plans to combat things like price gouging and high home costs.",
      "Wednesday morning, though, they were reckoning with a stunning sweep by Trump, who as the now-president-elect, appeared set for a swing-state sweep and left Democrats wondering how it all went so wrong.",
      "\"Complete, unmitigated disaster,\" Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis said when asked about the results. \"That was a wholesale repudiation of the Democratic message, the Democratic strategy, Harris' candidacy. There is no way to sugarcoat what an abject disaster this was.\"",
      "Trump's victory was thorough. He was projected to win or on pace to take all seven swing states up for grabs, while cutting down his margins in blue states from Minnesota to Virginia to New York. He lost women by 10 points after losing them by 15 in 2020, even after fury erupted over the scrapping of constitutional abortion protections. And he cut Harris' margin among Latino voters to 8 points after losing them by 33 points four years ago.",
      "Democrats, still licking their wounds as they spoke to ABC News Wednesday, had a laundry list of prescriptions for the party's woes, both strategically in how the 2024 race was waged and more fundamentally in how the party is perceived coast to coast and the state of its coalition.",
      "Harris took over in a particularly hectic series of events, taking over as Democrats' nominee from Joe Biden after the president's ruinous June debate poured jet fuel on concerns over his age and fitness for office.",
      "Many expressed dismay and frustration, distressed that Harris' historic candidacy and the party brand overall held insufficient appeal to win over voters who instead backed a twice-impeached former president convicted of 34 felonies whose closing message was so unfocused that it included riffing on a famous golfer's genitalia.",
      "Logistically, most pointed out the compressed timeline. In a country where elections have begun to run nearly two years long, Harris had about 100 days, leading some to point the finger at Biden for staying in the race as long as he did over the summer -- or even running for reelection at all.",
      "\"He never should've\" run for reelection, said Jim Kessler, the founder of the center-left think tank Third Way. \"Democrats and the Biden White House did not do a good enough job listening to the people, and they were saying loud and clear, 'your age is a concern.' And they chose to ignore that. They were also saying, the border's a concern, and so is crime. And they got to the right place on all of those things, including Biden's age. But it took them too long.\"",
      "Harris and Biden for weeks before the election touted policies they said would help Americans deal with rising costs and hammered Trump for essentially killing a bipartisan bill that would've strengthened border enforcement.",
      "But for months before that, the White House had insisted that the economy was strong, noting low unemployment numbers and the stock market while batting down worries over things like grocery costs, and was frustrated over the inability to stem the rise in unauthorized border crossings before leaning on executive orders that echoed those Trump himself had enacted.",
      "Trump and his allies went to work to paint Harris as out of touch on even more issues, blanketing the airwaves with ads highlighting Harris' policies from her 2019 run, including one underscoring her support for surgeries for transgender inmates, with a narrator saying that she was \"for they/them\" while Trump is \"for you.\"",
      "All the while, Harris, a loyal No. 2, appeared uncomfortable distancing herself from her boss.",
      "Later in the race, she insisted that her administration would not be a \"continuation\" of Biden's and that she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet, which Biden hadn't done. But a viral clip on ABC's \"The View\" in which she said she couldn't think of anything substantively she'd do differently helped cement the existing link she had to a president whose approval rating was historically low enough to sink his party in a presidential race.",
      "\"Clearly, voters thought the country was on the wrong track, and she became the status quo candidate,\" said veteran Democratic strategist James Carville. \"And the history of status quo candidates\u2026is not good.\"",
      "Some Democrats boiled it down to a phrase that Carville himself made famous: it's the economy, stupid.",
      "A Gallup poll conducted in September 2020 -- the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic -- found that Americans said they were better off than they were four years ago by a 22-point margin. The same poll conducted last September fond that Americans believed they were worse off than they were four years ago by a 13-point margin -- a 35-point swing.",
      "\"It's the inflation, stupid, right?\" said one source familiar with the Harris campaign's thinking. \"At the end of the day, the biggest driver of people's voting behavior is their economic self-interest, and they felt, by a wide margin, that they were doing pretty well under Donald Trump and that they were not doing well under the current administration. Not to say that other stuff wasn't important, but it was all superseded by their own economic conditions.\"",
      "Beyond her association with Biden, Harris also leaned into one of his favorite arguments against Trump -- that he posed a threat to democracy.",
      "She had shunted the theme early in her campaign, instead working to introduce herself in an atmosphere of \"joy.\" But as old administration aides like John Kelly rebuked him as undemocratic, she pounced on a message that Democrats ultimately said felt unconnected to voters' everyday struggles.",
      "\"Democrats often make the mistake of focusing on long term problems at a time when voters have immediate concerns. And democracy seems like a long-term issue, and it's not quite tangible. But gas prices, grocery prices, border crossings, a sense that crime is rising, those you feel every day,\" Kessler said.",
      "Some Democrats saw deeper troubles.",
      "Gone were the days when Democrats appealed to working and middle-class Americans they said. In their place were rallies with Beyonce and concerts with Bruce Springsteen, while Democrats, in critics' telling, lectured voters on why the party was right on the issues instead of empathizing with their underlying concerns.",
      "In short, philosophizing rather than fighting.",
      "\"It was the economy, was inflation, it was concerned about the border, and those were, for the most part, the top two issues,\" Kofinis said. \"We had no strategy in order to address that. And as a result, we just fed that alienation. Then in classic Democratic presidential campaign strategy that was eerily reminiscent to 2016, we embrace celebrities and the elites to somehow influence and dictate to the average voter how they should vote.\"",
      "\"I joined the Democratic Party because I wanted to fight NAFTA trade deals. I joined the Democratic Party because I wanted to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. I joined the Democratic Party because I was tired of seeing my tax dollars go to foreign wars while my community was crumbling. That sounds like Donald Trump today. We have to take that message back,\" added Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha.",
      "For Republicans, everything went right this election.",
      "Rather than deepen opposition, Trump's controversies and legal struggles deepened loyalties among his base. Rather than gin Democratic turnout, abortion ballot measures appeared to offer voters an off-ramp to fight for reproductive autonomy while separately registering their discontent with the current administration. And instead of running against a candidate who offered a fresh vision from the current White House, Trump faced the second-highest ranking official in it.",
      "Now, the struggle will be continuing the success.",
      "Trump's romp has the wind at Republicans' backs, and, should the GOP take the House of Representatives, he'll have at least two years to cement a string of accomplishments with a pliant Congress. But term limits bar Trump from running again, and replicating his coalition is easier said than done.",
      "\"That's what's going to be very, very difficult,\" said GOP pollster Robert Blizzard, who worked on the 2024 presidential campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis -- one of several Republicans who ran for the White House adopting Trump's pugilistic style only to be overwhelmingly rejected by primary voters this year.",
      "Yet in recognition of the gravitation pull that Trump has on the country's politics, even some Democrats said their path back to electoral success lies in part on the president-elect.",
      "Voters \"are hoping to get a repeat of the economy that they liked in his first term. If they get that, the path back for Democrats in 2028 is going to be quite difficult. But if his tariffs drive up inflation and his recklessness really demonstrates to voters that he does not have the special sauce on the economy that many think that he does, that will create a real opening,\" said the source familiar with the Harris campaign's thinking.",
      "\"It's tough, but it's just the reality of Trump in many ways.\"",

      "\"We will never give up the fight to protect our schools and our streets from gun violence,\" she continued. \"And America, we will never give up the fight for our democracy, for the rule of law, for equal justice, and for the sacred idea that every one of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld.\"",
      "She said that fight will continue \"in the voting booth, in the courts, and in the public square.\"",
      "\"And we will also wage it in quieter ways, in how we live our lives, by treating one another with kindness and respect, by looking in the face of a stranger and seeing a neighbor,\" she said. \"By always using our strength to lift people up, to fight for the dignity that all people deserve.\"",
      "To her young supporters watching, the vice president said, \"It is OK to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it's gonna be OK.\"",
      "\"Sometimes the fight takes a while. ... The important thing is don't ever give up,\" she said.",
      "\"This is not a time to throw up our hands, this is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together,\" she said.",

      "Harris' defeat came as Trump won the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin overnight. Trump won another swing state, Michigan, on Wednesday.",
      "Trump's victory underscores just how deep voters' frustrations were surrounding inflation and immigration, Republicans' two top issues this election cycle as polls consistently showed Americans' unhappiness with how President Joe Biden handled them. Trump's return to the White House also suggests that Democrats were not motivated enough by the prospect of electing the first female president and that its base's fury over the Supreme Court's revocation of constitutional abortion protections has waned since 2022.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 13:40:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump has proposed featuring prayer in public schools and dismantling the Department of Education.",
    "story": [
      "Trump has previously proposed dismantling the Department of Education.",
      "Former President Donald Trump -- now projected to be the next president of the United States -- has proposed sweeping reform for the nation's educational systems.",
      "Here's a look at what areas of education his second term might impact:",
      "Department of Education",
      "Trump's Agenda47 campaign proposed eliminating the Department of Education -- which, according to the DOE website, \"establishes policy for, administers and coordinates most federal assistance to education.\"",
      "The DOE, established by President Jimmy Carter, provides programs such as Title I funding for low-achieving or high-poverty K-12 schools in need of support, as well as Pell Grants for undergraduate students in high financial need.",
      "Throughout Trump's first presidency, he proposed billions in cuts to the Department of Education's budget.",
      "In a campaign video, Trump said he wants states -- not the federal government -- to have control over schools.",
      "However, he has also outlined plans to further restrict content or classroom discussion in schools based on guidelines that would be executed at the federal level.",
      "Content restrictions",
      "Trump's campaign has outlined a plan that features prayer in public schools, an expansion of parental rights in education, patriotism as a centerpiece of education and an emphasis on the \"American Way of Life.\"",
      "He has also called for the dismantling of diversity initiatives in education and federal funding cuts for schools or programs that feature \u201ccritical race theory, gender ideology or other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content.\" Republican-backed legislation across the country has similarly sought to limit these topics, and the efforts have been criticized for being vague and leading to \"censorship\" in schools and classrooms on topics concerning race, gender and politics.",
      "Similar policies and rhetoric against school content concerning race, gender, sex and more have coincided with the removal of more than 10,000 books from library shelves over the 2023-2024 school year, according to the free-expression advocacy group PEN America.",
      "Trump has also suggested that he would create a new credentialing body to certify teachers \"who embrace patriotic values and support the American Way of Life\" and reinstate his administration's 1776 Commission to align the teaching of history with the \"values\" of the founding of the United States -- though Agenda47 does not elaborate further on what such values are or define the criteria for embracing the \"American Way of Life.\"",
      "School choice",
      "Trump also backs nationwide universal school choice programs, which allow a student's allotment of public education funds to be transferred to nonpublic schooling options -- including private schools or homeschooling.",
      "This comes as voters in three states -- Nebraska, Kentucky and Colorado -- have rejected efforts to codify or expand this kind of school choice.",
      "Teacher pay and tenure",
      "Trump's Agenda47 also anticipates an end to teacher tenure laws. These laws are described by the United Federation of Teachers as state laws that prevent a school district from dismissing a tenured teacher without due process. Most states have tenure laws in place; however, at least 10 states have zero or limited tenure laws, according to the National Education Association.",
      "He also said he will adopt a merit pay for teachers. Some studies have shown that merit pay programs improve student outcomes, but critics argue there is not enough evidence and that various factors impact student performance -- including funding and resource inequity.",
      "Higher education",
      "Trump's agenda for higher education includes creating a new, free university called the \"American Academy\" and fund it by \"taxing, fining and suing\" private universities.",

Trump to congratulate him on his victory and extended an invitation to the White House to ensure a smooth transition between the current Administration and the incoming Administration. President Trump looks forward to the meeting, which will take place shortly, and very much appreciated the call,\" Cheung said in a statement.",
      "Biden also spoke to Vice President Kamala Harris on the phone Wednesday to congratulate her on \"her historic campaign,\" the White House said.",
      "Later, following Harris' concession speech to the nation on Wednesday afternoon, Biden released a statement praising Harris, saying she has been a \"tremendous partner and public servant full of integrity, courage and character.\"",
      "\"Under extraordinary circumstances, she stepped up and led a historic campaign that embodied what's possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just, and full of more opportunities for all Americans,\" Biden said.",

      "Trump and Harris also spoke by phone on Wednesday, according to the Trump campaign. Harris told Trump she will work with Biden to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, unlike the transition in 2020, according to an email Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon sent to campaign staff.",
      "Biden plans to talk about the election results and the transition on Thursday, according to the White House.",

      "ABC NEWS: Joining us now is Mary Jordan, associate editor at the Washington Post and author of \"The Art of Her Deal: The Untold Story of Melania Trump.\" Mary, thank you so much for joining us. We will get to Melania Trump in a moment, but first just put it into perspective, this very specific moment we find ourselves in. How will history remember this incredible 2024 election?",
      "MARY JORDAN: Like no other. Between the unusual nature that Kamala Harris didn't even know she was running until July, that we had a president who walked on stage and shocked people.",
      "They thought, Oh my God, Joe Biden, something happened to him. He can't run. And we, of course, had Donald Trump, the comeback king, who, despite offensive language, criminal convictions, just keeps on going and only getting a bigger victory.",
      "You know, I think it's safe to say, judging from what everyone said today, either they were nauseous and upset or euphoric. No one's going to forget this one.",
      "ABC NEWS: And President-elect Trump, as you mentioned, some of these things now, just the second president to win nonconsecutive terms in office, growing his coalition of voters from just four years ago comes into his second term as the only commander in chief convicted of a crime and is an incredibly polarizing figure. Historically, have divisive leaders like Trump been able to unite the party or only drive us further apart?",
      "JORDAN: You know, if he really can turn around after, you know, all of the offensive words. I mean, he called Kamala Harris low IQ and he, you know, he has said he's going to do all kinds of things. But, you know, Donald Trump always surprises. So let's see what he does.",
      "I mean, now maybe he has his eye on history. He has such a long list of things that he said he was going to do on Day One. Right. He's going to seal the border, hire more border agents, fire federal employees, trim the government down. I mean, it goes on and on and on. Tariffs, lower taxes.",
      "You know, he's going to be pretty busy. But it's really the feeling in Washington now is that the moving vans are coming. You know, there's a big change afoot. That's what you feel like.",
      "ABC NEWS: And this will be Melania Trump's second term as first lady. But she remains rather a mystery to most, standing back from much of the spotlight. What do you think that her role will be with this next term?",
      "JORDAN: You know, I think she is really underestimated. People thought, oh, she hates politics. She doesn't really like to be there. But when I interviewed over 100 people and spent a couple of years going to her native Slovenia and everywhere she worked in Europe, I came away with a woman who is a loner for sure. She doesn't need people around her, but she's determined, ambitious. She wants her place in history.",
      "She encouraged her husband to go into politics. And this time around, unlike the first time, now she has experience and a bit more confidence. In 2016, she was shocked that they won. She thought Hillary Clinton was going to win. And she kind of came in late, feuding with her daughter-in-law, Ivanka. I think this time you're going to see a more assertive and a more confident Melania Trump.",
      "ABC NEWS: Do you think she was surprised this time?",
      "JORDAN: No, not at all. Her, her son, who she's close to, enormously close to, Barron Trump had been actually quite involved in a way in the campaign during his dad telling him which podcast younger people are listening to, what's the cool thing to go on?",
      "And Donald Trump actually listened to him and did do that and has actually credited Barron. So Melania and Barron, you know, are more front and center this time. And I think that, you know, going through all the criticism that they had, it's kind of a bunker Trump mentality where we won and we deserve this. And they're more of a team. Even if she's going to still sneak away and be invisible sometimes.",
      "ABC NEWS: Mary Jordan, our thanks to you. Really appreciate your time tonight.",

      "Special counsel Jack Smith is in active talks with senior leadership at the Justice Department evaluating ways he can end his prosecutions of President-elect Donald Trump, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "The decision is based on longstanding Department of Justice policy that a sitting president cannot face criminal prosecution while in office, sources said.",
      "It is unclear as of today how Smith's prosecutors will approach dismissing both the federal election subversion case in Washington, D.C., and their ongoing appeal of Judge Aileen Cannon's dismissal of the classified documents case.",
      "Trump has vowed to fire Smith \"within two seconds.\"",
      "\"We got immunity at the Supreme Court. It's so easy. I would fire him within two seconds. He'll be one of the first things addressed,\" Trump said on a call into the \"Hugh Hewitt Show\" on Oct. 24.",
      "But due to Justice Department policy of not prosecuting a president, a firing is unneeded.",
      "Smith was appointed to his position by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to investigate Trump and his allies' efforts to overturn the 2020 election as well as Trump's alleged unlawful possession of highly classified documents he took from his time in the White House.",

    "summary": "While ABC News had not projected a winner by early Wednesday morning, Trump's performance broke the mold across a variety of measures.",
    "story": [
      "ABC News has not projected a winner in the presidential race.",
      "Former President Donald Trump leveraged economic discontent, extended his appeal beyond his core support groups and overturned long-term political trends in the 2024 presidential election, driving his unique political style to a remarkable comeback.",
      "While ABC News had not projected a winner by early Wednesday morning, Trump's performance broke the mold across a variety of measures.",
      "Among them, Hispanic voters, long a solidly Democratic group, voted for Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump by just 53-45% -- the closest margin since exit polls began in 1976. That 8-point win for Harris compares with 33 points for President Joe Biden among Hispanic voters four years ago.",
      "Trump's gain chiefly was among Hispanic men -- a win by 10 points, after losing them by 23 points in 2020. Given the country's increasingly diverse population, Republican competitiveness among Hispanic voters could represent a sea change in the nation's political landscape.",
      "At the same time, diversity declined in this election: It was the first time since 1996 that racial and ethnic minorities did not increase their share of the electorate, even if by a scant point or two. In all, they went from just 13% of voters in 1992 (with the rest, 87%, white) to 33% in 2020 (with 67% white). In this election, white voters accounted for 71%, a 4-point increase; minority voters moved down to 29%.",
      "The main gain among white people was those who don't have a four-year college degree, +4 points as a share of the electorate and a broadly pro-Trump group.",
      "White people overall voted 55-43% for Trump. That compared with Harris wins of 53-45% among Hispanic people (an historically tight margin, as noted) 56-38% among Asian voters and 86-12% among Black voters, a typical result for Democrats.",
      "Another break from the past was in terms of straight-ahead partisanship. Thirty-four percent of voters identified themselves as Republicans, 32% as Democrats and 34% as independents. However tight the margin, it was the first time in exit polls that Republicans outnumbered Democrats nationally.",
      "There was a huge gap between young men (roughly evenly split, 49-47%, Harris-Trump) and young women (+27 points for Harris, 63-36%). Still, Harris' vote from young women was down 4 points from Biden's in 2020.",
      "Harris won women by 54-44%; Trump won men by an identical margin. That 20-point gender gap almost exactly matches the average since 1996. Tellingly, though, Harris' support from women was 3 points lower than Biden's in 2020.",
      "In another dramatic shift, Harris underperformed Biden by 19 points among first-time voters (even if a small group, 8% of the electorate). They went 54-45% for Trump over Harris, after backing Biden over Trump by 64-32%. Trump doubled his support in this group.",
      "College-educated voters were about as good for Harris as they were for Biden \u2013 but Trump did 4 points better among non-college voters than he did four years ago. Non-college voters, notably, are more economically vulnerable: Fifty-three percent in that group said they'd gotten worse off financially under Biden's presidency. Just 33% of college-educated voters said the same.",
      "One more departure in the 2024 election bears note: Even with her overall outcome, independent voters went 49-46 percent Harris-Trump. Independents often \u2013 but not always \u2013 vote with the winner.",
      "On issues, the most striking result by far was the share of people overall saying they've gotten worse off financially under the current administration, 45%. That was the highest in exit polls that have asked the question, even surpassing the 42% worse off in 2008, in the teeth of the Great Recession. It was up from 20% four years ago, a more than doubling of the worse-off population under the administration in which Harris is No 2.",
      "Conversely, a mere 24% this year said they'd become better off under Biden, a question Trump asked repeatedly at his campaign rallies.",
      "Biden took the heat, with just a 40% job approval rating, with 58% disapproving, the lowest approval for an incumbent president in exit polls since President George W. Bush's 27% as he left office in 2008.",
      "But Harris took the heat, as well.",
      "Brief state-by-state results from exit polls in the seven battleground states follow.",
      "Arizona",
      "Biden narrowly won in Arizona four years ago helped by gains among college-educated white voters and among a growing share of independents. This year Harris maintained Biden\u2019s advantage with college-educated white voters, winning them by 53-45%. But independents, 40% of voters, split 49-45%, Trump-Harris.",
      "In another key result, Maricopa County voters divided 50-47%, Trump-Harris, compared with 50-48%, Biden-Trump, in 2020. Maricopa County is crucial, as it's home to 59% of the state\u2019s electorate.",
      "Georgia",
      "Harris was unable to replicate Biden\u2019s performance among independents that helped make him the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry Georgia since 1992.",
      "Key to Trump\u2019s victory here, independents swung toward Trump by 11 points, 54-43%, compared with Biden\u2019s 9-point margin in 2020. Trump also won white men with college degrees by 30 points, 64-34%, more than doubling his 12-point lead among them 2020. And although he lost moderates to Harris by 18 points, that was far narrower than his 32-point loss against Biden in 2020.",
      "Michigan",
      "In 2020, Biden flipped Michigan back to the Democratic column by making gains from Clinton's 2016 showing among independents, suburbanites and those in union households.",
      "In key shifts this year, under-30s divided 51-46% Trump-Harris, a sharp turn from Biden's 24-point advantage (61-37%) in this group in 2020. In partisan terms, the share identifying as Democrats fell 6 points to 32%, the lowest on record in exit polls since 1984.",
      "Nevada",
      "In a stronger-than-usual showing among Hispanic voters, Trump divided evenly with Harris in this group, 47-47%; Democrats had 21- to 54-point advantages among Hispanic voters in Nevada exit poll data since 2000.",
      "Other factors kept the race up in the air. Independents divided evenly, 47-46%; as did white women, a group Trump won by 53-45% in 2020.",
      "But Trump eroded usual Democratic margins in Las Vegas\u2019 Clark County, splitting the vote, 49-48%, Harris-Trump, the best showing for a GOP presidential candidate in available exit poll data since 2004.",
      "North Carolina",
      "Trump was aided in North Carolina by the broad 69% of voters who rated the national economy negatively \u2013 a group that supported him by 46 points over Harris, 72-26%. His economic message cut across racial lines. A third of voters were people of color, and 60% of them gave the nation\u2019s economy bad ratings; they went for Trump by 26 points, 61-35%.",
      "Trump lost 4 points vs. 2020 among white voters, while Harris gained 5 points over Biden\u2019s margin. Still, that wasn\u2019t enough to mitigate slips in groups that brought Biden close in 2020. Voters under 30 went +1 for Harris this year vs. +17 for Biden in 2020, men went +17 for Trump vs. +9 for him in 2020 and Black voters went for Harris by +74 points this time, down from Biden's +85.",
      "Pennsylvania",
      "Exit poll results in Pennsylvania pointed to a growing educational divide, with Harris leading by 60-39% among voters with a college degree, the widest Democratic win in this group in exit polls since 1988. Conversely, Trump had a 57-41% lead among non-college voters, the largest Republican victory on record. The gender gap also sharpened since 2020, with women breaking for Harris by 55-43% while men went for Trump by 57-41%.",
      "Harris made inroads among voters from union households, winning them by 54-45% after this group split 51-49% for Trump in 2020. But, as elsewhere, she lost ground among Hispanic voters, +15 points at the end of night, compared with Biden\u2019s 42-point lead in 2020; and among voters younger than 30, winning them by 9 points compared with Biden\u2019s 27 points.",
      "Wisconsin",
      "Harris lost ground among Wisconsin voters younger than 30; they went 53-45 Harris-Trump compared with a 59-36 percent Biden win four years ago. While they comprised just 6% of the electorate, Black voters went for Harris by 78-21%, down from a much wider 92-8% for Biden in 2020. At the same time, Harris was boosted by an increase in the share of voters with college degrees, up 4 points from 2020 to 38%; she won them 57-41%, matching Biden\u2019s margin in 2020. The share of moderates also increased, up 6 points to 44%, with this group breaking 56-43% Harris-Trump.",

      "The presidential race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris has been decided, but there are still several downballot races where the winner isn't yet apparent. Control of the House of Representatives is still up in the air, and while ABC News has projected that Republicans will win the Senate, the size of their majority is still TBD. Needless to say, both of these things will have major implications for how easy it will be for Trump to enact his second-term agenda.",

      "ABC News reports that Democratic Rep. Don Davis is projected to win his race in North Carolina's 1st District. With 91% of the expected vote in, Davis narrowly leads his Republican challenger Laurie Buckhout, 49% to 48%.",
      "Notably, Buckhout had already conceded on Wednesday afternoon. \"While Don and I have different visions, it is obvious to everyone he cares about this district,\" she wrote in a recent social media post. Given this, it's unlikely she'll request a recount \u2014 as she was once considering doing.",
      "Democrats have held this seat since the 1890s. But the party's slim voting margin might be reason to worry \u2014 as it's likely the GOP will target this seat in future races.

      "Despite a Democratic win here, though, South Texas's overall political shift is incredibly fascinating. Take this example: In Hidalgo County, the most populous in the Rio Grande Valley, Trump beat Harris by 3 percentage points. Compare this to 2020, when Biden won the county by nearly 17 points. Gonzalez might've survived to see another two years in the House, but given the political realignment of Latinos in South Texas, it's likely that Democrats will have to fight even harder for these seats in future elections.",

The other two were the 1st, which Democrats are also expected to hold, and the 3rd, in which a winner hasn't been projected and which is very close.

    "story": [
      "An attorney for Karen Read argued in front of the state's highest court that several charges related to the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend should be dropped",
      "BOSTON -- An attorney for Karen Read on Wednesday argued at the state's highest court that trying her again on several charges related to the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend amounted to double jeopardy and that it should allow jurors to be questioned about the verdict.",
      "Read is accused of ramming into John O\u2019Keefe with her SUV and leaving him to die in a snowstorm in January 2022. Read\u2019s attorneys argue she is being framed and that other law enforcement officers are responsible for O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. A judge declared a mistrial in June after finding jurors couldn\u2019t reach an agreement. A retrial on the same charges is set to begin in January, though both sides asked Monday for it to be delayed until April. 1.",
      "\u201cToday's appeal goes to the core issues regarding double jeopardy protection that safeguard defendants, in this case Ms. Read, from the risk of reprosecution for the very same offenses for which a prior jury was discharged,\u201d Read\u2019s attorney, Martin Weinberg, told judges at the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.",
      "Weinberg went onto to say four jurors and fifth indirectly came forward after her mistrial to say that they were deadlocked only on a manslaughter count and had agreed that she wasn\u2019t guilty on the other charges of charges of second-degree murder and leaving the scene. But they hadn\u2019t told the judge.",
      "As a result of the the revelations about the jurors, Weinberg argued for the court to allow holding of an a evidentiary hearing where jurors could be asked whether they had reached final not guilty verdicts on any charges.",
      "The judges questioned Weinberg over the the merits for holding inquiry. Associate Justice Frank Gaziano noting that such inquiries are usually reserved for \u201cextraneous information\u201d such as \u201cracisms in the jury room\" while Chief Justice Kimberly Budd wondered about the limits of allowing an inquiry, which she suggested could open the door for other defendants to argue a juror came to them to say \u201c that's not really what happened.\u201d",
      "Other justices raised concerns about juries having to discuss their deliberations during an inquiry while others questioned the merits of holding an inquiry when three notes from the juror made it clear they were at an impasse.",
      "\u201cYou have an exhausted jury writing this very eloquent message saying we've done our best, we haven't been able a verdict on the charges,\u201d Justice Scott Kafker said. \u201cThere is no inkling in that that they have reached verdicts on charges or that this only relates to the second charge.\u201d",
      "Weinberg also argued that Judge Beverly Cannone abruptly announced the mistrial in court without first asking each juror to confirm their conclusions about each count or to give defense counsel a chance to weigh in.",
      "But Associate Justice Serge Georges said Read had seasoned defense attoreys who must have sensed that a mistrial was possible when Cannon gave juries what is called Tuey-Rodriguez charge, a last ditch effort to get them to reconsider their positions before a mistrial was declared.",
      "\u201cThere isn't any lawyer that's worth their salt that wouldn't think they might get a mistrial on this,\" George said, pushing back on the contention that the defense didn't have an opportunity to be heard. \u201cHow do we factor in that you've got to know that is going to be on the table, a mistrial. What obligation is there on counsel to say, hey, before you declare a mistrial, let's talk about alternatives to that.\u201d",
      "In August, a judge ruled Read can be retried on those charges. \u201cWhere there was no verdict announced in open court here, retrial of the defendant does not violate the principle of double jeopardy,\u201d the judge, Beverly Cannone, said in her ruling.",
      "Prosecutors have maintained that there\u2019s no basis for dismissing the charges of second-degree murder and leaving the scene of the accident. In court, they argued defense counsel should have sensed a mistrial was \u201cinevitable or unavoidable\u201d and that they had every opportunity to be heard.",
      "Still, Gaziano asked Assistant District Attorney Caleb Schillinger whether Cannone had \u201ceither the discretion or an obligation to ask the jury after the last note about continued deliberatios or a verdict on any lesser included offense.\u201d",
      "Schillinger responded that Cannone had no obligation to question the jurors further, though he acknowledged she had discretion. But argued the Cannone had \u201cno doubt\u201d basd on the juries note that they \"had not reached agreement on any charges\" and that probing further risked coercing the jury into reaching a verdict.",
      "\u201cYou have a jury that has sat through a gruelling 10-week trial, nearly 100 witnesses, hundreds of exhibits now four or five days of deliberation,\u201d Schillinger said. \u201cThey've returned three times indicating they are deadlocked at an impasses and they do not want to continue to deliberate.\u201d",
      "But George said Schillinger's argument lent support to the idea of Cannone telling defense attorneys about the last note and getting their thoughts.",
      "\u201cYou've spent a lot of time, energy and money, anxiety, angst in this trial,\u201d George said. \u201cWhy wouldn't we talk about what potentially we could do short of saying mistrial, let's start again.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said Read, a former adjunct professor at Bentley College, and O\u2019Keefe, a 16-year member of the Boston police, had been drinking heavily before she dropped him off at a party at the home of Brian Albert, a fellow Boston officer. They said she hit him with her SUV before driving away. An autopsy found O\u2019Keefe had died of hypothermia and blunt force trauma.",
      "The defense portrayed Read as the victim, saying O\u2019Keefe was actually killed inside Albert\u2019s home and then dragged outside. They argued that investigators focused on Read because she was a \u201cconvenient outsider\u201d who saved them from having to consider law enforcement officers as suspects."

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them leaders,\u201d Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans \u201csee on television.\u201d He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",

      "Health officials say it's important to get flu and COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the holidays when respiratory bugs tend to spread",
      "WASHINGTON -- If you missed the early fall push for flu and COVID-19 vaccines, it's not too late.",
      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",
      "And that coincides with flu season, which tends to start in November or December and peak in January or February.",
      "It takes the body about two weeks to build up immunity after either shot \u2014 meaning vaccination is needed before these viruses start spreading. A lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.",
      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",
      "\u201cIt may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.\u201d",
      "Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot.",
      "\u201cOur best defense to protect ourselves, our loved ones and all those around us is a simple shot,\u201d Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a recent statement.",
      "While it may have faded from the headlines, the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year.",
      "\u201cMaybe we believe that it\u2019s not going to be me but let\u2019s not take a chance,\u201d said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. \u201cWhy not get a vaccine that\u2019s going to help you reduce that risk?\u201d",
      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",
      "About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access. Call your local health department to ask about options.",
      "Check the government website, vaccines.gov, for availability at local pharmacies.",

      "Some of the Donald Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol nearly four years ago are celebrating the president-elect's electoral victory",
      "WASHINGTON -- As it became clear Donald Trump was returning to the White House, the Florida man who posed for photos with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s lectern during the Capitol riot popped a bottle of Trump-branded sparkling wine. \u201cY\u2019all are in trouble,\u201d he said after taking a sip in a video shared on social media.",
      "Rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, are celebrating Trump\u2019s victory and hoping he makes good on his campaign trail promise to pardon them.",
      "Trump didn\u2019t mention the Jan. 6 defendants, whom he has called \u201chostages\u201d and \u201cpatriots,\u201d during his victory speech on Wednesday. But his defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris throws into doubt the future of the largest prosecution in Justice Department history over the unprecedented assault on a seat of American democracy.",
      "More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the riot that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. More than 1,000 defendants have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial of charges, including misdemeanor trespassing offenses, assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Trump's praise of Jan. 6 defendants was a centerpiece of his campaign, with rallies honoring them as heroes featuring a song he collaborated on with a group of jailed rioters. Trump hasn't explained how he will decide who gets pardoned. But he has suggested he would consider granting them even for those accused of assault as well as the former Proud Boys leader convicted of orchestrating a violent plot in 2020 to keep Trump in power.",
      "During his first term as president, Trump deployed his pardon power in overtly political ways, granting clemency in his final days in office to a broad range of political allies -- including five defendants convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation -- as well as celebrities, Republican members of Congress and the father of Jared Kushner, his son-in-law.",
      "Jacob Lang, a Capitol riot defendant who's jailed while awaiting a trial in Washington, posted within hours of Trump's victory that he and other Jan. 6 \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d were \u201cfinally coming home.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere will be no bitterness in my heart as I walk out of these doors in 75 days on inauguration day,\u201d Lang wrote.",
      "Lawyers for some Jan. 6 defendants cited Trump's victory in requests to hold off on sentencing their clients.",
      "Defense attorney Marina Medvin said her client, Christopher Carnell, is \u201cexpecting to be relieved of the criminal prosecution that he is currently facing when the new administration takes office.\u201d Michelle Peterson, an assistant federal public defender, argued it would be \"fundamentally unfair\" to sentence a client whose case may be dismissed by Trump's Justice Department.",
      "Judges swiftly denied both requests and refused to delay separate hearings for their respective cases on Friday.",
      "Other defense attorneys on Wednesday asked for a Jan. 6 defendant's trial to be postponed. They argued that their client, Mitchell Bosch, cannot receive a fair trial in Washington so soon after the election given that voters in the nation's capital overwhelmingly supported Harris over Trump.",
      "\u201cMr. Bosch understands that the President-elect\u2019s proclamations of stolen elections and pardons for patriots are not relevant evidence in his trial. However, they are highly relevant to the ability of the jury pool to be fair and impartial,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "A trial is scheduled to start next week for Steve Baker, a writer charged with Capitol riot-related misdemeanors. Baker, who has written articles about the Jan. 6 riot for the conservative outlet Blaze News, posted a photo of a press credential for him to cover Congress.",
      "\"I plan on covering J6, 2025 \u2018inside\u2019 the Capitol,\" he wrote on Wednesday, adding a winking face emoji.",
      "Of the more than 1,000 convicted rioters who have been sentenced, over 650 have received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years. Hundreds of people who went into the Capitol but did not attack police or damage the building were charged only with misdemeanors. The violence and destruction by other members of the mob have been documented in videos and other evidence heard in court, including testimony from police officers about being beaten and scared for their lives as they defended the Capitol.",
      "Trump has said he would issue pardons to Capitol rioters on \u201cDay 1\u201d of his presidency. He told Time Magazine he would consider pardoning all of the Jan. 6 defendants, though later added: \u201cIf somebody was evil and bad, I would look at that differently.\u201d He told NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last year that he would consider pardoning former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison after being convicted of seditious conspiracy. Trump said Tarrio was treated \u201chorribly.\u201d",
      "When pressed during an event in July, Trump said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would pardon rioters accused of assaulting police \u2014 if they were \u201cinnocent.\u201d When the interviewer noted she was talking about convicted rioters, Trump replied that they were convicted \u201cby a very tough system.\u201d",
      "Kim Wehle, a University of Baltimore law professor and author of a book about presidential pardons, said presidents have the unfettered power to issue mass pardons.",
      "\u201cThe pardon system is set up for winners and losers. Who gets them and who doesn\u2019t get them is completely subjective. It\u2019s completely arbitrary and based on the whims of the president,\u201d Wehle said. \u201cDonald Trump could fashion the pardon however he wants to fashion the pardon, and the general public wouldn\u2019t be able to challenge it.\u201d",

      "A judge is blocking a Georgia county from approving larger homes in a tiny community of Black slave descendants as they ask the state's highest court to reinstate a canceled referendum on the rezoning of their island enclave",
      "SAVANNAH, Ga. -- A judge has blocked a Georgia county from approving larger homes in a tiny island community of Black slave descendants until the state's highest court decides whether residents can challenge by referendum zoning changes they fear will lead to unaffordable tax increases.",
      "Hogg Hummock on Sapelo Island was founded after the Civil War by slaves who worked the cotton plantation of Thomas Spalding. It's one of the South's few remaining communities of people known as Gullah-Geechee, whose isolation from the mainland resulted in a unique culture with deep ties to Africa.",
      "The few dozen Black residents remaining on the Georgia island have spent the past year fighting local officials in McIntosh County over a new zoning ordinance. Commissioners voted in September 2023 to double the size of homes allowed in Hogg Hummock, weakening development restrictions enacted nearly three decades earlier to protect the shrinking community of modest houses along dirt roads.",
      "Residents and their advocates sought to repeal the zoning changes under a rarely used provision of Georgia's constitution that empowers citizens to call special elections to challenge local laws. They spent months collecting more than 1,800 petition signatures and a referendum was scheduled for Oct. 1.",
      "McIntosh County commissioners filed suit to stop the vote. Senior Judge Gary McCorvey halted the referendum days before the scheduled election and after hundreds of ballots were cast early. He sided with commissioners' argument that zoning ordinances are exempt from being overturned by voters.",
      "Hogg Hummock residents are appealing the judge's ruling to the Georgia Supreme Court, hoping to revive and reschedule the referendum.",
      "On Monday, McCorvey granted their request to stop county officials from approving new building permits and permit applications under the new zoning ordinance until the state Supreme Court decides the case.",
      "The new zoning law increased the maximum size of homes allowed in Hogg Hummock to 3,000 square feet (278 square meters) of total enclosed space. The previous limit was 1,400 square feet (130 square meters) of heated and air-conditioned space.",
      "Residents say larger homes in their small community would lead to higher property taxes, increasing pressure to sell land held in their families for generations.",
      "McCorvey in his ruling Monday said Hogg Hummock residents have a \u201cchance of success\" appealing his decision to cancel the referendum, and that permitting larger homes in the island community before the case is decided could cause irreversible harm.",
      "\u201cA victory in the Supreme Court would be hollow indeed, tantamount to closing a barn door after all the horses had escaped,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "Attorneys for McIntosh County argued it is wrong to block an ordinance adopted more than a year ago. Under the judge's order, any new building permits will have to meet the prior, stricter size limits.",
      "Less than a month after the referendum on Hogg Hummock's zoning was scrapped, Sapelo Island found itself reeling from an unrelated tragedy.",
      "Hundreds of tourists were visiting the island on Oct. 19 when a walkway collapsed at the state-operated ferry dock, killing seven people. It happened as Hogg Hummock was celebrating its annual Cultural Day festival, a day intended to be a joyful respite from worries about the community's uncertain future.",
      "The Georgia Supreme Court has not scheduled when it will hear the Sapelo Island case. The court last year upheld a citizen-called referendum from 2022 that stopped coastal Camden County from building a commercial spaceport.",
      "The spaceport vote relied on a provision of Georgia\u2019s constitution that allows organizers to force special elections to challenge \u201clocal acts or ordinances, resolutions, or regulations\u201d of local governments if they get a petition signed by 10% to 25%, depending on population, of a county\u2019s voters.",
      "In the Sapelo Island case, McCorvey ruled that voters can't call special elections to veto zoning ordinances because they fall under a different section of the state constitution."

      "Trent Russell, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, who worked at the time as a transplant coordinator for the Washington Regional Transplant Community and had access to hospital records all over the region, was convicted earlier this year of illegally accessing health care records and destroying or altering records at a jury trial.",
      "He was also charged with publishing that information on the internet in 2019, at a time when public speculation about Ginsburg's health and her ability to serve as a justice was a matter of public debate. Prosecutors said he posted the information along with a false claim that Ginsburg had already died. But the jury acquitted Russell on that count.",
      "Ginsburg served on the court until her death in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors said Russell disclosed the health records on forums that trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories, including conspiracy theories that Ginsburg was dead, but Russell's motivations for his actions were unclear. Indeed, Russell himself never admitted that he accessed the records, at one point suggesting that perhaps his cat walked across the keyboard in a way that mistakenly called up Ginsburg's data.",
      "Russell's excuses and refusal to accept responsibility prompted blistering critiques from prosecutors, who sought a 30-month sentence.",
      "\u201cHe offered completely implausible excuses with a straight face,\u201d prosecutor Zoe Bedell said.",
      "Russell's lawyer, Charles Burnham, sought a sentence of probation or home detention. He cited Russell's work saving lives as a transplant coordinator and his military record which included a deployment to Afghanistan as mitigating factors.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell has lived a quietly heroic life,\u201d Burnham wrote in court papers. He chalked up the criminal conduct to \u201cbeing stupid.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff's 24-month sentence , calling his crime \u201ctruly despicable conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have made it extremely difficult to understand what motivated you,\u201d Nachmanoff said. He said Russell made matters worse by lying to investigators and on the witness stand.",
      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",
      "Russell and his lawyer declined to comment after Thursday's hearing on whether they plan to appeal."

    "story": [
      "Republican Jeff Hurd has won the U.S. House seat in Colorado that Rep. Lauren Boebert left",
      "Republican Jeff Hurd has won the U.S. House seat in Colorado that Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert nearly lost in 2022 then left for another race, a risky but ultimately successful bet she took in the hopes of keeping the seat in GOP hands and staying in Congress herself.",
      "Hurd, more mild-mannered than Boebert and hewing to an older GOP tradition, beat Adam Frisch, the Democrat who nearly unseated Boebert two years ago in the 3rd Congressional District, which covers the state\u2019s Rocky Mountains. Boebert, meanwhile, won a seat in the 4th Congressional District.",
      "Hurd was leading by about 12,000 votes in unofficial results as of Thursday \u2014 a much larger margin than the 546 votes Boebert won by in 2022.",
      "Hurd campaigned on a platform centered around rural jobs and the cost of living, alongside more national issues such as border security. He was not endorsed by former and incoming President Donald Trump and rarely mentioned him during the campaign. That's in stark contrast to Boebert, who spoke and prayed often for Trump on the campaign trail, and swung an endorsement from him in the 4th District.",
      "\u201cI got into this race to ensure that our rural communities are not forgotten,\u201d Hurd said in a written statement. \u201cIt will be an honor and privilege to represent the district where I was raised.\u201d",
      "Hurd thanked Frisch and voters for participating in the elections process, saying, \u201cYour engagement is the lifeblood of our democracy. Let us move forward with confidence in our democratic institutions.\u201d",
      "Hurd overcame a massive fundraising deficit against Frisch, who had one of the largest U.S. House campaign chests in the nation. Frisch\u2019s contributions were fueled by donations from around the country from Democrats who disliked Boebert. Frisch is a businessman and former city councilmember in Aspen.",
      "Frisch, in a phone call, said Trump's sweeping victory this week presented a challenge for his own prospects in the historically Republican-leaning district.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can swim against the tide,\u201d he said. As for whether Frisch would have won if Boebert hadn\u2019t left the race, he remarked, \u201cDo I think we would\u2019ve beaten Boebert? Yes. Can I guarantee that? No.\"",
      "Boebert is an ardent Trump loyalist and a rabble-rouser who\u2019s helped define an ultra-conservative flank of the House. She left the race to run in the 4th District, a Republican stronghold covering a sweep of the Great Plains, saying she didn\u2019t want to give Democrats a chance to \u201cbuy\u201d the seat in the 3rd.",
      "Boebert's move came after Frisch nearly beat her two years ago. She was later caught on tape vaping and groping with a date in a Denver theater, which rattled even loyal supporters.",
      "Justifying her change of districts, Boebert said, \u201cThere is a need for my voice in Congress.\u201d",
      "She later said she wanted a fresh start for her family after a messy and public divorce.",
      "After successfully fighting through a packed Republican primary election, where she avoided a surprise political threat with some behind-the-scenes maneuvering, Boebert is now the incumbent in a safely red seat formerly held by conservative Republican Rep. Ken Buck.",
      "When Buck resigned earlier this year, he cited the flank of the party that is known for its hardheaded politics and unwavering devotion to Trump \u2014 traits that made Boebert a name brand.",
      "Hurd's victory also bore out Boebert's hope that her move would allow Republicans to maintain control of the district that first elected her in 2020.",
      "Boebert has been criticized for her intractable politics \u2014 stonewalling the January 2023 vote to elect Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy as House speaker, for example \u2014 but has said that her actions are aimed at keeping the promises she made on the campaign trail."

      "Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, a moderate known for defying party orthodoxy, is in a tight race to keep his seat in Congress against Austin Theriault, a stock car driver and Republican state lawmaker",
      "LEWISTON, Maine -- Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, a moderate known for defying party orthodoxy, was defending his seat in Congress against Austin Theriault, a stock car driver and Republican state lawmaker, but the tight race was still too early to call Thursday.",
      "The matchup between Golden and Theriault is one of a handful of pivotal races with a chance to influence control of the U.S. House of Representatives during a competitive election year. It played out in the largest congressional district by area on the East Coast, a largely rural part of Maine where former President Donald Trump has proven very popular with voters.",
      "Thursday afternoon, Golden and Theriault were in a tight race with some of the vote yet to be counted.",
      "Golden is a former Marine in his third term representing the 2nd Congressional District, which is typically described as a swing district. The district covers a vast part of Maine that includes a handful of small cities but is perhaps best known as the home of traditional northern New England industries such as lobster fishing and logging.",
      "During the campaign, Golden touted his ability to work with members of either political party along with his advocacy on behalf of the lobster industry, which is the lifeblood of the region\u2019s economy. He declared himself the winner of the race Wednesday, though it has not been called by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cAnyone who has observed this race knows that this was my toughest election yet. Across the country, no Democrat has withstood stronger headwinds from the top of the ticket, the pundits and the organized opposition,\u201d Golden said, wearing a flannel shirt and blue jeans at a news conference in Lewiston.",
      "Theriault, who was first elected to the Maine House of Representatives in 2022, spent much of the campaign portraying Golden as too liberal for the district. Although Theriault had the backing of Trump, he also attempted to portray himself as a potential uniter during a divided time in Washington.",
      "Theriault said Wednesday that he was \u201cwell within the margin\u201d where a recount was possible \u201cand every vote should be counted.\u201d",
      "Maine has no mandatory recounts even in close elections. But the state does allow candidates to request a recount. The state does not require a deposit for a recount if the margin of victory is 1% or less for statewide or multicounty races.",
      "It was also possible neither candidate would crack 50% of the total vote, and that would necessitate a ranked choice count. There was no third-party candidate on the ballot, but write-in candidates were still possible, and some voters used that option.",
      "Golden was first elected to Congress in 2018, when he needed the ranked choice voting count to defeat Republican incumbent Rep Bruce Poliquin.",
      "Golden has held onto his seat despite Trump dominating the district in recent presidential elections. Maine is one of two states to apportion electoral votes by congressional district \u2014 Nebraska is the other \u2014 and Trump has won his sole New England electoral vote in Maine\u2019s 2nd District three times.",
      "In the 1st Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree won her ninth term against Republican challenger Ron Russell and independent Ethan Alcorn."

      "The Republican challenger has conceded after a close contest for North Carolina's only toss-up congressional district",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Republican candidate Laurie Buckhout conceded the race for North Carolina's only toss-up congressional district on Wednesday following a tight, closely watched race against incumbent first-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis.",
      "The Associated Press has not yet called the race. With the vast majority of precincts reporting, Davis and Buckhout were separated by a narrow margin in one of the few competitive districts across the Southeast.",
      "Buckhout issued a statement on X announcing her loss and calling on Davis to work with President-elect Donald Trump's administration on immigration and economic issues. She said she phoned Davis early Wednesday to congratulate him on \u201chis hard-fought victory.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile Don and I have different visions, it is obvious to everyone he cares about this district,\u201d she said.",
      "Davis also put out a statement declaring victory and thanking his supporters. He said he looks forward to working with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in his second term.",
      "\u201cI'm wholeheartedly dedicated to understanding and addressing the challenges and aspirations over everyday citizens in our community,\u201d he said.",
      "The contest between Davis and Buckhout has attracted millions of dollars from both parties to either flip or maintain the district, which extends from Currituck County to a small portion of Granville County in the state's northeast.",
      "The district's political landscape is a bit different for Davis compared to when he defeated Republican opponent Sandy Smith in 2022. Last year, the GOP-controlled state legislature added a handful of conservative-leaning counties to the district, making it less blue than it once was.",
      "Davis was born and raised in Snow Hill and has held various political positions in the region, including as his hometown's mayor and a state senator. He also is a U.S. Air Force veteran.",
      "Buckhout served in the U.S. Army for more than 25 years before retiring and starting a Virginia-based military technology consulting company. She sold the company and moved to Edenton a few years ago.",
      "Both Davis and Buckhout have sought to tie each other to the unpopular policies or controversial behaviors of other candidates in their respective parties.",
      "Buckhout's campaign has repeatedly tried to tie Davis with Vice President Kamala Harris' economic and immigration policies as a way to win over voters dissatisfied with the Biden-Harris administration. Davis voted with House Republicans in July to condemn Harris' work at the U.S.-Mexico border, then endorsed her presidential run a day later. He has also campaigned with her, speaking at one of her rallies in Greenville in October.",
      "Democratic groups supporting Davis, meanwhile, have tried to draw connections between Buckhout and Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, whose gubernatorial campaign has been fighting back against a CNN report alleging that he made several graphic sexual and racist comments on an online pornography forum about a decade ago. Robinson has denied the claims, and The Associated Press has not independently verified them.",
      "Those groups also have used photos in which Buckhout appears with Robinson to tie her to the lieutenant governor's shifting stance on abortion restrictions. Buckhout has previously said that she's focused on her own race rather than Robinson's."

      "\u201cIt is OK to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it\u2019s going to be OK,\" she told supporters as some of them wiped tears from their eyes.",
      "Biden released a statement praising Harris after her speech, saying: \u201cShe will continue the fight with purpose, determination, and joy. She will continue to be a champion for all Americans. Above all, she will continue to be a leader our children will look up to for generations to come as she puts her stamp on America\u2019s future.\u201d",

      "Some in the audience expressed disappointment that Harris was not able to make history as the country's first Black female president. Harris would also have been first U.S. president of South Asian descent",
      "Gregory Pate, 38, said he appreciated that Harris said she was \"committed to the fight and not looking at this as a permanent defeat, but just another obstacle that we have to go through as Black people.\u201d",

      "He dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed his vice president, who swiftly unified the Democratic Party around her candidacy.",
      "It was a remarkable twist of fate for Harris. Four years earlier, her own presidential campaign had flamed out and revealed the political limitations of someone once dubbed \u201cthe female Barack Obama.\u201d Even though Biden chose Harris as his running mate, she languished in the role after taking office as the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president.",
      "Some Democrats started writing her off when they pondered the party's future after Biden. But Harris found fresh purpose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, and she became the White House's leading advocate for abortion rights.",
      "Harris also made a more concerted effort to network with local politicians, business leaders and cultural figures, forging connections that could serve her down the road. The moment arrived sooner than she anticipated, and she was catapulted into the presidential race with Biden's departure only a month before the Democratic National Convention.",
      "Harris instantly reset the terms of the contest with Trump. She was 18 years younger and a former courtroom prosecutor going up against the first major presidential candidate convicted of crimes. Her candidacy energized Democrats who feared they were destined for defeat with Biden at the top of the ticket.",
      "But she also faced steep odds from the beginning. She inherited Biden's political operation with just 107 days until the end of the election, and she faced a restless electorate that was eager for change.",
      "Although Harris pitched \"a new way forward,\" she struggled to meaningfully differentiate herself from the unpopular sitting president. In addition, she had limited time to introduce herself to skeptical voters, who never cast a ballot for her in a presidential primary.",
      "Democrats now face the prospect of picking up the pieces during a second Trump presidency, and it's unclear what role Harris will play in her party's future.",
      "\u201cThe work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now,\" wrote Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, Harris' campaign chair, in a letter to staff. \"I know the Vice President isn\u2019t finished in this fight, and I know the very people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission.\u201d"

      "A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid",
      "WASHINGTON -- A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid, voiding an order by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to throw out the deals, a government official said.",
      "The official spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because the order by the judge, Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, has not yet been posted publicly or officially announced.",
      "Unless government prosecutors or others attempt to challenge the plea deals again, McCall's ruling means that the three 9/11 defendants before long could enter guilty pleas in the U.S. military courtroom at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, taking a dramatic step toward wrapping up the long-running and legally troubled government prosecution in one of the deadliest attacks on the United States.",
      "The plea agreements would spare Mohammed and two co-defendants, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, the risk of the death penalty in exchange for the guilty pleas.",
      "Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense attorneys under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at the Guantanamo Bay naval base had approved the agreements.",
      "The plea deals in the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people spurred immediate political blowback by Republican lawmakers and others after they were made public this summer.",
      "Within days, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them. Plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary, Austin said at the time.",
      "The agreements, and Austin's attempt to reverse them, have made for one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties. That includes years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants given their years of torture in CIA custody.",
      "The Pentagon is reviewing the judge's decision and had no immediate further comment, said Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary.",
      "Lawdragon, a legal news site that long has covered the courtroom proceedings from Guantanamo, and The New York Times first reported the ruling.",
      "Military officials have yet to post the judge's decision on the Guantanamo military commission's online site. But Lawdragon said McCall's 29-page ruling concludes that Austin lacked the legal authority to toss out the plea deals, and acted too late, after Guantanamo's top official already had approved the deals.",
      "Abiding by Austin\u2019s order would give defense secretaries \u201cabsolute veto power\u201d over any act they disagree with, which would be contrary to the independence of the presiding official over the Guantanamo trials, the law blog quotes McCall as saying in the ruling.",
      "While families of some of the victims and others are adamant that the 9/11 prosecutions continue until trial and possible death sentences, legal experts say it's not clear that could ever happen. If the 9/11 cases ever clear the hurdles of trial, verdicts and sentencings, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would likely hear many of the issues in the course of any death penalty appeals.",
      "The issues include the CIA destruction of videos of interrogations, whether Austin\u2019s plea deal reversal constituted unlawful interference and whether the torture of the men tainted subsequent interrogations by \u201cclean teams\u201d of FBI agents that did not involve violence.",

      "The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.",
      "\"I went with a backpack, and set up a business,\" says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.",
      "Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing \"the clich\u00e9 that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time\".",
      "\"Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner you'd get attention,\" he says.",
      "Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.",
      "Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.",
      "The country's standard corporation tax rate - the amount that firms have to pay on their profits - is just 12%. This compares with 25% in the UK, and 25.8% in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.",
      "There's an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the country's IT sector - the Moldova IT Park (MITP).",
      "This isn't a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country - and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7%.",
      "The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.",
      "This drive is being led by Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu, who this week was re-elected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted \"yes\" on pro-EU constitutional changes.",
      "However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46% and No receiving 49.54%. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldova\u2019s authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an \"unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy\".",
      "Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily.",
      "Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.",
      "\"Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that it's a country that can change very fast,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This used to be a highly corrupt country, a country where, exactly 10 years ago, a billion dollars from our central banks just disappeared.\"",
      "\"We are moving very fast towards joining the EU, and we are reforming our economy at top speed. Of course, we have a long way to go.\"",
      "He pointed to Moldova's rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International.",
      "Out of 180 countries - with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt - Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.",
      "\"Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.\"",
      "Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.",
      "\"Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.",
      "\"It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with.\"",
      "Member companies of the MITP don't just benefit from the 7% corporation tax rate. They also don't need to make employer social security contributions, and staff don't have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.",
      "The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.",
      "More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.",
      "In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined \u20ac365m ($397m; \u00a3308m) in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6% of the country's GDP.",
      "While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldova's IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.",
      "Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.",
      "He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than \u20ac100,000 a year, \"because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany\".",
      "At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. \"Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.\"",
      "Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe \"as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine\".",
      "Marina Bzovii, MITP's administrator and an assistant professor at the Technical University of Moldova, already sees Moldova as a regional business hub. \"Moldova is connecting even Central Asia, countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who are culturally much further from Europe.",

      "Millions of households in England and Wales will struggle to pay their water bills when they go up, a consumer watchdog has warned.",
      "The water regulator, Ofwat, has provisionally said bills would rise by an average of \u00a319 a year between 2025 and 2030 - a 21% increase over that period.",
      "But in a survey of 9,500 households carried out by the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), some 18% said they were already struggling with bills and 40% said they would struggle to afford these rises.",
      "Water companies said they were proposing an increase in support to struggling households to protect vulnerable customers.",
      "Ofwat and water firms have been locked in tense negotiations over how much they will be able to charge for the five years from April next year.",
      "In this major survey from the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), customers across 19 water company areas were presented with the proposed bill rises that were adjusted for inflation.",
      "Some 40% of the 9,500 people asked said they would find bill rises difficult to afford. Of those:",
      "54% said they would have to cut back on non-essentials to pay for it43% said they would use less water38% said they would cut back on food shopping and other essentials",

      "43% said they would use less water",
      "38% said they would cut back on food shopping and other essentials",
      "While 75% of households surveyed supported their water companies' plans for investment, that fell to 58% when they were reminded of the associated bill rises.",
      "Mike Keil, chief executive of the CCW, said the bill increases would put an \"intolerable strain\" on the finances of millions of households.",
      "\"It\u2019s quite frightening the extent to which water affordability is going to affect people in the future.\"",
      "He said a third of households under strain will cut back on essentials \"like food shopping\" in order to pay their water bill.",
      "\"That's a situation we just can't let happen,\" he added.",
      "Every water company has a scheme which can help reduce your bills if you are on a low income, but eligibility and support varies by company.",
      "The CCW is calling for a single social tariff across England and Wales to end what it calls a \"postcode lottery of assistance\".",
      "Mr Keil said current support on offer for customers in the form of social tariffs was \"completely inconsistent\".",
      "\"We are calling for the current system to be revamped and replaced with a much more fair system of social tariffs so it is consistent across England and Wales, which means that everyone who is struggling can be assured that that safety net is in place and support is there if they need it,\" he said.",
      "He says a single social tariff would be funded  centrally and distributed where the need is greatest.",
      "\"Water companies committed back in 2019, as part of a public interest commitment, to end water poverty by 2030, and this single social tariff is the best way to do that,\" he said.",
      "Ofwat and the Environment Agency are still continuing with investigations into all water companies in England and Wales after sewage spills into England's lakes, rivers and seas more than doubled in 2023.",
      "Mr Keil said customers wanted to see investment but also \"need to see evidence their money is being well spent\" to repair trust in water firms.",
      "'A bit bleak'",
      "Jonathan Sawers, 48, in Southampton pays Southern Water \u00a3600 a year.",
      "The firm landed a \u00a390m fine for dumping raw sewage in the sea, which its chief executive said came about because the company had not invested enough.",
      "Ofwat has forecast Southern Water will put bills up by 44% and Mr Sawers told the BBC the extra \u201c\u00a3200-\u00a3300 a year won\u2019t just appear from nowhere\u201d.",
      "He said paying the water bill after constant increases has \u201cbeen tough at times\u201d that has put stress on his wife and children. He has just come out of arrears from previous bill rises, he added.",
      "\u201cNow with the possibility of a 44% increase to our bill so that Southern Water can pay the fine imposed by Ofwat, our bill could potentially be \u00a3900,\" he said.",
      "\u201cConsidering my latest pay offer is 1% per year over three years and along with the gas and electric hikes of the past couple of years it\u2019s all looking a bit bleak\u201d, he said.",
      "In July, Ofwat provisionally said bills would rise by an average of \u00a319 per year between 2025 and 2030 - totalling a \u00a394 increase, or a 21% rise, over that five year period. That increase does not include inflation.",
      "The bill hike varies by region with the regulator agreeing to a rise of 44% for Southern Water, and 11% for Northumbrian Water.",
      "Since July, some companies have asked for further increases. For example, Thames Water, the UK's largest water company, was given the go-ahead to lift bills by 23%. It has since said it needs to raise bills by 59%, in order to keep operating as normal.",
      "The BBC understands Ofwat is considering permitting bigger bill increases for some companies when it makes a final decision in December, to reflect higher financing costs.",
      "Responding to the CCW survey, Water UK, which represents the sector, said companies wanted to provide more help to customers struggling with bill rises.",
      "\u201cWe urgently need investment in our water and sewage infrastructure,\" a spokesman said.",
      "He added the survey showed there was widespread public support for investment to secure water supplies and stop sewage spills.",
      "\"However, we understand increasing bills is never welcome,\" he said.",
      "Ofwat said it would \"fully consider\" the findings from the CCW research.",
      "\"It is also clear the majority of customers accepted the investment being proposed and the increase in bills needed to fund it, but it is crucial companies deliver the meaningful improvements this investment is designed to bring\", a spokesperson said.",

    "story": [
      "The Treasury should have disclosed a \u00a39.5bn overspend in the public finances in the run-up to the previous government's Spring Budget \"under the law\", the UK's budget watchdog has said.",
      "Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), told a committee of MPs on Tuesday the Treasury should explain why information was \"not provided to us\".",
      "His comments prompted the committee's chair and Labour MP Meg Hillier to suggest the Treasury \"may have broken the law\".",
      "A Treasury spokesperson told the BBC it had acted \"within the law\" but said it had made changes to make sure the \"unidentified pressures... never happen again\".",
      "The Conservative party has been contacted for comment.",
      "Last week, the OBR said the previous government \"did not provide\" them with all available information at former chancellor Jeremy Hunt's last Budget in March.",
      "The \u00a39.5bn overspend forms the basis of Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 claim that the Conservatives left Labour with a significant \"hole\" in the public finances.",
      "Asked by the committee on Tuesday how the shortfall could have happened, the OBR's Mr Hughes said \"the system very clearly broke down\", but insisted \"that kind of failure will not happen again\" because of processes put in place since.",
      "The OBR works closely with the Treasury. Its role is to assess the government's tax and spending plans and produce reports on whether the chancellors' plans are sound.",
      "Its judgements and forecasts are closely watched by financial markets to determine if the UK's economic plans are credible.",
      "Pushed on whether the Treasury broke the law over not disclosing an overspend, Mr Hughes said there may \"have been a misunderstanding of how the law ought to be interpreted\".",
      "\"There is no doubt in our minds that had that information been provided we would have had a materially different judgement,\" he added.",
      "He said it \"was a question for the Treasury to ask: why was information available within the Treasury and not provided to us?\"",
      "In summarising Mr Hughes' comments, Hillier said: \"The Treasury may have even broken the law in the run-up to the Spring Budget in not disclosing all the spending information.\"",
      "Shadow chancellor Hunt has previously accused the OBR of failing to act in a \"politically impartial manner\" by releasing its findings about the overspend on the day of the Budget last week, arguing it would help make the case for Labour's big tax rises.",
      "Hunt said it was \"impossible to know\" how much of the \u00a39.5bn would have been compensated for by savings elsewhere.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson told the BBC: \u201cAt the time of the Spring Budget, we communicated to the OBR the decision that ministers would manage spending pressures by making offsetting savings. This was within the law.",
      "\"We have accepted all the recommendations put forward by the OBR in its review of the March 2024 forecast.",

      "At the Budget, Reeves said employers will pay NI at a rate of 15% on salaries above \u00a35,000 from April, up from 13.8% on salaries above \u00a39,100.",
      "The OBR has calculated that three quarters of the impact would be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "The watchdog's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "Prof Miles said the OBR estimated employers would only take around a quarter of the hit from the NI changes in terms of lower profits, and suggested that the rest would be felt by workers.",
      "He said part of the reason for this was the reduction of the threshold for employers paying the tax.",
      "However, he suggested that the personal impact for workers might see \"a bit of an offset\" with the increase to minimum wages announced in the Budget.",

      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",

      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",

    "story": [
      "The door of Juan Botero\u2019s apartment in Houston, Texas is made of wood \u2013 with a classy, walnut-like finish.",
      "But, for Halloween, he planned an eye-catching change. \u201cI\u2019m going to paint my door orange,\u201d Mr Botero, founder and chief executive of Colombia-based Glasst, told the BBC last month. And he has kept his promise.",
      "However, the move is not as drastic as it sounds. Mr Botero\u2019s firm, an \u201cinnovation company\u201d, has designed the paint to be removable \u2013 once dry, you can peel it off like plastic wrap. If it works as intended, it shouldn\u2019t leave behind any marks or residue.",
      "Mr Botero had the idea for the product, called Unpaint, about five years ago and, initially, his investors weren\u2019t keen. \u201cThey said I was crazy,\u201d he recalls. Nevertheless, he insisted: \u201cPeople are looking for customisation in their lives.\u201d",
      "Glasst is just one of many firms that claim house paint can do more than look nice. Various products now on the market, their makers promise, will save you money, keep you comfortable during heatwaves, or transform your relationship with the walls of your home. But is it all too good to be true?",
      "Unpaint is due to launch in the US this November, and Mr Botero is convinced that there is a market for the stuff. He argues it will appeal to people living in rented accommodation, who can\u2019t make permanent changes to their decor.",
      "Glasst, unsurprisingly, declines to share details about how it makes the paint, but Mr Botero says it is a resin from a renewable source. I ask if he means trees and he confirms.",
      "Peelable paint already exists for car bodywork, but getting such a product to work reliably on softer home interiors is more challenging.",
      "There is a risk of damaging your existing, underlying paint when you eventually wrest Unpaint off your walls, but, if the permanent paint below is in good condition, this shouldn\u2019t happen, says Mr Botero.",
      "It does have an odd texture: \u201cA little bit rubbery,\" says Mr Botero. Plus, it is easier to scratch than water-based emulsion.",
      "Bringing the product to market hasn\u2019t been easy. Glasst posted a video about the paint to YouTube two years ago, but the launch was delayed until this year \u201cto align with the correct funding and resources needed,\u201d says Mr Botero.",
      "He mentions that Glasst is working on other coatings with unusual properties \u2013 including \u201cThermglasst\u201d, an insulating resin due to launch next year. Mr Botero claims that less than a millimetre of this coating will provide the same insulating effect as 40 millimetres of foam.",
      "There\u2019s no independent validation of that claim just yet, but there are already a range of insulating paints on the market that promise to reduce your heating bills and, it is fair to note, they have not always performed well in scientific evaluations.",
      "In 2019, Richard Fitton of the University of Salford and colleagues published a paper in which they investigated the efficacy of six thermal paints available on the UK market at the time. In short, they found that claims that such paints could reduce heating bills by up to 20% or 25% were impossible to validate.",
      "First, the researchers coated boards with the paints, which allowed them to measure the coatings\u2019 thermal resistance, or insulating values. Then, the team calculated the reduction in heating costs you would expect after applying each of these paints to the interior of a typical Victorian terraced house.",
      "The biggest cost saving measured was a mere 2.9%, and, given the price of the paints in question, homeowners would potentially have to wait centuries or even up to a millennium \u2013 at 2019 prices \u2013 before they would recoup the decorating fees in terms of reduced heating costs.",
      "\u201cIf someone brought me a paint that could save me 25% of my energy bill, it would be on my wall by the weekend,\u201d says Prof Fitton. He adds that he is currently working on a follow-up paper to the 2019 study, and would also be open to testing Thermglasst, or any other insulating paint, in the future.",
      "Paints that help to keep your house cool might be more effective. For years, researchers have pursued the idea of improving the reflectivity of paint on exterior walls or roofs, since this could help keep buildings cool on hot, sunny days. Such weather is becoming ever more common due to climate change.",
      "The principle is as old as the hills \u2013 consider the white painted houses of the Mediterranean. But paints designed to be significantly more reflective than standard white paint could heighten the effect. i2Cool in Hong Kong is one of several firms marketing such a product at present.",
      "In their case, the paint contains tiny nanoparticles inspired by the extremely reflective body of the Saharan silver ant \u2013 which must naturally cope with baking sunshine.",
      "Martin Zhu, chief executive and co-founder, says the paint made by i2Cool was tested on the roof of a shopping mall in Hong Kong \u2013 but only on one of its two buildings, in order to find out whether there was a noticeable effect in terms of reducing the costs of running that building\u2019s air conditioning (AC).",
      "\u201cWe used a power meter to measure the energy consumption of the AC system,\u201d says Dr Zhu. The cost of running the AC duly fell in the painted building, by 40%, he adds.",
      "Dr Zhu first began working on the paint while a doctoral student, and he mentions that early versions made around 2017 contained silver, which made it very expensive \u2013 more than $100,000 just to cover a small area. Years of development later, it now costs around $10 per square metre of coverage. It also now comes in a variety of light colours, including grey, yellow and green.",
      "Researchers have noted that highly reflective coatings for passive cooling applications need to be resistant to dirt and soiling, for example, to avoid their efficacy dropping overt time. And glare from ultra-reflective roofs risks heating up nearby darker structures, a 2020 paper suggested.",
      "The paint from i2Cool does not contain heavy metals and uses a water-based emulsion, and while it is not biodegradable, it can be recycled, says Dr Zhu.",
      "The company\u2019s latest major project is the Dubai Mall. The roof of this sprawling complex \u2013 the largest mall in the world by total area \u2013 will eventually be fully coated with the paint. A 1,000 sq m section has been completed to date.",
      "While not yet available in Europe, that could change, says Dr Zhu. \u201cWe are discussing with some distributors in the UK,\u201d he says.",

      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",

      "Around 3,000 children are adopted in England each year. It\u2019s a process that must be authorised by judges in family courts, who set out the level of contact the child will have with their birth parents - usually just letters, sent twice a year, via an intermediary.",

      "UK students will pay more for university in England next year, as undergraduate tuition fees rise to \u00a39,535 a year.",
      "It is an increase of \u00a3285 on the fees, which have been frozen at a maximum of \u00a39,250 since 2017.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told MPs in Parliament on Monday that maintenance loans would also go up to help students manage the cost of living.",
      "The National Union of Students called the tuition fees rise a \"sticking plaster\", but said higher maintenance loans \"will make a real difference to the poorest students\".",
      "For universities, the higher fees are a cash injection to assist with their most immediate financial challenges.",
      "However, the announcement only affects fees and loans in the 2025/26 academic year \u2013 and vice-chancellors will want to know what the government\u2019s plans are beyond that.",
      "Phillipson said the government would announce further \"major reform\" for long-term investment in universities in the coming months.",
      "She said the government was having to \"take the tough decisions needed to put universities on a firmer financial footing\".",
      "But she told the BBC they would also be \"demanding more of universities\", and looking at things like how much top bosses are paid, in order to \"drive better value for students and for the taxpayer\".",

      "But in 2023, he said Labour was \"likely to move on\" from the pledge. In this year's general election campaign, he confirmed he would be doing so as he wanted to prioritise spending on the NHS.",
      "In the Commons on Monday, Conservative shadow education secretary Laura Trott called the tuition fee rise \u201ca hike in the effective tax graduates have to pay\u201d.",
      "Next year both tuition fees and maintenance loans will be linked to a measure of inflation called RPIX, which counts the cost of everything except mortgage interest costs.",
      "It is currently set at 3.1%.",
      "That will increase maintenance loan caps from \u00a310,227 to \u00a310,544 for students living away from their parents outside of London, and from \u00a313,348 to \u00a313,762 in London.",
      "Maintenance grants, which were non-repayable, were scrapped in 2016.",
      "In their analysis of the changes, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the tuition fees increase would spare universities a further real-terms cut to their teaching resources.",
      "But they urged the government to say whether fees would continue to increase after next year, \"to provide some certainty to universities and prospective students alike\".",
      "They also said that, under current repayment terms, around a quarter of the extended loans would eventually be written off and paid by the taxpayer.",
      "Although students taking out the highest possible maintenance loans would be getting more money next year, the IFS said they would still be borrowing 9% less in real terms than they would have done in 2020/21.",
      "The changes announced on Monday will affect students starting university next year, as well as current students - although universities can have contracts that protect their students from fee hikes part-way through a course.",
      "Students Shay and Zay, both in their first year studying product design at Manchester Metropolitan University, said higher fees could put off prospective students.",
      "Zay said tuition fees were \"already quite a big factor playing on a lot of people's minds\" when deciding whether to go to university.",
      "Shay said university was \"already expensive as it is\", but added that he was more worried about his maintenance money being able to cover the cost of living.",
      "Personal finance expert Martin Lewis has said the tuition fee changes are \"likely to be trivial\", especially compared with students who started university in 2023.",
      "Last year, loan terms were increased from 30 to 40 years and repayment threshold salaries were dropped from \u00a327,295 to \u00a325,000, meaning more graduates would be repaying their loans for longer.",
      "Tom Allingham, from the Save the Student money advice website, said that despite their \"dismay\" at the increase in fees, it would make \"little difference to overall levels of student debt, and will have no impact whatsoever on the amount a graduate repays each month\".",
      "That sentiment was reflected by sixth formers in Oldham considering their university choices for next year.",
      "Niamh, who wants to study English literature, said tuition fees were not rising by a \"huge amount\", but that maintenance loan increases were \"definitely needed\" to support students.",

      "She said the freeze had been \"completely unsustainable for both students and universities\".",
      "But Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said raising tuition fees was \"economically and morally wrong\" and that the government was \"taking more money from debt-ridden students\" to support universities.",
      "The changes come after growing concerns about the state of university finances in the UK.",

      "But they also acknowledged that asking for that amount would seem \"clueless\" and \"out of touch\".",
      "The government hopes that increasing maintenance support will help students with day-to-day living costs like food and accommodation.",
      "But higher tuition fees and increased maintenance loans will mean students need to borrow more to go to university, and will leave with more debt.",

      "He also played with Billie Holiday at 14, and got taken under the wings of bandleader Count Basie and trumpeter Clark Terry. He went on to accompany Dizzy Gillespie and appeared in the band during Elvis Presley's first TV appearance.",
      "After showing a talent for arranging songs while touring the world with Lionel Hampton's big band, he was soon in demand in that capacity, too.",
      "But after running up a $145,000 debt on a European tour, he took a day job with Mercury Records in 1961, becoming the first African-American vice-president of a major record label.",
      "While there, he discovered and produced the million-selling single It's My Party by Lesley Gore. He also released the Big Band Bossa Nova compilation album, which included his own infectious track Soul Bossa Nova, which has since become a staple of parties and film soundtracks, including Austin Powers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sinatra had been impressed with Jones's work and called on him to arrange and conduct two of his albums in the 1960s. The pair formed a fertile partnership, with Sinatra calling him \"a giant\" and \"one of the finest musicians I've ever known\".",
      "The pair became firm friends outside the studio, too. \"Seven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying,\" Jones recalled.",
      "Jones also worked with many other big names of the age, including Aretha Franklin, Louis Armstrong and Sammy Davis Jr, while his solo album Body Heat reached the US top 10.",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "Quincy Jones, giant of US music, has died aged 91",
      "Meanwhile, he was forging a career writing soundtracks for TV shows and films including In Cold Blood, The Italian Job and Roots.",
      "In Cold Blood's author Truman Capote reportedly tried to have Jones removed from the film because he was black. But he remained, and the score earned Jones the first of seven Oscar nominations.",
      "Another soundtrack was The Wiz, the 1978 film musical version of the Wizard of Oz, which starred Diana Ross and a 19-year-old Michael Jackson, who was looking to branch out after finding childhood fame in The Jackson 5.",
      "Jones saw a superstar quality in Jackson and became his producer and mentor, first on 1979's Off the Wall, which was a major hit, and then 1982's Thriller, which reached new heights of commercial and critical success, and made Jackson the undisputed King of Pop.",
      "The album was not just the fulfilment of Jackson's talent, but the culmination of Jones's career, as he used his peerless musical expertise to define the 1980s with a sleek and polished fusion of R&B and pop.",
      "Jones listened to hundreds of songs to decide which nine should go on the album, and employed a dream team of musicians and songwriters that he had been assembling over the years.",
      "His choice of collaborators was one example of his knack for knowing how to make a good song great. For Beat It, he thought the single needed a rockier edge, so he recruited Eddie Van Halen to contribute a guitar solo. Legend has it that the solo was so explosive that a speaker caught fire in the studio.",
      "And when it came to the title track, Jones didn't like the original name Starlight, so he asked its writer, Rod Temperton, to come up with something different. Temperton renamed it Thriller and recast it with a spooky theme. Jones topped it off by asking his wife's friend, horror actor Vincent Price, to record a spoken-word outro.",
      "The album earned Jones and Jackson the Grammy Award for producer of the year, while Thriller was named album of the year and Beat It won record of the year.",
      "Jones used his winning formula in the 1980s with George Benson, Donna Summer and Patti Austin, and produced the decade's best-selling single when Jackson and Lionel Richie assembled 35 of America's biggest names for the 1985 charity song We Are the World.",
      "Jones famously posted a message on the studio entrance telling the stars: \"Check your egos at the door\".",
      "He had further success under his own name with his albums The Dude and Back on the Block. The latter, released in 1989, featured an all-star cast including many friends from his early career like Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Ray Charles.",
      "But as well as revisiting his past, he was also firmly in the present, enlisting rappers like Ice-T and Grandmaster Melle Mel to appear on the title track.",
      "It earned Jones another album of the year award at the Grammys.",
      "Although he was in his 50s, he embraced rap music because he saw similarities with the energy of bebop jazz, and because may of its stars had risen out of hardship on the streets.",
      "\"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "And rap stars reciprocated his affection, looking on Jones as an inspirational elder statesman of black American music. Even Kendrick and Dr Dre were awestruck when meeting him for the Netflix documentary, which was titled Quincy and directed by his daughter, actress Rashida Jones.",
      "Jones used his status to try to stem the violence in the hip-hop world, convening the Quincy Jones Hip-Hop Symposium in 1995, where he addressed a room full of the nation's rap stars.",
      "\"I want to see you guys live at least to my age,\" he told them.",
      "For Jones, social activism went hand-in-hand with his music.",
      "He met Martin Luther King in 1955, and \"from then on, my life was never the same\", he said.",
      "\"Civil rights work and political involvement was no longer an activity to do on the side. It became an essential part of life and humanity.\"",
      "He set up the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation and launched the We Are the Future project, among support for other causes.",
      "Elsewhere, his redoubtable work ethic saw him launch a record label and hip-hop magazine Vibe, as well as producing films like The Color Purple and TV shows including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.",
      "With that workload, and an accompanying longstanding drink problem, his family life and his health both suffered.",
      "He married and divorced three times, having a nervous breakdown after splitting from third wife Peggy Lipton. To recover, he went to stay on the Pacific island owned by actor Marlon Brando, whom he first met in a jazz club at the age of 18.",
      "Jones was also in a relationship with actress and model Nastassja Kinski in the 1990s, and he had seven children in total.",
      "In 2015, he went into a diabetic coma for four days, and the following year went to hospital with a blood clot.",
      "His death on Sunday at the age of 91 has left the music world in mourning.",
      "If there's to be a second Quincy Jones memorial concert, stars will be queuing up to celebrate the full achievements of a singular talent."

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:20:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The musician, who has died aged 91, was one of the most consequential producers in jazz and pop.",
    "story": [
      "\"Music is sacred to me,\" Quincy Jones once said. \"Melody is God's voice.\"",
      "He certainly had the divine touch.",
      "Jones, who has died at the age of 91, was the right-hand man to both Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, and helped to shape the sound of jazz and pop over more than 60 years.",
      "His recordings revolutionised music by crossing genres, promoting unlikely collaborations and shaping modern production techniques.",
      "Here are 10 songs that showcase his versatility and brilliance in the studio, and his ability to draw the best out of the musicians he worked with.",
      "1) Michael Jackson - Billie Jean",
      "Michael Jackson met Quincy Jones on the set of the 1978 movie The Wiz, and asked him to produce his next album. That record was Off The Wall - a disco extravaganza that established Jackson as a solo star.",
      "They teamed up again for 1982's Thriller, which arguably remade the pop business. Not only did it produce seven top 10 singles; but it crossed racial barriers, appealing equally to black and white audiences.",
      "Key to the success was Billie Jean, a dark tale about the groupies Jackson met while touring with his brothers. As a producer, Jones wasn't keen on the track at first - arguing with Jackson about the long instrumental opening.",
      "\"I said, \u2018Michael we\u2019ve got to cut that intro,\u2019\u201d he later recalled.",
      "\"He said, \u2018But that\u2019s the jelly! That\u2019s what makes me want to dance.' And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That\u2019s what makes me want to dance,' well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\"",
      "With those words ringing in his ears, Jones kept the arrangement lean and funky. He even instructed sound engineer Bruce Swedien to create a drum sound with a \"sonic personality\" that no-one had ever heard before. The result is one of the most recognisable intros in the history of pop.",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "2) Frank Sinatra - Come Fly With Me (Live at The Sands)",
      "\"The friendship was so strong. You can't describe it,\" said Jones of his partnership with Frank Sinatra - which extended far beyond the recording studio.",
      "\u201cSeven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying.\"",
      "After establishing their relationship on 1964's It Might As Well Be Swing, Jones helped Sinatra re-arrange his signature songs for a four-week residency at the Copa Room in The Sands hotel, Las Vegas.",
      "\"It was probably the most exciting engagement I have ever done in my life, since I started performing,\" Sinatra later recalled.",
      "Accompanied by the Count Basie Orchestra, the star sounds perfectly at ease, breezing around standards like I've Got You Under My Skin, Fly Me To The Moon and You Make Me Feel So Young.",
      "But it's Come Fly With Me that most perfectly captures the vitality of Jones's new arrangements, especially in the charismatic interplay between Sinatra and the brass section.",
      "No wonder that it was chosen as the show's opening number - as captured on the award-winning live album, Sinatra At The Sands.",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "3) Lesley Gore - It's My Party",
      "Lesley Gore was just a teenager when her vocal demos made their way into Quincy Jones's hands in the early 1960s. Up to that point, he'd been working with jazz singers like Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan - but he heard something he liked on Gore's tape.",
      "\"She had a mellow, distinctive voice and sang in tune, which a lot of grown up rock \u2018n\u2019 roll singers couldn\u2019t do, so I signed her,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography.",
      "For their first session, Jones picked It's My Party out of a pile of 200 demos and got to work. He double-tracked Gore's voice, adding little flourishes of brass and unexpected chord changes that perfectly evoke the song's adolescent angst.",
      "He then rush-released the single, after discovering that Phil Spector had plans to record the same song with the Crystals. It duly topped the US charts and went to number nine in the UK.",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "4) Quincy Jones - Summer In The City",
      "Recorded by The Lovin' Spoonful, Summer In The City is a 1960s rock classic, full of ominous organ chords and powerful drum hits that capture the sticky filth of an oppressive heatwave.",
      "Quincy Jones version, recorded for his 1973 album You've Got It Bad Girl, is almost unrecognisable as the same song. Lazily chilled-out, the Hammond organ is played with a featherlight touch, and the drums are gently brushed.",
      "Most of the lyrics are excised and, when they arrive at the 2'30\" mark, they're sung with almost heavenly serenity by Valerie Simpson (of Ashford and Simpson fame).",
      "Originally released as a b-side, it's become one of Jones's most influential songs. According to WhoSampled.com, it's been sampled on 87 other songs, including tracks by Massive Attack, Eminem, Nightmares on Wax and The Roots.",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "5) Dinah Washington - Mad About The Boy",
      "Another example of how Jones's skill as an arranger could completely change a song.",
      "Mad About The Boy was written by Sir No\u00ebl Coward, for the 1932 revue Words and Music. In the original, it was sung by four different women, each expressing their love for an unnamed film star (rumoured to be Douglas Fairbanks Jr) as they wait in line to see one of his films.",
      "It's funny and quirky and clever - but when Dinah Washington covered the song in 1961, Jones slowed it down and switched the time signature from 4/4 to 6/8, allowing the singer to prowl through the lyrics with a newfound carnality.",
      "Overlooked at the time, it gained a new lease of life in 1992 when it was used to soundtrack a Levis advert and crept into the UK charts for the first time.",

      "6) Quincy Jones - Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Written in just 20 minutes, Soul Bossa Nova was inspired by an early-60s fad for Brazilian music, sparked by the success of Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and Stan Getz's Desafinado.",
      "Jones is in his element here - with chirruping flutes and big trombone slides that capture the joie de vivre of the carnival. He also makes prominent use of a cu\u00edca, the Brazilian drum that produces what sounds like a very happy monkey in the opening bars.",
      "The bossa craze may have been short-lived, but Jones's song endured, most memorably in the opening dance sequence of Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery.",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "7) Michael Jackson - Beat It",
      "From the beginning, Jones and Jackson planned to make Thriller a blockbuster pop album.",
      "\"We went through 800 songs to get to nine,\" Jones said. \"That's not casual.\"",
      "The work was exhausting. At one point, they were working in three studios simultaneously... until the speakers caught fire.",
      "Beat It was crucial to the project - because it was designed to get Jackson played on US rock radio, an unheard of prospect in the heavily segregated music industry of the 1980s.",
      "Jones had told Jackson to write \"a black version\" of The Knack's My Sharona - the 1979 hit song that sold more then 10 million copies. But Jackson was one step ahead. He had a demo that fitted the bill, albeit without a hook or lyrics.",
      "While Jackson worked on those elements (you can hear his first, wordless attempt at the melody on his YouTube channel), Jones called on Eddie Van Halen to perform the guitar solo.",
      "\"He came in and he stacked up his Gibson [guitars],\" Jones later recalled.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm not going to sit here and try to tell you what to play... Let's try three or four takes. Some of it will be over-animated, some of it will be long, and we'll sculpt it.",
      "\"And he played his ass off.\"",
      "The song, with its West Side Story-inspired video, landed just as MTV took off, making Jackson a permanent fixture in living rooms across America.",
      "But for all the commercial focus of the Thriller project, Jones always maintained that the music came first.",
      "\"I've never, ever in my life done music for money or fame - because that's when God walks out of the room,\" he said.",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "8) The Brothers Johnson - Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Jones discovered guitarist George Johnson and bassist Louis Johnson when he heard them playing on a demo by Chaka Khan's sister, Taka Boom.",
      "He hired them to play on the soundtrack for the celebrated TV mini-series Roots, placed them in his touring band, and helmed their 1976 debut album Look Out For #1 (including a sublime cover of The Beatles' Come Together).",
      "But the brothers didn't achieve mainstream success until 1977, with the release of Strawberry Letter #23.",
      "Originally recorded by Shuggie Otis, Jones's version toughens up the production, with a strutting bassline and soaring backing vocals - but George Johnson struggled to recreate Shuggie's original guitar solo, which was full of complicated triplet notes.",
      "Frustrated, Jones called up session musician Lee Ritenour for help.",
      "\"Quincy was walking down the hallway tearing his hair out,\" Ritenour later recalled. \"He said, 'I'm going to lunch, Ritenour. Get it done.'",
      "Released in the middle of the punk and disco boom, the song's romantic psychedelia still found an audience - reaching number 13 in the charts. It was later re-popularised by Quentin Tarantino in the film Jackie Brown.",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "9) Sarah Vaughan - Misty",
      "Early in his career, Jones was one of the most in-demand arrangers in jazz, working with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee.",
      "In 1958, he recorded an entire album with Sarah Vaughan in Paris, backed by a 55-piece orchestra. Among the highlights is the lovestruck ballad Misty - originally recorded by pianist Erroll Garner, and made famous by Johnny Mathis.",
      "Unlike their syrupy and sentimental versions, Vaughan and Jones (along with producer Jack Tracy) give the lyrics some pathos. She might be \"as helpless as a kitten up a tree\", but you're never entirely convinced she's happy about the situation.",
      "Jones adds beguiling touches - from the cascading strings when Vaughan sings \"a thousand violins begin to play\", to the beautifully muted saxophone line, played by Zoot Sims.",
      "Vaughan died of lung cancer in 1990. In 2019, on what would have been her 95th birthday, Jones posted a tribute to the singer, using his pet name for her - Sassy.",
      "\"Dear sweet Sassy was all about sophistication and chord changes and, man, I\u2019m telling you she thought like a horn and SANG like a horn!\" he wrote on Facebook..",
      "\"We had quite the journey together, & I will never forget each moment we had, because every moment was a special one.\"",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "10) USA For Africa - We Are The World",
      "\"Check your egos at the door,\" said the hand-written sign that Quincy Jones pinned to the door of his recording studio in 1985.",
      "The occasion was the recording of We Are The World - a star-studded charity single that aimed to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.",
      "Written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, the record featured vocals from Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen, Dionne Warwick and Bob Dylan, all recorded in a single night.",
      "Herding the singers was a massive headache, as the recent Netflix documentary The Greatest Night In Pop revealed.",
      "At one point, Stevie Wonder insisted that some of the lyrics should be rewritten in Swahili - despite the fact that the people of Ethiopia, who would be the main beneficiaries of the famine-relief fundraiser, largely speak other languages.",
      "Jones oversaw the whole session with the patience and wisdom of a producer who'd seen it all.",
      "The results aren't particularly great - the song is sickly and overlong - but the fact that it's coherent at all is a testament to his skill as a producer, arranger, mentor and referee.",
      "In the end, the song raised more than $63m ($227m or \u00a3178m adjusted for inflation); and Jones looked back on it as one of his proudest achievements.",
      "\u201cI have never before or since experienced the joy I felt that night working with this rich, complex human tapestry of love, talent, and grace,\" he wrote in his 2002 autobiography.",

      "He bounced around several agencies in the North West, gaining experience as a fledgling agent, building contacts and eventually he set up his own business.",
      "But others have called into question the credentials Jamie built his reputation on.",
      "Jamie reportedly claimed to have trained at the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and that he worked his way up at United Agents, a top London agency. He wrote in emails that he was a member of the Personal Managers\u2019 Association - which has a code of conduct for agents to observe.",
      "The BBC contacted all three of these organisations. They all said they had no record of him.",
      "Audition questions",
      "Several ex-clients have told the BBC Jamie sent them audition opportunities that were never intended for them.",
      "Layla Shirley from Birmingham signed with the agency in June 2022.",
      "Jamie sent her a promising self-tape opportunity, where actors are chosen by production companies to record their auditions at home. It was for an advert with a well-known burger chain - despite the fact she is vegan.",
      "The production company later confirmed they had no record of making this request for Layla.",
      "\u201cSo many times with self-tapes, you get them the night before, and you've got to drop everything or cancel your plans to learn the lines, which is a sacrifice we make\u2026 If you\u2019ve done all that for nothing, it really is a kick in the teeth.\u201d",
      "Frustrated, Layla began speaking about her experience with other former clients and Alexa Morden, host of The 98%, a podcast which explores the reality of work for jobbing actors.",
      "The most important thing Layla wanted to draw attention to though, was the operation of Jamie\u2019s agency for child actors, Luna Kids Casting.",
      "Kids agency",
      "Luna Kids Casting held auditions in April, July and October 2023, with pop-up banners in the Wigan studio suggesting children signed by Jamie went on to work for Cbeebies, Sky, Disney and Fox.",
      "Sarah Wilson\u2019s 10-year-old daughter was successful during busy auditions and a photoshoot day was scheduled for those children asked to join the books.",
      "Parents were asked to pay \u00a3180 in cash to Jamie's Mum on the reception desk.",
      "While this was \u201cincredibly expensive\u201d, Sarah says she felt reassured by the amount of paperwork requested prior to signing her daughter up.",
      "But costs kept mounting. They included a \u00a366 charge for a child\u2019s details and images to be uploaded to the agency\u2019s website and a fee of \u00a3120 to sign them up to Spotlight, a platform where actors are submitted for jobs.",
      "Agreements also outline a monthly fee of \u00a314.40. These charges were described as non-refundable.",
      "According to the Agents of Young Performers Association, upfront fees should only be charged 30 days after a client and agency has entered into a contract.",
      "Sarah says she later discovered a fake credit added to her daughter\u2019s Spotlight profile. It said she had taken part in a stage production called As It Was, with Jamie\u2019s partner listed as the director.",
      "The BBC has searched for this production online and has found no record of its existence.",
      "Despite paying just under \u00a3500 to Luna Kids Casting, Sarah says only one audition opportunity was sent to them. She moved her daughter to another agency.",
      "\u201cIt wasted a year of opportunity [and] it raised her hopes, a little girl\u2019s dreams.\u201d",
      "Fake charity claims",
      "Jamie was not only running talent agencies, but a sister company called Access Workshops providing training for actors.",
      "When actors signed up to Bodhi, their welcome emails stated it was mandatory to attend sessions by Access Workshops.",
      "The workshops cost between \u00a355 and \u00a360 and involved actors learning scripts and performing in front of top industry professionals.",
      "Attendees say Jamie would begin by giving a talk, where he would mention a portion of the fee would be donated to charity, with the logos of Mind, Rainbow Railroad and the Oddballs Foundation visible in photos of the sessions posted on social media.",

      "But it told the BBC it was made aware Jamie has no assets, and none are held by the company.",
      "In a statement, Equity said: \u201cHaving taken legal advice, we have been told that there is no prospect of monies being returned to creditors and that they do not expect to be making any payments at all.",
      "\u201cThis outcome is hugely disappointing. Mr Fisher and his rogue agency have treated its clients appallingly, leading to the loss of significant amounts of money owed to them.\u201d",
      "Others have questioned the role of the platform Spotlight. In 2019, former employers warned Spotlight alleging that Jamie was submitting fake credits for his own clients, as well as \u201cconcocting\u201d productions that never existed.",
      "They claimed his \u201cconsistent fabrications\u201d could cause damage to the industry, but said they heard little back.",
      "In response, Spotlight told the BBC it was provided with verified references from casting professionals who had been positive about their business dealings with Jamie Fisher.",
      "It also said it had \u201cactively supported affected individuals during the agency's closure by offering one-to-one assistance and guiding them on how to address their concerns, including directing them to Equity and the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate (EASI)\u201d.",
      "While it does not regulate talent agencies, Spotlight says it can \u201cremove their services for misuse of our platform or for breaching our terms and conditions\u201d.",
      "The #BodhiGate scandal, first reported by Deadline, has also generated discussion about the limited regulation of UK entertainment, in contrast with the US, where 22 states require an agency licence.",
      "\u201cWe see from the US that a structure is possible which can give consumers much more protection and ensure that unscrupulous agents aren't able to practice in this arena and make promises that they can't fulfil - alongside charging unfair fees,\u201d Christopher Gabbitas, a commercial lawyer working in the creative sector, told the BBC.",
      "He suggests that actors should look for established agencies, read any contracts carefully and speak to current clients if looking for representation.",
      "Alongside Equity, actors we spoke to said they were in the process of, or had, submitted reports to the EASI, the government-backed watchdog which polices UK employment agencies. It has the power to bar individuals from practicing.",
      "The BBC understands it is currently investigating complaints around Luna Kids Casting and the Bodhi Talent Agency.",
      "In the meantime, Thea and Jack have been left wondering if they will ever see any of the money they say they are owed.",

      "Patients aged 70 to 75 were to be automatically assigned four points, while those aged over 80 would receive six.",
      "Extra points would be added for chronic conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes.",
      "People who were terminally ill, with a life expectancy of less than six months, would automatically be given nine points.",

    "story": [
      "Health assessment body NICE has stressed to GPs hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be offered as the first treatment option to ease menopause symptoms.",
      "In its updated guidance, the use of talking therapy is set out as an additional method of help.",
      "After a detailed analysis of data on links between HRT and conditions such as heart disease, stroke, some cancers and dementia, NICE concluded HRT does not affect life expectancy.",
      "The guidance includes a new discussion aid to help GPs give patients the most useful information they can about the HRT drugs and what they do.",
      "HRT replaces the hormones oestrogen or progestogen, or both, when women's periods stop - normally between the ages of 45 and 55.",
      "It is administered using gels, creams, pessaries, tablets, patches or sprays and is sometimes prescribed during perimenopause, as the hormones start to fluctuate but before menstruation stops altogether.",

      "The guidance is clear that HRT is the go-to treatment option for hot flushes and night sweats caused by the menopause.",
      "Talking therapy known as CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) is to be offered to women over 40 alongside HRT or, if the patient's individual circumstances call for it, in place of it.",
      "That is a change from draft guidelines, published in late 2023, which caused controversy by suggesting that talking therapy could replace HRT as a treatment.",
      "The level of feedback received by NICE on that point led to a longer than usual delay in issuing the final guidance.",
      "The document highlights that while there are some increased risks linked to taking HRT, it is unlikely to lengthen or shorten overall life expectancy.",
      "Easy-to-read illustrations of the likelihood of developing certain health conditions are featured. These are intended to help GPs have informed conversations with patients.",
      "Dr Marie Anne Ledingham, consultant clinical adviser to NICE, explained that an independent panel assessed available scientific evidence to come up with the information.",
      "She said the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and ovarian and endometrial cancer was no higher among women aged 45 and over taking combined HRT, compared to those who had never taken it.",
      "And HRT actually reduced the risk of fractures linked to the bone condition osteoporosis, which is more likely to develop after the menopause.",
      "But the risk of breast cancer for women did rise slightly, affecting:",

      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",

      "Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.",
      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",
      "\"I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,\" he told reporters on Thursday.",

      "Officers can currently use cells as a \"place of safety\" for up to 24 hours to allow those needing immediate care to be assessed by a doctor.",
      "New legislation will also introduce additional rights for those receiving treatment, in a bid to modernise decades-old mental health laws.",
      "Charities have broadly welcomed the changes, whilst highlighting the need for better funding for mental health.",

      "People can be detained under the Mental Health Act - or sectioned - for their own safety, or the safety of others.",
      "Fully banning the use of police cells during detention was first proposed in draft legislation published under Boris Johnson's government, following a wide-ranging review of mental health laws published in 2018.",
      "But although that draft law underwent extensive scrutiny by MPs, it was not introduced to Parliament by the time of July's election.",
      "Under the current law, people who police believe are suffering from a mental disorder and are in \"immediate need of care or control\" can be detained so that they can be examined for possible treatment.",
      "Last year 34,685 people were detained under these circumstances, the majority to health settings such as a hospital A&E department.",
      "Some 314 detentions - around 1% - were to a police cell, with the proportion falling from around 4% in 2017, when restrictions on their use were tightened.",
      "Those detained in a police cell can typically only be held for 24 hours and must be assessed by a social worker and doctor during that time.",
      "A cross-party committee of MPs scrutinising the previous proposals had welcomed the ban on their use, but had called for an increase in appropriate places to detain people in healthcare settings alongside the change.",
      "Detention limits",
      "Labour had pledged to reform mental health legislation in its election manifesto -  branding existing laws, drawn up in the 1980s, as \"woefully out of date\".",
      "It had argued the current system discriminates against black people - who are more likely to be detained, according to official statistics - and had also criticised how the system treated autistic people and people with learning disabilities.",
      "Its new Mental Health Bill, to be published on Wednesday, will introduce a 28-day limit on how long autistic people and people with learning disabilities can be detained, unless they have a co-occurring mental health condition.",
      "It will also give people enhanced rights to select a person to represent their interests, and introduce additional requirements on clinicians to consult with people close to patients about their care.",
      "The rules on granting community treatment orders, which impose certain monitoring conditions on detained people discharged from hospital, are also expected to be changed.",
      "The health department said their use would be made more \"proportionate\", although it did not offer details.",
      "'Human rights scandal'",
      "The bill is set to largely mirror proposals included in the draft Tory law, including raising the threshold to detain people, and requiring that there is a realistic prospect that suggested treatment would have a therapeutic benefit.",
      "One area where it is expected to differ is in granting patients the right to draw up a document setting out their treatment preferences if they become unwell.",
      "The Conservative government had rejected making this a legal right, arguing that its preference was to retain flexibility in the system and it did not want to create a hierarchy of different documents.",
      "Labour has previously said the changes in the bill would take a number of years to implement fully, to give time to \"recruit and train more clinical and judicial staff\".",
      "The National Autistic Society said it welcomed the bill as a chance to end the \"human rights scandal\" of inappropriate detention.",
      "Mental health charity Mind also said the bill would move England and Wales a \"step closer to a more progressive mental health system,\" whilst adding that \"proper funding\" would be required to ease the \"mental health emergency\"."

      "Prof Miles said the OBR estimated employers would only take around a quarter of the hit from the NI changes in terms of lower profits, and suggested that the rest would be felt by workers.",

      "It did not model the impact of its blueprint on consumer bills \"given the heavy dependence on policy choices\".",
      "But the report predicts wholesale energy prices are likely to fall with decreased reliance on gas, which often spikes unpredictably.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:05:01 GMT",
    "summary": "David Lammy is on his first visit to the continent since he became foreign secretary.",
    "story": [
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy is coming to the end of his maiden tour of Africa with the aim of resetting relations with the 54-nation continent.",
      "\"Our new approach will deliver respectful partnerships that listen rather than tell, deliver long-term growth rather than short-term solutions and build a freer, safer, more prosperous continent,\" he said as he set out the agenda for his trip to the continent's two biggest powers - Nigeria and South Africa.",
      "Lammy's visit follows his appointment as foreign secretary in the Labour government that took office earlier this year.",
      "Since Labour was last in office in 2010, relations between African states and other world powers have changed massively.",
      "Today, China is the largest trade partner for many African countries, while Russia has increasingly made inroads, including by offering military support to West African states battling jihadists.",
      "Oil-rich Gulf nations, along with Turkey,  have also been increasing their influence on the continent by striking business and military deals.",
      "In contrast, UK-Africa relations have been \"a lot more lacklustre\", says Alex Vines, the head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "This is particularly the case between the UK and its  biggest trading partner on the continent, South Africa, and the trip is an \"attempt to reboot that\", he adds.",
      "\"I want to hear what our African partners need and foster relationships so that the UK and our friends and partners in Africa can grow together,\" Lammy said.",
      "Britain is no newcomer to the continent. A long \u2013 and at times chequered \u2013 history underpins many of its relationships with African countries.",
      "Almost all its former colonies on the continent are part of the Commonwealth, although countries that did not have this historical link to the UK have joined the group, including Rwanda, Togo and Gabon. Angola has also applied to join.",
      "\"The Commonwealth will likely continue to be a key platform,\" says Nicole Beardsworth, an academic at South Africa's Wits University.",
      "As its former colonies gained independence in the middle of the last century, Britain continued to play a sort of \"big brother\" role.",
      "But this is now changing.",
      "Dr Vines says Africa did not feature significantly in a major document released last year to outline the UK's priorities on the global stage.",
      "\"There were name checks to countries like Nigeria and South Africa and Kenya in it, but there wasn't much written,\" he says.",
      "Dr Vines adds that he expects South Africa-UK relations to improve under Labour because of its historic ties with the anti-apartheid movement that fought white-minority rule.",
      "\"That comes from the anti-apartheid struggle and the solidarity that Labour and people that were the Labour movement provided for combating apartheid,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth, however, notes that former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May tried to bolster ties with Africa, but her efforts were \"scuppered\" after she resigned in 2019 following turmoil in the then governing party.",
      "The UK then had an unprecedented turnover of prime ministers who had to deal with domestic crises, the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, and the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"Africa fell off the radar,\" Dr Beardsworth says, adding that the exception was the controversial, and now-scrapped, deal to send some asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda.",
      "Being the world\u2019s youngest continent \u2013 with a median age of 19 \u2013 Africa presents opportunities for the future, the UK Foreign Office said.",
      "\"Africa has huge growth potential, with the continent on track to make up 25% of the world\u2019s population by 2050,\" read a statement from the office.",
      "With an ageing population in the UK - as with much of the developed world - Dr Vines says that the sharing of skills will increase.",
      "He adds that migration is an \"emotive and complicated issue\", but the UK and other Western nations should avoid \"cherry-picking the best and corroding African states from being successful themselves\".",
      "The UK Foreign Office said that \"growth is the core mission of this government and will underpin our relationships in Nigeria, South Africa and beyond\".",
      "That will mean \"more jobs and more opportunities for Brits and Africans alike,\" it added.",
      "The UK's Africa policy has long focused on development aid, but this has been slashed in recent years as the country faces its own economic crisis.",
      "Dr Vines says aid can be important to deal with humanitarian crises, climate shocks and to finance projects aimed at expanding the private sector in Africa, but he does not see the Labour government increasing funding.",
      "\"When you had a previous Labour government under Tony Blair, Britain saw itself as a global superpower for international development - that\u2019s no longer the case,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth says relations are expected to move towards being more economically focused, and \"much more mutually beneficial\".",
      "She says this could also see the normalisation of the UK's relations with Zimbabwe and Harare being welcomed back to the Commonwealth after relations broke down during the rule of the late Robert Mugabe.",
      "Differences over international affairs such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could also play out less in the public.",
      "South Africa\u2019s position on both conflicts has been at odds with much of the West.",
      "But South African analyst Yanga Molotana does not see this as a major problem.",
      "\"Two things can exist at the same time - I can still hold my position, I can still hold my views, and we can still have a mutually beneficial relationship without the moral pressure of you saying that I have to agree with everything that you say,\" she adds.",
      "Dr Vines agrees, saying he expects the UK to continue promoting multi-party democracy in Africa, but there will be \"less finger-wagging, and more quiet diplomacy\".",
      "\"The concern is probably going to be more regularly raised in private,\" he says.",

    "published": "Sat, 02 Nov 2024 15:21:21 GMT",
    "summary": "With the government announcing big spending and tax, the differences between the two main parties feel sharper, writes Laura Kuenssberg.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like week zero,\u201d a government insider suggests. A new Conservative leader today. A whopper of a Budget on Wednesday.",
      "Add those two events together and it feels like this is the week that everything changed \u2013 the clock restarts.",
      "The tramlines are now set for the battles ahead, a member of the cabinet tells me. A Labour government that\u2019s now unabashed in the big choices it\u2019s made, the winners and losers they\u2019ve picked.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative boss, is unashamed in saying what the softer fringes of the Tory party has felt squeamish about until now.",
      "And maybe we\u2019ve entered a new era when the fabled centre ground of politics feels a bit emptier \u2013 and the differences between the two main parties are sharper.",
      "The consequences of the Budget are still emerging, and the real effect won\u2019t be clear for many months. There has been no huge unravelling, but ministers are still incredibly aware they\u2019ll still need to explain it.",
      "If your doorbell rings this afternoon and it\u2019s a grinning person with a red rosette and a leaflet, you\u2019ll know what they\u2019re up to.",
      "The party knows the decisions, particularly to whack billions on employers\u2019 national insurance, have caused some anxiety among some voters. This will also hit GP practices and charities, which have flagged fears about the cost of the change - and no government wants to go to war with them.",
      "No minister wants to have to defend a decision that looks to many voters and their rivals, like they were misled, after promises not to raise National Insurance in the election.",
      "The government rejects the charge - insisting they only promised to not raise the National Insurance paid by employees, rather than employers.",
      "But Labour is having to learn what it\u2019s like to take the flak. To wobble on the big decisions would be politically disastrous. And in Downing Street there\u2019s confidence the public is broadly onside.",
      "Insiders say No 10\u2019s focus groups - which have been asked about the Budget in the last few days - have understood the decisions, reporting some grumbles but not much sign of outrage.",
      "One government source says, \u201cpeople looked at the Budget and said, \u2018that makes sense\u2019. That is a platform we can build on.\u201d",
      "The decisions, and the government\u2019s true motivations \u2013 are out there now in black and white. The source says \u201cit\u2019s the first time \u2013 certainly in government, probably in the whole project \u2013 we have been able to show, rather than just tell.\u201d",
      "However, after all of Labour\u2019s schmoozing of the business world, and all their emphasis in the election of growing the economy, there\u2019s been some surprise that those arguments were a lot less prominent on Wednesday.",
      "Sources say phase one was concentrating on the public finances and public services, then the next part will be more emphasis on growth with a big speech from Rachel Reeves at the Mansion House in the City soon.",
      "How the Budget will affect you and your money",
      "Rachel Reeves doesn\u2019t mind if you don't like her Budget",
      "A senior business leader told me, \u201cthey\u2019ve done part one well, in a more traditional Labour way, but to get a real shape, they need a very strong part two... creating the vision, energy and specific incentives and plan for growth and wealth creation \u2013 that still needs work.\u201d",
      "On the other side, Labour\u2019s union backers are pleased with extra cash for some public services, and the tweaking of the borrowing rules so more money is available to spend on long-term projects.",
      "But there\u2019s concern, as one leader puts it, that the NI rise for employers will be \u201craised in every negotiating room\u201d, as an excuse for lowering wages. And unhappiness on the left about the two-child benefit cap, and the winter fuel allowance, remains - with a judicial review of the decision on those pensioner payments in the offing.",
      "But forget the inevitable skirmishes and stresses. The Budget has filled in many of the blanks about this government, answering part of that common question: what does Keir Starmer really stand for?",
      "And the response could almost be a line from a Gordon Brown Budget of days gone by \u2013 economic stability, more public spending, with schools and hospitals at the top of the list.",
      "Starmer\u2019s backers says the discipline on day-to-day spending - even cuts to some departments - makes it different to Labour Budgets of the past, claiming they have taken the Conservatives\u2019 mantle for being the party you can trust with public money.",
      "But no doubt the Budget illuminates the priorities of classic Labour instincts, not the mushy middle.",
      "A government source suggests none of it should really be a surprise.",
      "\u201cTraditional centre-left arguments were were all there in the election \u2013 ending non-doms, VAT on private schools - overall it passes the fairness test and that is the most important thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cLabour in its veins,\u201d says a cabinet minister. And in the next few weeks Labour will publish what\u2019s been described as a \u201cprogramme for government\u201d that will make it even more clear.",
      "New Conservative chapter",
      "The sharper shape makes life both easier and harder for the brand new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch.",
      "It\u2019s more straightforward perhaps if Labour\u2019s stripes are more red, the Tories can portray themselves a deeper blue.",
      "Kemi Badenoch has been deliberately light on policy, but her principles are clear. She believes in free markets and a smaller state. It\u2019s not going to be hard for her to draw a contrast to the government. \u201cIt\u2019s back to the future,\u201d one Tory source tells me.",
      "\u201cWe can go back to first principles, as we did in the 70s and the early 2000s,\u201d opposing bigger government and bigger taxes.",
      "Another senior party figure suggests the Budget has already sketched out an obvious path telling me, \u201cthe government has positioned itself as distinctly post-new Labour.",
      "\u201cIt is workerist, it\u2019s not very nice to farmers or rural areas \u2013 with pensioners and farmers you see that you have a coalition where the Tories can get back to 250 seats.\u201d",
      "Badenoch\u2019s backers are sure that she can satisfy the first task of opposition, getting noticed. Opposition parties don\u2019t have an automatic right to get attention.",
      "One supporter was convinced that \u201cwhatever happens, she will be an attention-gatherer.\u201d But Labour reckons their Budget choices have sent plenty of traps for the brand new leader.",
      "It might seem natural to the Tories to vote against the government\u2019s tax rises in the Budget. But it\u2019s a lot less comfortable to oppose extra cash for public services.",
      "It\u2019s one thing to stand against charging private schools VAT. But will the Conservatives oppose the new teachers for state schools the tax rise is meant to support? That is a far harder argument to make.",
      "Labour\u2019s decisions mean, despite Badenoch\u2019s broad-brush approach, the Tories are going to be expected to have something to say about schools and hospitals - services the public relies on.",
      "A senior Conservative figure warns that this week has \u201cset up a public services Parliament \u2026 you can\u2019t go through a sustained period of time when you just rely on the vibes.\u201d",
      "As Chris has written, the task for Badenoch is massive. Not just because of the July\u2019s battering that depleted their numbers so much, but because the Conservatives have been in the groove of attacking each other for many years now.",
      "The party is described by sources as \u201cfractious\u201d, and  \u201cdeeply sceptical\u201d. Getting rid of leaders became almost the norm.",
      "One of the contenders for the job joked when courting votes they\u2019d even been told by one former minister: \u201cI\u2019m more interested in the leadership race in two years time.\u201d",
      "Badenoch has won a clear mandate, but by a smaller margin than in races that have gone before.",
      "There is no doubt she is a politician that stands out, another Conservative says, referencing an old TV ad: \u201cShe has the potential to be Heineken \u2013 reaching the parts of the electorate other Tories cannot.\u201d",
      "But her style has risks - \u201clike a can of Heineken, if shaken up too much, it can froth everywhere,\u201d and make a terrible mess.",

      "Chris Mason: Badenoch will need all her political savvy to transform Tory fortunes",
      "A Labour government that has expressed its priorities with big borrowing, big spending and big tax that believes the public is on board, after years when Budgets at home and in Whitehall have been under so much pressure.",
      "And an opposition with a new leader who believes in something completely different. Don\u2019t forget of course the smaller parties, Reform, the Lib Dems, the SNP and Greens, have important roles too.",
      "But the contours of the central contest feel sharper now.",
      "For years politicians, whether Labour or Conservative, have liked to suggest that we can drift towards lower taxes and still have the kind of public services of countries where the government spends much more cash.",
      "Perhaps this week might mark the moment when our politicians stop telling us we can have it all.",
      "A former cabinet minister suggests now we\u2019ll be much less like \u2018the stepping stone\u2019 between America and the rest of Europe. Politics is an ever-shifting kaleidoscope but Labour\u2019s enormous Budget has set new terms.",

      "Like her political heroine Margaret Thatcher, Kemi Badenoch - who is the new Conservative leader - divides opinion even within her own party.",
      "Her robust views, \"anti-woke\" values and no-nonsense style have made her a darling of the Conservative right and the party's grassroots and they have chosen her over fellow right-winger Robert Jenrick.",
      "As the first black woman to lead a major UK political party she has made history, but she is no fan of identity politics and is not likely to make much of that as she sets to work on the formidable task of restoring her party's battered fortunes.",
      "The former business secretary's analysis of what went wrong for the Conservatives at the general election is that they \"talked right, but governed left\", and need to \"stop acting like Labour\" to win back power.",
      "It is a pledge she put at the heart of her Tory leadership campaign, which focused on changing the underlying mindset of the British state rather than setting out detailed policies.",
      "Born in Wimbledon in 1980, Olukemi Adegoke was one of three children of Nigerian parents. Her father worked as a GP and her mother was a physiology professor.",
      "Badenoch - she married banker Hamish Badenoch in 2012 and they have three children - grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, and in the United States where her mother lectured.",
      "She returned to the UK at the age of 16 to live with a friend of her mother because of the worsening political and economic situation in Nigeria, and studied for her A-levels at a college in south London while working in a McDonald's restaurant and elsewhere.",
      "After completing a degree in computer engineering at Sussex University, she worked in IT while also gaining a second degree in law.",
      "She then moved into finance, becoming an associate director of private bank  Coutts and later worked as the digital director of influential Conservative-supporting magazine The Spectator, a non-editorial role.",
      "According to Blue Ambition, a biography written by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, it was at Sussex University that Badenoch got a taste for right-wing politics - becoming \"radicalised\" by the left-wing campus culture, in the opposite direction.",

      "Badenoch and Jenrick wait for results of Tory leadership race",
      "Chris Mason: Challenges ahead for Kemi Badenoch",
      "Badenoch joined the Conservative Party in 2005 - aged 25 - and stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in 2010 and the London Assembly in 2012.",
      "When two Tory Assembly members, including Suella Braverman, were elected MPs in 2015, she took a vacant Assembly seat.",
      "She backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum before achieving her ambition of becoming an MP a year later, for the safe Conservative seat of Saffron Walden in Essex.",
      "Badenoch had spent three years bouncing around junior government roles when in 2022 she joined the rapid ministerial exodus which brought down Boris Johnson.",
      "To the surprise of many of her colleagues, Badenoch then joined the sprawling contest to succeed Johnson despite never having been in the cabinet.",
      "What began as a longshot campaign with the support mostly of loyal friends who also entered Parliament in 2017 quickly gained momentum, and heavyweight support in the form of Michael Gove.",
      "Badenoch ultimately came fourth with the backing of 59 MPs - more than the 42 MPs who were enough for her to finish top in the parliamentary stage of the current leadership election.",
      "Her direct approach, instructing her colleagues to \u201ctell the truth\u201d, won Badenoch a bigger role in the Conservative Party and it was inevitable that Liz Truss chose to appoint her to the cabinet - making her international trade secretary.",
      "Rishi Sunak retained her in post, adding the business and women and equalities briefs.",
      "Her time in Parliament has been characterised by her straightforwardness and willingness to engage in controversial issues.",
      "As a junior equalities minister under Johnson, she enraged many on the left when she challenged the notion there was widespread institutional racism in Britain.",
      "In an LBC interview, she said she had experienced prejudice only from left-wingers.",
      "\"I came to this country aged 16 and now I am standing for prime minister - isn't that amazing? I was born in this country but I didn't grow up here.",
      "\"I don't understand why people want to ignore all of the good things and only focus on the bad things, and use the bad things to tell the story,\" she added.",
      "She calls herself a gender-critical feminist, and has been an outspoken opponent of moves to allow self-certification of transgender identity.",
      "As the cabinet minister in charge of women and equalities, she spearheaded the UK government's blocking of Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform Bill.",
      "Responding to the Cass report on gender identity services in the NHS, she said they had been \"hijacked by ideologues\" while critics were \"gagged\", resulting in children being harmed.",
      "She has also opposed gender-neutral toilets.",
      "In 2021, members of the government's own LGBT+ advisory panel urged her to \"consider her position\" over the failure to deliver a manifesto pledge to ban so-called conversion therapy.",
      "Badenoch is often labelled a \"culture warrior\" but she disputes the tag.",

      "That is simultaneously what endears her to Conservative MPs and what makes some of them anxious.",
      "During the early stages of the leadership election several Conservative MPs told the BBC they were inclined to support Badenoch but were put off by fractious interactions while she was in government.",
      "To her supporters, that\u2019s the point: unlike other ministers she was willing to tell MPs what she believed and make the case for it forthrightly.",
      "On the eve of this year's party conference in Birmingham, she made headlines with a claim that not all cultures were \"equally valid\", citing as an example \"cultures where women are told that they should not work\".",
      "She also got attention in Birmingham for quipping that 5-10% of civil servants were so bad they should be in prison. She has previously strongly denied bullying officials.",
      "But she backtracked after an interview in which she appeared to suggest the current level of maternity pay was \"excessive\". She claimed her words had been \"misrepresented\", saying she had been talking about excessive business regulation and maternity pay was \"a good thing\".",

      "Appearing before a Commons committee, she told chair Caroline Nokes \"loads of people\" wanted to use equalities law as \"a tool for different personal agendas and interests\".",
      "During her leadership campaign, Badenoch has spoken of Conservatism being \"in crisis\" - under attack from a new \"progressive ideology\" involving \"identity politics\" (politics based on a particular identity such as race, religion or gender), constant state intervention, and \"the idea that bureaucrats make better decisions than individuals\" or elected politicians.",
      "Despite the Tories being in office for 14 years, she argues that increases in government regulations and public spending have crippled economic growth and polarised the country.",
      "She rejected Robert Jenrick's call for key party policies to be settled now, saying the UK's \"system is broken\" and requires a reset.",
      "The Conservative Party, she adds, needs to return to its core values and come up with new policies that recognise this reality."

    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 19:47:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Estimates of the number of farms affected range from 100 to 70,000.",
    "story": [
      "There has been an outcry from many farmers following the changes to inheritance tax for farms announced in the Budget.",
      "From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will have to pay inheritance tax at 20% - half the usual rate.",
      "We've seen a range of claims about how many farms will be affected.",
      "The largest estimate - 70,000 - relates to the total number that could ever be affected. But the number of farms likely to be impacted each year is likely to be around 500.",
      "Will 70,000 farms be affected?",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the government needed to \"listen to rural communities\" and reverse the change, claiming it would impact around 70,000 farms.",
      "That figure comes from the Country Land and Business Association. Its president, Victoria Vyvyan said: \"We estimate that capping agricultural property relief at \u00a31m could harm 70,000 UK farms, damaging family businesses and destabilising food security.\"",
      "That's not a figure for the number of estates that will have to pay inheritance tax each year, it's an estimate of the total number of farms worth enough to pay.",
      "There are a couple of ways to get to that.",
      "Yiorgos Gadanakis, associate professor of agricultural business management at University of Reading, Whiteknights pointed to various sources including Defra's Farm Business Survey, which suggest that between about 30 and 35% of farms in the UK could be valued at over \u00a31m.",
      "As there are about 209,000 farm holdings in the UK, that gives an estimate of between 62,700 and 73,150.",
      "An alternative way is to look at the number of farms that are bigger than about 200 acres (81 hectares), because at average land prices that would be enough to mean inheritance tax was due. That figure comes out at about 70,000.",
      "Sally Shortall, professor of rural economy at Newcastle University, points out they will not be evenly distributed across the country because of differing land values. \"Farms in England are likely to be the hardest hit,\" she said.",
      "But of course a farm will only be affected once it is inherited, so 70,000 is not necessarily the right number to use.",
      "Is it 500 farms a year?",
      "Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent economy think-tank, told Sky News: \"The changes will affect a remarkably small number of some of the most valuable farms.\"",
      "He added: \"[Farms are] still more generously treated, actually, than farms used to be in decades past.\"",
      "The Treasury estimates that 500 estates including agricultural land will be affected by the agricultural property relief reform per year.",
      "Dan Neidle, an independent tax expert, says the number of actual farms affected is likely to be below 500 per year.",
      "There were a total of 462 inherited farms valued above \u00a31m in 2021-22, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC):",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m37 above \u00a35m",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m",
      "80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m",
      "37 above \u00a35m",
      "Under the new rules, those 462 farms would be affected by the 20% inheritance tax on any value above \u00a31m (not on the whole value).",
      "However, as Mr Neidle points out, like for the rest of the population, there is no inheritance tax to be paid on the value of property up to \u00a3325,000, bringing the untaxed total to \u00a31.325m.",
      "If a farmer is married, his or her spouse would be able to pass on another \u00a31.325m tax free, taking the total untaxed amount to \u00a32.65m.",
      "There were 117 farms valued above \u00a32.5m in 2021-22, according to the HMRC figures.",
      "In addition, there is an \u00a3175,000 tax-free allowance on a main residence when it's being passed on to children or grandchildren. This brings the total untaxed amount for a farming couple to up to \u00a33m.",
      "Steve Reed, the secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, confirmed the \"vast majority\" of farmers will not be affected by changes. Writing in the Telegraph, he said \"only the richest estates will be asked to pay\".",
      "Farmers 'betrayed' by \u00a31m inheritance tax relief cap",
      "Farmers mull selling or protests over tax change",
      "How are the inheritance tax rules changing?",
      "How much could be raised?",
      "The chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, has said that the inheritance tax exemptions currently cost \"about \u00a31bn a year for taxpayers\".",
      "Now the Treasury expects that the changes to inheritance tax , as well as changes to Business Tax Relief, will raise \u00a3230m in 2026-27, the first year of their introduction. This rises to \u00a3520m by the end of the forecast in 2029-30.",
      "But the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warns that there is high uncertainty around these figures.",
      "Is the tax affordable?",
      "Sam Kirkham, who specialises in agriculture at Albert Goodman accountants, says \"people look at the value of farms and think the farmers must be wealthy\".",
      "But she says if the farm passes down to the next generation to continue to produce food, they never get to realise that capital.",
      "And she adds farm profits are insufficient to meet the additional cost of inheritance tax.",
      "Government figures suggest that the average return on capital for farms (which is the percentage return that they are making from things like land and machinery) is only about 0.5%, which is very low.",
      "UPDATE 4 November: The unit on a measure of area was corrected from hectares to acres. A sentence was added detailing the residence nil-rate band rate of inheritance tax.",

    "story": [
      "It is now \"virtually certain\" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service.",
      "Global average temperatures across the year are on track to end up more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which would make 2024 the first calendar year to breach this symbolic mark.",
      "These high temperatures are mainly down to human-caused climate change, with smaller contributions from natural factors such as the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",
      "Many scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain.",
      "\"We will watch with interest what happens going into 2025 and beyond,\" says Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.",
      "But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set.",
      "\"The warmer temperatures [are making] storms more intense, heatwaves hotter and heavy rainfall more extreme, with clearly seen consequences for people all around the world,\" says Prof Hawkins.",
      "\"Stabilising global temperatures by reaching net zero emissions is the only way to stop adding to the costs of these disasters.\"",

      "Back then, he announced the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the most important UN process to tackle climate change.  The agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.",
      "But the shock of Trump's decision was limited. The treaty's rules meant the US was not able to withdraw until November 2020, a few months before he left office.",

      "In recent years, richer countries such as the US, UK and EU states have tried to increase the funds available for developing countries to cope with climate change. But they also insist that big developing economies also contribute.",
      "\"The US basically wanted to have China cough up some money for that fund as well. Now they won't be able to do that. That leaves China off the hook,\" Prof Klein said.",
      "Climate scientists say developing countries need billions of dollars of extra investment to become net zero, where they are not contributing to climate change, and stave off the effects of rising temperatures.",
      "While the US might leave the Paris Agreement quite quickly, Trump would still be bound by other global efforts to fight climate change.",
      "There have been reports that some of his supporters also want to turn their backs on these as well.

      "Environmental campaigner Julie Bolthouse points out that Northern Virginia has the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centres. This is not something she is thrilled about.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the Wall Street of the data centre industry,\u201d says Ms Bolthouse, who is a director of local Virginian charity and campaign group Piedmont Environmental Council.",
      "Data centres are vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Northern Virginia, the northern region of the state of Virginia, has been a key location for data centres since the 1990s. This is thanks to its immediate proximity to Washington DC, yet with historically cheap electricity and land prices.",
      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",
      "\"This threat to the right to water amidst a water crisis raised strong criticisms, leading Google to change the proposed technology to cool down its equipment, so the project was modified. Chillers will cool down with air instead of water.\u201d",
      "In Chile, meanwhile, Google has halted plans for a data centre over similar water use concerns.",
      "Back in Virginia, Ms Bolthouse says the firms need to do more to boost sustainability. In the long run, she says, it will be in the industry's own interests to improve data centres' environmental impact.",
      "\"What's going to happen if we continue with business as usual is that electrical prices are going to skyrocket for everybody, including the data centre industry - and that's their biggest bill, so that's going to impact them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe water scarcity issue is also going to impact them.",

      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",

      "The door of Juan Botero\u2019s apartment in Houston, Texas is made of wood \u2013 with a classy, walnut-like finish.",
      "But, for Halloween, he planned an eye-catching change. \u201cI\u2019m going to paint my door orange,\u201d Mr Botero, founder and chief executive of Colombia-based Glasst, told the BBC last month. And he has kept his promise.",
      "However, the move is not as drastic as it sounds. Mr Botero\u2019s firm, an \u201cinnovation company\u201d, has designed the paint to be removable \u2013 once dry, you can peel it off like plastic wrap. If it works as intended, it shouldn\u2019t leave behind any marks or residue.",
      "Mr Botero had the idea for the product, called Unpaint, about five years ago and, initially, his investors weren\u2019t keen. \u201cThey said I was crazy,\u201d he recalls. Nevertheless, he insisted: \u201cPeople are looking for customisation in their lives.\u201d",
      "Glasst is just one of many firms that claim house paint can do more than look nice. Various products now on the market, their makers promise, will save you money, keep you comfortable during heatwaves, or transform your relationship with the walls of your home. But is it all too good to be true?",
      "Unpaint is due to launch in the US this November, and Mr Botero is convinced that there is a market for the stuff. He argues it will appeal to people living in rented accommodation, who can\u2019t make permanent changes to their decor.",
      "Glasst, unsurprisingly, declines to share details about how it makes the paint, but Mr Botero says it is a resin from a renewable source. I ask if he means trees and he confirms.",
      "Peelable paint already exists for car bodywork, but getting such a product to work reliably on softer home interiors is more challenging.",
      "There is a risk of damaging your existing, underlying paint when you eventually wrest Unpaint off your walls, but, if the permanent paint below is in good condition, this shouldn\u2019t happen, says Mr Botero.",
      "It does have an odd texture: \u201cA little bit rubbery,\" says Mr Botero. Plus, it is easier to scratch than water-based emulsion.",
      "Bringing the product to market hasn\u2019t been easy. Glasst posted a video about the paint to YouTube two years ago, but the launch was delayed until this year \u201cto align with the correct funding and resources needed,\u201d says Mr Botero.",
      "He mentions that Glasst is working on other coatings with unusual properties \u2013 including \u201cThermglasst\u201d, an insulating resin due to launch next year. Mr Botero claims that less than a millimetre of this coating will provide the same insulating effect as 40 millimetres of foam.",
      "There\u2019s no independent validation of that claim just yet, but there are already a range of insulating paints on the market that promise to reduce your heating bills and, it is fair to note, they have not always performed well in scientific evaluations.",
      "In 2019, Richard Fitton of the University of Salford and colleagues published a paper in which they investigated the efficacy of six thermal paints available on the UK market at the time. In short, they found that claims that such paints could reduce heating bills by up to 20% or 25% were impossible to validate.",
      "First, the researchers coated boards with the paints, which allowed them to measure the coatings\u2019 thermal resistance, or insulating values. Then, the team calculated the reduction in heating costs you would expect after applying each of these paints to the interior of a typical Victorian terraced house.",
      "The biggest cost saving measured was a mere 2.9%, and, given the price of the paints in question, homeowners would potentially have to wait centuries or even up to a millennium \u2013 at 2019 prices \u2013 before they would recoup the decorating fees in terms of reduced heating costs.",
      "\u201cIf someone brought me a paint that could save me 25% of my energy bill, it would be on my wall by the weekend,\u201d says Prof Fitton. He adds that he is currently working on a follow-up paper to the 2019 study, and would also be open to testing Thermglasst, or any other insulating paint, in the future.",
      "Paints that help to keep your house cool might be more effective. For years, researchers have pursued the idea of improving the reflectivity of paint on exterior walls or roofs, since this could help keep buildings cool on hot, sunny days. Such weather is becoming ever more common due to climate change.",
      "The principle is as old as the hills \u2013 consider the white painted houses of the Mediterranean. But paints designed to be significantly more reflective than standard white paint could heighten the effect. i2Cool in Hong Kong is one of several firms marketing such a product at present.",

      "Martin Zhu, chief executive and co-founder, says the paint made by i2Cool was tested on the roof of a shopping mall in Hong Kong \u2013 but only on one of its two buildings, in order to find out whether there was a noticeable effect in terms of reducing the costs of running that building\u2019s air conditioning (AC).",
      "\u201cWe used a power meter to measure the energy consumption of the AC system,\u201d says Dr Zhu. The cost of running the AC duly fell in the painted building, by 40%, he adds.",
      "Dr Zhu first began working on the paint while a doctoral student, and he mentions that early versions made around 2017 contained silver, which made it very expensive \u2013 more than $100,000 just to cover a small area. Years of development later, it now costs around $10 per square metre of coverage. It also now comes in a variety of light colours, including grey, yellow and green.",
      "Researchers have noted that highly reflective coatings for passive cooling applications need to be resistant to dirt and soiling, for example, to avoid their efficacy dropping overt time. And glare from ultra-reflective roofs risks heating up nearby darker structures, a 2020 paper suggested.",
      "The paint from i2Cool does not contain heavy metals and uses a water-based emulsion, and while it is not biodegradable, it can be recycled, says Dr Zhu.",
      "The company\u2019s latest major project is the Dubai Mall. The roof of this sprawling complex \u2013 the largest mall in the world by total area \u2013 will eventually be fully coated with the paint. A 1,000 sq m section has been completed to date.",

      "A quick guide to Kamala Harris",
      "Some allies have privately questioned whether Harris remained too loyal to Biden in her bid to replace him. But Jamal Simmons, the vice-president's former communication director, called it a \"trap\", arguing any distance would have only handed Republicans another attack line for being disloyal.",
      "\"You can't really run away from the president who chooses you,\" he said.",
      "Harris tried to walk the fine line of addressing the administration's record without casting shade on her boss, showing a reluctance to break with any of Biden's policies while also not outwardly promoting them on the campaign trail.",
      "But she then failed to deliver a convincing argument about why she should lead the country, and how she would handle economic frustrations as well as widespread concerns over immigration.",
      "About 3 in 10 voters said their family's financial situation was falling behind, an increase from about 2 in 10 four years ago, according to data from AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 US voters conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago.",
      "Nine in 10 voters were very or somewhat concerned about the price of groceries.",
      "The same survey found that 4 in 10 voters said immigrants living in the US illegally should be deported to their country of origin, up from around 3 in 10 who said the same in 2020.",
      "And though Harris tried to spend the home stretch of her campaign underlining that her administration would not be a continuation of Biden's, she failed to clearly outline her own policies, often skirting around issues instead of addressing perceived failures head on.",
      "Struggle to build on Biden's network of support",
      "The Harris campaign had hoped to reassemble the voting base that powered Biden's 2020 victory, winning over the core Democratic constituencies of black, Latino and young voters as well as making further gains with college-educated suburban voters.",
      "But she underperformed with these key voting blocs. She lost 13 points with Latino voters, two points with black voters, and six points with voters under 30, according to exit polls, which may change as votes are counted, but are considered representative of trends.",
      "Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who lost the 2016 Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton and the 2020 primary to Biden, said in a statement it was \"no great surprise\" that working class voters abandoned the party.",
      "\"First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and black workers as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,\" he said. \"And they're right.\"",
      "While women largely threw their support behind Harris over Trump, the vice-president's lead did not exceed the margins that her campaign had hoped her historic candidacy would turn out. And she was unable to deliver on her ambitions of winning over suburban Republican women, losing 53% of white women.",
      "In the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, Democrats had hoped her focus on the fight for reproductive rights would deliver a decisive victory.",
      "While some 54% of female voters cast their ballots for Harris, it fell short of the 57% who backed Biden in 2020, according to exit poll data.",
      "Making it about Trump backfired",
      "Even before she was catapulted to the top of the ticket, Harris had sought to frame the race as a referendum on Trump, not Biden.",
      "The former California prosecutor leaned into her law enforcement record to prosecute the case against the former president.",
      "But her nascent campaign opted to ditch Biden's core argument that Trump posed an existential threat to democracy, prioritising a forward-looking \"joyful\" message about protecting personal freedoms and preserving the middle class.",
      "In the final stretch, however, Harris made a tactical decision to again highlight the dangers of a second Trump presidency, calling the president a \"fascist\" and campaigning with disaffected Republicans fed up with his rhetoric.",
      "After Trump's former White House Chief of Staff, John Kelly, told the New York Times that Trump spoke approvingly about Adolf Hitler, Harris delivered remarks outside her official residence describing the president as \"unhinged and unstable\".",
      "\"Kamala Harris lost this election when she pivoted to focus almost exclusively on attacking Donald Trump,\" veteran Republican pollster Frank Luntz said on Tuesday night.",
      "\"Voters already know everything there is about Trump \u2013 but they still wanted to know more about Harris\u2019 plans for the first hour, first day, first month and first year of her administration.\"",
      "\u201cIt was a colossal failure for her campaign to shine the spotlight on Trump more than on Harris\u2019s own ideas,\u201d he added.",
      "Ultimately, the winning coalition Harris needed to beat Trump never materialised, and voters' resounding rejection of Democrats showed that the party has a deeper problem than just an unpopular president.",

      "His message on the economy touched a chord",
      "Few people have a middle ground when it comes to Trump. Most of the voters I spoke to during the course of this campaign said they wished he would \u201cshut his potty mouth\u201d \u2013 but they were able to look past it.",
      "Instead, they focused on the question he asked at every rally. \u201cAre you better off now than you were two years ago?\u201d",

Although much of the cause of inflation was due to outside forces such as the Covid-19 pandemic, they blamed the outgoing administration.",
      "Voters were also deeply concerned about illegal immigration which had reached record levels under Biden.

They have cautioned that if he surrounds himself with loyalists, which he is expected to do, that there will be no one to restrain him from his more extreme ideas.",

At the same time, he could pardon hundreds of people sentenced to prison for their part in the Capitol Riots.",
      "In the end, voters were presented with two versions of America.",

      "He has talked about trying to silence critics in the press. Just days before the election, he also made comments that implied he wouldn\u2019t mind if members of the media were killed.",

      "The rest of the world will now discover what \u201cAmerica First\u201d really means. From the global economic consequences of 20% tariffs that he has proposed on US imports to the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East that he has vowed to end \u2013 regardless of which side wins.",

      "Donald Trump Jr also brought along two of his five children. His 17-year-old daughter Kai spoke publicly for the first time during the RNC, describing Trump as \"very caring and loving\" and \"a normal grandpa\".",
      "Trump\u2019s second child Ivanka Trump appeared with her husband Jared Kushner. Both held key roles under the Trump administration, with Kushner advising on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and relations with China, Mexico and Canada. The couple did not participate in this campaign.",

      "The Vances",
      "Vice-president-elect JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, hailed Trump's victory as the \"greatest political comeback\" in US history. Vance is also the author of the best-selling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, about his childhood in the white working-class Rust Belt.",
      "\"He turned out to be a good choice,\" Trump remarked. \"I took a little heat at the beginning, but I knew the brain was a good one - as good as it gets.\"",
      "Vance celebrated with his wife Usha Vance. Born in California to Indian immigrants, she worked as a lawyer until her husband\u2019s campaign.",
      "Campaign advisers and allies",

      "He has frequently voiced concerns over the Biden administration's approach to immigration and the economy, and claimed free speech would be at risk with another Democrat presidency.",
      "As one of the president-elect's most important backers, the tech billionaire donated more than $119m (\u00a392m) to fund a Super PAC aimed at re-electing Trump.",

      "Russia, Ukraine and Nato",
      "During the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine \u201cin a day\u201d. When asked how, he suggested overseeing a deal, but has declined to give specifics.",
      "A research paper written by two of Trump\u2019s former national security chiefs in May said the US should continue its weapons supply to Ukraine, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia.",
      "To entice Russia, the West would promise to delay Ukraine\u2019s much-wanted entry into Nato. The former advisers said Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from Russian occupation, but that it should negotiate based on current front lines.",
      "Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents, who accuse him of cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, say his approach amounts to surrender for Ukraine and will endanger all of Europe.",
      "He has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on US resources.",

      "It\u2019s not clear how far the former advisers\u2019 paper represents Trump\u2019s own thinking, but it\u2019s likely to give us a guide to the kind of advice he\u2019ll get.",
      "His \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to ending the war also extends to the strategic issue of the future of Nato, the transatlantic all-for-one and one-for-all military alliance set up after the World War Two, originally as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.",
      "Nato now counts 32 countries and Trump has long been a sceptic of the alliance, accusing Europe of free-riding on America\u2019s promise of protection.",
      "Whether he would actually withdraw the US from Nato, which would signal the most significant shift in transatlantic defence relations in nearly a century, remains a matter of debate.",
      "Some of his allies suggest his hard line is just a negotiating tactic to get members to meet the alliance\u2019s defence spending guidelines.",
      "But the reality is Nato leaders will be seriously worried about what his victory means for the alliance\u2019s future and how its deterrent effect is perceived by hostile leaders.",
      "The Middle East",
      "As with Ukraine, Trump has promised to bring \u201cpeace\u201d to the Middle East - implying he would end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon - but has not said how.",
      "He has repeatedly said that, if he had been in power rather than Joe Biden, Hamas would not have attacked Israel because of his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy on Iran, which funds the group.",
      "Broadly, it\u2019s likely Trump would attempt to return to the policy, which saw his administration pull the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, apply greater sanctions against Iran and kill Gen Qasem Soleimani - Iran\u2019s most powerful military commander.",
      "In the White House, Trump enacted strongly pro-Israel policies, naming Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving the US embassy there from Tel Aviv - a move which energised Trump\u2019s Christian evangelical base, a core Republican voter group.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump the \u201cbest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\u201d.",
      "But critics argue his policy had a destabilising effect on the region.",
      "The Palestinians boycotted the Trump administration, because of Washington\u2019s abandonment of their claim to Jerusalem - the city that forms the historical centre of national and religious life for Palestinians.",
      "They were further isolated when Trump brokered the so-called \u201cAbraham Accords\u201d, which saw a historic deal to normalise diplomatic ties between Israel and several Arab and Muslim countries. They did so without Israel having to accept a future independent Palestinian state alongside it - the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of Arab countries for such a regional deal.",
      "The countries involved were instead given access to advanced US weapons in return for recognising Israel.",
      "The Palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground.",
      "Trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the Gaza war to end.",
      "He has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with Netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him.",
      "He also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key Arab countries that have contacts with Hamas.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the Israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close.",
      "Trump\u2019s allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile Middle East in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it\u2019s far from clear how this would play out.",
      "Trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the Biden administration to get a Gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by Hamas.",
      "China and trade",
      "America\u2019s approach to China is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade.",
      "When he was in office, Trump labelled China a \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d and imposed tariffs on some Chinese imports to the US. This sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by Beijing on American imports.",
      "There were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the Covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled Covid a \u201cChinese virus\u201d.",
      "While the Biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to China policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the Trump-era tariffs on imports.",
      "What Chinese people want from the US",
      "What Chinese people want from the US",
      "The trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the US about protecting American manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional US industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring.",
      "Trump has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping as both \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an \u201ciron fist\u201d- part of what opponents characterised as Trump\u2019s admiration for \u201cdictators\u201d.",
      "The former president seems likely to shift away from the Biden administration\u2019s approach of building stronger US security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain China.",
      "The US has maintained military assistance for self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing\u2019s control.",
      "Trump said in October that if he returned to the White House, he would not have to use military force to prevent a Chinese blockade of Taiwan because President Xi knew he was \u201c[expletive] crazy\u201d, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on Chinese imports if that happened.",

      "Back then, he announced the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the most important UN process to tackle climate change.  The agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.",
      "But the shock of Trump's decision was limited. The treaty's rules meant the US was not able to withdraw until November 2020, a few months before he left office.",
      "If Trump withdraws again, he will only have to wait a year before the US is completely out. That would give him three years to chart his own course without any need to report to the UN or be bound by its rules.",

      "\"They can't commit to anything and that means that countries like China will not want to commit to anything.\"",
      "In recent years, richer countries such as the US, UK and EU states have tried to increase the funds available for developing countries to cope with climate change. But they also insist that big developing economies also contribute.",
      "\"The US basically wanted to have China cough up some money for that fund as well. Now they won't be able to do that. That leaves China off the hook,\" Prof Klein said.",
      "Climate scientists say developing countries need billions of dollars of extra investment to become net zero, where they are not contributing to climate change, and stave off the effects of rising temperatures.",
      "While the US might leave the Paris Agreement quite quickly, Trump would still be bound by other global efforts to fight climate change.",
      "There have been reports that some of his supporters also want to turn their backs on these as well. Some have argued for a complete break from UN efforts on climate change, urging the president-elect to leave something called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that underpins global collective action to tackle climate change.",

      "Global average temperatures across the year are on track to end up more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which would make 2024 the first calendar year to breach this symbolic mark.",
      "These high temperatures are mainly down to human-caused climate change, with smaller contributions from natural factors such as the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",
      "Many scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain.",
      "\"We will watch with interest what happens going into 2025 and beyond,\" says Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.",
      "But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set.",
      "\"The warmer temperatures [are making] storms more intense, heatwaves hotter and heavy rainfall more extreme, with clearly seen consequences for people all around the world,\" says Prof Hawkins.",
      "\"Stabilising global temperatures by reaching net zero emissions is the only way to stop adding to the costs of these disasters.\"",

    "summary": "Kenya's status as a sanctuary for refugees is questioned after the deportation of four Turkish nationals.",
    "story": [
      "Once regarded as a safe haven for refugees, Kenya is slowly becoming a hostile place for some of those seeking protection from political persecution and war, rights groups say.",
      "Their concerns come after masked men abducted at gunpoint four Turkish refugees in the capital, Nairobi, last month -  the latest in a series of such cases in the East African state.",
      "Kenyan authorities said the four, who were recognised by the UN as refugees, were deported at the request of the Turkish government, which wants them on treason charges.",
      "Critics accuse Kenya of abandoning an age-old legal principle of \"non-refoulement\", which prohibits the forced return of people to countries where they may face persecution.",
      "This has tarnished Kenya's reputation, with the local Daily Nation newspaper reporting that the chiefs of the US's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the UK's foreign intelligence agency MI6 - William Burns and Richard Moore respectively - raised the deportations with President William Ruto during their visit to Nairobi late last month.",
      "Kenya's refugee commissioner John Burugu declined to comment about the expulsions, but senior foreign ministry official Korir Sing'oei highlighted the dilemma the government faced when he said it needed to perform a \"crucial balancing of interests for the bigger good\".",
      "\"Harbouring the subversive elements accused of undertaking activities detrimental to a friendly country posed both a diplomatic and humanitarian dilemma to Kenya,\" he added.",
      "In the end, realpolitik triumphed, with Kenya not prepared to jeopardise its closer ties with Turkey, which saw the two countries sign a military co-operation agreement in July.",
      "Compared to its neighbours, Kenya has enjoyed peace and stability for many years, making it a prime destination for refugees and asylum seekers, from various conflict-hit or authoritarian countries in the region such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Rwanda and South Sudan.",
      "East Africa's biggest economy, Kenya is home to more than 800,000 refugees, according to Burugu.",
      "But rights groups fear that the country has in recent years become an increasingly unsafe for those fleeing persecution in their home countries.",
      "Kenyan police have also been accused on numerous occasions of colluding with foreign security agencies trying to apprehend people they regard as threats.",
      "The latest example of this came when it was accused of being complicit - as Uganda's Observer newspaper put it - in the \"brazen cross-border abductions\" of 36 Ugandan opposition supporters in July.",
      "The group had travelled to the Kenyan city of Kisumu for a training course, according to their lawyers, but were deported to Uganda without proper legal channels like deportation orders or extradition requests being followed.",
      "Uganda's police accused the suspects of being \"engaged in covert activities that are suspected to be subversive, drawing the attention of Kenyan security forces\".",
      "But the group denied any wrongdoing through their lawyer.",
      "\"By allowing Ugandan security operatives to cross into Kenya and essentially kidnap these individuals, Kenya has failed in its duty to safeguard the liberty and wellbeing of all people on its territory, regardless of their nationality or political affiliations,\" the Observer said in an editorial.",
      "Last May, Rwandan human rights defender Yusuf Ahmed Gasana was abducted from his home in Nairobi by unidentified persons and has not been seen since.",

      "\"Going back home is not an option for me and my family but we live in constant fear here,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm afraid because being accessed by the people we are running away from is a huge possibility,\" the refugee added.",
      "Because of the growing threat, more than 3,000 refugees and asylum seekers are currently living under the protection of a non-governmental organisation, the Refugee Consortium of Kenya (RCK).",
      "The fear of being arrested, charged or extradited are among the reasons why they had turned to the RCK for assistance, the organisation's lead researcher, Shadrack Kuyoh, told the BBC.",
      "He said the deportation of refugees was in breach of the Refugees Act of Kenya, which seeks to ensure that they \"are not returned to territories where they may face harm\".",
      "The fate of the Turkish nationals since their deportation remains unclear.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 00:06:39 GMT",
    "summary": "Deputy PM admits former Soviet state was until recently a 'highly corrupt country' - but insists things are changing fast.",
    "story": [
      "The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.",
      "\"I went with a backpack, and set up a business,\" says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.",
      "Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing \"the clich\u00e9 that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time\".",
      "\"Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner you'd get attention,\" he says.",
      "Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.",
      "Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.",
      "The country's standard corporation tax rate - the amount that firms have to pay on their profits - is just 12%. This compares with 25% in the UK, and 25.8% in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.",
      "There's an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the country's IT sector - the Moldova IT Park (MITP).",
      "This isn't a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country - and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7%.",
      "The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.",
      "This drive is being led by Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu, who this week was re-elected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted \"yes\" on pro-EU constitutional changes.",
      "However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46% and No receiving 49.54%. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldova\u2019s authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an \"unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy\".",
      "Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily.",
      "Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.",
      "\"Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that it's a country that can change very fast,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This used to be a highly corrupt country, a country where, exactly 10 years ago, a billion dollars from our central banks just disappeared.\"",
      "\"We are moving very fast towards joining the EU, and we are reforming our economy at top speed. Of course, we have a long way to go.\"",
      "He pointed to Moldova's rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International.",
      "Out of 180 countries - with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt - Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.",
      "\"Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.\"",
      "Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.",
      "\"Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.",
      "\"It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with.\"",
      "Member companies of the MITP don't just benefit from the 7% corporation tax rate. They also don't need to make employer social security contributions, and staff don't have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.",
      "The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.",
      "More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.",
      "In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined \u20ac365m ($397m; \u00a3308m) in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6% of the country's GDP.",
      "While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldova's IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.",
      "Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.",
      "He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than \u20ac100,000 a year, \"because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany\".",
      "At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. \"Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.\"",
      "Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe \"as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine\".",
      "Marina Bzovii, MITP's administrator and an assistant professor at the Technical University of Moldova, already sees Moldova as a regional business hub. \"Moldova is connecting even Central Asia, countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who are culturally much further from Europe.",

    "story": [
      "We\u2019ve known for months that there is no love lost between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his now former Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant.",
      "But this year, there have been reports of stand-up rows and shouting matches between the two men over Israel\u2019s war strategy.",
      "Gallant has vastly more military experience than Netanyahu.",
      "He began his career as a navy commando in 1977 and rose to be a major general in Israel\u2019s Southern Command, overseeing two wars in Gaza between 2005 and 2010.",
      "The suspicion is that Gallant\u2019s military superiority and respect from within the armed forces grated with his boss.",
      "In Israel\u2019s hard-line government, the most right-wing in the country\u2019s history, Gallant was less hawkish than some of his fellow ministers. But he was no dove.",
      "After Hamas\u2019s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, the country\u2019s biggest ever military humiliation, Gallant was initially fully behind the war in Gaza.",
      "Along with Netanyahu, he faces possible war crimes charges at the International Criminal Court. Both men rejected the allegations made by the ICC's prosecutor when he sought warrants for them in May.",
      "But in recent months as defence minister, Gallant argued that Israel's government should prioritise a hostage release deal with Hamas and end the war in Gaza.",
      "Protests erupt in Israel after Netanyahu fires defence minister",
      "Netanyahu aide leaks may have harmed hostage talks, court says",
      "Stories of the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel",
      "Netanyahu hasn\u2019t listened, insisting that continued military pressure on Hamas was the best way to free the remaining Israelis being held.",
      "Since the beginning of the year, Gallant had raised concerns about the lack of a post-war strategy. Again, it fell on deaf ears.",
      "He has pushed for a comprehensive investigation into the military, political, and intelligence failings that led to the 7 October attack.",
      "The prime minister has been resistant, arguing now is not the time.",
      "Gallant was also unhappy at plans to continue to allow Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Jewish seminary students to be exempt from serving in the military.",
      "At a time of multiple wars, he said, the country couldn\u2019t afford such luxuries.",
      "Netanyahu, wary of the collapse of his coalition government which has been dependent on support from the ultra-Orthodox parties, paid no heed.",
      "The new Defence Minister, Israel Katz, who up until yesterday was the foreign minister, is more hawkish and much more in step with his boss\u2019s thinking.",
      "Following his appointment, he vowed to \u201cachieve the goals of the war\u201d, including \u201cthe return of all hostages as the most important moral mission, the destruction of Hamas in Gaza, [and] the defeat of Hezbollah in Lebanon\u201d.",
      "But compared to Gallant, Katz has virtually no military experience.",
      "That will raise concerns here and abroad at a time when Israel is fighting two wars, in Gaza and in Lebanon, which risk further engulfing the wider Middle East.",
      "The cabinet has now lost the last remaining minister who was willing and able to confront Netanyahu, another likely reason Gallant was shown the door.",
      "There have been rumours for months that he was on the verge of being sacked.",
      "The timing of his dismissal on the day of the United States election cannot be ignored.",
      "The former defence minister has a much better relationship with President Joe Biden\u2019s White House than Netanyahu, whose rapport is frosty at best.",
      "His sacking can be seen as one more jab in the eye to the now outgoing US administration.",
      "It will come as no surprise if the Israeli prime minister is much more willing to listen to advice on war strategy handed out by Donald Trump\u2019s team.",
      "Of course, in the merry-go-round world of Israeli politics, no-one will be shocked if this is not the last we hear from Gallant.",
      "He has been sacked as defence minister once before, back in March 2023.",
      "On that occasion, along with many high-ranking military and former military officials, he was unhappy with Netanyahu\u2019s controversial plans to overhaul the judicial system.",
      "His dismissal led to tens of thousands of Israelis taking to the streets calling for him to be reinstated.",
      "After just a few days, Netanyahu was forced to back down and return Gallant to his position.",
      "On Tuesday night, as news broke that he had been sacked again, there were again protests in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, but not on the same scale.",
      "Gallant belongs to the same political party as Netanyahu, Likud, and could one day challenge his leadership in any future elections.",
      "But the fact he has been given his marching orders now suggests the prime minister is feeling strong.",
      "As has been the case for the past year, it is Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, its most Machiavellian and successful political operator, who is calling the shots."

    "story": [
      "For the last 17 years, a worldwide army of online sleuths obsessively tried to figure out the title of what has been dubbed \"the most mysterious song on the internet.\"",
      "Now, they have the answer after a chance discovery by one intrepid researcher who triumphantly reported his breakthrough on online forum Reddit: it is called \"Subways of Your Mind\"\u00a0and was recorded by a little-known 1980s German band called FEX.",
      "The former band members are \"absolutely overwhelmed\" by the news, 68-year-old Michael Haedrich, who played keyboard and guitar and sang back-up vocals for FEX, told Der Spiegel magazine.",
      "The band had been oblivious to the online phenomenon, he admitted.",
      "How the mystery unfolded",
      "The mystery began in 2007, when a German brother and sister uploaded a track online that they had digitized after originally recording it as teenagers on a cassette from the radio. As Rolling Stone\u00a0reported in 2019, the tape mostly featured songs from popular bands like XTC and The Cure, as well as one particular song that remained a mystery \u2014 until now.",
      "The German siblings asked for help to identify it and audiophiles soon took up the challenge.",
      "The track did not show up in any music databases, but online sleuths tried to work out what instruments could be heard and analyzed the lead singer's accent.",
      "Initial attempts to identify the song, soon classified by many as being in the 1980s' \"New Wave\" genre, yielded little.",
      "It was only when the track was uploaded onto Reddit in 2019 that global interest exploded.",
      "A Reddit subforum called \"r/TheMysteriousSong\" attracted tens of thousands of members, and the hunt was reported on in German media and beyond.",
      "The big breakthrough finally came earlier this week when a user called \"marijn1412\" said he had identified the song as \"Subways of Your Mind.\"",
      "He said he came across former FEX members while researching an event for up-and-coming bands that had been organized in the 1980s by a public broadcaster in northern Germany.",
      "The Reddit user wrote that he had reached out to members of what was a four-piece outfit from the northern city of Kiel, who sent him a version of the mystery song, and revealed its long-sought-after name.",
      "Marijn1412 wrote: \"After I emailed him back that the song is actually quite a famous 'lost song,' he asked me not to go public with it until he spoke with his old band members. In the meantime, though, the song did get registered at [the German performance rights organization] GEMA and people found out about it. But I'm happy to say that the band members agreed for me to go public with it.\"",
      "Haedrich, who is still a musician, told Spiegel that it was the first time he had heard about the massive search effort.",
      "\"I thought it was amazing that someone was interested in music by a band that was only successful regionally, if at all, and that was over 40 years ago,\" he said.",
      "Haedrich, who lives in Munich, said the band members now want to reissue \"Subways of Your Mind\" and are trying to track down the original recording of the song.",
      "Their success may have been decades in the making, but he said \"for us, it has just come suddenly.\"",

      "Elton Sawyer, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said the sanctioning body considered suspending the drivers as well as taking action against manufacturers Chevrolet and Toyota. He said there was nothing in the rulebook that would call for the manufacturers to be punished, but NASCAR planned to meet with the leaders of Ford, Chevy and Toyota to discuss the situation.",
      "Because the penalties were issued the week of the season finale, the teams have until Wednesday afternoon to ask for an expedited appeal. The appeals would likely be heard Thursday.",

      "Dillon was fined $100,000, as was Richard Childress Racing. One-race suspensions were given to team executive Keith Rodden, crew chief Justin Alexander and spotter Brandon Benesch. The team also lost 50 points. Richard Childress Racing also said it would appeal.",

      "But he said he hoped the penalties were harsh enough to curb the manufacturer alliances and race manipulation.",
      "\"We took and looked at the most recent penalty that we had written for an infraction very similar... we wanted to ramp this one up,\" Sawyer said, \"and we did. We did that in a way that included team leadership and this is something that we felt like we wanted to get our point across that it is a responsibility of all of us.... to uphold the integrity of the sport.\"",

      "Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic \"Thriller\" album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.",
      "Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family.",
      "\"Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones' passing,\" the family said in a statement. \"And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.",
      "\"He is truly one of a kind and we will miss him dearly; we take comfort and immense pride in knowing that the love and joy, that were the essence of his being, was shared with the world through all that he created. Through his music and his boundless love, Quincy Jones' heart will beat for eternity.\"",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary music catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song.",
      "For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who didn't own at least one record with his name on it or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who didn't have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \"Roots\" and \"In the Heat of the Night,\" organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \"We Are the World,\" the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.",
      "Lionel Richie, who co-wrote \"We Are the World\" and was among its featured singers, would call Jones \"the master orchestrator.\"",
      "Jones' work with Michael Jackson",
      "In a career that began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 RPM, the top honors he received are likely the ones for his productions with Jackson: \"Off the Wall,\" \"Thriller\" and \"Bad\" were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones' versatility and imagination helped set off Jackson's explosive talent as he transformed from child star to the \"King of Pop.\" On such classic tracks as \"Billie Jean\" and \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,\" Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \"Thriller,\" some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing \"Beat It\" and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\"Thriller\" sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles' \"Greatest Hits 1971-1975\" among others as the best-selling album of all time.",
      "\"If an album doesn't do well, everyone says 'it was the producers fault'; so if it does well, it should be your 'fault,' too,\" Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. \"The tracks don't just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.\"",
      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \"Q\", including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for \"Roots.\" He also received France's Legion d'Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \"Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones\" and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author.",
      "Music as Jones' savior",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, once telling Oprah Winfrey that \"There are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don't. Nothing's in between.\" Jones' mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \"senseless\" for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "\"They nailed my hand to a fence with a switchblade, man,\" he told the AP in 2018, showing a scar from his childhood.",
      "Music saved him. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\"I went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\" he wrote in his autobiography. \"That's where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\"",
      "Within a few years, he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\"We had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\" Jones later told Musician magazine. \"That's when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\"",
      "Jones, the businessman",
      "As a music executive, he overcame racial barriers by becoming a vice president at Mercury Records in the early '60s. In 1971, he became the first Black musical director for the Academy Awards ceremony. The first movie he produced, \"The Color Purple,\" received 11 Oscar nominations in 1986 but, to his great disappointment, no wins.",
      "In a partnership with Time Warner, he created Quincy Jones Entertainment, which included the pop-culture magazine Vibe and Qwest Broadcasting. The company was sold for $270 million in 1999.",

    "summary": "The former child actor who grew up to play Roman Roy, the filterless, fast-talking middle child in \"Succession,\" is now playing a rudderless man-child in Jesse Eisenberg's poignant comedy, \"A Real Pain.\"",
    "story": [
      "For 42-year-old Kieran Culkin, visiting the building in Manhattan's Yorkville neighborhood where he spent the first eight years of his life brings back unusual memories. \"I remember my mom baking a cake and it would come out slanted because the whole apartment was on a slant,\" he said. \"We used to put cars on one end of the kitchen and let go and see them roll!",
      "\"We lived in a tight space where it was just seven of us running around. It was like a sort of little wolf-pack mentality,\" he said.",
      "His father \"Kit,\" himself a former actor, and mother Patricia, a telephone operator, raised their seven kids in a four-room apartment. Kieran came fourth in the birth order. \"Whenever the door would open to let the kids in, I used to stand aside and make sure, and I used to count to make sure all six of them got in before I got in,\" he said. \"That's how I remember growing up, too, was I couldn't fall asleep until they all fell asleep. Like, I only existed because they did around me.\"",
      "He got into acting because neighbors of theirs ran an off-off-Broadway theater on the Upper East Side: \"And they knew that there was this family that had a bunch of kids. And whenever they needed a kid they were like, 'Uhm, you know, we might need a kid for this show.' And my parents were more or less like, 'Okay, yeah, what gender? What age? We got a whole bunch.'\"",
      "Soon enough, Macaulay, two years older than Kieran, became world famous as the star of \"Home Alone.\" Kieran also had a small role in that movie, and a year later played Steve Martin's son in \"Father of the Bride.\"",
      "Kieran was cute and charismatic. But making it as a grownup actor meant learning how to act. He says when he was 18 and starring in the movie \"Igby Goes Down,\" the director, Burr Steers, wanted to break him of his \"kid acting habits\" \u2013 to unlearn the tricks that had served him so well as a child.",
      "\"He really didn't like kid actors, and he was like, 'You still have a few bad habits,'\" Culkin said. \"He was like, 'You're doing something with your eyes.' He would say, 'Soulful eyes.' Or sometimes he would say, you know, 'That was Nickelodeon,' or something like that. 'You're doing kid stuff.'\"",
      "And when that didn't work, \"He bought me a six-pack of beer and he goes, 'I want you to take this beer and do the scene in front of the mirror.' And I was like, 'I don't think I can do that \u2026 I'm gonna be too self-conscious.' He goes, 'That's what the beer's for.'\"",
      "Culkin got praise for \"Igby.\" But he wasn't sure he wanted to keep acting. For one thing, he was worried about becoming famous. \"Definitely. I feel like any rational person [who] got to experience fame second-hand, they would not pursue it. It's not a nice thing.\"",
      "His brother, Macauley, has become an international movie star at a young age. \"And I saw that and went, 'Oh, I got it. That's awful. Let's never do that!'\"",
      "Kieran worked on stage and only sporadically on film for years, before landing the part he's best known for: Roman Roy, the filterless, fast-talking middle child scheming to inherit a media empire in \"Succession.\"",
      "Even as a member of the fictional Roy family, though, Culkin's real family played a role. Back in 2008, his older sister, Dakota Culkin, was struck and killed by an automobile. He said, \"After a couple seasons on 'Succession,' I realized there was some stuff that Roman did that I was like, 'Oh, that's my sister. That was her sense of humor.' She could find exactly what the right thing to make fun of you was that would get to you, but be really funny and make the room laugh. That was her.\"",
      "Sixteen years later, the loss of his sister is still devastating. \"I only knew who I was because of who my siblings are,\" Kieran said. \"So, to lose one was losing a big piece of myself. Losing one of my favorite people in the world, it doesn't get easier. But you get used to it.\"",
      "Culkin's newest project is also about family. In the movie \"A Real Pain,\" he and Jesse Eisenberg (who wrote and directed) play cousins on a trip to Poland to see where their late beloved grandmother was raised \u2013 and the concentration camp she survived.",
      "Culkin's character, Benji, is a charming but rudderless man-child \u2026 a contrast to Eisenberg's straitlaced family man.",
      "Asked why he connected with the role, Culkin replied, \"I don't really know what it was with me, but I went, I instantly knew who this guy was. I understood the dynamic, and I really wanted to play.\"",
      "Describing the character, Culkin has said, \"I'm one quick little misstep away from being that person.\"",
      "\"That's good! I said that? Good!\" he laughed. \"I feel like I easily could've gone down that path. There was something in that that I recognized as myself, but I'm not that guy at all. But I think I'm worried that I easily could've become that guy, [had I not] married, kids, or figured out how to, you know, get my s*** together.\"",
      "Indeed, Culkin is not \"that guy.\" He's been married to his wife Jazz for 11 years. The couple has two children.",
      "Asked what he likes about being a dad, Culkin said, \"Oh, man, everything. Everything except dinnertime. Dinnertime's a terror. I've seen some kids sit and eat dinner, it's great. My kids sit and eat breakfast, they'll eat lunch, but dinner is just throwing things around the house, and it's very stressful.\"",
      "Kieran Culkin may be at the top of his game, but he says he's still figuring it out.",
      "\"There's different versions of success. I think for many years success, for me, was, like, working on projects I really like [that] nobody really sees. Fly under the radar, but keep getting to do what I do. And now I'm like, 'Well, now I gotta figure out how to do the jobs I want but also make money.' It's really hard to find the way to do that!\"",

      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",

      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",

      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

      "After four days there he was released. The doctors said lab tests showed it was a case of E. coli. His daughter interviewed with the Mesa County Health Department before leaving.",
      "\"(The health department worker) asked 'Where did my parents eat?' because there was some type of outbreak,\" Bonnell said. \"But they were not going to say where yet.\"",
      "Sometime after that hospitalization, Smith went back to the McDonald's and had another Quarter Pounder. This time, when he got symptoms again and went to the hospital, he wound up dying. His death was on Oct. 20.",
      "Smith was likely one of the first people to be identified as having a positive E. coli case in the nationwide outbreak.",
      "A strong, loving man",
      "Bonnell says her dad was a Marine veteran and wasn't slowing down in life.",
      "She also said before he got sick he just wanted to go and do things, even though they told her his feet can't move as well.",
      "He grew up in Mississippi and worked as a firefighter and later on a postal service employee. The couple moved to Colorado in the 1980s. In Colorado, he was a small business owner and then a maintenance manager at Vail Run Resort. He returned to the south for a stint but then moved back to Mesa County.",
      "This year marked JC and Doris's 70th year of marriage. They still took trips together and enjoyed playing with their great-grandchildren.",

      "Bonnell said she went over to her parents' house right away.",
      "\"They had been up all night. He had been in the bathroom all night, like every 10 minutes, and he had the bloody diarrhea and he was so weak,\" she said. \"When I got here he was so weak he couldn't walk.\"",
      "Following the four days at the hospital, the family wasn't aware that there was any specific restaurant they should avoid.",
      "Bonnell said, \"She just asked me, \"where were some places my parents ate\" because there was some type of outbreak.\"",

      "Two days after JC's death health officials reported the outbreak to the public.",
      "Sharing their story out of concern",
      "Jim Smith said, \"I was not planning on my dad going this quick.\"",
      "\"We still had lots of plans,\" he said.",
      "Smith's grandson Jim says his family is angry and they have questions about if more could have been done to save their beloved family member. But the reason they decided to speak publicly about what happened was because they are concerned for the health of others.",
      "\"If you are out there in that line of work \u2026 and you lose a level of concern or become complacent, accidents happen. Then you're going to be held accountable. And when you're talking about taking people's loved ones and changing their life permanently, others need to know,\" he said.",

      "McLoughlin was raised in Dublin as an only child. When at-home genetic testing became available in 2006, she signed up, and she discovered that she had a half-sister. Not long after that, there was another match.",
      "\"I just went, oh my God. We found our biological dad,\" she told CBS News. Within a few hours McLoughlin found a website belonging to her biological father and, later that same day, she called him.",
      "\"I know I've caught you off guard,\" McLoughlin told the man on the other end of the phone line. \"I have a million questions. You may have a million questions.\"",
      "Her biological father said the call came unexpectedly, but he did acknowledge donating sperm at a clinic in London years earlier. He said he thought the donation would remain anonymous, but he told McLoughlin that he welcomed her call.",
      "\"To hear this man say, 'you're very welcome,'\" McLoughlin told CBS News, \"I feel guilty, because I know that's not the happy ending that everyone gets.\"",
      "McLoughlin now hosts a podcast called You Look Like Me, which explores the lives of donor-conceived people. Some have faced the discovery of hundreds of half-siblings.",
      "A recent Netflix documentary highlighted the case of one prolific sperm donor from the Netherlands, Jonathan Jacob Meijer, who has fathered hundreds of children. Some of his donations may have reached the United States.",
      "Meijer told CBS News he believes he has about 550 children, but admitted it could be many more. The sperm banks he's used do not need to inform him how many children have resulted from his donations.",
      "In 2023, a court in the Netherlands banned a man, identified only as Jonathan M. under Dutch privacy laws, from donating any more sperm, saying he had fathered about 550 children. The court noted that under national guidelines, donors are allowed to produce a maximum of 25 children with 12 mothers, and the judge said the man had \"deliberately lied about\" the extent of his donations \"to persuade the parents to take him as a donor.\"",
      "\"Donor conceived people have been sounding the alarm on this for years,\" McLoughlin said. \"We are seeing men who are donating hundreds and thousands of times. They're doing it in small areas. They're doing it within the same kind of years. So you're ending up with kids who are growing up knowing each other or meeting each other in later adulthood, which is just incredibly, incredibly dangerous.\"",

More than 50 fertility doctors in the U.S. have been accused of using their own sperm to inseminate patients.",
      "\"We regulate gasoline more comprehensively, driving more comprehensively. And yet, here we're actually creating lives,\" Indiana Law Professor Jody Madeira said. She's trying to get a law passed in Indiana that would make fertility fraud a felony.",
      "Madeira said the U.S. was like the Wild West compared to European countries in terms of regulating sperm donations.",
      "\"If you think that something like, a guy with a thousand kids, donor conceived kids, is possible in Europe, then the chances are exponentially higher in the United States,\" she told CBS News.",
      "There are several known prolific sperm donors in America, including New Yorker Ari Nagal, who's said he has 165 kids, and is still counting.",
      "There are no national databases tracking sperm donations in America, nor is there a legal limit on how many donations a person can make. There is also no requirement for donors to disclose genetic medical conditions that could affect offspring.",
      "Madeira said it is possible to regulate sperm donations, but \"in the United States, our cultural orientation just prioritizes the market, and the industry, and the wishes of parents. Whereas in Europe, they prioritize the rights of donor conceived individuals.\"",

      "The two rate cuts so far this year, which have reduced the federal funds rate by a combined 0.75 percentage points, but the larger impact will be felt if the Fed continues to cut rates at its December meeting and into 2025, experts say.",
      "\"The Fed cutting rates a quarter point this month is more about a long-term trend,\" Christopher Clarke, a professor of economics at Washington State University, told CBS News. \"People should think about this as a half a point a month ago, a quarter point this month, a quarter point next month.\"",

      "While many economists expect an additional cut at the Fed's December meeting and more reductions in early 2025, any future moves by monetary policy makers appear more uncertain following the election amid concerns that some of Trump's key economic proposals could stoke inflation.",

    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",

      "Between finding openings, sending out your resume and interviewing, looking for a job is tough. Now a growing trend of\u00a0scammers\u00a0impersonating recruiters is making it even harder.",
      "In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised.",
      "Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.",
      "\"We've really seen tremendous growth in job scams,\" Velasquez said. \"I think that's just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.\"",
      "It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.",
      "After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she'd need for the job.",
      "A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That's when she learned the job was a scam.",
      "\"I'm a little traumatized,\" said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.",
      "If you're a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers:",
      "Job scams are a type of\u00a0impersonation scam.",
      "Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.",
      "\"They're going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,\" she said. \"And they're often saying it's a 100% remote position because that's so appealing to people.\"",
      "Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver's license details.",
      "The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.",
      "Other details don't generally need to be shared with an employer until after you've gotten an offer.",
      "Whether you're replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn't initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.",
      "Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.",
      "Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:",
      "\u2014 Don't respond to the message right away.",
      "\u2014 Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.",
      "\u2014 Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.",
      "\u2014 If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.",
      "If you receive a message from a recruiter, it's best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.",
      "In Islam's case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.",
      "A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\"If you deposit a check and it's fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,\" Puig said.",
      "So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.",
      "When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.",
      "\"Don't let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,\" Velasquez said.",
      "After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter's email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.",
      "\"This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can't just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,\" Islam said.",

      "Trump ran on a campaign that vowed to tackle those issues, pledging to end the \"inflation nightmare\"\u00a0and to bring prices down \"very quickly.\" He also offered a myriad of tax cuts to various groups, ranging from senior citizens to homeowners, as well as to finance some of those cuts through new tariffs on imports from China and other nations and to\u00a0deport millions of undocumented immigrants.",
      "In the aftermath of Trump's win, economists and policy experts are assessing how those policies might impact the economy as well as consumers' wallets. Already, Wall Street is predicting that his policies could boost corporate growth, sending the S&P 500 higher by as much as 2.2% on Wednesday.",

      "Trump also wants to provide deeper tax cuts for some individuals and businesses, with his campaign proposing lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%. He's floated the idea of eliminating personal income taxes on many types of earnings, from tips to Social Security benefits, but has yet to offer details.",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts, would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "If Trump is able to enact these tax code changes, personal income taxes would decline for all income groups. But the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model (That research assesses Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.)",
      "That means a middle-class family with earnings of about $80,000 a year would get a tax break of about $1,740 in 2026, the analysis found. Top-earning households, with incomes of more than $14 million, would see their taxes reduced by $376,910, according to Penn Wharton.",
      "What could happen with inflation?",
      "Consumers rank inflation as one of their biggest economic concerns, with many still feeling impact of soaring prices during the pandemic. Although the U.S. inflation rate has now fallen close to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal, many Americans still describe it as high because prices haven't come down; rather, prices are simply rising more slowly than they did during the pandemic.",
      "Economists have cautioned that Trump's plans could reignite inflation. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by American consumers, rather than the countries that export goods to the U.S. On top of that, Trump's plan to deport millions of immigrants could also boost inflation as employers would likely face higher wages due to a labor crunch.",
      "\"Two main pillars of his policy proposals, tariffs and mass deportations, are likely to cause prices to rise as they will make it more difficult for businesses to produce goods,\" Jacob Channel, chief economist at LendingTree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Trump's plan to levy a 10% tariff on all imports and 60% or more on Chinese goods shipped to the U.S. could add $1,700 a year in additional costs for a typical middle-class household, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump's plans could boost the inflation rate by as much 1 percentage point, bringing it to an annual rate of about 3.4% \u2014 above the Fed's 2% goal \u2014 according to Andrzej Skiba of RBC Global Asset Management.",
      "\"If you add 1% to next year's inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts,\" Skiba said.",
      "Could the economy grow faster?",
      "The economy could initially grow slightly faster under Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes, but that impact could fade over time, especially due to the impact of deporting millions of immigrants, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Real GDP growth could be 0.3 percentage points higher in 2026 than if current economic policies continued, wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a November 6 research note.",
      "But, he added, GDP growth could eventually fall to 0.6 percentage points lower in 2028 than earlier projections due to the impact of deportations and higher tariffs.",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Probably not, according to Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant.",
      "First, if Trump's plans reignite inflation as some economists are forecasting, the Federal Reserve may not continue lowering its benchmark rate. Without further cuts in borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, mortgage rates aren't likely to fall, she added.",
      "Second, deporting millions of undocumented immigrants could impact the housing sector \u2014 which already faces a severe shortage of homes \u2014 because it relies on these workers to build new homes, Sturtevant said.",
      "\"His mass deportation proposal would have a chilling effect on the construction industry, shrinking the already constrained labor force and stalling badly needed new housing construction,\" she said. \"At the same time, proposed tariffs will increase building costs.\"",
      "Will Trump's policies help your 401(k)?",
      "Possibly, given that Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts and support for lighter regulations on businesses, if enacted, could bolster company profits and lift the stock market.",
      "On Wednesday, indices including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average,\u00a0soared on Wall Street optimism for stronger corporate growth.",
      "\"Lower corporate taxes and/or deregulation of the energy and financial sectors under a Trump administration could provide additional support,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Other financial instruments could also get a boost, including cryptocurrencies, due to Trump's pledge to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "At the same time, much of these forecasts depend on Trump pushing through changes to the tax code, regulations and other laws, Channel noted.",
      "\"Virtually all of these policies will be tough to implement, even with Republican control over the House, the Senate and the presidency,\" he said. \"With that in mind, we might not see much change at all in the broader economy.\"",
      "He added, \"Inaction from the next Trump administration could mean that the economy continues to chug along its current course.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",
      "\"Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant,\" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release.",
      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association said Thursday it was \"disappointed\" in the FDA's proposal. The industry trade group renewed its claim that no changes \"are warranted\" for oral phenylephrine and cited previous FDA and advisory committee decisions that did not call for pulling the ingredient.",

      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",
      "The researchers also have questioned the initial studies that were run to prove the drug's effectiveness, though they acknowledge that it is safe at currently approved levels.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

      "During President-elect Trump's first term in office, his administration imposed tariffs of up to 25% on more than $360 billion in products from China. President Joe Biden's White House kept most of those tariffs and added more onto goods including Chinese electric cars and microchips.",
      "Now, Trump has said he plans to impose a 60% tax on goods from China and a 10% to 20% levy on all of the $3 trillion in foreign goods the U.S. imports annually. Such sweeping tariffs would reignite inflation, as they would mostly be paid by U.S. consumers, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, offering a general view widely\u00a0shared by\u00a0other economists on both sides of the political aisle.",
      "\"A consistent theoretical and empirical finding in economics is that domestic consumers and domestic firms bear the burden of a tariff, not the foreign country,\" the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University stated in an\u00a0analysis published in mid-October.",

In reality, American importers pay the tariffs to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency when their goods cross the border.",
      "\"These policy steps would amount to regressive tax cuts, only partially paid for by regressive tax increases,\" and cost a typical middle-income household about $1,700 in increased taxes a year,\" according to economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The proposed tariffs would shift tax burdens from the well-off to lower-income Americans, the nonprofit also stated in a policy\u00a0brief\u00a0published in August.",
      "For now, it is unclear when the new Trump regime could seek to stiffen tariffs. The process to complete legislation required to raise the levies could take nearly a year, so any adverse impact might not be felt until 2026, according to Oxford Economics.",

      "\"If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer,\" Philip Daniele, CEO of vehicle parts supplier AutoZone,\u00a0told\u00a0Wall Street analysts in an earnings call in late September. \"We'll generally raise prices ahead of \u2014 we know what the tariffs will be \u2014 we generally raise prices ahead of that,\" Daniele said.",

      "The Federal Reserve on Thursday made its second rate cut of this year, with the decision coming less than two months after the central bank's surprise jumbo cut in September.",
      "The Fed shaved borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage points, or half the size of its September reduction, according to its Thursday\u00a0statement. That brings down the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for borrowing money \u2014 to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level.",
      "With the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure dropping to 2.1% last month, just shy of the Fed's 2% goal, the central bank is easing off the brakes it applied when inflation hit a 40-year high during the pandemic. High borrowing costs have made it more expensive to buy everything from homes to cars.",
      "The Fed's 0.25 percentage point cut will provide some added relief for consumers, although the initial benefit will be small, experts say. The Fed is expected to continue cutting rates at its next several meetings, which could snowball into bigger savings for borrowers.",
      "\"Once a few more cuts happen over the next few months, the impact will add up to something that moves the needle for the average person struggling with debt,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, in an email. \"For now, however, the effect of these cuts won't be very noticeable.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Thursday's Fed meeting.",
      "What time is the Fed rate decision?",
      "The Fed\u00a0announced its decision at 2 p.m. ET on Nov. 7. That is followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m.",

      "How will the election impact the Fed's decision?",
      "The November 7 meeting is the first Fed rate decision since the Nov. 5 election propelled former\u00a0President Donald Trump to victory.",
      "Although Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is likely to be asked about the potential impact of Trump's policies on monetary policy and the economy during today's press conference, Powell has generally shied away from direct commentary on White House administrations. Instead, he has stressed the independence of the central bank and that its officials make their decisions based on data, not politics.",
      "Even so, Trump's policies could make the Fed's job more difficult, given that the president-elect's combination of tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants is expected to boost prices by as much as 1 percentage point at a time when inflation is close to the Fed's goal of an annual 2% rate.",
      "If Trump's policies reignite inflation, the Fed would be hard-pressed to continuing easing borrowing costs, and could instead be forced to raise rates to counter those inflationary pressures.",
      "How low will rates go in 2024?",
      "The Fed is expected to cut its benchmark rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its December meeting. That would reflect a full percentage point cut from its pre-September level, when the federal funds rate was at its highest in more than two decades.",
      "But that doesn't mean mortgage rates or other borrowing costs will decline to that level, as lenders like mortgage companies and credit card companies make money by charging higher terms to consumers than the federal funds rate.",
      "Even so, borrowers should see some relief. Already, credit card rates are slightly lower, although they still remain close to record highs, according to Schulz.",
      "\"While they'll almost certainly continue to fall in coming months, no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon,\" he added. \"Unless the Fed dramatically accelerates its pace of rate cuts, it'll still be a while before these reductions add up to more than just a few dollars per month coming off your bill.\"",
      "Will mortgage rates drop?",
      "Despite the Fed's September cut, mortgage rates have increased over the last month, with the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan sitting at about 6.72%, according to Freddie Mac. That's up from a September low of 6.08%.",
      "Even though the Fed's rate decisions impact mortgage rates, home borrowing costs are also affected by economic trends such as unemployment. Meanwhile, Treasury yields have been on the rise due to concerns about rising U.S. debt and the presidential election.",

      "In 2020, the S&P 500 fell 0.04% from July 31 to October 31, with then-President Donald Trump losing the election to President Joe Biden. While the outcome in the 2024 election is not yet known, the S&P 500 rose 3.3% during that three-month span this year.",
      "\"You can say there is sort of an overlap \u2014 the market usually goes up on an annual basis and voters tend to give the incumbent the benefit of the doubt, so it makes sense if the market goes up most of the time and the incumbent gets re-elected most of the time,\" Stovall told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even more reliable are periods when the stock market falls during the period from July 31 to October 31, in which case the incumbent has been replaced 89% of the time. That predictor failed only once, in 1956, according to Stovall, pointing to the year when incumbent President Dwight Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson, despite the S&P 500 tumbling 7.7% in the period ahead of the election.",

He was a master merchant and a retail visionary,\" Atlanta-based Home Depot said in a statement. \"But even more importantly, he valued our associates, customers and communities above all. He's left us with an invaluable legacy and the backbone of our company: our values and culture.\"",
      "He died on Monday at his home in Boca Raton, Florida, surrounded by his family, a company spokesperson said.",
      "The billionaire, a major donor to Republican politicians, accumulated his fortune by starting The Home Depot with Arthur Blank in 1978, with the two building the hardware store into a giant retail chain that now operates 2,300 stores and employs more than 500,000.",
      "Marcus was the CEO of Home Depot until 1997 and served as its chairman until he retired in 2002. Bank retired from Home Depot in 2001 after serving as president, CEO and co-chairman.",
      "Marcus had a net worth of $7.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "An outspoken supporter of former President Donald Trump, Marcus and his spouse contributed $7 million to committees backing Trump's 2016 campaign and nearly $8 million to Republicans in the 2018 midterms. As of September, he gave more than $1.8 million to back Trump in the current cycle.",
      "Marcus in 2022 told the Financial Times he was worried about the future of capitalism, telling the newspaper he faulted \"socialism\" in America for people not wanting to work. \"Nobody gives a damn. 'Just give it to me. Send me money. I don't want to work \u2014 I'm too lazy, I'm too fat, I'm too stupid'.\"",
      "He founded the Jerusalem-based Israel Democracy Institute in 1991, and in 2003 gave $250 million to the state of Georgia to finance its aquarium in Atlanta.",
      "Born in 1929 to Russian Jewish immigrants in Newark, New Jersey, Marcus grew up poor. He wanted to become a doctor but instead trained to become a pharmacist, graduating from Rutgers University in 1954.",
      "In addition to his wife, Billi, Marcus is survived by three children.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 12:36:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Harris and Trump both have proposed historically large tax overhauls. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both proposing tax changes that would rank among the largest in U.S. history, but their plans would impact very different groups of Americans by providing tax credits and cuts to some taxpayers, while raising taxes on others.",
      "While taxes are always on the ballot during an presidential election, the 2024 race has even more at stake given that many provisions in Trump's signature tax legislation, the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, will expire at the end of 2025. If Trump wins, he's expected to extend many of those provisions, while Harris has vowed to only keep those that help people earning under $400,000.",
      "At the same time, both candidates have sought to curry favor with some groups of voters by promising specific tax cuts and credits, such as Harris' plan to introduce a $6,000 Child Tax Credit for parents of newborns. Trump, meanwhile, has dangled a host of tax cuts to everyone from senior citizens (promising to get rid of income taxes on Social Security) to tipped workers (vowing to eliminate taxes on tips).",
      "But Trump is also proposing across-the-board tariffs on all imports, a plan that would effectively act as a sales tax on American consumers. That's because the countries that manufacture products imported to the U.S. do not pay tariffs; rather, tariffs are added to the prices of imported products that American consumers purchase.",
      "Here's what to know about how their tax plans stack up.",
      "Would Trump cut or raise your taxes?",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts \u2014 including cutting the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21% \u2014 would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "However, Trump's tax cuts would require Congressional approval, which could prove to be a hurdle if at least one of the chambers is controlled by Democrats.",
      "If Trump is unable to enact his tax cuts but adds his proposed tariffs \u2014 which don't need a Congressional greenlight \u2014 he would instead be introducing the seventh-biggest tax increase since 1940, the Tax Foundation says. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by U.S. consumers, with the typical household paying about $1,700 more each year in additional costs, according to one estimate.",
      "Meanwhile, income taxes would decline under Trump for all income groups, but the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Their analysis includes Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.",
      "Would Harris cut or raise your taxes?",
      "Harris is proposing a mix of tax cuts, tax increases and expanded tax credits that together would rank as the 15th largest tax increase since 1940, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "However, the impact would be greater on higher-income households, given that she has vowed to not raise taxes on those earning less than $400,000. Her tax increases would also be targeted at businesses, as she wants to boost the corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.",
      "Most low- and middle-income households would actually get a tax break under her proposals, but high-income households would pay substantially more in income taxes than they currently do, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model.",
      "The top 0.1%, or those earning more than $14 million a year, would see their taxes increase by about $167,000 a year.",
      "What are Harris and Trump proposing for families?",
      "Harris wants to expand the Child Tax Credit from its current $2,000 to $6,000 for children up to a year old, $3,600 for kids between 1 to 6, and $3,000 for those between 6 to 17.",
      "Low-income households with kids would receive an additional $2,750 on average from Harris' expanded CTC, according to a Tax Policy Center\u00a0analysis.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's vice presidential candidate, JD Vance, has floated the idea of a $5,000 CTC, but the campaign hasn't introduced more details, according to the Tax Policy Center. If Trump extends the TCJA, the CTC would remain at $2,000 per eligible child.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for taxes on Social Security?",
      "Harris hasn't proposed any tax cuts for Social Security beneficiaries, while Trump has floated eliminating federal income taxes on the retirement payments.",
      "Trump's plan would mostly help middle- and high-income retirees, given that low-income retirees often don't make enough to pay federal income tax on their benefits, according to tax experts. The biggest boost would go to retirees earning between $63,000 and $200,000, the Tax Policy Center estimates.",
      "At the same time, Trump's tax cut would likely hasten the insolvency of the Social Security trust fund, which relies on those income taxes for funding, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Retirees would also be facing a bigger benefit cut, up to 33% of their monthly checks rather than the 23% currently forecast, when the trust fund is exhausted, the group estimates.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for business taxes?",
      "Harris wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.",
      "By comparison, Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%.",
      "\"Nowhere do the candidates' tax plans differ more,\" noted Howard Gleckman, senior fellow of the Tax Policy Center, in a November 1 blog post.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for taxes on overtime and tips?",
      "One place where the candidates converge is on cutting taxes for people who work for tips. Both have portrayed the idea as helping workers with families.",
      "But Trump is also proposing other tax cuts for workers, such as a plan to get rid of federal income taxes on overtime income.",
      "What other tax changes are Harris and Trump proposing?",
      "Harris wants to help people buy homes and start businesses by creating a new $25,000 first-time homebuyers credit and expanding the deduction for startup business expenses from $5,000 to $50,000.",
      "Trump has also proposed making the interest for auto loans tax deductible, a move that would primarily help higher-income taxpayers who itemize their deductions.",

      "The current annual salary for a U.S. senator \u2014 as well as members of the U.S. House of Representatives \u2014 is $174,000. The government-paid salary, set in 2009, reflects a $4,700 pay bump from 2008, but has not been raised since.",

      "Unlike individuals in other professions, Congress essentially has direct control over the salary of its members, in the sense that any raise or decrease in member compensation must be \"ascertained by Law\" according to\u00a0Article I, Section 6\u00a0\u00a0of the U.S. Constitution. Checks and balances in the legislative process surrounding compensation, however, keep members from giving themselves million-dollar pay raises each year.",
      "\"A change in salary must be done via a bill or joint resolution, both of which are presented to the President for a signature. Thus, the President could veto a bill changing Members' salaries if he thought it inappropriate,\" explains a 2019 report from the Congressional Institute.",
      "That said, perhaps the most powerful protection against inflated salaries in Congress is the ballot box, and the voting public's general skepticism toward increases in Senate pay.",
      "\"Members know constituents are skeptical of congressional pay increases, so they hate voting for them,\" according to the Congressional Institute.",
      "Do senators get a cost of living adjustment?",
      "In spite of public scrutiny, Congress has managed to keep itself among the highest paying professions.",
      "After public outrage quashed a brash attempt by Congress to increase member pay by 51% in early 1989, a more modest hike of 10% was passed through The Ethics Reform Act of 1989, signed into law by President George Bush on Nov. 30, 1989.",
      "Described by CQ Almanac at the time as \"the most sweeping rewrite of the congressional code of conduct in 12 years,\" the legislation allowed salaries for congressional members to reach $125,000 in 1991, a nearly 40% increase from the $89,500 salary that had been set in 1987.",
      "The ethics reform also established an annual automatic cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for members of Congress\u00a0based on the previous year's Employment Cost Index, an increase they have refused since 2009 \u2014 likely to avoid blowback from voters.",
      "If Congress had accepted each of those increases over the years, their annual salary would have reached $208,000 in 2023, as previously\u00a0reported by CBS News. Meanwhile, a report by Congressional Research Service\u00a0 estimates senators are actually making 29% less than they were in 2009 because of inflation.",

      "But pay raises can come in less obvious forms, such as subsidies. As reported last January by the New York Times, a provision passed by Congress in late 2022 allowed lawmakers to claim reimbursements for gas, food and lodging while on official business in Washington \u2014 the equivalent of a $34,000 tax-free pay raise, according to the Times.",

      "1789: $25,000 ($895,741)1873: $50,000 ($1.3 million)1909: $75,000 ($2.6 million)1949: $100,000 (plus $50,000 taxable expense account) ($1.3 million)1969: $200,000 (plus $50,000 taxable expense account) ($1.7 million)",
      "More money in memoirs",
      "It's worth noting that presidents remain on the federal government's payroll after leaving The White House too. Since 1958, former presidents have earned an annual pension, which now amounts to more than $200,000. They also get office space in a place of their choosing and travel expenses, according to the Former Presidents Act of 1958.",

      "Ulysses S. Grant was the first U.S. president to write a memoir, which he famously finished only days before his death in 1885. Virtually every modern president, with the exception of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, both of whom died while in office, has written a memoir.",
      "\"It's where a lot of money comes from after they have been president,\" Barbara Perry, co-chair of the Presidential Oral History Program at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Written memoirs have earned them millions.\"",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve announced its second interest rate cut of 2024, but Trump's economic priorities could impact future policy.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Thursday announced its second interest rate cut of 2024, trimming its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points amid cooling inflation. The expected move by the U.S. central bank provides additional relief to millions of Americans grappling with high borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed cut, half the size of its September reduction, lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level.",
      "The announcement marks the Fed's first interest rate decision since President-elect Donald Trump secured another term in the White House\u00a0following the Nov. 5 election. In\u00a0exit polls\u00a0on Tuesday, many voters reported that they're still hurting from the sharpest inflation in 40 years and expressed dissatisfaction with the nation's economic trajectory.",

      "\"Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.\"",
      "The two rate cuts so far this year, which have reduced the federal funds rate by a combined 0.75 percentage points, but the larger impact will be felt if the Fed continues to cut rates at its December meeting and into 2025, experts say.",
      "\"The Fed cutting rates a quarter point this month is more about a long-term trend,\" Christopher Clarke, a professor of economics at Washington State University, told CBS News. \"People should think about this as a half a point a month ago, a quarter point this month, a quarter point next month.\"",
      "He added, \"Overall, we're expecting a whole percentage point this year and another percentage point next year, so that's going to lower interest rates on auto loans, mortgages, credit cards, et cetera.\"",

      "Will Trump win affect the Fed's thinking?",
      "While many economists expect an additional cut at the Fed's December meeting and more reductions in early 2025, any future moves by monetary policy makers appear more uncertain following the election amid concerns that some of Trump's key economic proposals could stoke inflation.",
      "\"With additional inflation and employment data in, the Fed went 25 basis points as expected.

      "Trump ally and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani got a tongue lashing Thursday in federal court after missing a deadline to turn over valuables to two election workers he defamed, including one asset, a vintage Mercedes, that he took for a drive to vote in Florida. He owes the women, Ruby Freeman and daughter Wandrea Moss, millions in damages.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman, upon being informed that Giuliani is the only person listed on a document who has knowledge of his assets \u2014 and that he wants his name removed \u2014 called the request \"farcical.\"",
      "\"My expectation is you're going to answer that question truthfully and fully,\" Liman said, adding that someone else \"in the world\" must have knowledge of Giuliani's various assets.",
      "Hearings in the matter were being conducted remotely, but Liman ordered Giuliani to appear Thursday in person after learning that Giuliani ha not met his obligations to the two women. Lawyers for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea Moss, said they went to Giuliani's Manhattan apartment last week and discovered that it had been emptied out, frustrating their efforts to catalog and obtain his assets.",
      "\"That's the one piece of property sitting here in Manhattan that can't be moved. Everything else has been game playing,\" said Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for Freeman and Moss.",
      "\"We've asked over and over where this stuff is, and the defendant has refused to answer,\" Nathan said.",
      "Kenneth Caruso, one of Giuliani's lawyers, said some of the items are now in a storage facility in suburban Ronkonkoma, New York, and claimed Giuliani has \"no control\" of it.",
      "Liman warned Caruso to \"consider your words\" about access to the storage facility, because it could end up the subject of a contempt hearing if Giuliani doesn't turn over the property he owes.",
      "A jury in December 2023 awarded the pair $148 million in damages for lies Giuliani spread about them after the 2020 presidential election. The massive award sent Giuliani into bankruptcy, and entitled the defamed women to much of what he owns.",
      "Asked by a reporter after Thursday's hearing if he regretted defaming Freeman and Moss, Giuliani exclaimed, \"No!\" He then denied defaming them.",
      "Liman had given Giuliani until Oct. 29 to surrender a long list of possessions, including the Mercedes, two dozen high-end watches, a jersey signed by New York Yankees Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio \u2014 long featured prominently above the fireplace in Giuliani's $5 million apartment \u2014 as well as other furniture and sports memorabilia. The women are also entitled to some $2 million that Giuliani has said President-elect Trump's 2020 campaign owes him.",
      "In another tense moment, Caruso called it \"vindictive\" that Giuliani must turn over a watch that's an heirloom previously owned by his grandfather. Liman raised his voice, saying \"Oh, come on,\" before pointing to other cases he hears regularly, such as people \"who run bodegas and short their employees' wages.\"",
      "\"If they have a debt, they have to pay the debt. It doesn't matter if it's an heirloom.\" Liman said. He later said Moss and Freeman had been willing to let Giuliani keep the watch, but he never filed paperwork asking to do so.",
      "Giuliani was in the passenger's seat of a Mercedes convertible that appeared to be the 1980 classic once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall when he arrived to vote in Florida on Tuesday.",
      "Later that day, a spokesperson for the former New York City mayor and disbarred ex-attorney for Trump seemed to confirm it was the same vehicle, and said they've attempted to turn it over.",
      "In court on Thursday, Kenneth Caruso, a lawyer for Giuliani, said he believed the half century old car could be appraised as being worth less than $4,000. He noted that a court order allows him to keep a vehicle to that value.",
      "Caruso had asked Liman to allow Giuliani to attend the hearing remotely, as he had previously. Caruso said Giuliani is under contract to do evening radio appearances on Thursdays and Fridays. Caruso said Giuliani uses \"broadcasting equipment\" in his Florida home.",
      "Liman rejected that request. On Thursday, he gave lawyers for the women until Nov. 11 to instruct Giuliani on how to turn over his property, and Giuliani four days after to comply.",

      "The presidential election was seen by many as a referendum on women's rights. Trump has been found liable for sexual abuse\u00a0and defamation, and his vice president, former Ohio senator JD Vance, has previously referred to some women as \"childless cat ladies.\" The Harris campaign also ran on a platform of supporting a woman's right to abortion, something that has been jeopardized in many states after the fall of Supreme Court decision\u00a0Roe v. Wade, which Trump has taken credit for.",
      "Now, some women are swearing to abide by the code of the \"4B movement,\" a South Korean feminist approach that swears off men. Here's what to know about the 4B movement.",
      "What is the 4B movement?",
      "In short, the 4B movement is a vow to swear off men. It is called the 4B movement because in Korean, the four tenets each begin with bi, which means no, according to a paper published by two South Korean researchers at Yonsei University's Institute of Humanities.",
      "The movement specifically calls for the refusal of dating men (biyeonae), sexual relationships with men (bisekseu), heterosexual marriage (bihon), and childbirth (bichulsan) in response to what South Korean women see as a patriarchal and misogynistic culture. The movement is also known as the \"4 Nos.\"",
      "The 4B movement began in 2017 and gained more attention in 2019, amid a\u00a0#MeToo-style reckoning in South Korea. Much of the movement has been built online, where participants call themselves \"anonymous women\" and share few personal details. It has no official leadership structure.",
      "Women in the nation have fought against what Human Rights Watch calls \"shockingly widespread\" gender-based violence and called for harsher penalties for what's called \"spy cam porn.\" They have also criticized the country's extreme gender wage gap, which saw women paid 31.2% less than men in 2022, according to the KoreaTimes, and called out hiring discrimination and harassment in the workplace.",
      "What impact has the 4B movement had in South Korea?",
      "The 4B movement has been controversial in South Korea. The country's president Yoon Suk-yeol said in 2021 that feminist movements were \"blocking healthy relationships\" between men and women in the nation.",
      "The nation has been battling a declining birth rate for several years, which some credit to the 4B movement, according to The New York Times.",

      "Since the election, multiple far-right figures have made alarming statements about women's rights on social media. White nationalist Nick Fuentes, who dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, wrote \"Your body, my choice. Forever.\" in a widely-criticized post on X.

      "\"Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,\" President Biden said. \"A defeat does not mean we are defeated.\"",
      "He urged Americans to embrace unity, and said he accepted the results of the election.",
      "\"We accept the choice the country made,\" he said. \"I've said many times, you can't love your country only when you win. You can't love your neighbor only when you agree,\" and he called for unity after the bitterly partisan election.",

She gave her whole heart and effort, and she and her entire team should be proud of the campaign they ran.\"",
      "It was only four months ago that Mr. Biden was seeking reelection himself, before exiting the race and passing the baton to Harris. Now, he'll be handing off to Trump.",
      "The president also said he hopes this election quiets doubts about the integrity of the election and election workers, a reference to misinformation spread by Trump and Republicans about the 2020 election.",
      "\"I also hope we can lay to rest the question about the integrity of the American electoral system \u2014 it is honest, it is fair, and it is transparent,\" Mr. Biden said. \"And it can be trusted, win or lose.\"",

      "Throughout the campaign, Mr. Biden repeatedly framed a possible Trump return to the White House as a threat to democracy, and the two men have been bitter rivals since they faced off in the 2020 presidential election.

      "The Constitution rules that even if the terms aren't consecutive, a person can only hold the office of the president twice.",
      "Here's everything to know about presidential term limits.",
      "How many terms can someone serve as president?",
      "A person can serve two four-year terms as president, as outlined in the Constitution's 22nd Amendment. The terms do not have to be consecutive.",
      "A vice president who serves as president can run for two terms after that service if they held the office of president for less than two years. So if a vice president took the office of president one year into a term, they could only run for office one more time. If they took power in the back half of the term, they could be elected to the presidency twice. In recent history, President Lyndon Johnson took over in 1963 when President John F. Kennedy was killed, making him eligible to run in 1964 and 1968. He ultimately opted not to run in 1968, although he was in the race until after the New Hampshire primary.",

      "But this means that Donald Trump, who was elected to office in 2016 and in 2024, cannot be elected president again in 2028.",
      "Has anyone been president for more than two terms?",
      "Only one person has served more than two terms as president: Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was the longest-sitting president in United States history, serving from 1933 to 1945.",
      "That third term led to controversy, according to the National Constitution Center. The nation's first president, George Washington, had established a precedent of only two terms in office per president, and some saw Roosevelt's break from tradition as a threat to democracy.",
      "In 1947, Congress approved the 22nd amendment. The amendment was ratified in February 1951.",
      "How many times can someone run for president?",
      "There's no limit to how many times someone can run for president.",
      "There have been more than a few perennial candidates for president throughout American history. Harold Stassen, a former governor of Minnesota, ran for president as a Republican candidate nine times between 1944 and 1992. Lyndon LaRouche ran for president in eight consecutive elections between 1976 and 2004 \u2014 once as the candidate for the U.S. Labor Party, which he had founded, and seven times as a candidate for the Democratic party.",
      "What Trump has said about term limits",
      "Trump has made a number of comments about term limits and his time in office, although it's unclear if he was serious. In July, he repeatedly told attendees at a conservative Christian event that they wouldn't \"have to vote anymore\" if he was elected to office in 2024. Some saw the comments as a threat to not leave office after a second term.",
      "\"Christians, get out in vote. Just this time,\" he said during a speech at the Believers' Summit, an event hosted by the conservative advocacy group Turning Point Action. \"You won't have to do it anymore. Four more years. You know what? It'll be fixed. It'll be fine. You won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.\"",

      "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014\u00a0Former President Donald Trump's projected win of the presidency has many in Minnesota wondering what the next steps will be for Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris gave her concession speech Wednesday afternoon from Howard University in Washington, D.C. Though Walz did not speak at the event, he was asked what was next as he left the rally. His reply: \"Minnesota.\"",
      "Walz, 60, returned to his state Wednesday evening to continue to serve his second term as governor of Minnesota. Peggy Flanagan, who would have stepped into the governorship had Walz's ticket won, will remain lieutenant governor.",
      "Walz has two years left on his term. For the remainder of the term, he may have a harder time getting policies passed compared to the accomplishments made during the landmark 2023 session.",
      "As of now, control for the Minnesota House is up in the air after Republicans were able to flip three seats, achieving a rare tie, with several other races likely heading to a recount \u2014 meaning the Democratic \"trifecta\" of power in the state is over.",
      "Minnesota election results and maps show live vote count",
      "Minnesota election results and maps show live vote count",
      "Larry Jacobs, a politics professor at the University of Minnesota, elaborated further.",
      "\"The wheels of the DFL progressive bus just came to a screeching halt,\" he said. \"The DFL is not going to be able to move big budgets and big programmatic ideas as they did in 2023. The Republicans are either going to have a tie in the House, in which case they can stymie things, or they'll have the majority in which they'll vote down whatever the DFL sends them that involves more taxes, more spending, more regulation. So this is a big, big win for the Republicans.\"",
      "Walz has not indicated whether or not he would run again for governor.",
      "Walz releases statement",
      "Following Trump's win, Walz released a statement on social media.",
      "\"Thank you Vice President Kamala Harris for putting your faith in me, and selecting me as your running mate. Campaigning at your side was the honor and privilege of my life. While the outcome is not what we wanted, I am grateful to the millions of Americans who joined our campaign and stood up for our greatest ideals: decency, compassion, and love of our neighbor.  Now more than ever, we need you to continue fighting for those values and the country we all love.\"",
      "What is Walz's likely path as a politician at this point?",
      "Hamline University professor and political expert David Schultz told WCCO he believes not only has Walz's path for national politics most likely ended, but his path in Minnesota politics is also \"just about coming to an end.\"",
      "At the state level, Walz's prospects of winning a third term as governor don't look promising.",
      "\"With the exception of Rudy Perpich, no governor in Minnesota since post-WWII has successfully run and been elected to a third term as governor,\" Schultz said. \"The chances of him deciding to run and win become complicated for him.\"",
      "At a national level, Schultz said analysts will be looking for reasons why Harris lost.",
      "\"Some are going to point to Walz as the choice for vice president,\" Schultz said. \"That he didn't resonate with those voters in Pennsylvania or Wisconsin or Michigan. That becomes one issue to think about here.\"",
      "Several vice presidents have eventually run for president \u2014 like Minnesota's Walter Mondale and Hubert Humphrey \u2014 but that's after they have already been part of a winning ticket on the national level.",
      "Schultz also notes the percentage of the popular vote that Walz has received has steadily gone down since he first ran for governor. That also includes the 2024 presidential election.",
      "\"Harris got fewer percentage of the vote than Presiden Biden did, wins fewer counties than Biden did, so I think his path in terms of a future in Minnesota politics is difficult,\" Schultz said.",
      "Walz provided a final address on a national platform before the election on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" Monday night, where he underscored the Harris campaign's focus on Pennsylvania, the hotly contested battleground state that Trump eventually won, along with its 19 electoral votes.",
      "During a rally in La Crosse, Wisconsin earlier that day, Walz told the audience that if Harris and he defeat Trump, voters \"aren't ever going to have to see this guy on TV again and listen to him.\"",
      "Walz stressed that the future of American democracy is at stake.",
      "\"The thing is upon us now, folks. I know there is a lot of anxiety. The decisions over the next 24-36 hours will shape not just the next four years, they will shape the coming generations,\" Walz said.",
      "During his time as governor, Walz experienced several major crises. In his first term, he faced harsh criticism from Republicans amid the dual dilemmas of the COVID-19 pandemic and\u00a0the violent uprising that followed the murder of George Floyd\u00a0in Minneapolis in 2020.",
      "Before serving as governor, Walz led Minnesota's 1st Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2006 to 2019. Prior to his political career, the Nebraska native served in the Army National Guard for nearly a quarter century.",

The staffers, aide Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, also pleaded not guilty.",

Smith appealed the ruling, and both sides have submitted filings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on the issue.",

He was convicted on allegations of falsifying business records in an effort to hide a $130,000 payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 election.",

Officials in Mr. Biden's camp later attributed the president's lackluster performance to a cold, which they said he'd had for several days, but Americans and some party and government leaders questioned whether the debate was a sign the 81-year-old politician would not be fit enough to serve a second term.",
      "The Butler assassination attempt",
      "While Mr. Biden faced mounting pressures to end his reelection campaign after the debate, there was another startling turn of events as\u00a0Trump was shot while speaking to a crowd of supporters from the podium of his July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The assassination attempt against the former president left him with a graze wound to his ear, and killed one spectator at the rally and critically injured two others as Secret Service agents quickly rushed Trump from the stage.

      "\"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\"",

      "\"'I don't know what's wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?'\" Harris said, quoting her mother. \"You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.\"",

At 17, he enlisted in the National Guard, serving for 24 years. He used his GI Bill benefits to go to college, and become a teacher. He served as both the football coach and the adviser of the Gay-Straight Alliance.\"",
      "Second apparent assassination attempt",
      "In September, a man was taken into custody after allegedly pointing a high-powered rifle at the Florida golf course where Trump was playing.

      "Trump and Harris sparred in a contentious presidential debate in Philadelphia on Sept. 11. The debate, hosted by ABC, saw the two candidates slashing over key issues like abortion rights, immigration, the economy and foreign policy.",
      "\"They're eating the dogs ... they're eating the cats\"",
      "Among a medley of blatant falsehoods and baseless claims made by Trump during his debate against Harris was one that stood out from the rest. While speaking about immigration, the former president repeated a story that had been circulating on social media that alleged that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were abducting and eating people's pets.",
      "Trump, Vance and others had already amplified those rumors prior to the debate, where Trump doubled down, saying: \"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs \u2014 the people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating \u2014 they're eating the pets of the people that live there and this is what's happening in our country, and it's a shame.\"",

      "Madison Square Garden rally draws outcry",
      "As the presidential race neared a close at the end of October, Trump held a campaign rally at\u00a0Madison Square Garden\u00a0in New York City and vowed to win his home state in the election (which didn't happen).

    "summary": "Former President Donald Trump's election victory\u200b and looming return to the White House will likely bring changes that scale back the nation's public health insurance programs.",
    "story": [
      "Former President Donald Trump's election victory and looming return to the White House will likely bring changes that scale back the nation's public health insurance programs \u2014 increasing the uninsured rate, while imposing new barriers to abortion and other reproductive care.",
      "The reverberations will be felt far beyond Washington, D.C., and could include an erosion of the Affordable Care Act's consumer protections, the imposition of work requirements in Medicaid and funding cuts to the safety net insurance, and challenges to federal agencies that safeguard public health. Abortion restrictions may tighten nationwide with a possible effort to restrict the mailing of abortion medications.",
      "And with the elevation of vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Trump's inner circle of advisers, public health interventions with rigorous scientific backing \u2014 whether fluoridating public water supplies or inoculating children \u2014 could come under fire.",
      "Trump's victory will give a far broader platform to skeptics and critics of federal health programs and actions. Worst case, public health authorities worry, the U.S. could see increases in preventable illnesses; a weakening of public confidence in established science; and debunked notions \u2014 such as a link between vaccines and autism \u2014 adopted as policy. Trump said in an NBC News interview on Nov. 3 that he would \"make a decision\" about banning some vaccines, saying he would consult with Kennedy and calling him \"a very talented guy.\"",
      "While Trump has said he will not try again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, his administration will face an immediate decision next year on whether to back an extension of enhanced premium subsidies for Obamacare insurance plans. Without the enhanced subsidies, steep premium increases causing lower enrollment are projected. The current uninsured rate, about 8%, would almost certainly rise.",
      "Policy specifics have not moved far beyond the \"concepts of a plan\" Trump said he had during his debate with Harris, though Vice President-elect JD Vance later said the administration would seek to inject more competition into ACA marketplaces.",
      "Republicans were projected to claim a Senate majority, in addition to the White House, while control of the House was not yet resolved early Wednesday.",
      "Polls show the ACA has gained support among the public, including provisions such as preexisting condition protections and allowing young people to stay on family health plans until they are 26.",
      "Trump supporters and others who have worked in his administration say the former president wants to improve the law in ways that will lower costs. They say he has already shown he will be forceful when it comes to lowering high health care prices, pointing to efforts during his presidency to pioneer price transparency in medical costs.",
      "\"On affordability, I'd see him building on the first term,\" said Brian Blase, who served as a Trump health adviser from 2017 to 2019. Relative to a Democratic administration, he said, there will be \"much more focus\" on \"minimizing fraud and waste.\"",
      "Efforts to weaken the ACA could include slashing funds for enrollment outreach, enabling consumers to purchase more health plans that don't comply with ACA consumer protections and allowing insurers to charge sicker people higher premiums.",
      "Democrats say they expect the worst.",
      "\"We know what their agenda is,\" said Leslie Dach, executive chair of Protect Our Care, a health care policy and advocacy organization in Washington, D.C. He worked in the Obama administration helping to implement the ACA. \"They're going to raise costs for millions of Americans and rip coverage away from millions and, meanwhile, they will give tax breaks to rich people.\"",
      "Theo Merkel, director of the Private Health Reform Initiative at the right-leaning Paragon Health Institute, which Blase leads, said the enhanced ACA subsidies extended by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 do nothing to improve plans or lower premiums. He said they paper over the plans' low value with larger government subsidies.",
      "Other Trump supporters say the president-elect may support preserving Medicare's authority to negotiate drug prices, another provision of the IRA. Trump has championed reducing drug prices, and in 2020 advanced a test model that would have tied the prices of some drugs in Medicare to lower costs overseas, said Merkel, who worked in Trump's first White House. The drug industry successfully sued to block the program.",
      "Within Trump's circles, some names have already been floated as possible leaders for the Department of Health and Human Services. They include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Seema Verma, who ran the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services during the Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy, who suspended his independent presidential run and endorsed Trump, has told his supporters that Trump promised him control of HHS. Trump said publicly before Election Day that he would give Kennedy a big role in his administration, but he may have difficulty winning Senate confirmation for a Cabinet position.",
      "While Trump has vowed to protect Medicare and said he supports funding home care benefits, he's been less specific about his intentions for Medicaid, which provides coverage to lower-income and disabled people. Some health analysts expect the program will be especially vulnerable to spending cuts, which could help finance the extension of tax breaks that expire at the end of next year.",
      "Possible changes include the imposition of work requirements on beneficiaries in some states. The administration and Republicans in Congress could also try to revamp the way Medicaid is funded. Now, the federal government pays states a variable percentage of program costs. Conservatives have long sought to cap the federal allotments to states, which critics say would lead to draconian cuts.",
      "\"Medicaid will be a big target in a Trump administration,\" said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Less clear is the potential future of reproductive health rights.",
      "Trump has said decisions about abortion restrictions should be left to the states. Thirteen states ban abortion with few exceptions, while 28 others restrict the procedure based on gestational duration, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights. Trump said before the election that he would not sign a national abortion ban.",
      "Trump could move to restrict access to abortion medications, used in more than half of abortions, either by withdrawing the FDA's authorization for the drugs or by enforcing a 19th-century law, the Comstock Act, that abortion opponents say bans their shipment. Trump has said he generally would not use the law to ban mail delivery of the drugs.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 13:50:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Victims thought to be female were male and not related to one another, showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers won a $700,000 prize for using artificial intelligence to read a 2,000-year-old scroll that was scorched in the Vesuvius eruption.",
      "The Herculaneum papyri consist of about\u00a0800 rolled-up Greek scrolls\u00a0that were carbonized during the 79 CE volcanic eruption that buried the ancient Roman town, according to the organizers of the\u00a0\"Vesuvius Challenge.\"",
      "The scroll's author was \"probably Epicurean philosopher Philodemus,\" writing \"about music, food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures,\" wrote contest organizer\u00a0Nat Friedman\u00a0on social media.",
      "The scrolls were found in a villa thought to be previously owned by Julius Caesar's patrician father-in-law, whose mostly unexcavated property held a library that could contain thousands more manuscripts.",

      "The Dragon's Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from historic launch pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 9:29 p.m. EST Monday, lighting up the night sky for miles around as it climbed away atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust.",
      "After boosting the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the first stage, making its fifth flight, peeled away, reversed course and headed back to an on-target landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station while the second stage continued the climb to space.",
      "The landing marked SpaceX's 57th successful booster recovery at the Florida Space Force station and its 363rd overall, including California flights and droneship landings.",
      "Just under 10 minutes after liftoff, the vacuum-optimized engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage shut down and one minute later, the Dragon was released to fly on its own.",
      "Running slightly ahead of schedule, the cargo ship executed a series of rendezvous rocket firings, catching up with the space station from behind and below before looping up to docking at the lab's forward port at 9:52 a.m.",
      "\"Welcome aboard, Dragon,\" astronaut Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore radioed from inside the station. \"Nice to  have you aboard.\" Station commander Sunita Williams, referring to the  successful docking in general and the food on board in particular,  added: \"Just want to say thank you to SpaceX, the International Space  Station program, the Commercial Crew program for bringing us... honey.\"",
      "One of the first items on the agenda is a test Friday to determine the Cargo Dragon's ability to boost the space station's orbit slightly using its aft-facing thrusters. The ISS is routinely re-boosted by Russian Progress freighters and Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ships, but Friday's test will be a first for SpaceX.",
      "The California rocket builder is under contract to NASA to build a powerful space tug of sorts that can be used to safely drive the ISS back into the atmosphere when the lab complex is retired in the 2030 timeframe. The vehicle is needed to make sure the station breaks up over a stretch of ocean well away from populated areas and shipping lanes.",
      "During the test Friday, the Cargo Dragon's aft thrusters will fire for about 12 minutes.",
      "\"The data that we're going to collect from this reboost and attitude control demonstration will be very helpful, informing SpaceX analyses on how the system performs,\" said Jared Metter, SpaceX director of flight reliability. \"This data is going to lead to future capabilities, namely the US de-orbit vehicle.\"",
      "Reboost aside, the Cargo Dragon is loaded with slightly more than 6,000 pounds of equipment and supplies, including 2,022 pounds of science gear, 2,119 pounds of crew clothing, food and other supplies, 377 pounds of spacewalk equipment, 525 pounds of space station hardware and 44 pounds of computer equipment.",
      "One of the more unusual payloads: Lignosat, a small wooden satellite using a framework of magnolia panels built by researchers at Kyoto University in Japan and the Tokyo-based logging company Sumitomo.",
      "\"While some of you might think that wood in space seems a little counterintuitive, researchers hope that this investigation demonstrates that a wooden satellite can be more sustainable and less polluting for the environment than conventional satellites,\" said Meghan Everett, the ISS deputy project scientist.",
      "\"The main objective here is to determine whether wood can be used in space, and to do this, researchers will measure the temperature and strain of the wooden structure and see how it might change in the vacuum environment of space with atomic oxygen and radiation conditions as well.\"",
      "As with all station-bound Dragon cargo ships, the crew supplies include fresh food and special treats for holiday meals.",
      "Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager, said the \"food kit\" includes \"citrus, apples, sweet onions, blueberries, radishes, etc,\" along with lobster, crab and quail for holiday meals. A variety of cheeses is on board as well as fresh coffee and personal items requested by each crew member.",
      "Mounted in the Dragon's unpressurized trunk section is the Coronal Diagnostic Experiment, or CODEX, an instrument that will be mounted outside the space station to learn more about how charged particles in the solar wind are heated to millions of degrees and accelerated to enormous velocities, affecting Earth's space environment and the rest of the solar system.",
      "Inside the station, the astronauts will have a variety of new experiments and instruments to operate and monitor, including one called ARTEMOSS that will examine how Antarctic moss tolerates the space radiation and microgravity environment to learn more about how plants might be used in future life support systems.",
      "The European Space Agency is sending up a space exposure experiment to learn more about how high-tech materials respond to prolonged exposure to the weightless environment and another experiment to study how organic samples degrade when exposed to unfiltered ultraviolet light from the sun.",
      "And in an experiment that could be particularly useful to future astronauts, a small device known as Nanolab Astrobeat, provided by the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology, will test cold welding technology that could prove useful for repairing leaks or other damage from inside a spacecraft.",

While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles.

      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",

      "\"Residents are strongly advised to keep doors and windows secured to prevent these animals from entering homes,\" police said\u00a0earlier. \"If you spot any of the escaped animals, please contact 911 immediately and refrain from approaching them.\"",
      "Greg Westergaard, CEO of Alpha Genesis, told CBS News the monkey escape is \"frustrating\" and he is \"hoping for a happy ending\" with the primates returning of their own volition.",
      "Westergaard told CBS News that a caretaker inadvertently failed secure a door at an enclosure, allowing the monkeys to roam free.",
      "\"It's really like follow-the-leader. You see one go and the others go,\" Westergaard said. \"It was a group of 50 and 7 stayed behind and 43 bolted out the door.\"",

    "summary": "Scammers impersonating as companies or recruiters try to trick people into giving money or personal information.",
    "story": [
      "Between finding openings, sending out your resume and interviewing, looking for a job is tough. Now a growing trend of\u00a0scammers\u00a0impersonating recruiters is making it even harder.",
      "In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised.",
      "Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.",
      "\"We've really seen tremendous growth in job scams,\" Velasquez said. \"I think that's just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.\"",
      "It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.",
      "After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she'd need for the job.",
      "A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That's when she learned the job was a scam.",
      "\"I'm a little traumatized,\" said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.",
      "If you're a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers:",
      "Job scams are a type of\u00a0impersonation scam.",
      "Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.",
      "\"They're going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,\" she said. \"And they're often saying it's a 100% remote position because that's so appealing to people.\"",
      "Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver's license details.",
      "The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.",
      "Other details don't generally need to be shared with an employer until after you've gotten an offer.",
      "Whether you're replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn't initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.",
      "Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.",
      "Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:",
      "\u2014 Don't respond to the message right away.",
      "\u2014 Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.",
      "\u2014 Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.",
      "\u2014 If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.",
      "If you receive a message from a recruiter, it's best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.",
      "In Islam's case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.",
      "A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\"If you deposit a check and it's fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,\" Puig said.",
      "So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.",
      "When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.",
      "\"Don't let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,\" Velasquez said.",
      "After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter's email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.",
      "\"This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can't just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,\" Islam said.",
      "If you or a family member is a victim of a scam, it's good practice to report it on the\u00a0FTC's website.",

After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",

    "title": "Can Trump run again in 2028? Get the details on term limits for presidents",
    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 11:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's everything to know about presidential term limits after President-elect Donald Trump won the 2024 election.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's\u00a0defeated\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and although he ran for president three times, this is the last term he can serve.",
      "The Constitution rules that even if the terms aren't consecutive, a person can only hold the office of the president twice.",
      "Here's everything to know about presidential term limits.",
      "How many terms can someone serve as president?",
      "A person can serve two four-year terms as president, as outlined in the Constitution's 22nd Amendment. The terms do not have to be consecutive.",
      "A vice president who serves as president can run for two terms after that service if they held the office of president for less than two years. So if a vice president took the office of president one year into a term, they could only run for office one more time. If they took power in the back half of the term, they could be elected to the presidency twice. In recent history, President Lyndon Johnson took over in 1963 when President John F. Kennedy was killed, making him eligible to run in 1964 and 1968. He ultimately opted not to run in 1968, although he was in the race until after the New Hampshire primary.",
      "The two terms don't need to be consecutive: Until Trump's victory this week, Grover Cleveland was the only president to serve non-consecutive presidential terms.",
      "But this means that Donald Trump, who was elected to office in 2016 and in 2024, cannot be elected president again in 2028.",
      "Has anyone been president for more than two terms?",
      "Only one person has served more than two terms as president: Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was the longest-sitting president in United States history, serving from 1933 to 1945.",
      "That third term led to controversy, according to the National Constitution Center. The nation's first president, George Washington, had established a precedent of only two terms in office per president, and some saw Roosevelt's break from tradition as a threat to democracy.",
      "In 1947, Congress approved the 22nd amendment. The amendment was ratified in February 1951.",
      "How many times can someone run for president?",
      "There's no limit to how many times someone can run for president.",
      "There have been more than a few perennial candidates for president throughout American history. Harold Stassen, a former governor of Minnesota, ran for president as a Republican candidate nine times between 1944 and 1992. Lyndon LaRouche ran for president in eight consecutive elections between 1976 and 2004 \u2014 once as the candidate for the U.S. Labor Party, which he had founded, and seven times as a candidate for the Democratic party.",
      "What Trump has said about term limits",
      "Trump has made a number of comments about term limits and his time in office, although it's unclear if he was serious. In July, he repeatedly told attendees at a conservative Christian event that they wouldn't \"have to vote anymore\" if he was elected to office in 2024. Some saw the comments as a threat to not leave office after a second term.",
      "\"Christians, get out in vote. Just this time,\" he said during a speech at the Believers' Summit, an event hosted by the conservative advocacy group Turning Point Action. \"You won't have to do it anymore. Four more years. You know what? It'll be fixed. It'll be fine. You won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.\"",
      "Trump continued: \"I love you Christians and I'm a Christian. I love you, you got to get out and vote. In four years, you don't have to vote again. We'll have it fixed so good, you're not going to have to vote.\"",
      "Trump has mentioned the idea of a third term more than once. In August 2020, he said he would win that election and then \"go another four years\" because \"they spied on my campaign,\" according to Forbes. A month later, he told crowds he would \"negotiate\" more time in office, saying that he was \"probably entitled to another four after (2020)\" based on \"the way we were treated.\"",
      "In April 2024, Trump told Time magazine that he intends \"to serve four years and do a great job\" and \"wouldn't be in favor\" of an extended term, but during a 2024 speech for the National Rifle Association, Trump asked supporters if he would be considered \"three-term or two-term.\"",

      "A federal judge has temporarily halted the planned execution of an Idaho man on death row whose first lethal injection attempt was botched earlier this year.",
      "Thomas Eugene Creech was scheduled to be executed by lethal injection Nov. 13 - roughly nine months after the state first tried and failed to execute him. Execution team members tried eight locations in Creech's arms and legs on Feb. 28 but could not find a viable vein to deliver the lethal drug.",
      "U.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow issued the stay this week to allow the court enough time to consider Creech's claims that prosecutors acted improperly during his clemency hearing. Creech's defense team also has other legal cases underway seeking to stop him from being put to death.",
      "The Idaho Department of Correction declined to comment on the postponement because the lawsuit is ongoing but said it will take at least until the end of the month for both sides to file the written copies of their arguments with the court.",
      "\"Per IDOC policy, Mr. Creech has been returned to his previous housing assignment in J-Block and execution preparations have been suspended,\" department public information officer Sanda Kuzeta-Cerimagic said in a statement.",
      "Creech, 74, is the state's longest-serving person on death row. He has been in prison for half a century, convicted of five murders in three states and suspected of several more. According to court filings, Creech admitted to killing or participating in the murders of at least 26 people.",
      "In January, investigators in California closed a decades-old cold case in San Bernardino County, connecting the 1974 murder of Daniel Walker to Creech, CBS Los Angeles\u00a0reported.",
      "Creech was already serving a life term when he beat another person in prison with him, 22-year-old David Dale Jensen, to death in 1981 - the crime for which he was to be executed. He was sentenced to death by a judge in 1982, who found after several resentencings that \"the protection of society demands that Thomas Eugene Creech receive the death penalty.\"",
      "In the decades since, Creech has become known inside the walls of the Idaho Maximum Security Institution as a generally well-behaved person who sometimes writes poetry. His bid for clemency before the last execution attempt found support from a former warden at the penitentiary, prison staffers who recounted how he wrote them poems of support or condolence and the judge who sentenced Creech to death.",
      "After the last execution attempt failed, the Idaho Department of Correction announced it would use new protocols for lethal injection when execution team members are unable to place a peripheral IV line, close to the surface of the skin. The new policy allows the execution team to place a central venous catheter, a more complex and invasive process that involves using the deeper, large veins of the neck, groin, chest or upper arm to run a catheter deep inside a person's body until it reaches the heart.",
      "According to the\u00a0Death Penalty Information Center, Creech would be just the fourth person executed in Idaho since 1976.",

      "The New York Times and Associated Press were first to report the news.",
      "The official spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the order by the judge, Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, has not yet been posted publicly or officially announced.",
      "The plea agreements would spare Mohammed and the others the risk of the death penalty in exchange for guilty pleas in the long-running 9/11 case. Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense attorneys under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had approved them.",
      "Outcry over plea deal for 9/11 defendants",
      "The plea deals in the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people spurred immediate political blowback by Republican lawmakers and others when announced in late July.",
      "The agreements, and Austin's attempt to reverse them, have been one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties, including years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants given their years of torture in CIA custody.",
      "Within days of the deals becoming public this summer, Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them. Plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary, Austin said at the time.",

    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",

    "story": [
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers won a $700,000 prize for using artificial intelligence to read a 2,000-year-old scroll that was scorched in the Vesuvius eruption.",
      "The Herculaneum papyri consist of about\u00a0800 rolled-up Greek scrolls\u00a0that were carbonized during the 79 CE volcanic eruption that buried the ancient Roman town, according to the organizers of the\u00a0\"Vesuvius Challenge.\"",
      "The scroll's author was \"probably Epicurean philosopher Philodemus,\" writing \"about music, food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures,\" wrote contest organizer\u00a0Nat Friedman\u00a0on social media.",
      "The scrolls were found in a villa thought to be previously owned by Julius Caesar's patrician father-in-law, whose mostly unexcavated property held a library that could contain thousands more manuscripts.",

      "The presidential election was seen by many as a referendum on women's rights. Trump has been found liable for sexual abuse\u00a0and defamation, and his vice president, former Ohio senator JD Vance, has previously referred to some women as \"childless cat ladies.\" The Harris campaign also ran on a platform of supporting a woman's right to abortion, something that has been jeopardized in many states after the fall of Supreme Court decision\u00a0Roe v. Wade, which Trump has taken credit for.",

      "What is the 4B movement?",
      "In short, the 4B movement is a vow to swear off men. It is called the 4B movement because in Korean, the four tenets each begin with bi, which means no, according to a paper published by two South Korean researchers at Yonsei University's Institute of Humanities.",
      "The movement specifically calls for the refusal of dating men (biyeonae), sexual relationships with men (bisekseu), heterosexual marriage (bihon), and childbirth (bichulsan) in response to what South Korean women see as a patriarchal and misogynistic culture.

      "The 4B movement began in 2017 and gained more attention in 2019, amid a\u00a0#MeToo-style reckoning in South Korea. Much of the movement has been built online, where participants call themselves \"anonymous women\" and share few personal details. It has no official leadership structure.",
      "Women in the nation have fought against what Human Rights Watch calls \"shockingly widespread\" gender-based violence and called for harsher penalties for what's called \"spy cam porn.\" They have also criticized the country's extreme gender wage gap, which saw women paid 31.2% less than men in 2022, according to the KoreaTimes, and called out hiring discrimination and harassment in the workplace.",
      "What impact has the 4B movement had in South Korea?",
      "The 4B movement has been controversial in South Korea. The country's president Yoon Suk-yeol said in 2021 that feminist movements were \"blocking healthy relationships\" between men and women in the nation.",
      "The nation has been battling a declining birth rate for several years, which some credit to the 4B movement, according to The New York Times.",

      "Since the election, multiple far-right figures have made alarming statements about women's rights on social media. White nationalist Nick Fuentes, who dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, wrote \"Your body, my choice. Forever.\" in a widely-criticized post on X.

    "summary": "The gruesome discovery in the city of Chilpancingo comes just weeks after the city's mayor was murdered and decapitated.",
    "story": [
      "Police in a southern Mexico region rife with drug cartel violence have found 11 bodies, including two of minors, dumped by a highway, prosecutors in the state of Guerrero said Thursday.",
      "The bodies were found late Wednesday after police received a tip about an abandoned pickup truck on the main thoroughfare of the city of Chilpancingo, the state capital, prosecutors said in a news release. The city of 300,000 has been the scene of gruesome drug gang violence as two rival cartels fight for control of the area.",
      "Prosecutors did not specify the ages of the two dead minors but said that two of the 11 bodies were female. The highway where they were found is also the main route between Mexico City and the resort of Acapulco.",
      "In early October, the city's mayor was killed and beheaded just a week after he took office. Alejandro Arcos took office on Oct. 1 in Chilpancingo, and his beheaded body was found in a pickup truck a week later, his head placed on the vehicle's roof. Days later, four mayors asked federal authorities for protection.",
      "Arcos' murder came days after the killing of another city official, Francisco Tapia, according to Institutional Revolutionary Party president Alejandro Moreno.",
      "\"They had been in office for less than a week. Young and honest officials who sought progress for their community,\"\u00a0Moreno said on X.",
      "Two rival drug gangs, known as the Tlacos and the Ardillos, are fighting for control of the drug and extortion business in the city.",
      "In 2023, gang violence in Chilpancingo became so brazen that one of the gangs staged a demonstration of hundreds of people, hijacked a government armored car, blocked a major highway and took police hostage to win the release of arrested suspects.",
      "On Monday, officials said gunmen killed five members of the same family in a house in a suburb of Acapulco, which is in the state of Guerrero.",
      "Violence in Guerrero reached such unprecedented levels that earlier this year, Roman Catholic bishops announced they had helped arrange a truce in another part of the state between two warring drug cartels.",
      "At the time, former president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador- who refused to confront the gangs - said he approved such talks.",
      "\"Priests and pastors and members of all the churches have participated, helped in pacifying the country. I think it is very good,\" said L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office Sept. 30.",
      "Mexico appears to abandon \"hugs, not bullets\" strategy",
      "For the last six years, Mexico bragged about its oft-questioned \"hugs, not bullets\" strategy, in which its leaders avoided confrontations with drug cartels that were gradually taking control of large parts of the country. The thinking was that social programs, not shootouts, would gradually drain the pool of cartel gunmen.",
      "Now, a month into the term of new President Claudia Sheinbaum, a string of bloody confrontations suggests the government is quietly abandoning the \"no bullets\" part of that strategy and is much more willing to use the full force of the military and the militarized National Guard.",
      "But the challenge Mexico now faces is different from that during the country's 2006-2012 drug war. Cartels today are more diversified, more deeply entrenched in migrant smuggling and more willing to use foreign recruits and adolescents to fill their ranks.",
      "All of that has led to a string of violent clashes in which security forces who shoot at suspected drug cartel convoys wind up killing bystanders and migrants, and reporting lopsided death tolls in which soldiers aren't harmed but most of the suspects are wiped out.",
      "Sheinbaum has studiously avoided using the \"hugs, not bullets\" slogan popularized by her predecessor and mentor, L\u00f3pez Obrador. She has, after all, pledged to continue each and every one of L\u00f3pez Obrador's policies. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "But Sheinbaum has had to perform some verbal gymnastics to avoid disowning the policy entirely.",
      "\"Clearly, it isn't a question of hugs for criminals, nobody has ever said that,\" Sheinbaum said soon after taking office. The hugs, she said, were meant for impoverished youths, to avoid having them recruited as cartel gunmen.",
      "\"There are traces of a change in tone toward organized crime, but it's too early to call,\" said Falko Ernst, a security analyst. \"It seems unlikely that the Sheinbaum administration would risk a politically inconvenient, steady stream of violent imagery by betting on wholesale balazos (bullets)-only strategy,\" but there may be more willingness to confront \"the most overt and brazen displays of power\" by the cartels.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 11:16:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Israeli ground forces have \"started to operate\" around a northern Gaza town, expanding an anti-Hamas offensive that will apparently see residents kept out indefinitely.",
    "story": [
      "The Israeli military announced Thursday an expansion of its month-old ground operation in northern Gaza to include part of Beit Lahiya, a town that has been heavily bombed since the earliest days of the war, where Israel says Hamas militants have regrouped.",
      "The military said in a statement that \"troops started to operate\" in the area of Beit Lahiya after intelligence indicated the presence of militants there. Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas where the military already conducted major operations.",
      "The town in the northwestern corner of Gaza was among the first targets of the ground invasion launched over a year ago, after Hamas' attack into southern Israel. The northern third of the territory has been encircled by Israeli forces since then.",
      "Israel launched another major offensive in nearby Jabaliya, a decades-old urban refugee camp, in early October. It has sharply restricted the amount of aid entering northern Gaza and ordered a full evacuation. Tens of thousands have fled to nearby Gaza City in the latest mass displacement of the war.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people - mostly civilians \u2014 and abducting 250 others. Israel's military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children.",
      "Palestinian medical sources told the Al Jazeera network that about 20 people were killed Thursday alone in northern Gaza amid the expanding Israeli operations in Beit Lahiya, including five people killed and five others wounded in a raid on a house in the town.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Thursday that it was continuing to facilitate \"the safe evacuation of Palestinians from combat zones in northern Gaza through organized routes for their safety,\" after an IDF commander said the military was working to displace all civilians from the north of the war-torn Palestinian territory indefinitely.",
      "Briefing journalists Tuesday night, Brigadier General Itzik Cohen, who commands the IDF's 162nd Division operating in Gaza, said that since troops had been forced to enter some areas twice, including the Jabaliya camp, \"there is no intention of allowing the residents of the northern Gaza Strip to return to their homes.\"",
      "He said humanitarian aid \u2014 which the Biden administration has demanded that Israel increase the flow of into Gaza \u2014 would be allowed to enter the south of the enclave \"regularly,\" but not the north, as there were, he said, \"no more civilians left.\"",
      "According to a United Nations estimate, however, \"between 75,000 and 95,000 people were estimated to remain in North Gaza\" as of Monday.",
      "The U.N.'s humanitarian agency OCHA said roughly 100,000 people had been forced to flee the region since Israel launched its offensive in northern Gaza, and \"the death toll in the North Gaza governorate over the past month is thought to be in the hundreds, possibly over 1,000.\"",
      "The U.N. agency said in July that 1.9 million Gaza residents had been forcibly displaced from their homes.",
      "\"In other words, approximately nine out of ten people in Gaza are now estimated to be internally displaced, many multiple times,\" the U.N.'s humanitarian agency said.",
      "That number is likely to have risen since, given Israel's ongoing military operations and routine evacuation orders.",
      "No sign of letup in Israel's parallel war with Hezbollah",
      "Several large Israeli airstrikes hit Beirut's southern suburbs early Thursday, including one on a site adjacent to Lebanon's only international airport. The Israeli military had issued an evacuation notice for the site, saying there were Hezbollah facilities there, without giving more details.",
      "Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said in a speech aired Wednesday that the Lebanese militant group is open for cease-fire negotiations only once \"the enemy stops its aggression.\" His speech marked the 40-day mourning period since former Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated in Beirut.",
      "Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Both groups are considered proxy forces backed by Iran, which insisted Thursday that despite Israel killing many top commanders, its \"Axis of Resistance\" against Israel remained robust. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,000 people have been killed and some 13,600 wounded in Lebanon, according to the country's health ministry.",
      "Lebanon's state news agency said an Israeli drone strike hit a car at an army checkpoint in the southern port city of Sidon, killing three people and wounding several others, including U.N. peacekeepers based in southern Lebanon. The National News Agency said one of the wounded was taken to the hospital while the peacekeepers were treated for minor injuries at the scene of the attack at the northern entrance of Sidon, Lebanon's third-largest city. There was no immediate information on the identities of those who died.",
      "The U.N. peacekeeping force in the country, UNIFIL, said in a statement that a convoy \"bringing newly-arrived peacekeepers to south Lebanon was passing Saida when a drone strike occurred nearby\" lightly wounding five peacekeepers, whom it said were treated by Lebanese Red Cross medics on the spot.",
      "\"They will continue to their posts,\" UNFIL said of the troops in the convoy, adding: \"We remind all actors of their obligation to avoid actions putting peacekeepers or civilians in danger. Differences should be resolved at the negotiating table, not through violence.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 08:23:00 -0500",
    "summary": "An environmental agency says black balls that washed up on Sydney beaches aren't tar, but a \"complex composition\" of \"mixed waste.\"",
    "story": [
      "Environmental officials in Australia still haven't completely solved the mystery of black balls found littering popular beaches on the country's eastern coastline, but they're getting closer. The New South Wales Environmental Protection Authority said Wednesday that the composition of the mysterious globs had been determined \u2014 and it's not pretty \u2014 but their origin remains unclear.",
      "The golf-to-baseball sized balls \u2014 the appearance of hundreds of which forced the closure of two beaches near Sydney last month \u2014 are not, the agency said, tar balls as initially suspected. Or at least not simple tar balls from oil out at sea.",
      "They're more likely to be sewage-trash balls.",
      "According to the EPA's analysis, \"the balls comprised fatty acids, petroleum hydrocarbons, and other organic and inorganic materials.\" In plain English, that means a mix of cooking oils and fats, cleaning and skincare products, hair, food waste, oil and gas and any number of other things that people routinely flush, dump or wash down drains and storm grates.",
      "\"The investigation has revealed that the balls contain hundreds to thousands of different materials, including human hair and various fibres, indicating they likely originated from a source that releases mixed waste,\" the agency concluded.",
      "But officials still couldn't say where the mix of materials came from.",
      "The EPA said it looked at \"several possible causes, such as a shipping spill or wastewater outflow,\" but that due to \"the complex composition of the balls and the time they have spent in the water, testing has not been able to confirm their exact origin.\"",
      "It said the regional water company, Sydney Water, reported \"no issues with the operation or maintenance\" at two nearby treatment facilities when asked soon after the balls appeared. A review of data by the state maritime meteorological agency yielded \"nothing conclusive\" about where they might have washed up from.",
      "While the EPA said it was waiting for the final results of its tests on the mystery balls, the agency has separately been pushing for greater efforts to clean up the Sydney area, which it warned was quickly filling up with residents' trash.",
      "\"Greater Sydney is on the brink of a waste crisis, with landfill space expected to run out by 2030 unless urgent action is taken,\" the EPA said in a Nov. 1 social media post, heralding a Circular Economy Summit of government, industrial and environmental officials \"to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the NSW waste sector.\"",
      "Officials explained that the concept of a circular economy is one that \"keeps products and materials in use for as long as possible and reduces the need for new materials,\" to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills \u2014 waste that, if it overwhelms the available landfill space, could be washed into water ways and then carried into the ocean.",
      "The black balls first started showing up on the Coogee and Gordon's Bay beaches near Sydney in mid-October, the local mayor said at the time, suggesting they could be tar balls, which often form at sea after an oil spill or leak.",
      "Authorities closed those beaches, along with Sydney's famed Bondi Beach and several others in the area, while cleanup operations continued. All the beaches were reopened after several days, based on authorities saying there were few or no more balls washing up, and a determination that they were \"not highly toxic to humans.\"",

      "According to its ERA5 dataset, the agency said it was \"virtually certain\" that the annual temperature for 2024 will be more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, and it will likely be more than 1.55 C above.",
      "For decades, scientists have warned that average global temperatures should not get any higher than 1.5 C above pre-industrial times in order to prevent deadly weather conditions that could impact people worldwide.",
      "The world has already warmed considerably and has seen the effects with back-to-back heat waves, droughts and\u00a0unprecedented flooding and hurricane events. The way farmers are able to grow food has already started to shift, and with\u00a01.5 to 2 degrees Celsius of warming, agricultural yields will decline and sea levels could rise up to 10 feet, researchers have found. Experts say the oceans will also be warmer, fueling more powerful hurricanes and threatening ecosystems that are fundamental for economies and help protect areas from inclement weather.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records and should serve as a catalyst to raise ambition for the upcoming Climate Change Conference, COP29,\" said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, in a statement.",
      "The Copernicus Climate Change Service said the average global temperature anomaly for the first 10 months of 2024 (January to October) is 0.71 C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.16 C warmer than the same period in 2023.",
      "\"The average temperature anomaly for the rest of 2024 would have to drop to almost zero for 2024 to not be the warmest year,\" the agency said.",
      "The agency added that given that 2023 was 1.48\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level according to its ERA5 model, it was also likely that the annual temperature for 2024 will be more than 1.55\u00b0C above.",
      "European temperatures were above average over almost all of the continent, Copernicus found. Outside Europe, temperatures were most above average over northern Canada, and well-above average over the central and western United States, northern Tibet, Japan and Australia.",
      "The agency also said Arctic sea ice reached its fourth lowest monthly extent for October, at 19% below average. Sea ice extent is a measure of the surface area of the ocean which is covered by ice.",
      "Sea ice concentration anomalies were well below average in all peripheral seas of the Arctic Ocean, particularly in the Barents Sea, Canadian Archipelago, and north of Svalbard, the agency said.",
      "Antarctic sea ice extent was 8% below average in October, which was the second-lowest such average behind only October 2023, when it was 11% below average, Copernicus said. Those numbers continued \"a series of large negative anomalies observed throughout 2023 and 2024.\"",
      "The Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is funded by the EU, routinely publishes monthly climate bulletins reporting on changes observed in global surface air and sea temperatures, sea ice cover and hydrological variables. All the reported findings are based on computer-generated analyses and the ERA5 dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.",
      "In a\u00a0report\u00a0published last month, the United Nations warned that the world is now in \"climate crunch time\" as greenhouse gases \u2014 which trap heat in the atmosphere that warms global temperatures and fuels more extreme weather events \u2014 have hit \"unprecedented levels.\"",
      "\"The numbers paint a clear picture,\" the U.N. said. \"To keep emissions below the\u00a0critical 1.5-degree target\u00a0set in Paris in 2015, countries must cut emissions by 42 percent overall by 2030 and achieve a 57 percent reduction by 2035.\"",

      "Within days of the deals becoming public this summer, Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them.

    "story": [
      "For the last 17 years, a worldwide army of online sleuths obsessively tried to figure out the title of what has been dubbed \"the most mysterious song on the internet.\"",
      "Now, they have the answer after a chance discovery by one intrepid researcher who triumphantly reported his breakthrough on online forum Reddit: it is called \"Subways of Your Mind\"\u00a0and was recorded by a little-known 1980s German band called FEX.",
      "The former band members are \"absolutely overwhelmed\" by the news, 68-year-old Michael Haedrich, who played keyboard and guitar and sang back-up vocals for FEX, told Der Spiegel magazine.",
      "The band had been oblivious to the online phenomenon, he admitted.",
      "How the mystery unfolded",
      "The mystery began in 2007, when a German brother and sister uploaded a track online that they had digitized after originally recording it as teenagers on a cassette from the radio. As Rolling Stone\u00a0reported in 2019, the tape mostly featured songs from popular bands like XTC and The Cure, as well as one particular song that remained a mystery \u2014 until now.",
      "The German siblings asked for help to identify it and audiophiles soon took up the challenge.",
      "The track did not show up in any music databases, but online sleuths tried to work out what instruments could be heard and analyzed the lead singer's accent.",
      "Initial attempts to identify the song, soon classified by many as being in the 1980s' \"New Wave\" genre, yielded little.",
      "It was only when the track was uploaded onto Reddit in 2019 that global interest exploded.",
      "A Reddit subforum called \"r/TheMysteriousSong\" attracted tens of thousands of members, and the hunt was reported on in German media and beyond.",
      "The big breakthrough finally came earlier this week when a user called \"marijn1412\" said he had identified the song as \"Subways of Your Mind.\"",
      "He said he came across former FEX members while researching an event for up-and-coming bands that had been organized in the 1980s by a public broadcaster in northern Germany.",
      "The Reddit user wrote that he had reached out to members of what was a four-piece outfit from the northern city of Kiel, who sent him a version of the mystery song, and revealed its long-sought-after name.",
      "Marijn1412 wrote: \"After I emailed him back that the song is actually quite a famous 'lost song,' he asked me not to go public with it until he spoke with his old band members. In the meantime, though, the song did get registered at [the German performance rights organization] GEMA and people found out about it. But I'm happy to say that the band members agreed for me to go public with it.\"",
      "Haedrich, who is still a musician, told Spiegel that it was the first time he had heard about the massive search effort.",
      "\"I thought it was amazing that someone was interested in music by a band that was only successful regionally, if at all, and that was over 40 years ago,\" he said.",
      "Haedrich, who lives in Munich, said the band members now want to reissue \"Subways of Your Mind\" and are trying to track down the original recording of the song.",
      "Their success may have been decades in the making, but he said \"for us, it has just come suddenly.\"",

      "A British doctor who was disgruntled about his inheritance and injected his mother's boyfriend with poison presented as a COVID-19 vaccine was sentenced Wednesday to 31 years in prison.",
      "Dr. Thomas Kwan disguised himself as a nurse making home visits to inject Patrick O'Hara with a poison that caused a life-threatening flesh-eating disease. Kwan believed O'Hara stood in the way of him inheriting his mother's home someday, officials said.",

      "Police used surveillance camera footage to track down Kwan.",
      "They found he had hatched an elaborate plot by sending fake letters with National Health Service logos, hyperlinks and even a QR code to offer a home visit for a COVID booster to O'Hara. Kwan disguised himself in head-to-toe protective gear, tinted glasses and a surgical mask and drove a vehicle to the appointment in January using fake license plates.",
      "Before Kwan injected O'Hara in the arm, the doctor spent 45 minutes at a hospital, speaking with a broken Asian accent and carrying out blood checks and health surveys, the BBC reported.",
      "Kwan, who was described as having a morbid obsession with poisons, used iodomethane, a substance found in pesticides that he thought would be difficult for medics to detect, the judge said.",
      "Police found arsenic, liquid mercury and castor beans, which can be used to make the chemical weapon ricin, during a search of his home. He had instructions on how to make ricin on his computer.",
      "Kwan was upset about getting a smaller share of his inheritance when his father died. He had a strained relationship with his mother and learned that she had a provision in her will that would allow O'Hara to stay in her home if she predeceased him.",

    "story": [
      "Parts of Cuba are reeling in the wake of Hurricane Rafael, a powerful\u00a0Category 3 storm that ripped across the island and knocked out the country's power grid\u00a0this week after ravaging parts of the Cayman Islands and Jamaica. The storm had weakened somewhat since making landfall Wednesday, and by Thursday it had changed directions over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and was moving away from Cuba, according to the National Hurricane Center.",
      "The exact magnitude of Rafael's\u00a0impact on Cuba remained unclear Thursday afternoon. Cuban Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz reported \"major damages\" in Havana and two provinces in the surrounding region, but he did not provide details about the damages. Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel separately said the government had not confirmed any deaths linked to Rafael.",
      "\"This morning we assessed the damage caused by Rafael after passing through our country. There are major damages in Artemisa, Mayabeque and Havana. Recovery work is already underway,\" Cruz said in a social media post.",
      "Electrical workers were continuing to fix the national energy system, the prime minister added, and portions of it had been restored by Thursday afternoon. But he said parts of western Cuba hit hardest by Rafael would likely have to wait longer.",
      "The\u00a0Cuban Electric Union\u00a0reported an electrical line was back up and running from \u00a0Matanzas to Holgu\u00edn, a stretch of land east of Havana that extends more than 400 miles. \"Evaluation of transmission networks in the West continues,\" the union said.",
      "Cuban Public Health Minister Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Portal Miranda traveled to Artemisa Thursday to assess damages in Rafael's wake and evaluate the province's response to the storm. Basic services remained operational there, Miranda said.",
      "The health minister shared images of some impacts to the region, including one that showed the inside of a partially collapsed room and another of a hallway apparently covered in shattered glass. It was unclear what purpose the building normally serves. The president said hospitals, schools, service centers and residential homes in Artemisa sustained the worst damages from the hurricane.",

      "On Wednesday evening, massive waves lashed at Havana's shores as sharp winds and rain whipped at the historic cityscape, leaving trees littered on flooded roads. Much of the city was dark and deserted.",
      "As it plowed across Cuba, the storm slowed to a Category 2 hurricane chugging into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, said the Miami-based hurricane center in an advisory early Thursday.",
      "The center said Rafael's center was about 200 miles west-northwest of Havana, Cuba and 215 miles west of Key West, Florida at 10 a.m. EST. Traveling northwest at fairly slow pace, the storm's maximum sustained winds had dropped to 100 mph. It had packed 115 mph winds, and higher wind gusts, when it struck Cuba.",
      "According to the hurricane center, \"Rafael is expected to continue to move away from western Cuba over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico this morning.  Rafael is then forecast to move over the southern Gulf of Mexico for the next few days.\"",
      "Forecasters expected Rafael to weaken more while moving over the Gulf. Cuba could continue to see rainfall linked to the storm, they warned, with additional rain of 2 to 4 inches likely for western parts of the island. If that happens, the total accumulation linked to Rafael could amount to a foot of rain in some areas.",
      "The latest forecast models suggest Rafael will remain in the Gulf and either weaken over water or move into Mexico at some point next week, CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said early Thursday. No direct impacts to land were expected for the U.S., Nolan added.",
      "Many Cubans had a strange sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu after a rocky few weeks in the Caribbean nation.",
      "In October, the island was hit by a one-two punch. First, Cuba was roiled by island-wide blackouts stretching on for days, a product of the island's energy crisis. Shortly after, it was slapped by another powerful hurricane that killed at least six people in the eastern part of the island.",
      "It stoked discontent already simmering in Cuba amid an ongoing economic crisis, which has pushed many to migrate from Cuba.",
      "While the State Department issued a travel warning for Cuba because of the storm, the Cuban government also raised an alarm, asking citizens to hunker down.",
      "Classes and public transport were suspended on parts of the island and authorities canceled flights in and out of Havana and Varadero. Thousands of people in the west of the island were evacuated as a preventative measure, and many more, like Silvia P\u00e9rez, a 72-year-old retiree living in a coastal area of Havana, scrambled to prepare.",
      "\"This is a night I don't want to sleep through, between the battering air and the trees,\" P\u00e9rez said. \"I'm scared for my friends and family.\"",
      "The concern came after the storm knocked out power in the Cayman Islands and Jamaica, where it also unleased flooding and landslides.",
      "Rafael is the 17th named storm of the season. It is among eight hurricanes in the last 30 years that developed during the month of November and went on to reach major hurricane strength, said Nolan. Three of those eight hurricanes eventually made landfall in the U.S., but, by then, they were no longer major hurricanes.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted the 2024 hurricane season was likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast called for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.",
      "An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.",

      "From enthusiasm voiced by Israel's leader as he wages an expanding, multi-front war to anxiety from some of America's closest, generations-old European allies, the reaction to Trump's election performance started rolling in long before the final votes were counted across the U.S.",
      "Below is a look at how some foreign leaders and governments around the world have taken the news of the American electorate's apparent rebuke of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party at the polls.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his congratulations to Trump on Wednesday, calling his election performance \"history's greatest comeback!\"",
      "\"Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,\" Netanyahu said. \"This is a huge victory!\"",
      "Later Wednesday Netanyahu's spokesperson said the Israeli prime minister had been among the first foreign leaders to call Trump and offer his congratulations personally.",
      "\"The conversation was warm and cordial,\" Netanyahu's office said, adding that the two men had \"agreed to work together for Israel's security\" and also discussed \"the Iranian threat.\"",
      "Despite Trump's criticism of the Israeli leader's handling of the ongoing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Netanyahu was widely believed to favor the former U.S. leader in the U.S. election. Tension between Washington and Tel Aviv has risen sharply over the last year, with President Biden and others criticising Israel's tactics in its multi-front war with Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East.",
      "The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that saw the militants kill some 1,200 people and kidnap about 250 others, has now killed more than 43,000 people in the Palestinian territory, according to its Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also significantly ramped-up its assault on Hezbollah, Hamas' fellow-Iranian backed allies in Lebanon. The Israeli offensive there has killed more than 3,000 people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.",

      "Ukraine's war-time President Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated Trump Wednesday for what he called an \"impressive election victory,\" and said he looked forward to \"an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership.\"",
      "\"I recall our great meeting with President Trump back in September, when we discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post, adding that his country was interested \"in developing mutually beneficial political and economic cooperation that will benefit both of our nations.\"",
      "\"I appreciate President Trump's commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs,\" said the Ukrainian leader. \"This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together.\"",
      "Zelenskyy offered no comment on Trump's repeated vows to \"quickly\" end the nearly three-year war that began with Russia's full-scale invasion in early 2022. His government and his commanders on the battlefield have voiced growing concern that Trump could dramatically reduce or even halt the huge American support for Ukraine's military effort to repel Russia's invasion.",

      "One of the first foreign leaders to offer congratulations to Trump on Wednesday was one of the very few who openly backed him long before the final votes were cast in the U.S. Hungary's far-right President Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who's been accused during his decades-long leadership of the eastern European nation of eroding its democratic institutions by giving himself more power and limiting that of the country's courts and civil society institutions, called Trump's apparent success \"a much needed victory for the World!\"",

      "\"Can we expect changes in approaches to the role of the U.S. in the Ukrainian conflict, which has been fueled by the Democratic administration since 2014? Judging by the election rhetoric (if it can still be believed), the Republican team is not going to send more and more American taxpayers' money into the furnace of a proxy war against Russia,\" Slutsky was quoted as saying. \"Perhaps there is a chance for a more constructive approach here.\"",
      "Slutsky did not comment on Trump's repeated vows to end the war in Ukraine quickly if reelected \u2014 something European and Ukrainian leaders fear he could do by halting America's vast military support for Kyiv and forcing Ukraine to accept Russia's takeover of significant Ukrainian territory.",
      "Slutsky did predict, however, that if the next American administration does cut off that support, the U.S.-backed Ukrainian government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will fall \"in a matter of months, if not days.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from President Vladimir Putin, who never spoke in favor of either candidate during the U.S. election campaign process, but whose leadership Trump has lauded previously.",
      "In remarks later to journalists in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was unaware of any plans for Putin to congratulate Trump directly, saying the former U.S. leader had made \"quite harsh statements\" about Russia during the campaign and calling the U.S. an \"unfriendly country that is directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state.\"",
      "In a statement issued later, Russia's Foreign Ministry echoed that stance, saying: \"We have no illusions about the elected American President, who is well known in Russia, and the new composition of Congress, where the Republicans, according to preliminary data, are gaining the upper hand. The ruling political elite in the United States, regardless of party affiliation, adheres to anti-Russian attitudes and a line on 'containing Moscow.' This line is not subject to fluctuations in the domestic political barometer in the United States.\"",
      "The ministry said Russia would \"work with the new Administration when it 'settles' in the White House, firmly defending Russian national interests and focusing on achieving all the goals of the special military operation.\"",
      "In his remarks, however, Peskov left room for any change in the U.S. stance during Trump's second term, saying: \"After victory, preparing to enter the Oval Office, sometimes statements take on a different tone.\"",
      "\"We will draw conclusions based on concrete steps and concrete words,\" he said, adding that it would be \"practically impossible\" for Trump to damage U.S. relations with Moscow, as they're \"at their lowest point in history.\"",

      "President Xi Jinping spoke Thursday, congratulating Trump on his victory and calling for both nations to find the \"right way to get along\" and reiterating previous statements about the international community expecting the two major powers to \"respect each other (and) co-exist peacefully.\"",
      "The Chinese leader called for ongoing and increasing bilateral dialogue to manage the two countries differences.",
      "Trump has often described China as a primary U.S. adversary, and he's has pledged to continue a tit-for-tat tariff feud with the vast Asian nation.",
      "Under President Biden, the U.S. tightened export controls to try to\u00a0keep some sensitive U.S. technology out of China, and tension between Washington and Beijing had increased for years over China's stance on Taiwan, the democratically ruled island off its east coast that Xi has vowed to bring back under the control of the Chinese government for the first time in about 70 years.",
      "The U.S. is bound by American law to defend Taiwan from any military aggression, but Trump has never committed to doing so in the case of a Chinese invasion.",
      "The bilateral tension has decreased slightly since last year, with lines of communication between Washington and Beijing reopening, but it's unclear how hard Trump will actually push Beijing during his second term \u2014 after recent vows to \"tariff the hell out of that country\" \u2014 and how much that economic war could impact security matters.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te",
      "Taiwan President Lai Ching-te offered his \"sincere congratulations\" to Trump on Wednesday, saying he was \"confident that the longstanding\u00a0#Taiwan-#US\u00a0partnership, built on shared values & interests, will continue to serve as a cornerstone for regional stability & lead to greater prosperity for us all.\"",
      "The United States is bound by domestic law to back Taiwan, an island off China's eastern coast that's claimed by Beijing as Chinese territory but which has had its own democratic government for decades, if it faces military aggression.",
      "China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under the rule of his Communist Party, by force if necessary, creating one of the most risky global military standoffs on the planet. Chinese and Taiwanese military vessels and aircraft have regularly entered each others' territory in recent months, increasing the tension as U.S. vessels continue \"freedom of navigation\" operations in the region.",
      "During and before the campaign, Trump dodged questions about whether the U.S. would come to the aid of Taiwan if China launched an invasion with him in the White House. In a July interview with The Associated Press,\u00a0he said\u00a0Taiwan should pay the U.S. more for helping ensure its defense.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that Trump's reelection was \"no cause for concern\" for Mexico, despite the president-elect's recent threat to impose a massive 25% tariff on Mexican imports unless her government halts what he called an \"onslaught of criminals and drugs\" coming across the southern U.S. border.",
      "\"We are a free, independent, sovereign country and there will be good relations with the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, adding that she felt it was \"prudent to wait\" to extend congratulations to the U.S. election winner until the official results were announced.",
      "\"For all Mexicans, there is no cause for concern, for our countrymen and women [in the U.S.], for their relatives who are here, for Mexican businesswomen and businessmen, there is no cause for concern,\" Sheinbaum said.",

      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer did his best Wednesday, despite a clear delineation between his own policies and those expected of another Trump administration, to maintain the decorum of the storied \"special friendship\" between the two nations.",
      "In a social media post, Starmer offered his congratulations to Trump \"on your historic election victory,\" adding that he looks forward to \"working with you in the years ahead.\"",
      "\"As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defense of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise,\" said Starmer, who came to power only months ago as Britain's left-leaning Labour Party won national elections in a landslide after a decade and a half of Conservative Party rule.",

He declared his administration \"ready to work together\" again as it did during Trump's first term in office, \"with your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.\"",
      "But an hour later, the French president issued another statement that hinted at the concerns he and many of his European colleagues are likely to share about Trump's commitment to the transatlantic NATO alliance, America's future backing of Ukraine in the war with Russia, and his stance on foreign import tariffs.",
      "In his second tweet, Macron said he had just spoken with German Chancellor Olaf Sholz, and that the leaders of the EU's two biggest economies had agreed to \"work towards a more united, stronger, more sovereign Europe in this new context.

I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through #NATO.\"",
      "Trump has criticized many of the NATO alliance's European members for failing to commit at least 2% of their national GDPs to their defense budgets.",
      "Trump shocked many of America's closest allies during and after his first term by openly criticizing\u00a0their funding commitments, and during the 2024 presidential campaign he said calling on allies to increase their defense spending would be a policy he aggressively pursued if reelected.",
      "In May, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said \"Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by demanding they pay up,\" and that if reelected, \"he will restore peace and rebuild American strength and deterrence on the world stage.\"",
      "Iran's government and people",
      "Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran's ruling Islamic regime, appeared on the country's state-run TV network IRIB Wednesday and was quoted as dismissing the potential impact of Trump's election victory amid her country's standoff with the West over its support for armed proxy groups across the Middle East and its nuclear program.",
      "\"The election of the U.S. President is not relevant to us,\" she said according to a translation of her remarks on state media. She said the policies of both the U.S. and Iran were \"fixed and do not change with the change of individuals,\" and said there would be be no \"impact on people's livelihoods\" in Iran regardless of who occupies the White House.",
      "Iran's economy has been decimated by a huge regime of U.S. and international sanctions imposed initially over its alleged nuclear weapons development \u2014 which the country denies \u2014 and extended over its support for U.S.-designated terror groups such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "During Donald Trump's first term in office, he unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of an international nuclear pact negotiated by his predecessor that was intended to keep Iran's atomic work in check in exchange for an easing of sanctions. He adopted a hard line instead, re-imposing sanctions to the consternation of America's European allies who helped broker and co-signed the deal.",
      "Iran has since ramped up its nuclear work, and there has been mounting concern this year that its backing for the so-called proxy groups across the Mideast could lead to a full-scale war with Israel, with the potential to draw in the U.S. as Israel's closest ally.",
      "Despite the government's claim that there would be no impact on Iranians, the value of the country's currency, the rial, slipped on Wednesday to its lowest ever value.",
      "Traders in Tehran told The Associated Press that the rial was trading at 703,000 to the dollar, though there could be further fluctuations over the course of the day.",
      "One resident of Iran's capital told the AP he had no doubt that Trump \"will intensify the sanctions.\"",
      "\"Things that are not in our favor will be worse,\" 22-year-old student Amir Aghaeian told the AP. \"Our economy and social situation will surely get worse... I feel the country is going to blow up.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and Gaza residents",
      "Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian Authority that administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, congratulated Trump on his reelection and wished him success.",
      "In his message, posted Wednesday on the website of the Authority's\u00a0news agency WAFA, Abbas expressed hope to work with Trump for peace and security in the region, stressing the Palestinian people's commitment to the pursuit of \"freedom, self-determination and statehood, in accordance with international law.\"",
      "\"We will remain steadfast in our commitment to peace, and we are confident that the United States will support, under your leadership, the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people,\" he said, addressing Trump.",
      "While nearly two-thirds of Israelis polled by the Israel Democracy Institute before election day in the U.S. said they believed Trump would be a better American leader for Israel's interests, the sentiment in Gaza, where Abbas' Fatah movement hasn't held any power in many years, was less focused on who would win, and more on surviving the war.",
      "A woman living amid the rubble in Gaza told CBS News this week that they just want the bombs to stop falling, and many were doubtful that a change in U.S. leadership could precipitate that.",
      "\"For me, Republicans or Democrats are the same thing,\" Gaza resident Firas Abu Firas said before election day. \"They are two faces on the same coin.\"",
      "Hamas reacts",
      "Basem Naim, a long-time senior figure in the Hamas regime that ruled over the Palestinian Gaza Strip for almost two decades before the group sparked the ongoing war with Israel with its unprecedented terrorist attack more than a year ago, called Trump's reelection, \"a private matter for the Americans,\" but said in a statement Wednesday that \"Palestinians look forward to an immediate cessation of the aggression against our people, especially in Gaza, and look for assistance in achieving their legitimate rights of freedom, independence, and the establishment of their independent self sovereign state with Jerusalem as its capital.\"",
      "International diplomatic efforts toward a so-called \"two-state solution,\" which would see an independent state of Palestine created alongside Israel, have all but vanished amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "U.S. administrations from both sides of the political aisle have pushed for such a solution to the nearly seven-decade crisis in the heart of the Middle East, but with the current Israeli administration firmly opposed to the notion of Palestinian statehood, most Palestinians saw little reason for hope regardless of who won the U.S. election.",
      "European Union's Ursula von der Leyen",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Union bloc's governing body, the European Commission, congratulated Trump on Wednesday and iterated her hope in a brief\u00a0social media post\u00a0that the U.S. and EU could \"work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering\" for citizens on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "\"I warmly congratulate Donald J. Trump. The EU and the US are more than just allies,\" Von der Leyen said. \"We are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens. So let's work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering for them.\"",
      "Italian premier Giorgia Meloni",
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni congratulated Trump Wednesday, lauding what she called \"unshakeable\" ties between the U.S. and Italy.",
      "\"Italy and the United States are 'sister' nations, linked by an unshakeable alliance, common values and a historic friendship. It is a strategic bond which I am sure we will now strengthen even more,\" Italy's far-right leader wrote in a statement posted to social media.",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan congratulated \"my friend Donald Trump\" Wednesday with a message posted on social media.",
      "The leader of the sometimes contentious NATO ally, who's taken a strong stance against Israel's handling of the ongoing wars with Hamas and Hezbollah, voiced his hope that \"Turkey-US relations will strengthen, that regional and global crises and wars, especially the Palestinian issue and the Russia-Ukraine war, will come to an end.\"",
      "\"I believe that more efforts will be made for a more just world,\" said Erdogan. \"I hope that the elections will be beneficial for our friendly and allied people in the United States and for all of humanity.\"",
      "Trump and Erdogan appeared to get along relatively well during the American's first term in office.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro",
      "Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro congratulated Trump on Wednesday and lauded the U.S. democratic process, which he said would be respected, but took the opportunity also to challenge the president-elect's vows to close the U.S. border to undocumented migrants as unrealistic.",
      "\"The only way to seal the boarders is through the prosperity of the communities of the south and the end of blockades,\" he said.",
      "Petro also alluded to concerns that Trump will lead the world's biggest economy further away from goals to address man-made climate change, saying the dialogue between the global north and south continues, \"and the reality of the climate collapse will force us to rally around a solution.\"",
      "Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva",
      "Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known widely simply as Lula, offered his congratulations to Trump Wednesday \"on his election victory and return to the presidency of the United States.\"",
      "\"Democracy is the voice of the people and must always be respected,\" said the Brazilian leader, who is currently serving a third term after returning to office last year in an election that saw him defeat far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, who was often compared to Trump.",
      "\"The world needs dialogue and joint work to achieve greater peace, development and prosperity. I wish the new government luck and success,\" da Silva said in his tweet.",
      "Afghanistan's Taliban regime",
      "Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, who stormed back into power after 20 years of U.S.-backed governance a year after the first Trump administration signed a peace agreement with the group in 2020, said Wednesday that it hoped for more cordial relations with Washington with his return to the White House.",
      "In a statement, the Taliban's foreign ministry voiced hope that \"the incoming U.S. administration will adopt a pragmatic approach to ensure tangible advancement in bilateral relations, allowing both nations to open a new chapter of relations grounded in mutual engagement.\"",
      "The Taliban, whose rule over Afghanistan has not been formally recognized by the U.S. or most other nations, noted Trump's role in getting the 2020 Doha Agreement peace deal and said \"it is expected that Mr. Trump will assume a constructive role in ending the current conflicts in the region & globally, particularly the ongoing brutality & aggression in Gaza & Lebanon.\"",

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday dismissed his popular defense minister, Yoav Gallant, in a surprise announcement that came as the country is embroiled in wars on multiple fronts across the region.",
      "Netanyahu and Gallant have repeatedly been at odds over the war in Gaza. But Netanyahu had avoided firing his rival. Netanyahu cited \"significant gaps\" and a \"crisis of trust\" between the men in his Tuesday evening announcement.",
      "\"In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and defense minister,\" Netanyahu said. \"Unfortunately, although in the first months of the campaign there was such trust and there was very fruitful work, during the last months this trust cracked between me and the defense minister.\"",
      "In the early days of the war, Israel's leadership presented a unified front as it responded to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. But as the war dragged on and spread to Lebanon, key policy differences have emerged. While Netanyahu has called for continued military pressure on Hamas, Gallant had taken a more pragmatic approach, saying that military force has created the necessary conditions for a diplomatic deal that could bring home hostages held by the militant group.",
      "Gallant, a former general who has gained public respect with a gruff, no-nonsense personality, said in a statement: \"The security of the state of Israel always was, and will always remain, my life's mission.\"",
      "The White House on Tuesday declined to comment on the firing but called Galant \"an important partner on all matters related to the defense of Israel.\"",
      "\"As close partners, we will continue to work collaboratively with Israel's next Minister of Defense,\" the White House National Security Council said.",
      "Gallant has worn a simple, black buttoned shirt throughout the war in a sign of sorrow over the Oct. 7 attack and developed a strong relationship with his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.",
      "A previous attempt by Netanyahu to fire Gallant in March 2023 sparked widespread street protests against Netanyahu. He also flirted with the idea of dismissing Gallant over the summer but held off until Tuesday's announcement.",
      "Gallant will be replaced by Foreign Minister Israel Katz, a Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister who was a junior officer in the military. Gideon Saar, a former Netanyahu rival who recently rejoined the government, will take the foreign affairs post.",
      "Netanyahu has a long history of neutralizing his rivals. In his statement, he claimed he had made \"many attempts\" to bridge the gaps with Gallant.",

      "More than a year of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed over 43,000 people, according to Palestinian health officials. The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health does not distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties, but says more than half of those killed have been women and children.",

An American company is working to change that, and their innovation is a contender for this year's annual Earthshot Prize, an award handed out by Britain's Prince William to highlight solutions to the climate crisis.",
      "Like most 12-year-olds, Dimakatso Ngcobo isn't a fan of household chores. She wasn't shy about telling CBS News so as she scrubbed an old pot, a few plastic plates and two old peanut butter jars that she and her mom use as cups.",
      "Last year, her mom couldn't afford the rent at their home in Soweto, outside Johannesburg, so they were evicted. The mother and daughter walked to the community of Kokotela, a few miles further south, to buy a tiny dirt patch of land for $200. There, they put up a new one-room home made of metal sheeting.",
      "Ngcobo told CBS News that while there's no running water and no toilet, what she missed the most was electricity.",
      "\"It is a bit hard. We don't have much. We don't afford that much,\" she said, adding on a more positive note: \"At least the school nearby is OK, as I want to be a doctor one day.\"",
      "She was also grateful for her world getting just a little bit brighter recently, thanks to the U.S. company d.light, which was created by two co-founders who met at Stanford University's school of design. The company has now connected more than 180 million people in 70 countries to a clean source of energy from solar power.",
      "\"We are very focused on making these products as affordable as possible, and the way we do that is by pay-as-you-go financing, where customers can pay 20 cents a day or 30 cents per day, similar to what they would spend on kerosene or diesel for the diesel generator,\" said d.light co-founder Nedjip Tozun. \"But instead of literally burning away that money, they can invest it into an asset that they are going to own that is going to deliver power for many years.\"",
      "D.light is one of the 15\u00a0finalists in the running for a 2024 Earthshot Prize. Winners will be chosen Wednesday in five categories: Protect and Restore Nature, Clean Our Air, Revive Our Oceans, Build a Waste-Free World and Fix our Climate. The winner in each category will be awarded 1 million U.K. pounds, or about $1.3 million, intended to help scale-up their respective projects.",
      "William, the Prince of Wales and future British monarch, has said he took inspiration from President John F. Kennedy's 1962 \"Moonshot\" challenge to land a man on the moon within 10 years when he created the Earthshot Prize four years ago with the ambition of finding and elevating innovative global climate solutions. The Earthshot initiative's ambitious goal since it launched has been to repair the planet within 10 years.",
      "The Earthshot award ceremony has come to the African continent for the first time this year, with Cape Town in South Africa playing host.",
      "Delegates at the Earthshot awards in Cape Town told CBS News ahead of Tuesday's U.S. national election that they've been disappointed that climate change didn't emerge as a central theme in the presidential race, and they worry it could fall even further from the focus of U.S. policy conversation.",
      "New Yorker Shantha Bloemen, CEO of Mobility for Africa, a start-up that provides green mobility services to rural women in Africa using custom-built electric tricycles and bespoke solar powered batteries, was nominated for an award this year but didn't make the finalist list. She said she was still hoping to find partners in Cape Town this week to help her scale up her company's operations.",
      "\"We need urgent action and strong political leadership to unlock the financing to combat this crisis,\" she told CBS News. \"There are many of us with proven solutions to mitigate the worst impact on those living on the front line of the crisis, but without strong U.S. political leadership, it will be difficult to unlock the finance needed to scale quickly to succeed. Time is not on our side.\"",
      "Prince William acknowledged the networking aspect of the prize initiative Tuesday at an event in Cape Town. Panel host Wanjira Mathia teased the British royal as he sat for a panel discussion, calling the prize \"a large dating service to bring together climate innovators.\"",
      "\"The prize is about visibility, but it's also about scale,\" he said. \"What we hear a lot from innovators is, 'I have a solution and no idea how to scale,' and businesses and leaders who say, 'I have money but don't know where to put it.' So, that's where we created a launchpad, which is a dating service which matches the funder with the solution, and vice versa. And I think this collaboration is key \u2014 if you put all of this into one melting pot, then sparks will fly.\"",
      "\"It's wonderful to see those many brilliant minds and changemakers in a room,\" he said, addressing the audience.",
      "Back in Kokotela, south of Johannesburg, Muriel Nobela can now power her TV, radio and lights thanks to a d.light solar panel on her roof. The panel feeds electricity to an outside light and to a storage battery inside her home, and it all costs her just over $250, which she's paying off in small monthly instalments.",
      "Her neighbor Portia Msomi had always been forced to rely on gas to cook and candles for light in the evenings. Now, it's just a flip of a switch.",
      "\"Aha!\" said Portia, giggling as she hit her new d.light switch to illuminate her home. \"You see, isn't it wonderful!\"",
      "Tozun told CBS News it's that kind of reaction that drives d.light's work.",
      "\"The name of our company is d.light, and that is the emotion that gets us really excited to see in our customers,\" he said, adding: \"There are 2 billion people in the world who have unreliable electricity access, and about 750 million with no access to electricity at all, our goal is\u00a0 to transform the lives of one billion people by 2030.\"",
      "Portia takes a lot of pride in her new solar system. With a huge amount of effort she climbed onto a large trunk to stretch her hand onto her metal roof to grab her solar panel and clean it meticulously. She told CBS News it took her only four months to pay off the $150 cost of the system.",
      "She pointed to various neighbors' homes that had burned down in accidents involving paraffin and candle fires.",
      "\"We are safe now, and have light all the time,\" she said.",
      "Light and safety are important for young Dimakatso Ngcobo, too, but the 12-year-old told CBS News that being connected was one of the biggest benefits of clean power in her home. She can now indulge in her favorite activity: scrolling through TikTok and Instagram.",
      "\"And I love TV,\" she added. \"I really love cartoons.\"",
      "Her infectious laugh also helped to light up the room.",

      "\"They tried to kill us,\" said Rosa Benalcazar, a migrant staying at the House of Mercy and all Nations, one of the biggest shelters for migrants on the Mexican side of the Arizona-Mexico border.",
      "Benalcazar said she journeyed to the U.S. after criminal gangs threatened to harm her and her family in Ecuador, which has seen record numbers of its citizens flee amid mounting violence and insecurity.",
      "Like the other migrants at the shelter in Nogales, Benalcazar has been trying to get an appointment to enter America through a U.S. government phone app known as CBP One. Designed to discourage illegal border crossings, the Biden administration program allows migrants in Mexico to request a time to be processed at a legal entry point. The wait times, however, can extend for months due to an extraordinarily high demand.",
      "\"I haven't had luck,\" Benalcazar said in Spanish, noting she's been attempting to secure a CBP One appointment each day for seven months straight.",

      "\"There's a lot of concern\"",

      "Jaramillo said she also urged migrants to follow the legal process and refrain from crossing the U.S. border illegally with the help of smugglers. Crossing the Arizona desert, she said, is not only dangerous, and potentially deadly, but would also disqualify migrants from asylum under an executive action by President Biden in June.",
      "After Mr. Biden enacted those broad restrictions on asylum, illegal border crossings, which had soared to record levels late last year, plunged to a 4-year low. While unauthorized crossings have remained at that low level for the past few months, U.S. officials worry the results of the presidential election could disrupt the lull.",
      "A Trump victory, some U.S. officials believe, could prompt large numbers of migrants to try to cross into the country illegally before he takes office in January. In addition to promising to shut down the CBP One app process, Trump has vowed to reinstate his hardline immigration policies, militarize the border and oversee the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "\"It's nerve-racking\"",
      "Roughly half the migrants at the shelter are children, according to Macias, the facility's director. While their parents desperately await the results of the election, fearing dramatic changes in American border policy, the kids' only focus is being kids.",
      "After all, for the children, there's little to fear at the Nogales shelter, where they can learn English and mathematics and enjoy outdoor activities like soccer and basketball, as well as occasional treats.",

      "\"If they close the (CBP One) application, what are we going to do? We already waited 10 months,\" she said. \"It's nerve-racking.\"",

      "Colombia's foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday that all of the victims were migrants who had been \"caught in the crossfire.\" It identified the dead as a 20-year-old man and a 37-year-old woman, and gave the number of Colombians wounded as five, not four. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy. The victims were identified by the foreign ministry as Yuli Vanessa Herrera Marulanda and Ronaldo Andr\u00e9s Quintero Pe\u00f1uelas.",
      "Mexico's Defense Department, which controls the National Guard, did not respond to requests for comment Monday on whether the victims were migrants, but it said one Colombian who was not injured in the shootings was turned over to immigration officials, suggesting they were.",
      "If they were migrants, it would mark the second time in just over a month that military forces in Mexico have opened fire on and killed migrants.",
      "On Oct. 1, the day President Claudia Sheinbaum took office, soldiers opened fire on a truck, killing six migrants in the southern state of Chiapas. An 11-year-old girl from Egypt, her 18-year-old sister and a 17-year-old boy from El Salvador died in that shooting, along with people from Peru and Honduras.",
      "The most recent shootings happened Saturday on a dirt road near Tecate, east of Otay Mesa on the California border, that is frequently used by Mexican migrant smugglers, the department said in a statement late Sunday.",
      "The Defense Department said a militarized National Guard patrol came under fire after spotting two vehicles -- a gray pickup and a white SUV -- in the area, which is near an informal border crossing and wind power generation plant known as La Rumorosa.",
      "One truck sped off and escaped. The National Guard opened fire on the other truck, killing two Colombians and wounding four others. There was no immediate information on their conditions, and there were no reported casualties among the guardsmen involved.",
      "One Colombian and one Mexican man were found and detained unharmed at the scene, and the departments said officers found a pistol and several magazines commonly used for assault rifles at the scene.",
      "Colombians have sometimes been recruited as gunmen for Mexican drug cartels, which are also heavily involved in migrant smuggling. But the fact the survivor was turned over to immigration officials and that the Foreign Relations Department contacted the Colombian consulate suggests they were migrants.",
      "Cartel gunmen sometimes escort or kidnap migrants as they travel to the U.S. border. One possible scenario was that armed migrant smugglers may have been in one or both of the trucks, but that the migrants were basically unarmed bystanders.",
      "The defense department said the three National Guard officers who opened fire have been taken off duty while the incident is being investigated.",
      "Former president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office Sept. 30, gave the military an unprecedentedly wide role in public life and law enforcement; he created the militarized Guard and used the combined military forces as the country's main law enforcement agencies, supplanting police. The Guard has since been placed under the control of the army.",
      "But critics say the military is not trained to do civilian law enforcement work. Moreover, lopsided death tolls in such confrontations - in which all the deaths and injuries occur on one side - raise suspicions among activists whether there really was a confrontation.",
      "For example, the soldiers who opened fire in Chiapas - who have been detained pending charges - claimed they heard \"detonations\" prior to opening fire. There was no indication any weapons were found at the scene.",

    "story": [
      "Seoul \u2014\u00a0North Korea fired a salvo of short-range ballistic missiles early Tuesday, Seoul's military said. It was Pyongyang's second launch in days and it came just hours before Americans were set to vote for a new president.",
      "The nuclear-armed North last week test-fired what it said was its most advanced and powerful solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). That was Kim Jong Un's first weapons test since he was accused by U.S. and Ukrainian officials of sending soldiers to help support Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "North Korea, which has denied the deployment, is under growing international pressure to withdraw its troops from Russia, with Seoul warning Tuesday that thousands of soldiers were being deployed to front-line areas, including the Russian region of Kursk, which Ukrainian troops pushed into months ago.",
      "Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the launch of \"several short-range ballistic missiles\" at around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday (5:30 p.m. Eastern, Monday) into waters east of the Korean peninsula. The missiles flew approximately 248 miles and Seoul's military said it had tracked the launch in real time while sharing information with Tokyo and Washington.",
      "\"In preparation for additional launches, our military has strengthened surveillance and alertness,\" it added. Seoul was set to get more U.S. help in monitoring the North's missile launches, meanwhile, with the State Department in Washington announcing Monday the approval of a new military aid package worth almost $5 billion.",
      "That package includes the potential sale of airborne early warning and control systems to South Korea, with the approval of four E-7 Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C) aircraft, 10 jet engines, and other systems and support elements, at an estimated total cost of $4.92 billion.",
      "The early warning and control aircraft, known as Wedgetails, would enable South Korea to detect missiles and other threats more swiftly and from greater distances than ground-based radar systems.",
      "\"This proposed sale will improve the Republic of Korea's ability to meet current and future threats by providing increased intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and airborne early warning and control capabilities,\" the State Department said. \"It will also increase the ROK Air Force's command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) interoperability with the United States.\"",
      "On Sunday, South Korea, Japan and the United States conducted a joint air drill involving a U.S. B-1B bomber, South Korean F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets, and Japanese F-2 jets, in response to the ICBM launch. Such joint drills infuriate Pyongyang, which views them as rehearsals for invasion.",
      "Pyongyang called its latest launch \"a direct response to the trilateral aerial exercises over the weekend,\" Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defense Industry Studies told AFP. \"Given it was a salvo of short-range missiles, the North is indicating that it not only has long-range missiles capable of reaching the U.S., but also short-range ones to target all bases in South Korea and Japan.\"",
      "Kim Yo Jong, sister of the country's leader and a key spokesperson, called the U.S.-South Korea-Japan exercises an \"action-based explanation of the most hostile and dangerous aggressive nature of the enemy toward our Republic.\"",
      "In a statement carried Tuesday by the official Korean Central News Agency, she said the drill was \"absolute proof of the validity and urgency of the line of building up the nuclear forces we have opted for and put into practice.\"",
      "Seoul has long accused the nuclear-armed North of sending weapons to help Moscow fight Kyiv and alleged that Pyongyang has moved to deploy soldiers en masse since Kim signed a mutual defense deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June.",
      "\"More than 10,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia, and we assess that a significant portion of them are deployed to front-line areas, including Kursk,\" Jeon Ha-gyu, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, said Tuesday.",
      "Seoul, a major weapons exporter, has said it is reviewing whether to send weapons directly to Ukraine in response, something it has previously resisted due to longstanding domestic policy that prevents it from providing weaponry into active conflicts.",
      "With its recent testing spate, \"Pyongyang is showing that its contribution of weapons and troops to Russia's war in Ukraine does not curtail its military activities closer to home,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. \"On the contrary, cooperation with Moscow appears to enable blatant violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\"",
      "On Monday, Robert Wood, U.S. deputy ambassador to the U.N., slammed the North's advancing ballistic missile program and said Russia and China were preventing the U.N. from holding Pyongyang to account.",
      "Beijing and Moscow \"have repeatedly shielded the DPRK, contributing to the normalization of these tests and emboldening the DPRK to further violate this Council's sanctions and resolutions,\" he said, referring to the North by its official name.",

      "Maumere, Indonesia\u00a0\u2014 Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency said Monday that at least 10 people had died as a series of volcanic eruptions widens on the remote island of Flores. The eruption at Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki around midnight spewed thick brownish ash as high as 6,500 feet into the air and hot ashes hit several villages, burning down houses including a convent of Catholic nuns, said Firman Yosef, an official at the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post.",
      "Yosef said volcanic material was thrown up to 3.7 miles from the volcano's crater, blanketing nearby villages and towns with tons of volcanic debris and forcing residents to flee.",
      "Rescuers were still searching for more bodies buried under collapsed houses, said Abdul Muhari, the National Disaster Management Agency's spokesperson. Muhari said all the bodies, including a child, were found with a 2.4-mile radius of the crater. He said at least 10,000 people had been affected by the eruption in six villages.",
      "Some people fled to relatives' houses while the local government was readying schools to use as temporary shelters.",

No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed since then due to seismic activity.",
      "In a video conference on Monday, Muhammad Wafid, the head of Geology Agency at the Energy and Mineral Resources ministry said there was a different character between January's eruption and Monday's eruption due to a blockage of magma in the crater, which reduced detectible seismic activity while building up pressure.",
      "\"The eruptions that occurred since Friday were due to the accumulation of hidden energy,\" Wafid said.",

      "The wedding album sits on my desk, held together by tape and aged binding. It\u2019s more than a family heirloom, though. It\u2019s a time capsule that lets Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age spring to life.",

Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, who'd played matchmaker to the couple and opened their Beverly Hills home for the ceremony.",

      "After a bitterly contested presidential campaign full of unprecedented twists and turns, voters returned Donald Trump to the White House after four years out of power. In an election where voters across the country wanted change, they chose Trump\u2019s outsider appeal over Kamala Harris\u2019 promise to \"turn the page\" on the Trump era.",
      "Trump\u2019s victory was powered by his strength on the economy and immigration \u2013 two of voters\u2019 top concerns. He was seen as a stronger leader than Harris in a time of turmoil, and voters remembered his presidency more fondly than their evaluations of the current administration. Trump ran up the score with his base while narrowing traditional Democratic advantages among Black, Hispanic, and young voters.",

      "Those seeking complete change in the country\u2019s affairs voted for the former president by a wide margin.",
      "Voters\u2019 frustrations with Joe Biden\u2019s administration were a drag on Harris\u2019 candidacy, as nearly 6 in 10 disapproved of the job Biden has done.",
      "Voters had rosier recollections of Trump\u2019s time in office, with half approving of the job he did as president. Four years ago, 47% approved of the job Trump had done.",
      "This desire for change was coupled with split views on the role of government. Slightly more than half felt the government should be doing more to solve the country\u2019s problems, a modest decline from 2020 (57%). Some 45% felt the government was doing too many things better left to the private sector.",
      "Profile of the Vote",
      "The nation\u2019s deep divides \u2013 by gender, education, and area of residence \u2013 were on vivid display. Men backed Trump by 10 points, while women went for Harris by 8 points. The 18-point gender gap was a touch wider than 2020 (17 points).",
      "In 2020, Trump won men by 5 points and Biden won women by 12.",

      "Trump had a particular advantage among White voters without a degree (+29 points), thanks in large part to his 38-point edge among noncollege White men.",
      "Harris won college-educated Whites by 8 points and college-educated White women by 16 points \u2013 both in the ballpark of Biden\u2019s 2020 margins (+7 points and +21 points, respectively).",
      "Overall, White voters backed Trump by 12 points, exactly the same as his 12-point advantage in 2020.",

      "Suburban voters backed Harris by 6 points, less than Biden\u2019s 10-point margin four years ago.

      "Nearly three-quarters of Republicans (73%) considered themselves part of the MAGA movement. And while the Harris campaign touted endorsements from prominent Republicans, she was unable to convince enough non-MAGA Republicans to cross the aisle.",
      "Just 7% of voters self-identified as true independents, meaning they do not lean toward one party or another. Harris had a 7-point advantage with this pivotal swing group, a decline from Biden\u2019s 15-point edge in 2020.",

      "Voters also believed Trump would capably handle a crisis (54-48%) and had the right policy ideas (52%-47%).",
      "Harris had advantages on personal character (53% vs 43% for Trump), honesty (47%-41%), and having the mental capacity to serve as president (57%-52%). Equal numbers thought each would look out for people like them (48%-48%).",
      "But in an election where voters wanted change, slightly more thought Trump would bring positive change (51%-48%).",
      "Trump\u2019s voters were largely motivated by support for the former president (79%) rather than a vote against Harris (21%). Two-thirds of the vice president\u2019s supporters (66%) described their vote as for her; 34% as against Trump.",
      "On balance, voters had slightly more favorable views of Harris (48% favorable, 50% unfavorable) as a person than Trump (47% favorable, 51% unfavorable). The same was true at the vice-presidential level: views of Tim Walz (43% favorable, 42% unfavorable) were marginally better than opinions of JD Vance (43% favorable, 45% unfavorable). Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ended his third-party presidential bid and endorsed Trump in August, was just a touch less popular than the two running mates (42% favorable, 43% unfavorable).",
      "Harris\u2019 best groups included college-educated women, Black voters, liberals and urban voters. (Fox News)",
      "Although he won, Trump was unable to fully rehabilitate his image during his time out of office: four years ago, his favorable rating was under water by 7 points (46% favorable vs. 53% unfavorable).",
      "The spotlight was less kind to Biden, whose sharply negative favorability rating (40% favorable, 58% unfavorable) slipped significantly from four years ago (50% favorable, 48% unfavorable).",
      "Views of the candidates were shaped over the course of a condensed campaign marked by a string of earthshaking events: the criminal cases against Donald Trump, two assassination attempts against the former president, Biden withdrawing from the race after the first debate, and Harris attempting to be the first woman elected to the presidency.",
      "Relatively few voters (13%) said the possibility of electing the first woman president was the most important factor to their vote. Harris won these voters by a wide margin \u2013 but a third backed Trump to deny Harris the chance to be the first female commander-in-chief.",
      "The image of a bloodied and defiant Trump after the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, clearly galvanized his supporters, as 16% said the attempts were the most important factor to their vote, and they overwhelmingly backed Trump.",

      "In a sign of inflation\u2019s economic toll, nearly three times as many voters said they were falling behind financially as said they were getting ahead. In 2020, 13% said they were getting ahead and 18% were falling behind, with the majority (69%) holding steady.",
      "Those who said they were getting ahead went for Harris by 42 points and those holding steady backed her by a narrower 6-point spread, while those falling behind went for Trump by 29 points.",
      "Nearly all voters were concerned about being able to afford food (91%, including 67% very concerned), and most were worried about paying for health care (84%, 54% very concerned), housing (79%, 51% very), and gas (79%, 48% very).",

      "Despite preferring Trump on the economy, voters split on his signature economic policy, increasing tariffs on goods imported to the United States.",
      "Trump\u2019s advantage on immigration was larger than his edge on the economy, as voters preferred him on the issue by 15 points.",
      "Over the course of the campaign, Trump promised \"the largest domestic deportation operation in American history\" \u2013 and succeeded in changing voters\u2019 minds on the issue. Four years ago, 70% believed undocumented immigrants should be offered the chance to apply for legal status, while 29% felt they should be deported. Voters\u2019 views this year were markedly different.",
      "Relatedly, two-thirds favored limiting the number of immigrants allowed to apply for asylum \u2013 a policy adopted by both the Trump and Biden administrations, but more closely associated with Trump.",
      "Voters also thought Trump would do a better job handling crime than Harris by 9 points.",
      "Harris\u2019 advantages on climate change (voters preferred her to Trump by 18 points) and abortion (Harris +18 points) outpaced Trump\u2019s edge on immigration and crime.",
      "All told, nearly two-thirds (63%) said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, up from the 59% who felt that way four years ago, before the repeal of Roe v. Wade.",
      "The balance was closer, however, when voters considered a ban after 15 weeks: 46% in favor, 53% opposed.",
      "In a sign of inflation\u2019s economic toll, nearly three times as many voters said they were falling behind financially as said they were getting ahead. In 2020, 13% said they were getting ahead and 18% were falling behind, with the majority (69%) holding steady. (Fox News)",
      "A slim majority opposed banning gender-affirming medical treatments for minors who identify as transgender. The Trump campaign spent millions of advertising dollars highlighting Harris\u2019 past support of gender-affirming care for the incarcerated.",
      "Even if they did not agree with her on transgender health care, voters saw Harris as better able to handle health care more broadly (by 8 points) and largely envisioned a more active government role. Majorities felt the government should be more involved in lowering the price of prescription medication (75%), eliminating medical debt (58%), and ensuring individuals have health insurance coverage (58%).",
      "Slightly fewer, 50%, said the government should be more involved in ensuring children are vaccinated against common preventable diseases, but just 22% wanted the government less involved in vaccinations.",
      "A week before the election, Harris used a speech at the Ellipse in Washington \u2013 the site of the Jan. 6, 2021, Trump rally that preceded the violent events at the Capitol \u2013 to cast Trump as a threat to American democracy.",
      "A 55% majority was concerned Trump would move the country closer to authoritarian rule, while less than half (46%) felt Harris posed a similar threat.",
      "Even so, majorities felt each candidate\u2019s views were too extreme.",
      "Voters split over how much responsibility Trump bore for the violence at the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Harris won those who felt Trump had a great deal of responsibility by 86 points, while Trump won those who felt he was not to blame at all by 91 points. The group in the middle \u2013 who felt he was somewhat responsible for the violence \u2013 went for Trump by 40 points.",
      "In general, slightly more voters felt the way Republicans talk about politics leads to violence (56%) than felt the same about Democrats (50%).",
      "Despite unsubstantiated allegations of fraud in the 2020 election results and Trump raising similar concerns about the 2024 contest, three-quarters of voters (75%) were confident votes would be counted accurately at the national level, and even more were confident in their state\u2019s ability to properly count the vote.",
      "While 31% lacked confidence that ineligible voters would be prohibited from voting, that was down from 35% who felt that way four years ago. Few (9%) worried that eligible voters would be prevented from casting ballots.",
      "Overall, 89% felt both candidates were obligated to accept the results of the election once all the votes were counted and the inevitable legal challenges were resolved. The vast majority of Harris voters (95%) and Trump voters (82%) felt there was an obligation to accept the results.",
      "Trump countered Harris\u2019 closing argument by suggesting Harris was too weak and untested to respond effectively in a crisis. Three-quarters thought Harris had been tested, and these voters felt she had delivered negative results by a 5-point margin. Most voters felt Trump had been tested, and slightly more felt he had delivered positive results than negative ones.",
      "The ongoing violence in the Middle East served to reinforce Trump\u2019s argument about leadership in a crisis, as voters believed he would do a better job handling the situation.",
      "Voters favored continuing aid to Israel to fight Hamas and Hezbollah by 9 points, while favoring continued aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression by 11 points.",
      "There was a marked shift in voters\u2019 views of America\u2019s role in the world. Just 20% wanted the country to take a more active role in solving the world\u2019s problems, down from 37% who felt that way four years ago. Roughly equal numbers said the current approach was about right (38%) or preferred a less active role (40%).",
      "States",
      "Georgia swung back to the Republican column after Biden eked out a win by the slimmest of margins in 2020. With the margins so narrow, the smallest shifts from 2020 would have been enough to flip the state to Trump. Instead, he got substantial movement among constituencies Democrats were counting on to keep the state blue.",
      "Harris won women by 5 points, down from Biden\u2019s 10-point advantage in 2020. She won voters under age 30 by 9 points, down from +19 for Biden. There was a similar shift among Black voters, who form the backbone of Democratic support in the Peach State: from Biden +86 points to Harris +71 points.",
      "The shift among Black men was particularly consequential, as they went for Harris by just 51 points after breaking for Biden by 76 points four years ago.",
      "Harris was counting on a strong performance in the suburbs to offset Trump\u2019s strength (+31 points) with rural voters, but here again she came up well short of Biden\u2019s mark: winning by just 3 points, a far cry from Biden\u2019s 12-point win.",
      "Trump was dominant with White voters without a college degree (78%) and White evangelical Christians (82%).",
      "Trump appealed to voters across the state on economic grounds and found a ready audience, as huge numbers said they were concerned about paying for necessities like food (93%), health care (87%), gas (84%), and housing (83%).",
      "Georgia voters trusted Trump over Harris on the economy by 8 points.",
      "Voters preferred Harris by a wider margin (19 points) on abortion. Harris highlighted the case of Amber Thurman, the Georgia mother who died waiting for care after complications from an abortion pill, as an example of the harms of abortion bans.",
      "Trump, on the other hand, shone a spotlight on Laken Riley, a nursing student allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant while jogging in February. His message on immigration proved compelling, as voters favored him on the issue by 17 points.",
      "Overall, 54% would prefer illegal immigrants be deported, a substantial increase from the 32% who felt that way in 2020. Less than half (44%) said undocumented immigrants should be given the chance to apply for legal status.",
      "Georgia was a focal point for controversy after the 2020 election, but 8 in 10 voters were confident this year\u2019s votes would be counted accurately.",
      "Trump triumphed once again in North Carolina, as Republicans have now won 10 of the last 11 presidential elections in the state. Barack Obama\u2019s narrow win in 2008 was the only Democratic victory since Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency.",
      "Trump posted similar results to 2020 among White voters without a college degree (74%, vs 69% four years ago), rural voters (63%, up 3 points from 2020), and White evangelical Christians (87%, up 1 point from 2020).",
      "That alone might have been a winning formula \u2013 but shifts among Black voters and voters under age 30 pushed Trump over the top.",
      "Overall, young voters backed Harris by just 8 points after going for Biden by 16 points four years ago. The shift was entirely powered by young men, who backed the former president by 16 points. Women under 30 went for Harris by 25 points.",
      "The story was similar among Black voters: Black women were nearly universal in their support for Harris (93%), while 19% of Black men backed Trump, up from 6% in 2020.",
      "Overall, 88% of Black voters picked Harris, down substantially from Biden\u2019s 94%.",
      "Harris won political moderates, a group that voted for Biden by 26 points, by just 16 points. She had hoped to run up the margins in the suburbs, but Trump more than held his own with 44% of the vote, up from 43% in 2020.",
      "Just 12% of North Carolina voters said they were getting ahead financially, while almost three times as many (31%) said they were falling behind \u2013 and these voters broke heavily for Trump.",
      "Some 42% cited the economy as the top issue facing the country. Harris kept the race close by nearly battling Trump to a draw on who could better handle the economy. Overall, voters trusted him over her by 5 points.",
      "Still, the 41% of voters who said inflation was the most important factor to their vote broke for Trump by 31 points, 65%-34%.",
      "In the governor\u2019s race, Republican Mark Robinson faced allegations of discriminatory remarks and inappropriate online behavior. The scandals did not help Republicans retake the governorship, which Democrats have now won in 8 of the last 9 elections.",
      "A majority (56%) held unfavorable opinions of Robinson, while more than half (52%) viewed Democrat Josh Stein favorably.",
      "Trump endorsed Robinson, but a majority of voters said the endorsement did not affect their view of the former president.",

      "Data theft and ransomware attacks against health care and critical third-party providers are still happening at an alarmingly high rate in 2024, which is shaping up to be as severe as last year, the worst on record for health care breaches.",

      "Woman working on a computer in a hospital (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Impact of ransomware on health care",
      "Microsoft points out that beyond the financial risk to health care organizations, ransomware attacks can have life-threatening consequences. When health care providers lose access to diagnostic equipment or patient records due to ransomware, patient care is severely disrupted. For example, stroke code activations are nearly double during hospital attacks, with confirmed strokes increasing by 113.6%, and cardiac arrest cases rise by 81% and survival rates drop from 40% to just 4.5%.",
      "Health care facilities near hospitals hit by ransomware attacks also feel the impact, facing a surge in patients needing urgent care that they may not be equipped to handle. As a result, patients often face longer wait times.",
      "What\u2019s more troubling is that these attacks aren\u2019t limited to urban areas. Rural health clinics are also prime targets for cyberattacks. These facilities are particularly vulnerable to ransomware because they often lack the resources to prevent or respond to security incidents. And since these clinics are the only health care option within miles, a successful attack can be devastating for many rural communities.",

      "HEALTH CARE RANSOMWARE ATTACK EXPOSES PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION OF OVER 100 MILLION",
      "Why health care is the prime target?",
      "Ransomware attacks on health care have shot up 300% since 2015, making it one of the top 10 most targeted industries in the second quarter of 2024. This rise is mostly because health care organizations store extremely sensitive data, and hackers know there\u2019s big money to be made. With lives on the line, hospitals can\u2019t risk poor patient outcomes if their systems go down or the exposure of patient data if they don\u2019t pay. This reputation for paying ransoms just makes health care an even bigger target.",
      "Some of the blame also falls on health care organizations. They tend to have lower cybersecurity budgets compared to other industries, making it harder to defend against these kinds of attacks. Many facilities don\u2019t have staff dedicated to cybersecurity; some don\u2019t even have a chief information security officer or a security operations center. Instead, cybersecurity often gets lumped in with regular IT duties. Plus, doctors, nurses and other health care staff might not get any cybersecurity training, so they might not even recognize a\u00a0phishing email when they see one.",

      "5. Be vigilant against phishing: Cyberattacks often result in a spike in phishing emails and calls as attackers exploit the situation. Protect yourself by using strong antivirus software on all your devices, which can help block malicious links and detect phishing emails. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Confirm appointments: If you have upcoming appointments or procedures, contact your health care provider to confirm or reschedule if a cyberattack disrupts their normal operations.",
      "7. Monitor patient portals: Keep an eye on patient portals like MyChart for updates on your medical records and communication with health care providers, as these can provide critical information during service disruptions.",

      "The surge in ransomware attacks on the health care industry is troubling and a harsh reminder that criminals don\u2019t care about the lives at risk. They\u2019re just after money. Health care organizations need to take lessons from the past two years, investing heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure and hiring dedicated staff to protect patient data and systems. With stronger defenses in place, the goal is to prevent these situations from reaching the point where paying a ransom is even considered.",

If you see such warnings, it\u2019s best to ignore them and avoid clicking on any links or downloading any suggested software. Below are several key steps you can take to secure your iPhone.",
      "1) Keep your iPhone up to date: Occasionally, Apple releases new iOS updates to address known vulnerabilities. When possible, it is best to\u00a0update the iOS so that your iPhone is safe from known vulnerabilities.",
      "2) Install and run strong antivirus software: An antivirus software actively running on all of your devices can help keep them all safe, including your iPhone. With iPhones, strong antivirus software will prevent you from clicking on any malicious links that may then install malware onto your devices, which can potentially extract personal information from your device. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These can be phishing attempts designed to steal your personal information.",

      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security to your Apple ID can help protect your personal information. With\u00a02FA, even if someone gets your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without the second factor.",
      "5) Use strong passwords: Ensure that your passwords are strong and unique for different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them.",

      "While most iPhone users rest easy knowing that the iOS keeps most common viruses and malware at bay, they are still susceptible to scammers trying to work around the closed code and scaring people into making bad choices that endanger their phones and data. Because Apple never sends out alerts about viruses or malware on your iPhone, it should be the first clue of a scam. Even if it looks official, iPhone users do not get alerts from Apple about viruses or malware. If you do install a good antivirus program, that will be the only program notifying you that there is anything amiss with your iPhone. Understanding these scams can go a long way in keeping you calm and your phone safe.",

      "Common misconceptions",
      "Opening emails can instantly infect your device: One common myth is that simply opening an email can automatically infect your device with malware. In reality, modern email systems (such as Gmail, Outlook, etc.) generally prevent this from happening. The real danger comes from interacting with the content inside the email, such as clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.",
      "Plain text emails are always safe: While emails in plain text format are generally safer than HTML-based emails, they can still pose a risk if they contain malicious links. Phishing attacks can appear in plain text emails, luring you to dangerous websites.",
      "Emails from known contacts are always safe: Even if an email appears to come from someone you know, that doesn\u2019t always mean it's safe. Attackers can spoof email addresses or hack accounts, so always be cautious about unexpected or unusual messages from known contacts, especially those containing links or attachments.",
      "Spam filters catch all malicious emails: Spam filters are highly effective but not perfect. Some sophisticated phishing and malicious emails can bypass these filters and land in your inbox. This is why it\u2019s important to stay vigilant, even with emails that seem to have passed your email service\u2019s security checks.",
      "Previewing emails is always safe: Most modern email clients use a \"preview\" pane for quick reading. While the risk of malware through previews is significantly reduced in up-to-date systems, embedded trackers or other forms of data collection can still occur, confirming your activity to the spammer. Always disable automatic image loading or other active content features in your email client\u2019s settings to minimize exposure.",

      "As mentioned already, generally, simply opening an email is not enough to cause harm. However, there are some important points to consider:",
      "1) Embedded trackers: Some spam or\u00a0phishing emails contain trackers that can notify the sender when the email is opened. This can confirm to the spammer that your email address is active, potentially leading to more spam.",
      "2) Malicious links and attachments: The real danger lies in clicking on links or downloading attachments within the email. These can lead to malicious websites or download malware onto your device.",
      "3) HTML emails: Emails that contain HTML content can sometimes execute scripts when opened. While modern email clients have protections against this, it\u2019s still a potential risk.",
      "4) Phishing attempts: Even if you don\u2019t click on anything,\u00a0phishing emails can be designed to look very convincing and may trick you into providing personal information if you respond.",

      "3) Enable email filtering: Turn on spam filters to reduce the number of unsolicited or potentially dangerous emails reaching your inbox. This reduces your exposure to phishing attempts. Most email platforms these days automatically filter out what they assume to be \"junk\" into their own folder. If you notice the amount of spam getting through to your inbox increasing, you may want to consider a\u00a0Spam Filter.\u00a0There are free options for different email providers. For Gmail, try\u00a0Mailwasher. For Outlook and Windows Mail, try\u00a0Spam Bully, which costs an annual fee of $29.95.",
      "4) Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your email client and operating system to stay protected from the latest security vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit.",

Regularly culling through these reports can help you spot potential fraud, which might signal that your Social Security number has been compromised.

      "While most people know they should check their credit report and scores, you can see your Social Security statement by creating an account on the official Social Security Administration website. Because only one account can be created per SSN, it is safer if you claim it so that no one else can by piecing together your personal information (along with your SSN) to claim it fraudulently.

It\u2019s important to make note of the patterns and follow up with these collectors should it become more and more apparent that your SSN might have been misused. Oftentimes, consumers start getting more credit offers when new credit cards are opened.

Don\u2019t carry your Social Security card in your wallet or purse.",
      "Skip jotting down your Social Security number on in-person forms. When your SSN is jotted down on paper, it is hard to control how the information gets used or disposed of. If you can submit forms online, you can skip the risk of having your SSN getting into the wrong hands. If you mail in forms that denote your SSN, you risk having that piece of mail stolen or lost.",
      "Even though your SSN is requested on some forms, it is not always necessary. If a future employer is requesting your SSN, double-check why they need it.

While paying regularly for fraud protection services may seem like an unnecessary expense when you\u2019re not presently dealing with identity or credit issues, a fraud protection service subscription can help you focus on your present moment instead of worrying about what a criminal might do with your SSN.

    "story": [
      "Powered by artificial intelligence, the tool aims to keep personal information safe.",
      "Do you remember those TV shows where the villain gets defeated in one season but comes back even stronger in the next? Think\u00a0\"Stranger Things\" on Netflix. The malware we\u2019re talking about here is just like that. It\u2019s called FakeCalls, and every time researchers figure out how it infects devices, it evolves with new ways to hide.",
      "Earlier this year, it was reported to be impersonating large financial institutions, and now security researchers have discovered that the malware has gone through another upgrade. It can even hijack the calls you make to your bank using your Android phone.",

      "Man surfing on his Android phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "FakeCalls is a banking trojan that focuses on voice phishing, where victims are deceived through fraudulent calls impersonating banks and are asked to share sensitive information. Earlier versions did this by prompting users to call the bank from within an app that impersonated the financial institution, as reported by\u00a0Bleeping Computer. However, the latest version, analyzed by\u00a0Zimperium, sets itself as the default call handler.",
      "The default call handler app manages incoming and outgoing calls, allowing users to answer, reject or initiate calls. Giving these permissions to a malicious app, as you can imagine, carries serious risks.",
      "When a user gives the app permission to set itself as the default call handler, the malware gets the green light to intercept and mess with both outgoing and incoming calls. It even shows a fake call interface that looks just like the real Android dialer, complete with trusted contact info and names. This level of deception makes it really tough for victims to see what's happening.",
      "\"When the compromised individual attempts to contact their financial institution, the malware redirects the call to a fraudulent number controlled by the attacker,\"\u00a0explains the new Zimperium report. \"The malicious app will deceive the user, displaying a convincing fake UI that appears to be the legitimate Android's call interface showing the real bank's phone number.\"",
      "\"The victim will be unaware of the manipulation, as the malware\u2019s fake UI will mimic the actual banking experience, allowing the attacker to extract sensitive information or gain unauthorized access to the victim\u2019s financial accounts,\"\u00a0the report added.",

      "This malware not only hijacks your calls but can also steal your data. It gets access to Android\u2019s Accessibility permissions, which basically gives it free rein to do whatever it wants. The developer of the malware has also added several new commands, including the ability to start livestreaming the device's screen, take screenshots, unlock the device if it\u2019s locked and temporarily turn off auto-lock. It can also use accessibility features to mimic pressing the home button, delete images specified by the command server, and access, compress and upload photos and thumbnails from storage, especially from the DCIM folder.",

      "6 ways to protect yourself from FakeCalls malware",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software: Android has its own built-in malware protection called Play Protect, but the FakeCalls malware proves it\u2019s not enough. Historically, Play Protect hasn\u2019t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. Also, avoid clicking on any links in messages or emails that seem suspicious. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any\u00a0phishing emails or\u00a0ransomware scams.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Download apps from reliable sources:\u00a0It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources, like the Google Play Store. The FakeCalls malware infects your phone when you download an app from an unknown link. As an Android user, you should only download apps from the Play Store, which has strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Also, never trust download links that you receive through SMS.",
      "3) Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4) Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system and apps: Keeping your software\u00a0up to date is crucial, as updates often include security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware like FakeCalls.",
      "5) Monitor financial activity regularly: Check your bank and credit card statements often for unauthorized transactions. Set up alerts for any account activity, which can notify you immediately if suspicious activity occurs.",
      "6) Limit sensitive transactions on mobile: Whenever possible, avoid performing high-risk transactions (like large money transfers) on your mobile device, especially if you\u2019re in\u00a0public or connected to unsecured Wi-Fi. Use a secure computer or contact your bank directly from a verified number.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Hackers are constantly upgrading their tactics and finding clever ways to hack your devices and scam you out of your hard-earned money. I really think Android phone manufacturers and Google need to step up their game on security to help keep users from getting hacked so often. I don\u2019t see the same level of malware affecting iPhones.",

      "As the name suggests, the\u00a0Mac Mini\u00a0is a compact computer that can handle some serious workloads. First announced in 2005, it retained the same design until 2010, but Apple finally changed it with the latest model. They\u2019ve shrunk the case, reducing the computer\u2019s volume by half. The new Mini is now a five-inch by five-inch box that\u2019s just two inches tall, while the older model measures 7.75 inches by 7.75 inches and is 1.41 inches thick.",
      "The main upgrade for the new computer is the inclusion of Apple\u2019s latest chips, either the M4 or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro. The\u00a0M4 Mini\u00a0comes equipped with two USB-C ports and a headphone jack on the front. These front USB-C ports support USB 3, with speeds of up to 10Gbps.",
      "On the back, you\u2019ll find three USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports (up to 40Gbps), along with Ethernet and HDMI connections. The higher-end M4 Pro model also features Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, which offers transfer speeds of up to 120Gbps and the ability to connect up to three displays.",
      "The starting price of the\u00a0Mac Mini remains the same at $599. This baseline model comes with the M4 chip featuring 10 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores, along with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. For $799, you can double the SSD to 512GB, while the $999 model bumps the RAM up to 24GB. These are solid prices, which isn\u2019t something I say often about Apple products.",
      "There\u2019s also a $1,399 Mac Mini model that features the new M4 Pro processor, which boasts a 12-core CPU and 16-core GPU. It also supports up to 64GB of RAM and up to an 8TB SSD.",

But if you\u2019re just using an\u00a0iMac for general tasks like browsing or light work, you might be better off with an older model to save some cash.

They can get your information in many ways, by accessing public information like government records or gathering data from loyalty card programs, surveys and social media. Mobile apps can also share your personal information with data brokers. Even your online browsing habits are valuable to data brokers. Your data profile can be sold to many different buyers, including targeted advertising and marketing companies, as well as\u00a0government agencies.",
      "How a data broker uses your information",
      "Some data brokers offer personal profiles directly to consumers, and you might be surprised by how much information they have about you. Have you ever tried searching for someone on a \"people search\" website? These sites let you enter a name and find out all sorts of information about that person. Try searching for yourself or someone you know. You might find out who used to live at your current address, how much money you make and who your relatives are.",
      "Where do people search sites get their information?",
      "People search sites get their information from public records like court documents and voter registration forms. They usually offer some basic information for free, but if you want more details, you\u2019ll have to sign up for a free trial. And when you do, they\u2019ll probably ask for even more information about you.",
      "The scary thing is that anyone with a computer can access this information, including identity thieves. With just a few key pieces of information, they can call your bank, reset your passcodes and take over your financial accounts.",
      "Even cyberstalkers and blackmailers can use people search sites to find out more about you. Sure, most sites make users promise not to use the information for illegal purposes, but there\u2019s no real way to enforce that. It\u2019s all based on the honor system.",
      "Taking control: removing your information from data brokers",
      "Don\u2019t worry though; there\u2019s something you can do about it. You can request that data brokers remove your information.\u00a0 But with hundreds of them in the U.S. alone, it can be a daunting task. That\u2019s where removal services come in.",
      "Invest in data removal services",

      "The persistence of robocalls: why are they still a problem?",
      "While it\u2019s important to take steps to protect your personal information, such as removing it from data broker sites, there are still other threats to our privacy and security. For example, despite efforts to crack down on robocalls, scammers are constantly finding new ways to evade detection and continue their operations. Furthermore, as technology improves, robocallers are able to use more sophisticated methods, such as \"spoofing\" their phone numbers to make it appear as though they are calling from a different location or entity.",
      "Moreover, spam callers are becoming so sophisticated that they have started to add conversational speech to their scripts to further convince their unsuspecting victims to go along with their scams. For instance, the caller may stumble on their words, use \"umm\" a lot, and sometimes even use slang to signal to the listener that the caller is not a robot but an ordinary person, but beware! While some robocalls can range from harmless reminders, most are malicious scams, leaving many frustrated and vulnerable to fraud.

      "Kohberger's team filed a number of attacks on the possibility of capital punishment last month, challenging it as a potentially cruel or unusual punishment, arguing that it goes against \"contemporary standards of decency\" and asserting that Idaho's newly revived firing squad is unconstitutional, among other arguments.",
      "\"It appears the defense is laying the groundwork for appeal,\" said Matt Mangino, a former Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, district attorney and expert on capital punishment litigation. \"Their most recent arguments are for an appellate court not a trial court.\"",

      "Cease-fire talks continued last week as Israel, the U.S., Egypt and Qatar looked to find a solution to free the hostages and stop the war, yet life in the trenches goes on. Fox News Digital spoke with an IDF colonel based in the explosive Netzarim corridor in Gaza.",
      "The Netzarim Corridor splits Gaza in half, and it's here where IDF Col. Amir Ofri\u00a0organizes his troops in a fight against terrorists. The atmosphere is tense, he says, and describes a recent incident where a Gazan woman stumbled toward his unit checkpoint, her movements erratic, suggesting disorientation.

      "On the morning that Hamas attacked Israeli communities and settlements close to Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, Col. Ofri was with his family in the north to celebrate his 46th birthday. A seasoned officer, he immediately reported for duty to a base in the Negev Desert a little more than 30 kilometers from the border. By the next day, his reserve armored brigade was positioned at the Gaza fence, ready for whatever lay ahead. \"We were the first to enter Gaza on Oct. 21,\" he recalls.",
      "The responsibility he bears weighs heavily on him. \"It's been over nine months since I\u2019ve seen my wife and children for more than a fleeting moment,\" he says. Before the war, he directed a company with factories in Israel, Spain and the U.S. \"My partner in Oklahoma was one of the first to call me after Oct. 7.

      "The Netzarim Corridor is pivotal in the Gaza Strip. With the onset of the ground campaign, IDF forces established a four-kilometer wide corridor to split Gaza in two, from its eastern border to the Mediterranean Sea. Key towns sit along the route \u2013 Jabalia and Zeitoun to the north, and Al-Bureij and Nuseirat to the south.",

      "\"All the convoys we needed to pass did pass, and then we saw Hamas setting up roadblocks, stopping and looting them,\" he says, elaborating on the complicated dynamics on the ground. \"Hamas targets specific trucks rather than looting indiscriminately. We observed them unloading supplies quickly, moving items into warehouses. We even saw armed Hamas vehicles leaving those locations, with guards at the entrances.\"",

      "\"The problem lies in Hamas's cynical use of the population,\" Ofri says. He blames the terror organization for the loss of so many civilian lives. \"We witnessed this during the recent Iranian attack. As soon as the Iranian assault began, on October 1, Hamas operatives attacked us. We were on the southern side of the corridor when they used short-range mortars to exploit the situation, pushing civilians toward our position.

While many speculate that Sinwar\u2019s death may lead to a turning point in the conflict, Ofri remains dubious. \"In my view, he was just another terrorist who deserved to die. He\u2019s just another obstacle in the effort to release hostages. I understand we won\u2019t be able to free them through military means alone. However, I believe military pressure is the only strategy that has led to the first hostage deal.\"",
      "And it is because of the hostages that Israel must continue fighting, he says. \"There are 101 hostages left, many of whom are relatives of our soldiers. Oct. 7 affected us all. I lost friends that day as well,\" Ofri says. \"That\u2019s why we come together time and again, although it gets harder and harder. If you ask any soldier, they will tell you it\u2019s about the hostages.\"",

      "Badenoch became the Conservatives' fifth leader since mid-2016 after winning 57% of party members' votes in the final stage of a months-long contest that saw a field of six whittled down to two. She beat a former immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, who won 43% of the votes.",

      "With the Labour government off to a bumpy start, some Conservatives are increasingly optimistic that they could win back power at the next election, which has to be held in 2029.",

    "summary": "Democrats\u2019 recriminations started immediately, but Trump\u2019s victory was decisive enough that there may have been little Kamala Harris could have done.",
    "story": [
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Democrats were counting on fed-up women to elect America\u2019s first female president. Instead, dissatisfied men helped return Donald Trump to power.",
      "The president-elect's two eldest sons helped him pick a running mate who once decried \u201cchildless cat ladies,\u201d while his youngest son, Barron, encouraged his father\u2019s pivot to podcasts in an effort to reach other young men, a typically reliable Democratic voting bloc that split evenly this year.",
      "\u201cI think the gender gap is going to be the story of the next 20 years. Truly,\u201d Democratic strategist Caitlin Legacki said. \u201cThere are a lot of men who feel like they\u2019re being left behind, that society doesn\u2019t have a place for them. And if we don\u2019t want a civil war breaking out along gender lines, we\u2019ve got to figure that out. That is the biggest widening gap in American society.\u201d",
      "The entire country shifted right, like other Western democracies in the inflationary post-Covid era. And with the electorate in a foul mood, Vice President Kamala Harris struggled to separate herself from a deeply unpopular incumbent who waited too long to step aside and whose aides had undermined her for years.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, made strides in his promise to assemble a multiracial working-class coalition, winning 45% of Latinos and 55% of Latino men \u2014\u00a0 records for a Republican presidential candidate \u2014 while making gains in blue states and pushing his margins among non-college-educated and middle-income voters to new heights, according to NBC News exit polls.",
      "\u201cThe demographic shifts for us were just so brutal,\u201d a Harris aide said. \u201cOur people rejected us.\u201d",
      "Democrats\u2019 recriminations started before the clock ran out on Election Day \u2014 Harris was too cautious, many said, or she should have broken cleanly from President Joe Biden and replaced the leaders he installed in the campaign\u00a0 \u2014 but Trump\u2019s victory was conclusive enough across the board that there may have been little she could do.",
      "\u201cThe electorate has moved decisively to the right on a number of key issues, which happen to be the key issues that defined this election, especially immigration and inflation,\u201d said Evan Roth Smith, the lead pollster for the Democratic group Blueprint. \u201cIt was probably impossible for any Democrat to win, and probably any Republican could have won, because Harris made probably the best possible attempt to win it and Trump made the best possible attempt to lose it.\u201d",
      "Indeed, on his third run for the presidency and after nine years as a fixture of American life, Trump is positioned to be the first nonincumbent Republican of the century to win not just the Electoral College, but also the most votes.",
      "\u201cThe worst part: He\u2019s going to win the popular vote, too,\u201d another Harris aide said.",
      "This account of how Trump won and how Harris lost is based on more than 35 interviews with operatives and officials from both parties and campaigns, many of whom were granted anonymity to offer immediate candid observations about what went right or wrong.",
      "New campaign, same Trump",
      "Less than four years ago, after the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, Trump was cast into the political wilderness by his own party, as Republicans turned to new faces they thought could harness Trump\u2019s energy but with less of his baggage, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "Republican voters had other ideas, sticking with Trump, the former reality TV star, who reclaimed his image as an outside change agent and faced prosecutions and two assassination attempts.",
      "A campaign official said Trump\u2019s primary clash with DeSantis helped him hit his stride after a \u201csocial stigma\u201d followed him in the early months of his post-presidency.",
      "\u201cRewind back to 2021 and 2022 \u2014it was kind of rough,\u201d a campaign official said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t seen as cool. The spark was gone a little bit. When he really started with DeSantis, the spark came back to him. Having an adversary brought the spark back.\u201d",
      "The \u201csocial stigma\u201d receded further after the indictments, this person said.",
      "\u201cIt turned Donald Trump into a f---ing folk hero and icon,\u201d the person added.",
      "\u201cAnd then he gets shot, and that only increases the view of him as a folk hero and icon.\u201d",
      "Breaking from the improvisational chaos that defined his 2016 and 2020 campaigns, Trump \u201cmade it clear from the beginning: He wanted a professional operation,\u201d said Chris LaCivita, who along with fellow senior adviser Susie Wiles co-managed a campaign that was widely seen as more disciplined and competent than his previous ones \u2014 even if Trump himself remained as allergic to staying on message as ever.",
      "Outside of some clashes involving LaCivita and longtime Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski that recently spilled out into public, there was little of the backstabbing that typified past Trump campaigns.",
      "\u201cThere was very little drama,\u201d a campaign official said. \u201cIt was like a normal campaign where people basically got along. You would talk through strategy, agree on stuff and you wouldn\u2019t run to NBC to knife the person if you disagreed with them.\u201d"

      "The names \u2014 shows and personalities that hosted Trump on their programs during the campaign \u2014 comprise a who\u2019s who of the most influential shows among young American men. And in an election in which his campaign specifically courted that demographic, the shoutout hinted at what has so far been borne out in exit polling data.",
      "Trump picked up a larger portion of voters under 30 than any Republican presidential candidate since 2008, according to NBC News exit polling, improving with both young men and young women. In 2020, President Joe Biden beat Trump by 11 percentage points among young men; this year, Trump beat Kamala Harris by 2 points. Among young women, Biden\u2019s 35-point lead over Trump in 2020 shrunk to a 24-point lead for Harris. Among young white men without college degrees, Trump beat Harris, 56% to 40%.",
      "Researchers at Tufts University\u2019s Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement saw similar trends.",
      "This year, \u201cit\u2019s not the case that young people overwhelmingly supported Democrats,\u201d said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, the center's director.",
      "Young people, more than older voters, typically rely on people in their communities whom they trust, Kawashima-Ginsberg said. That could help explain the influence of internet personalities, like Rogan, who interviewed Trump for his podcast and endorsed him on the eve of the election.\u00a0\u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience\u201d is the most popular podcast in the United States, according to data from Edison Research, with 56% of its listeners aged 18 to 34, according to YouGov, and 81% male. Other prominent male influencers who endorsed Trump, like YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul, also have demographics that skew young and male.",
      "\u201cIf you are a Joe Rogan listener and you feel inspired by the interview and want to talk to others about it, that has a real impact,\u201d Kawashima-Ginsberg said.",
      "Another major motivating factor among young people this year was the economy.Researchers picked up on this trend months before the election, noting that voters under 30 were struggling financially, uncertain about their futures and were driven more by pocketbook concerns than issues that seemed more distant, like the future of democracy \u2014 or even abortion and immigration.",
      "That turned out to be the case.",
      "NBC News exit polls showed that the economy ranked as the most important issue among young voters, and those who chose it as the top issue voted for Trump 78% to Harris\u2019 21%.",
      "\u201cEvery candidate and party had an opportunity to really listen to young voters and hear what they really wanted,\u201d Kawashima-Ginsberg said. \u201cIn this case, one candidate did reach them on economy.\u201d",

      "Ryan Jones, 21, said that he was a fan of Trump\u2019s proposal to not tax tips or overtime. Jones said he had worked jobs where his income was based on tips and, had those policies been in place at the time, he would\u2019ve been able to save more for college.\u201cPeople can\u2019t afford to live. People can\u2019t afford gas. People can\u2019t afford food. People can\u2019t afford rent. The cost of living has gone up in these last four years, and I think that everyone here has been a victim of that,\u201d said Jaiveer Bajwa, 19, of Pennsylvania.",
      "Kaeli Bennet, 18, said that when Trump was president, \u201cprices were a lot lower especially for homebuyers, and that is a huge issue for me.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s appearances on popular podcasts consumed by largely young male audiences may have bolstered his appeal to that demographic. Trump said his son Barron Trump, 18, urged him to appear on Rogan\u2019s show.",
      "\u201cI think him hopping on like Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast helped, and I remember he said that he actually took advice from his son Barron, because Barron would know what younger guys like, right?\u201d\u00a0Angel Sobolewski, 21, of Ohio, told NBC News by phone on Wednesday. She said she voted for Trump.",
      "In addition to Rogan\u2019s podcast, Trump made an appearance on \u201cThis Past Weekend w/ Theo Von,\u201d which racked up 14 million views on YouTube. On the podcast, Trump seemed fascinated with Von, who usually focuses on comedy and culture.",
      "\u201cIs cocaine a stronger up? So you\u2019re way up with cocaine \u2014 more than anything else you can think of?\u201d Trump asked Von.",

    "story": [
      "After helping engineer Donald Trump\u2019s improbable and sweeping victory in the presidential race, Susie Wiles, the president-elect\u2019s unassuming co-campaign chief, is seen as the frontrunner to become his White House chief of staff, according to six sources familiar with discussions inside the campaign.",
      "In a world riven by rivalries, advisers credit Wiles\u2019 ability to gain Trump\u2019s respect and corral big personalities. If chosen, Wiles would become the first female White House chief of staff in history.",
      "\u201cShe has commanded a ton of respect amongst the staff, as well as loyalty. She doesn\u2019t play games. And she means what she says: On the campaign, she said we are checking egos at the door and held everyone to it,\u201d said one campaign official, who, like others in this piece, was granted anonymity to speak candidly or because they were not authorized to speak on the record. \u201cThe team of rivals concept did not apply here.\u201d",
      "\"Susie is as good as they get,\" a second Trump campaign official said. \"She ran a great campaign and has the respect of all \u2014 including Democrats who recognize her talent. She'd make for a great chief of staff and would serve at the president's pleasure. After all, it is his White House.\" A third Trump campaign official said Wiles is already playing the de-facto chief of staff role and that staffers widely want her to get the job. A large staff meeting is taking place at the campaign headquarters on Thursday, and Wiles will lead it.",
      "The sense among advisers is that if Trump makes a strong appeal to Wiles, she would take the job \u2014 and it is widely hoped she will.",
      "\u201cIf she wants it, it\u2019s hers,\u201d said an adviser familiar with the discussions. \u201cHer standing with Trump and what she just helped pull off [winning by huge margins], makes it an easy choice if she wants it.\"",
      "Another Trump adviser said the job belongs to Wiles if she wants it. NBC News reached out to Wiles for comment.",
      "\u201cIf she really wants it, I\u2019m not sure how competitive this would be,\u201d the adviser familiar said.",
      "Trump is famously superstitious and has kept a distance from the planning for a future administration that began in the final months of his campaign. But the planning is now beginning in earnest and the pick of who will lead his operation will be among the most critical as he hopes to enact a sweeping agenda.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, Trump's transition team said his victory had \"delivered a mandate\" for their agenda \"that puts the working men and women of our nation first.\"",
      "\"As he chooses the best people to join his team and best policies to pursue, his transition team will ensure the implementation of President Trump's common sense agenda starting on Day 1,\" said the two advisers tapped to lead his transition, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, and Linda McMahon, a Cabinet member during the first Trump administration and business executive.",
      "The daughter of famed American football player and sportscaster Pat Summerall, Wiles led the staff through attempted assassinations, a change at the top of the Democratic ticket and slump in the polls.",
      "\u201cShe would be everybody\u2019s number one pick, but it\u2019s his decision,\u201d the first campaign official said.",
      "The 2024 campaign was the first time Trump has not changed his core campaign leadership team throughout a race, a dynamic that even he alluded to while speaking to reporters on Tuesday as he name-checked Wiles, who helped secure his victory in once-purple Florida in 2016.",
      "\u201cSome people said it\u2019s the best run campaign they\u2019ve ever seen, but in order to make that stick, you have to win,\u201d Trump said while casting his ballot. \u201cMy team \u2026 many of them are the same players\u2014 as you know, Susie.\u201d",
      "Praising Wiles during his victory speech on Tuesday, Trump shared her nickname and alluded to her essential work behind the scenes: \"We call her the ice maiden. Susie likes to stay in the background \u2014 she\u2019s not in the background.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think a lot of the president\u2019s closest allies really see the value that their partnership has created,\u201d said Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. \u201cThey complement each other perfectly.\u201d",
      "Trump's transition leaders are some of his longstanding friends and allies: Lutnick, who joined him often on the trail in the final weeks of his campaign \u2014 including on his return to Butler, Pennsylvania \u2014 and McMahon, a former official in his first administration.",
      "Other names actively under consideration for the White House chief of staff role include Brooke Rollins, a former top White House aide to Trump who now leads the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute, and former House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.",
      "Notably, Rollins held a prime speaking slot during an appearance at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally last month, where Lutnick spoke. During an appearance on Fox News on Thursday, McCarthy said he would not be chief of staff and praised Wiles as a someone who \u201cwould do a great job.\u201d",
      "A campaign official said Rollins and McCarthy all have relationships with Trump, but only one candidate has the professional respect and loyalty of the staff.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s Susie,\u201d the person added."

    "summary": "Haunted by their past critiques regarding President-elect Donald Trump, U.S. allies are rushing to make diplomatic U-turns by deleting posts and brushing over their prior scathing remarks.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's presidential victory means some U.S. allies may have to reckon with prior scathing remarks as their countries prepare to build diplomatic ties with a president-elect whose return they may not have anticipated.",
      "\u201cThe most destructive president in history,\u201d Australian Ambassador to the U.S. Kevin Rudd said of Trump in 2020, who \u201cdrags America and democracy through the mud.\u201d",
      "\u201cA woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathizing sociopath\u201d and a \u201cprofound threat to the international order,\u201d David Lammy, the  U.K.'s current foreign secretary, said in 2018.",
      "\u201cA political pyromaniac who must be put before a criminal court,\u201d Jean Asselborn,\u00a0then-foreign minister for Luxembourg, said of Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",
      "\"Trump has ruined it all,\" Croatian President\u00a0Zoran Milanovi\u0107 said, also in 2021. \"He incite[s] hate, he is a rabble-rouser and that\u2019s it.\"",
      "Following Trump\u2019s election victory, at least two of these U.S. allies, the U.K. and Australia, have had to dial back some of their previous attacks.",
      "Rudd deleted his posts after Trump's win, \u201cout of respect for the office of President of the United States,\u201d an Australian government statement said, and to \u201celiminate the possibility of such comments being misconstrued as reflecting his positions as Ambassador and, by extension, the views of the Australian Government.\u201d",
      "For Trump\u2019s part, he responded to Rudd\u2019s comments by calling him \u201cnasty\u201d and saying Rudd \u201cwon\u2019t be there long\u201d as Australian ambassador to the United States.",
      "Lammy pivoted from scathing critic to polite well-wisher, showing that diplomacy sometimes means shaking hands with those you once pointed fingers at.",
      "Lammy, who made his comments about Trump being \u201ca woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathizing sociopath\u201d in Time magazine in 2018 when he was a backbench minister of Parliament, had also protested against the then-government\u2019s \u201ccapitulation to this tyrant in a toupee.\u201d",
      "By Wednesday, as Trump claimed his decisive electoral victory, Lammy's tone as foreign secretary had shifted considerably, as he sent his congratulations and underlined the U.K.'s cherished special friendship with the U.S.",
      "Relations between Britain\u2019s ruling center-left Labour Party and Trump have been antagonistic in the lead-up to the election, with Trump accusing the British of election interference.",
      "In October, Trump\u2019s team\u00a0asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate\u00a0after a senior Labour figure posted a rallying cry for current and former staffers to travel to battleground states and\u00a0campaign for Harris.",
      "In the first phone call between the pair after the U.S. election, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer offered his \u201chearty congratulations\u201d to Trump after his \u201chistoric victory,\u201d a spokeswoman for the prime minister's office said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Charles Parton, who served as a British diplomat for almost four decades, said that \u201cthe Labour Party has got some grounds to make up\u201d after a perception that Starmer's party had favored the Democrats.",
      "On top of Lammy\u2019s remarks, Parton believes that Starmer's \u201csomewhat effusive statement\u201d is an attempt to \u201ctry and make up lost ground.\u201d",
      "Nigel Farage, the leader of the far-right Reform UK party, offered to help bridge Labour's awkward relations with Trump, whom he considers a personal friend with whom he is ideologically aligned, an offer the Labour Party declined."

      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 victory was powered by an overall voter shift in most places and most demographics compared to 2020 \u2014 with a new analysis of precinct data in pivotal Pennsylvania coloring in additional details about how Trump won.",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk collected and monitored precinct-level vote results in 50 of Pennsylvania\u2019s 67 counties, totaling more than 8,300 of the state\u2019s roughly 9,000 precincts. This granular data provides a detailed insight into what was happening neighborhood to neighborhood and block to block in the nation\u2019s biggest battleground state.",
      "On average, Pennsylvania\u2019s precincts shifted 1.6 percentage points toward the Republicans and 1.6 points away from the Democrats \u2014 a 3.2-point swing overall that flipped Pennsylvania from a 1-point victory for Democrats in 2020 to an approximately 2-point Republican win in 2024.",
      "The chart below shows the difference between Trump\u2019s vote percentage in 2020 and his percentage in 2024 in Pennsylvania precincts. Dots above the dotted black line are precincts where Trump out-performed his vote percentage four years ago. The red line shows the average shift in Trump support from 2020 to 2024.",
      "On average, Trump improved on his 2020 vote percentage in nearly all precincts in Pennsylvania, except those where he had already received more than 80% of support in 2020. Trump\u2019s strongest improvements occurred in places where he received 20% to 30% of the vote in 2020 \u2014 that is, he managed to lose by significantly less in what had been very Democratic corners of the state.",
      "Trump\u2019s overperformance in Democratic areas was clear when looking at the precinct results in the Philadelphia metro area \u2014 a key region for Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. In 2024, voters in Philadelphia and its four suburban collar counties made up just under 33% of all voters in the state.",
      "The map shows that nearly all of the region\u2019s 3,100 precincts shifted their votes in Trump\u2019s favor. While there are a few precincts that moved in Harris\u2019 favor (in blue on the map), Trump improved on his 2020 vote percentage in 82% of the region\u2019s precincts.",
      "While Harris and Biden both won this region comfortably, Harris\u2019 vote margin was nearly 120,000 votes smaller than Biden\u2019s. That\u2019s a significant decrease: Biden carried the state by 82,000 votes in 2020.",
      "The regional map also shows that the precincts where Trump improved the most were heavily concentrated in the city of Philadelphia.",
      "The Philadelphia map on the left shows that Harris comfortably won the vast majority of the city\u2019s 1,700 precincts. But the right side shows that Harris underperformed Biden\u2019s margins and nearly 84% of the city\u2019s precincts shifted toward Trump.",
      "On average, Trump performed 2 percentage points better in Philadelphia precincts \u2014 overall, similar to his improvement in the rest of the state. But there are key differences in different types of neighborhoods.",
      "The biggest of these shifts occurred in north and northeastern Philadelphia neighborhoods with high concentrations of Hispanic residents. This is yet more evidence of a recurring pattern in pre-election polling and the NBC News Exit Poll, which showed Trump significantly improving his vote percentage among Latino voters around the nation, including in Pennsylvania.",
      "Meanwhile, the blue areas that shifted toward Harris in northwest and central/southern Philadelphia (including the highly dense, downtown region of Center City) are neighborhoods with the highest concentration of college-educated residents. NBC Exit Poll results showed Trump\u2019s support among this group in Pennsylvania decreasing by 3 percentage points from his 2020 level."

      "For many Democratic voters, Vice President Kamala Harris' loss to Donald Trump was disappointing but not surprising, they said in interviews, agreeing that their party hadn't done enough to talk about the economy and lamenting lingering racism and sexism.",
      "Democratic voters in battleground states say they see many reasons for her defeat: the abbreviated campaign, a lack of economic messaging, a drift too far to the left on social issues, the war in Gaza and bias against Harris because she is a woman of color.",
      "Trump seized on Americans\u2019 economic frustrations while he drew young men and Latino voters, in particular, according to NBC News exit polls.",
      "Follow live coverage here",
      "Laytza Hernandez, 18, said that she voted for Harris but that many of her Mexican relatives voted for Trump because of his clearer message about the economy.",
      "\"They just felt like he was speaking more to their concerns,\u201d said Hernandez, a student at Arizona State University.",
      "Sami Khaldi, 58, the president of the local Democratic club in Dearborn, Michigan, said many in the community were \"angry\" about the Biden administration's handling of the war in Gaza and used their votes in protest. Voters in Dearborn, America's only Arab-majority city, broke decisively for Trump over Harris, a departure from Joe Biden\u2019s beating Trump there in 2020.",
      "More broadly, he said, Khaldi believes the Democrats need to go further to win over rural voters. Trump made a concerted effort to campaign in solidly blue states such as New York, Illinois and California, where, he said, Democratic policies, including about immigration and crime, have faltered.\"They need to rethink their strategy by widening their base and reach out to red states, not just the blue states or swing states,\" Khaldi said. \"I understand these swing states are very, very important, but I think we need to build a stronger foundation.\"",
      "While Harris was saddled with having to introduce herself to voters in a shortened campaign season after Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July, her supporters acknowledged she also had to walk a fine line between touting the administration's successes and presenting herself as a change candidate.",
      "\"She needed more time,\" said Luis Muza, 20, a Latino and Democratic voter in Milwaukee. \"If she had more time, it would\u00a0have\u00a0been a much closer race.\"",
      "Symone Sanders-Townsend, a former senior adviser on the Biden campaign who hosts MSNBC\u2019s \"The Weekend,\" said Harris \"left it all on the field\" as she crisscrossed the country ahead of Election Day.",
      "But Sanders-Townsend said that as she spoke with Democratic strategists and officials in swing states such as Pennsylvania, many expressed dismay at the perception that Harris' campaign seemed focused on issues that weren't necessarily pertinent to voters more concerned about inflation and their finances.",
      "One particular attack ad by the Trump campaign stuck out, Sanders-Townsend said: It featured Harris saying in the 2020 campaign that she would support giving trans inmates access to gender-affirming care and a narrator declaring, \u201cKamala is for they/them.\u201d",
      "\"The question that some of these voters had, according to the strategists on the ground, said, 'Hey, if that's what they're focused on, they're not focused on me,'\" Sanders-Townsend said. \"Some of the soul-searching is about how can the message break through. Because the idea that Democrats don't have an economic agenda that speaks to some of these working people, which is not true, but do the people feel it is the difference.\"",
      "MJay Hawkins, a student at Arizona State University, said it seemed like the Harris campaign may have focused too much on \"things that people are not comfortable with.\"\"So they chose Trump,\" Hawkins said, \"because they presented him as a Christian in a way that he's going to stop people with gay marriages and all of that stuff.\"",
      "For some Democrats, the possibility that Harris, a Black and South Asian woman whose victory would have been historic, could have become president wasn\u2019t lost on them. Her ability to peel off more white female voters \u2014 who have traditionally supported Republicans \u2014 amid larger concerns about women's access to abortion care and reproductive rights was noteworthy, although some Democrats worry that the electorate still isn\u2019t ready for a female president, much less a female president of color.",
      "\"I was really praying that she would get it,\" said Deborah McKinnon, 68, a Black Democratic voter from Pittsburgh. \"And then I was thinking, when [Hillary] Clinton was running, for some reason, society didn't want a female to win, so that also came to my mind this morning because she's a female. Regardless of race, they didn't want her to win.\"",
      "Gary Tate, another Black Democratic voter in Pittsburgh, agreed that gender was most likely a factor in an election in which Trump managed to lure more young men to the polls.",
      "\"No one's ready for a woman president,\" Tate said, adding that he liked Harris' stance on abortion rights.",
      "Harris' loss can't be understated, said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, a national organization supporting women of color in politics, which she started after Trump's 2016 win. Both Black women and men voted overwhelmingly for Harris, according to an NBC News exit poll, and Allison said Democrats can't afford to lose their base at a time when other demographic groups are shifting Republican.",
      "One in 3 voters of color went for Trump \u2014 the best performance of any Republican presidential candidate since George W. Bush in his 2004 re-election effort \u2014 the exit poll found.",
      "\"It just underscores that Black women are the most loyal Democrats, and they were the power behind Kamala Harris' campaign,\" Allison said. \"The country could learn a lot from what we've done.\"",
      "John Park, 37, a Black Democratic voter in suburban Atlanta, said that as a warehouse worker for an automotive company, he initially liked Trump's \"pro-America\" approach. But he snapped back toward Harris after he listened to an episode of Steve Harvey's radio show in which Harvey pointed out that convicted felons couldn\u2019t vote but that now a candidate with a felony conviction had another opportunity to become president.",
      "Park blamed Biden for not having stepped aside earlier. \"He didn't trust her when she was beside him,\" he said.",
      "The Rev. Luis Cort\u00e9s, who leads Esperanza, a Philadelphia nonprofit organization that provides services and advocates for Latinos, said Trump did something Harris didn\u2019t: He \"tapped into men's psyche\" after \"very little was done for that population in the inner cities of our country, for Black and Hispanic men.\"",
      "He said it seemed as if Harris didn't emphasize the same interest in economic development \u2014 and apparently the controversy in recent days about a racist joke made about Puerto Ricans at a Trump rally failed to galvanize some Latinos to support Harris, instead.",
      "\"So they were open to a conversation with Donald Trump and his leadership,\" Cort\u00e9s said, \"and obviously that conversation gave them more hope with Trump than it did with Harris.\""

      "After feeling like they were on the precipice of history, many South Asian Americans say they\u2019re heartbroken following Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 loss in the 2024 presidential race, but are looking back on her ascent in politics with pride for their community.",
      "Harris would have been the first Black woman and South Asian person to hold the nation\u2019s highest office, and with her defeat by President-elect Donald Trump called Wednesday morning, they\u2019re reflecting on the spotlight her unprecedented candidacy put on their community.",
      "\u201cI was speechless,\u201d said Anjali Bhatt, 27, who saw the results online when she woke up Wednesday morning. \u201cThe fact that there could have been a South Asian woman in the White House \u2026 we\u2019re not there yet, but it would have been very nice. For the South Asian community, there\u2019s that added level of grieving.\u201d",
      "Bhatt, a Washington, D.C., resident, said Trump is the only Republican presidential candidate she\u2019s ever seen on the ballot. She said she thought Harris might have offered a reprieve \u2014 and a sign that America is moving forward.",
      "In Mississippi, Sumati Thomas, 42, said she was hit with similar feelings when she saw the results Wednesday morning. As a Black and Indian woman, she felt particularly connected to Harris\u2019 multiracial identity. Despite the loss, she said Harris\u2019 Democratic nomination earlier this year and ascent to the vice presidency in 2020 put her community on the map.",
      "\u201cEveryone that I\u2019ve talked to is just kind of solemn today,\u201d she said on Wednesday. \u201cBut I really hope that, in the history books, this loss doesn\u2019t diminish in any way the accomplishments that Kamala Harris has had. Just seeing her and having someone that looks like me, being able to look up to that is great.\u201d",
      "Harris\u2019 campaign and the attention paid to her race shone a spotlight on a community of South Asian Americans that makes up less than 2% of the U.S. population.",
      "She reinvigorated a bloc whose excitement was fading under President Joe Biden before he dropped out of the race. Sixty-eight percent of Indian Americans lean Democratic, and in the days after Harris replaced Biden on the ticket, a massive mobilization effort began.",
      "Groups like South Asians for Harris and movements like \u201cLotus for POTUS\u201d quickly sprang up; many were spearheaded by women who felt an immediate kinship.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of disappointment in that sense,\u201d said Shakeel Syed, executive director of the nonprofit South Asian Network. \u201cFor Kamala Harris, I think there was a sense of belonging and identity, and that definitely is lost. We don\u2019t have anyone [South Asian] on the horizon who could rise to that level. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u201d",
      "Harris\u2019 South Asian touchstones",
      "Though Harris didn\u2019t often touch on her race or gender during her presidential campaign, she did regularly mention her mother, the late scientist and Indian immigrant Shyamala Gopalan.",
      "\u201cMy mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream,\u201d Harris said in her speech at the Democratic National Convention.",
      "Gopalan was born and raised in Chennai, a South Indian city, before she moved to the U.S. to attend the University of California, Berkeley. There, she became involved in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s before she eventually became a leading breast cancer researcher.",
      "She steeped her daughters in all things South Asian, said Harris, who grew up eating South Indian food, like potato curry and masala dosa, and hearing Gopalan speak Tamil.",
      "Harris saw her mother confront racism in the U.S. as a new immigrant.",
      "\u201cMy mother was a brilliant 5-foot-tall brown woman with an accent,\u201d Harris said in her convention speech. \u201cAs the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her. But my mother never lost her cool.\u201d",
      "In her 2019 memoir, \u201cThe Truths We Hold,\u201d Harris recounts her experiences visiting India and the influence her mom\u2019s father, P.V. Gopalan, had on her early political consciousness. He was involved in the Indian independence movement, she wrote, and often spoke to her about the importance of fighting for civil rights.",
      "Her maternal grandmother, who never finished high school, she wrote, was a community organizer, taking in abused women and helping them rehabilitate their families.",
      "Thomas said Harris\u2019 candidacy and persona awakened people in her circles and got them excited to go to the polls.",
      "\u201cThe vibes were not as joyous earlier in the year, and the fact that she was able to re-energize the Democrats in the way that she did is also such a great accomplishment,\u201d she said.",
      "Where voters feel she fell short",
      "While Thomas feels Harris ran a near-perfect campaign, Bhatt said there are areas where the Democratic agenda missed the mark. Like many young and progressive Asian Americans, she said Israel\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip has been an important issue for her.",
      "\u201cI was really disappointed in how they handled that,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have loved if she had met with the uncommitted movement, with Palestinian leaders in Southeast Michigan, if they\u2019d had a Palestinian speaker at the DNC.\u201d",
      "South Asian Muslims in the U.S. make up the largest percentage of all Muslim Americans, a group that has long expressed solidarity with Palestinians and disappointment with Biden\u2019s handling of the war.",
      "Harris didn\u2019t take the opportunity to distance herself from Biden enough on that issue or introduce different ideas, Syed said.",
      "\u201cThese were great openings that she had to distance herself by establishing her own identity as a leader and take positions, either fully or partly in disagreement with the Biden administration,\u201d he said. \u201cShe pissed off young educated, non-Muslim South Asians from India and certainly pretty much all of Pakistan and Bangladesh.\u201d",
      "Syed said a stronger focus on the economy would have also drawn in more Indian American voters, who are on average the highest earners in the U.S., with a median household income of $145,000.",
      "\u201cLook at Trump\u2019s agenda: He ran on inflation and immigration primarily,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think she did not address those things.\u201d",
      "The next four years",
      "As Harris wanes from the community\u2019s focus, Syed said South Asians are bracing for the next four years. Many are worried about what life might look like back under Trump, he said.",
      "\u201cWorking-class folks, they\u2019re largely scared and afraid because of the historical experience of 2016 to 2020 under Trump\u2019s administration,\u201d he said.",
      "But South Asian American influence in politics is far from over, he said, and with Trump headed back to the White House, questions remain about the role future second lady Usha Vance and former GOP candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will play in the administration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to raise the profile of the Indian American community,\u201d Syed said.",
      "In the meantime, South Asian voters say they have no choice but to keep pushing. They have been through this before when Trump was elected in 2016, they said, and they\u2019re not entirely losing hope about the work that can be done at the local and state level.",
      "\u201cThe only thing you can do is hug your kids and try to assure them that things will be OK,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe have lost the presidency, but there\u2019s still city, state, county elections coming up, and we can\u2019t lose focus.\u201d"

      "Lance Wallnau, a celebrity evangelist who has spent decades calling on conservative Christians to occupy positions of power and influence over society, told followers on an election night livestream that Trump\u2019s victory had been prophesied years ago \u2014 a key step in God\u2019s plan to usher in a new era of Christian dominion around the world.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a different dialogue about spirituality happening in America,\u201d said Wallnau, who had worked to mobilize Trump voters in swing states. \u201cAnd with Donald Trump,\u201d he continued, God has \u201cgiven permission to take it right to the White House.\u201dWhite evangelical support for Trump has not wavered since he pledged in early 2016 while running for the GOP presidential nomination that if he were elected, \u201cChristianity will have power.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m there, you\u2019re going to have plenty of power, you don\u2019t need anybody else,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have somebody representing you very, very well. Remember that.\u201d",
      "Trump renewed that vow in the 2024 campaign, telling Christians they would be granted \u201cpower at a level that you\u2019ve never used before.\u201d He promised to crack down on acceptance of transgender people in schools and in society. And his campaign said it would create a task force focused on \u201cinvestigating all forms of illegal discrimination, harassment, and persecution against Christians in America.\u201d",
      "While Trump, married three times and found liable for sexual abuse, might not seem an obvious fit to lead a religious movement, Wallnau and other evangelicals championed him as a flawed leader who had been anointed by God to save America from the demonic influence of Democrats. That belief took on new fervor in July after Trump survived the first of two assassination attempts.",
      "Trump embraced that narrative in his victory speech in Florida early Wednesday.\u201cMany people have told me that God spared my life for a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "About 80% of white evangelicals backed Trump in Tuesday\u2019s election, the NBC News Exit Poll shows. He also won an estimated 67% of Latino evangelicals, according to the poll, and 14% of Black evangelicals.",
      "The chain of events that propelled Trump back to the White House represented a \u201cdream scenario\u201d for Christians leaders who have sought to portray him as God\u2019s chosen vessel, said Matthew Taylor, a senior scholar at the nonprofit Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies in Maryland.Taylor, who has extensively researched the role Christian Trump loyalists played in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, said he believed the view of Trump as ordained by God could give him license to take extreme actions in office.",
      "As a candidate, Trump repeatedly spoke of seeking retribution against political opponents, including threats to jail officials who criticized him or worked to stop his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Some Christian leaders have echoed those calls. Other evangelicals hope Trump will support a national abortion ban and roll back the rights of LGBTQ people.",
      "\u201cHe has the capacity now to claim not only a democratic mandate, but a divine mandate,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAnd there are legions of American Christians who are primed to embrace that narrative and to provide theological, moral and spiritual cover to whatever Trump decides to do.\u201d",
      "Dutch Sheets, a self-described apostle who led a series of prayer rallies in the months after Trump\u2019s 2020 election defeat in a bid to keep him in office, celebrated Wednesday in a video posted online.",
      "Sheets told his followers that Trump\u2019s victory would help usher in what he called a \u201cThird Great Awakening\u201d \u2014 what he and other believers say will be a global revival of fervent Christian faith around the world.\u201cThe reformation will take some time, but we will get there,\u201d Sheets said. \u201cAnd Trump is a necessary part of this reformation.\u201d",
      "Sheets and Wallnau did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "During his first term in office, Trump and his staff welcomed Christian leaders, including Sheets, to the White House. He further earned their loyalty when the three justices he appointed to the Supreme Court helped overturn the abortion rights enshrined in Roe v. Wade.",
      "Trump, Taylor said, may now be empowered to go further.",
      "\u201cI think you\u2019re going to be seeing much more explicit advocacy of Christian nationalism and Christian supremacy from the White House,\u201d Taylor said, noting Trump\u2019s close connection to Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana, who has embraced the claim that America was founded as an explicitly Christian nation.",
      "Johnson and others who shared that worldview were on hand for Trump\u2019s victory speech at a convention center in West Palm Beach, Florida.Christian singer Sean Feucht has traveled the country for years, holding pro-Trump worship rallies at state capitols and praying for Christians to win power and adopt laws based on their values. Feucht posted photos of himself in a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat at Trump\u2019s campaign party. Around 3 a.m., he recorded as those gathered to celebrate Trump\u2019s victory began to sing a classic Christian hymn.",
      "Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee",
      "How great Thou art, how great Thou art.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 18:41:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Whether the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students can be punished with the death penalty if convicted will be the focus of a planned hearing Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "The defense team for the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students said Thursday that his trial should not permit the death penalty as punishment, arguing that the state has \"no real means\" of executing an inmate and the methods are unconstitutional.",
      "The death penalty hearing in Boise, Idaho, on whether suspect Bryan Kohberger can be executed if he is convicted comes less than a week before the campus community will mark two years since the quadruple homicide in the college town of Moscow.",
      "\"I don't believe our constitution allows for us to move forward and make him sit in death row for years and years and years if the way Idaho is doing it right now isn't really working,\" Ann Taylor, Kohberger's public defender, said. \"It's not a realistic option.\"",
      "\"So you're saying the anxiety of not knowing is a constitutional violation?\" Ada County District Court Judge Steven Hippler asked.",
      "Taylor continued: \"It is anxiety. It is fear. it is the not knowing.\"",
      "But Latah County prosecutors responded that Idaho's current method of execution, lethal injection, is now available, and while the method could change down the line, \"we don't have the time and effort debating what we don't know in the future.\"",
      "\"You don't get to short-circuit the whole thing that death is off the table,\" prosecutors said, adding \"that's not to say decades from now there's not going to be a method to put him to death.\"",
      "Idaho currently allows death by lethal injection for condemned inmates, as well as firing squad, which Republican Gov. Brad Little signed into law last year as an alternative method.",
      "But while the death penalty in Idaho remains on the books, it hasn't been used since 2012 because the state, like many others, has had trouble procuring lethal injection drugs.",
      "That changed in February, when the state located the necessary drugs and planned to execute Thomas Creech, who was convicted of five murders in three states, after he has been imprisoned for nearly half a century. But the state abandoned the execution after prison staff failed to establish an IV line, exposing the difficulties with administering the death penalty.",
      "Another execution attempt of Creech, 74, had been scheduled for Nov. 13 \u2014 coincidentally the same day as when the four University of Idaho students were fatally stabbed in 2022 in an off-campus apartment house. His execution was temporarily halted by a federal judge this week as he appeals.",
      "At Thursday's hearing, Taylor said whether there would still be available drugs is unclear, and keeping Kohberger on death row would be \"dehumanizing.\"",
      "\"Looking forward, we just don't have those answers yet,\" Taylor said. \"We don't know how that will unfold.\"",
      "Hippler denied the defense's request to hear from expert testimony regarding the constitutionality of the death penalty.",
      "Meanwhile, the judge also heard arguments about whether Kohberger may pose a future danger to others.",
      "Prosecutors have said in court filings that four aggravating factors exist in the case against Kohberger, who turns 30 later this month, making the crime more severe and the death penalty warranted. They are that there are multiple victims; the murders were \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\"; the suspect exhibited \"utter disregard for human life\"; and he has \"a propensity to commit murder which will probably constitute a continuing threat to society,\" according to the filing.",
      "Taylor on Thursday asked the judge to strike the state's death penalty request on the claims of aggravating factors.",
      "The defense also suggested allowing for a special phase if Kohberger is found guilty that would require the jury to determine if he is then eligible for capital punishment, an extra step that prosecutors want denied.",
      "It was not immediately clear if Hippler would decide on the death penalty motion Thursday, but he did say he was allowing Kohberger to appear in \"civilian\" attire at his trial. Kohberger sat at the defense table Thursday in a suit.",
      "He was arrested in December 2022, more than a month after the four students \u2014 housemates Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, and Xana Kernodle, 20, and Kernodle's boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, 20 \u2014 were killed. Kohberger was a resident of nearby Pullman, Washington, and then a doctoral student at Washington State University.",
      "A\u00a0not guilty plea\u00a0on four counts of first-degree murder and burglary was entered on his behalf in May 2023. Authorities have not publicly confirmed a motive, and a\u00a0gag order\u00a0has prevented many involved from speaking.",
      "The prosecution says it expects at trial to present\u00a0DNA evidence, details about cellphone use and security videos to connect Kohberger to the crime.",
      "Kohberger's defense has suggested that he often went on late-night drives and that\u00a0cellphone tower data would show\u00a0that he had been doing so miles away when the four students were killed.",
      "Next summer's trial was moved to Idaho's capital of Boise from Latah County after the defense successfully argued there would be a strong possibility for bias among potential jurors and the local community does not have the resources for such highly anticipated proceedings."

      "China has also complained that the U.S. is trying to contain its development with export controls and other restrictions on strategically sensitive sectors such as semiconductors. One person it may turn to for help is tech billionaire Elon Musk, a devoted Trump supporter with extensive business interests in China who is wildly popular there.",

      "Weeks after sticky black balls washed up on the famed beaches of Sydney, Australia, scientists say they have partly solved the mystery behind the \u201cdisgusting\u201d blobs.",
      "Initially thought to be tar balls, the golf-ball-size debris turned out to be something much different \u2014 a combination of decomposed cooking oils, hair and food waste, the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) said Wednesday.",
      "The investigation, carried out by the Australian government and scientists from the University of New South Wales, revealed that the black balls \u201clikely originated from a source that releases mixed waste,\u201d the EPA said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAuthorities have considered several possible causes, such as a shipping spill or wastewater outflow,\u201d it said.",
      "The exact origin is yet to be confirmed due to the \u201ccomplex composition of the balls and the time they have spent in the water,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBut final results are due in the coming weeks.\u201d",
      "Thousands of the dark balls were discovered starting in mid-October on multiple Sydney beaches, including the famous Bondi Beach, leading to beach closures across the city\u2019s shores.",
      "At the time, authorities advised the public not to swim near or touch the debris. They said preliminary test results indicated that the blobs were tar balls formed when oil comes into contact with debris and water.",
      "However, further investigation has disproven that theory.",
      "\u201cWhat we found is much more \u2014 this is not going to sound very scientific \u2014 but much more disgusting than we previously thought,\u201d said William Alexander Donald, a chemistry professor at the\u00a0University of New South Wales Sydney, who is part of the research team.",
      "While initial testing suggested that the blobs had formed from crude oil or natural oil seeps from the ocean floor, further analysis revealed plenty of \u201cfatty, oily, greasy\u201d molecules typical of spent cooking oil and soap scum, as well as traces of recreational drugs and birth control medication, Donald told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re doing the testing, these balls smell worse than anything you\u2019ve ever \u2014 at least for me, worse than anything I\u2019ve ever smelled before,\u201d Donald said, with all the signs pointing toward human waste that could \u201cclog up the sewage pipes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a hugely complex analytical challenge where we\u2019ve detected hundreds of different molecules and components in these blobs,\u201d he said.",
      "It would be interesting to follow up on how often this kind of debris occurs and whether scientists can trace it back to the exact source, Donald said, noting that his team has received a few unconfirmed reports of similar debris washing up in the past in similar areas and even in the southeastern\u00a0state of Victoria.",
      "Sydney Water confirmed there were no issues at the Bondi or Malabar water facilities, while Transport for NSW Maritime reviewed recent weather patterns but found no clear answers, according to the statement."

    "story": [
      "Chris Martin is the latest musician to take a spill on stage during a concert.",
      "The British singer and his band, Coldplay, are performing around the world for their \u201cMusic of the Spheres World Tour.\" The group recently traveled to Australia for a series of shows in Melbourne, Australia, at the Marvel Stadium, where Martin experienced a slightly scary moment on stage.",
      "On Nov. 3, one fan captured the moment Martin fell backwards through the opening of a trapdoor. In a clip shared on X, Martin is shown chatting with the crowd when he loses his balance and stumbles.",
      "\u201cWhoa!\u201d the audience collectively gasps as the Coldplay frontman goes down and briefly looks around to figure out what happened.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not planned,\u201d Martin says as he steps out of the trapdoor opening and thanks a crew member for catching him.",
      "\u201cThank you guys. Holy s---! That was nearly a YouTube moment,\u201d he added and continued with the show.",
      "Martin and his band performed in Melbourne for four shows and will continue their tour with four more performances in Sydney, Australia. Their final performances this year will be in Auckland, New Zealand, before they return to the road for more concerts around the world next year.",
      "Martin\u2019s fall comes about a month after Olivia Rodrigo took a tumble on stage at a show in Melbourne. Last month, multiple fans uploaded videos of Rodrigo pointing to the crowd and running across the stage before she fell through a hole in the stage. There was an audible thud.",
      "She immediately popped up and said, \u201cOh my God! That was fun.\u201d She assured fans she was fine and joked, \u201cWhoa! Sometimes there\u2019s just a hole in the stage.\u201d",
      "Rodrigo, who is not afraid to poke fun at herself, later shared a clip of her fall on TikTok.",
      "In the caption, she included the hashtag \u201csubtleforeshadowing.\u201d"

      "\"There is so much on the line this election. I believe the government has no right over my body as a woman, and that the decisions over my body should come ONLY from myself and my doctor,\" wrote Moretz.",
      "\"I believe in the need for legal protections that protects the LGBTQ+ community as a gay woman. We need protections in this country and to have access to the care we need and deserve,\" she added.",

      "TODAY.com reached out to Moretz for comment, but did not hear back at the time of publication.",
      "Moretz, who previously dated\u00a0Brooklyn Beckham, has been romantically linked to model Kate Harrison for more than five years. The two women often share photos of themselves together on Instagram, including in June 2023, when Harrison posted a selfie photo of them posing together at a March for gay women in New York City.",
      "Moretz\u00a0portrayed a gay teenager sent against her will to a conversion therapy camp in the 2018\u00a0coming-of-age\u00a0drama \"The Miseducation of Cameron Post.\"",
      "While promoting the movie, which is set in 1993, Moretz told Deadline that she had been an \"activist\" for the LGBT community since she was \"a little girl\" and had two brothers who were gay.",
      "Also during the film's promotion, Moretz became irritated when a reporter for\u00a0The Independent told her she was name-checked in an article about straight actors portraying gay characters.",
      "\u201cOh really?\u201d asked Moretz before laughing nervously. \u201cWell I think what\u2019s important is don\u2019t assume anyone\u2019s sexuality. I mean, across the board ... don\u2019t assume.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it comes down to the line that\u2019s in the movie,\u201d she continued. \u201c(Moretz's character) says, \u2018I don\u2019t see myself as a homosexual, I don\u2019t see myself as anything.\u2019 These are all societal pressures that we\u2019re being labelled as.",
      "\"We\u2019re all human, trying to be with the people that we fall in love with, and be the best person that we can be. But don\u2019t assume people\u2019s sexualities. And don\u2019t project your own issues onto them. Why don\u2019t we let people be who they wanna be?\u201d"

      "Taylor Swift has kept up the memorable tradition of giving one lucky fan part of her costume during each \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert. On Nov. 2 \u2014 the second to last U.S. show of the tour \u2014 the encounter was a moment seven years in the making.",
      "During the part of the show dedicated to her fourth album \u201cRed,\u201d Swift walks down the catwalk while singing \u201c22\u201d and meets one attendee standing at the edge of the stage. Swift crouches down each night and takes off her black fedora to give to the fan.",
      "Recipients of the famed \u201c22\u201d hat include Bianka Bryant, daughter of Vanessa and the late Kobe Bryant; Mikael Arellano, a TikTok creator who went viral for his \u201cBejeweled\u201d choreography; and Gracie Elliott Teefey, Selena Gomez\u2019s little sister.",
      "Now, there's 7-year-old Eloise.",
      "Eloise received the hat during Swift\u2019s second Indianapolis show Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium. The 7-year-old, wearing a pink, green, purple and blue sparkly jacket, shared a big hug with Swift. The singer then appeared to say to Eloise, \u201cLast time I saw you, you were a baby,\u201d while miming rocking an infant.",
      "The story goes like this: Seven years ago, Eloise's mom, Cindy Childs, started a livestream on Instagram that Swift watched and commented on. Childs, a longtime Swiftie, got to chat with the singer and show her baby Eloise, then just a few months old.",
      "According to screenshots posted by fans, Swift left a ton of comments on the livestream, including an all-caps \u201cELOISE\u201d and \u201cshe\u2019s a tiny baby and I will totally meet her and A when they\u2019re not 3 months old and jus tryna GET SOME REST.\u201d",
      "Saturday\u2019s concert marked Eloise\u2019s first time seeing Swift perform after being \u201cborn and raised a Swiftie.\u201d",
      "Taylor Nation, an official X account associated with Swift, posted about the moment Saturday.",
      "\u201cWhat a full-circle moment it is for Taylor to finally meet Eloise, @talldrinkhappy!\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s been a long 7 year wait!\u00a0\u00a0We are so happy for her! #IndyTSTheErasTour #TSTheErasTour,\u201d the account wrote.",
      "But it wasn't just Swift, Eloise and her mom who got a kick out of the sweet moment. Longtime Swifties were also emotional about the moment.",
      "\"I'M GONNA CRY!\" a fan wrote on X.",
      "\"In the clerb, we all cried over Eloise,\" another wrote.",
      "And one fan used a clip from \"Succession,\" in which Tom shouts, \"Excuse me, executives coming through,\" to show that only true Swift fans understand the meaning of the moment.",
      "\"Swifties veterans tonight as we sob over Eloise and see people pretending to know the significance,\" the post read."

    "summary": "Haunted by their past critiques regarding President-elect Donald Trump, U.S. allies are rushing to make diplomatic U-turns by deleting posts and brushing over their prior scathing remarks.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's presidential victory means some U.S. allies may have to reckon with prior scathing remarks as their countries prepare to build diplomatic ties with a president-elect whose return they may not have anticipated.",
      "\u201cThe most destructive president in history,\u201d Australian Ambassador to the U.S. Kevin Rudd said of Trump in 2020, who \u201cdrags America and democracy through the mud.\u201d",
      "\u201cA woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathizing sociopath\u201d and a \u201cprofound threat to the international order,\u201d David Lammy, the  U.K.'s current foreign secretary, said in 2018.",
      "\u201cA political pyromaniac who must be put before a criminal court,\u201d Jean Asselborn,\u00a0then-foreign minister for Luxembourg, said of Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",
      "\"Trump has ruined it all,\" Croatian President\u00a0Zoran Milanovi\u0107 said, also in 2021. \"He incite[s] hate, he is a rabble-rouser and that\u2019s it.\"",
      "Following Trump\u2019s election victory, at least two of these U.S. allies, the U.K. and Australia, have had to dial back some of their previous attacks.",
      "Rudd deleted his posts after Trump's win, \u201cout of respect for the office of President of the United States,\u201d an Australian government statement said, and to \u201celiminate the possibility of such comments being misconstrued as reflecting his positions as Ambassador and, by extension, the views of the Australian Government.\u201d",
      "For Trump\u2019s part, he responded to Rudd\u2019s comments by calling him \u201cnasty\u201d and saying Rudd \u201cwon\u2019t be there long\u201d as Australian ambassador to the United States.",
      "Lammy pivoted from scathing critic to polite well-wisher, showing that diplomacy sometimes means shaking hands with those you once pointed fingers at.",
      "Lammy, who made his comments about Trump being \u201ca woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathizing sociopath\u201d in Time magazine in 2018 when he was a backbench minister of Parliament, had also protested against the then-government\u2019s \u201ccapitulation to this tyrant in a toupee.\u201d",
      "By Wednesday, as Trump claimed his decisive electoral victory, Lammy's tone as foreign secretary had shifted considerably, as he sent his congratulations and underlined the U.K.'s cherished special friendship with the U.S.",
      "Relations between Britain\u2019s ruling center-left Labour Party and Trump have been antagonistic in the lead-up to the election, with Trump accusing the British of election interference.",
      "In October, Trump\u2019s team\u00a0asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate\u00a0after a senior Labour figure posted a rallying cry for current and former staffers to travel to battleground states and\u00a0campaign for Harris.",
      "In the first phone call between the pair after the U.S. election, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer offered his \u201chearty congratulations\u201d to Trump after his \u201chistoric victory,\u201d a spokeswoman for the prime minister's office said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Charles Parton, who served as a British diplomat for almost four decades, said that \u201cthe Labour Party has got some grounds to make up\u201d after a perception that Starmer's party had favored the Democrats.",
      "On top of Lammy\u2019s remarks, Parton believes that Starmer's \u201csomewhat effusive statement\u201d is an attempt to \u201ctry and make up lost ground.\u201d",
      "Nigel Farage, the leader of the far-right Reform UK party, offered to help bridge Labour's awkward relations with Trump, whom he considers a personal friend with whom he is ideologically aligned, an offer the Labour Party declined."

      "Rafael had strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane before it made landfall in the Cuban province of Artemisa, and weakened to a Category 2 shortly after making landfall Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The storm is now about 195 miles west of Key West, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph, moving northwest at 9 mph, the National Hurricane Center said at 7 a.m. ET.",
      "Rafael will continue to move away from western Cuba on Thursday and will weaken over the central Gulf of Mexico.",
      "\u201cOn the forecast track, Rafael is expected to move over the southern Gulf of Mexico for the next few days,\u201d the National Hurricane Center said.",
      "Due to its track and rapid weakening, little to no impacts are expected for the Gulf Coast except for some rip current risk and minor coastal flooding.",
      "There are no longer any coastal watches or warnings in effect, and a previous tropical storm warning for the lower and middle Florida Keys has been lifted.",
      "Two to 4 inches of additional rainfall is expected Thursday, which would bring storm total accumulations to 12 inches across western Cuba and lead to \u201careas of flash flooding and mudslides, especially along the higher terrain.\u201d",
      "Locals in Cuba rode out the hurricane in the dark after Cuba\u2019s state-run grid operator UNE said the high winds had caused the country\u2019s electrical system to collapse \u2014 at least the\u00a0second such incident\u00a0on the island in less than a month, Reuters reported.",

Many people do not have that option and have to cook with fuel. We are without electricity. I hope all the power will be restored when the storm is over,\u201d Havana resident Mabel Suarez told Reuters.",
      "The fierce winds and pelting rain caused downed trees and power lines. Schools were closed, public transport was suspended on parts of the island and authorities canceled flights in and out of Havana and Varadero due to Rafael, The Associated Press reported."

      "The strike late Monday hit a home where several displaced families were sheltering in the town of Beit Lahiya, near the border with Israel, according to Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of\u00a0the recently raided and barely functioning\u00a0Kamal Adwan Hospital, which received the casualties.",
      "The dead included eight women and six children, according to a list provided by the Gaza Health Ministry\u2019s emergency service.\u00a0Separate strikes elsewhere in Gaza\u00a0early Tuesday killed another 10 people, according to health officials.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.",
      "Israel launched the offensive in the north after saying Hamas militants had regrouped there. The army has returned to several areas of Gaza multiple times after previous operations, as Hamas continues to carry out hit-and-run attacks on troops and fire occasional rockets into Israel.",
      "The military has ordered the complete evacuation of Beit Lahiya, the nearby town of Beit Hanoun and the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, and has allowed almost no humanitarian aid into the area for over a month. That has\u00a0drawn rebukes from the Biden administration, which has warned that U.S. laws might force it to curb military aid to Israel if more aid is not allowed in.",
      "Tens of thousands of people have fled to nearby Gaza City in\u00a0the latest wave of displacement\u00a0within the besieged territory. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million have fled during the war, often multiple times.",

      "The offensive has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel is implementing\u00a0a surrender-or-starve plan\u00a0for northern Gaza proposed by former generals, in which civilians would be ordered out, aid would be cut off and anyone remaining would be considered a fighter.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 14:17:30 GMT",
    "summary": "An Israeli court on Sunday partially lifted a gag order on a case investigating leaks of classified Gaza documents suspected to involve one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
    "story": [
      "Arrests. Classified documents. And suspected leaks that may have harmed efforts to free hostages held by Hamas in order, critics say, to give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu public cover for failing to agree to a cease-fire deal. Netanyahu was engulfed in scandal Monday over a case involving one of his aides that has sent shock waves across the country.",
      "The firestorm \u2014 brought into public view when an Israeli court loosened a gag order Sunday night \u2014 has enraged Netanyahu's political opponents and hostages\u2019 families. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and distanced himself from the case, but critics have alleged that he put hostages' lives and national security at risk to buttress his hard-line position in stalled cease-fire talks by leaking Gaza documents to friendly media outlets.",
      "In a ruling Sunday, the Rishon Le-Zion Magistrates\u2019 Court\u00a0said an investigation had been launched after suspicions arose within the Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency, or the Shin Bet, that \"classified and sensitive intelligence\" had been illegally taken from IDF systems.",
      "The action, the court said, may not only have caused \u201cserious harm to state security and the endangerment of intelligence sources,\" but it also could have harmed \"the goal of releasing the hostages\" who were taken captive during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.",
      "The court identified the central suspect in the case as Eliezer Feldstein, reported by Israeli media to have been one of Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
      "In addition to Feldstein, three other people the court described as \"detainees involved in the activities\" were questioned. The court has yet to publicly identify them.",
      "Israeli media have reported that the information suspected of being leaked formed the basis of multiple articles on Hamas' approach to the hostage situation, including an article published by the London-based Jewish Chronicle that was later withdrawn after widespread criticism. NBC News was not immediately able to independently confirm that reporting.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle article had suggested that Hamas planned to move hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, while a separate article published by the German newspaper Bild reported that Hamas was drawing out negotiations for a cease-fire deal as a form of psychological warfare on Israel.",
      "Both articles drew skepticism from Israeli observers given their timing and the apparent cover they gave Netanyahu as he was accused of deliberately sabotaging cease-fire negotiations.",
      "\u201cThere was something very fishy about them. Also about the timing of everything,\u201d Mairav Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle and Bild did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The reports emerged as Netanyahu insisted on Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt, a demand that became a major sticking point in cease-fire talks. They also came as Netanyahu faced mounting outrage from hostages\u2019 families and much of the country's public over his failure to agree to a cease-fire deal after six hostages were killed in Hamas' captivity.",
      "While Israeli media had reported some details of the probe and the gag order had been partially lifted last week, it was not until Sunday that crucial and explosive allegations were revealed.",
      "In a statement before the ruling, Netanyahu's office said the materials suspected of being leaked had never reached the prime minister's office from the Military Intelligence Directorate and that Netanyahu had learned about the document in question from the media.",
      "It added that the aide implicated in the suspected leaks had \"never participated in security discussions, was not exposed or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits.\"",
      "But political opponents, hostages\u2019 families and critics expressed outrage over the potential involvement of one of Netanyahu's aides.",
      "\"It\u2019s left me yet again disappointed but not surprised by this government,\" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui was taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7.",
      "\"I feel utterly betrayed, not just as a hostage father but as an Israeli citizen,\" he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "Dekel-Chen said that if the allegations raised in the investigation are true, it would be the latest in a \"long series\" of moments when Netanyahu's government has \"invented reasons to not move forward in the negotiation process.\"",
      "Gil Dickmann's cousin Carmel Gat was one of six hostages killed in Hamas captivity \u2014 an incident that sparked national outrage not long before the media reports were published.",
      "He noted the timing but said that if the intention was to sway public opinion, \"it didn't work,\" as he pointed to major demonstrations in the following days pressuring Netanyahu to secure a cease-fire.",
      "In a statement, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of those still in Hamas captivity, expressed \u201coutrage and deep concern\u201d at the possibility that at least one Netanyahu aide may have \u201cworked to undermine public support\u201d for a deal.",
      "Benny Gantz, who resigned from Netanyahu's now-dissolved war Cabinet in June, said on X that \"if sensitive security information was stolen and used as a tool in a political survival campaign, it\u2019s not just a criminal offense; it\u2019s a national crime.\"",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid rejected claims from Netanyahu's office that Netanyahu had been previously unaware of the materials alleged to have been leaked.",
      "\"If Netanyahu didn\u2019t know that his close aides were stealing documents, planting spies within the IDF, forging documents, exposing intelligence sources, and passing classified documents to the foreign press to stop the hostage deal\u2014what *does* he know?\" Lapid said on X.",
      "Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said that even if Netanyahu was not directly involved, the suspected leak would have emerged from a \u201cwell-oiled machine that is already accustomed to taking sensitive information and manipulating it for political purposes.\u201d",
      "But she said that would not \"come as a surprise at all.\"",
      "\"I think for the people who are already convinced that Netanyahu was playing with the public's consciousness and wasn't interested in a hostage deal, this is kind of just further proof,\" she said."

      "The legislation has alarmed the United Nations and some of Israel\u2019s Western allies who fear it will further worsen the already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where Israel has been fighting Hamas militants for a year. The ban does not refer to operations in the Palestinian territories or elsewhere.",

      "A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at Japan's tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",

      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",
      "That\u2019s led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",

      "But early Thursday, Transport Minister Volker Wissing from the Free Democrats unexpectedly took back last night\u2019s resignation and told reporters that after talking to Scholz, he had decided to stay on as minister and leave the party instead.",
      "Lindner will receive his certificate of dismissal from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Thursday afternoon and, to ensure a smooth transition, a successor will likely be named right after. German news agency dpa reported that J\u00f6rg Kukies, an economic adviser to Scholz, will become the next finance minister.",
      "The posts of the research and justice ministers who resigned may also be filled Thursday, dpa reported.",
      "Scholz announced late Wednesday that he would seek a vote of confidence on Jan. 15 that he said might lead to an early election as soon as March \u2014 which otherwise would have been be due next September.",
      "Scholz had accused Lindner of breaching his trust and publicly calling for a fundamentally different economic policy, including what the chancellor said would be tax cuts worth billions for a few top earners while at the same time cutting pensions for all retirees.",

      "He said he was planning to meet with Scholz later Thursday to push for a quick vote of confidence.",
      "Since Scholz\u2019s government doesn\u2019t have a majority in parliament any longer, he would likely lose the vote. In that scenario, Germany\u2019s president could dissolve parliament within 21 days and an early election could then be held as soon as January.",
      "\u201cDuring these 21 days, we will have enough time to find out whether there are any issues that we may have to decide on together,\u201d Merz said, offering his party\u2019s cooperation with the minority government. \u201cWe are, of course, prepared to hold talks (..) we are also prepared to take responsibility for our country.\u201d",
      "Indeed, pushing through new legislation and plugging the billion-euro hole in the 2025 budget won\u2019t become easier for Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats and the Greens as their government no longer has a majority in parliament.

      "Weeks after sticky black balls washed up on the famed beaches of Sydney, Australia, scientists say they have partly solved the mystery behind the \u201cdisgusting\u201d blobs.",
      "Initially thought to be tar balls, the golf-ball-size debris turned out to be something much different \u2014 a combination of decomposed cooking oils, hair and food waste, the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) said Wednesday.",
      "The investigation, carried out by the Australian government and scientists from the University of New South Wales, revealed that the black balls \u201clikely originated from a source that releases mixed waste,\u201d the EPA said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAuthorities have considered several possible causes, such as a shipping spill or wastewater outflow,\u201d it said.",
      "The exact origin is yet to be confirmed due to the \u201ccomplex composition of the balls and the time they have spent in the water,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBut final results are due in the coming weeks.\u201d",
      "Thousands of the dark balls were discovered starting in mid-October on multiple Sydney beaches, including the famous Bondi Beach, leading to beach closures across the city\u2019s shores.",
      "At the time, authorities advised the public not to swim near or touch the debris. They said preliminary test results indicated that the blobs were tar balls formed when oil comes into contact with debris and water.",
      "However, further investigation has disproven that theory.",
      "\u201cWhat we found is much more \u2014 this is not going to sound very scientific \u2014 but much more disgusting than we previously thought,\u201d said William Alexander Donald, a chemistry professor at the\u00a0University of New South Wales Sydney, who is part of the research team.",
      "While initial testing suggested that the blobs had formed from crude oil or natural oil seeps from the ocean floor, further analysis revealed plenty of \u201cfatty, oily, greasy\u201d molecules typical of spent cooking oil and soap scum, as well as traces of recreational drugs and birth control medication, Donald told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re doing the testing, these balls smell worse than anything you\u2019ve ever \u2014 at least for me, worse than anything I\u2019ve ever smelled before,\u201d Donald said, with all the signs pointing toward human waste that could \u201cclog up the sewage pipes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a hugely complex analytical challenge where we\u2019ve detected hundreds of different molecules and components in these blobs,\u201d he said.",
      "It would be interesting to follow up on how often this kind of debris occurs and whether scientists can trace it back to the exact source, Donald said, noting that his team has received a few unconfirmed reports of similar debris washing up in the past in similar areas and even in the southeastern\u00a0state of Victoria.",
      "Sydney Water confirmed there were no issues at the Bondi or Malabar water facilities, while Transport for NSW Maritime reviewed recent weather patterns but found no clear answers, according to the statement."

    "story": [
      "SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The Australian government will legislate for a ban on social media for children under 16, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Thursday, in what it calls a world-leading package of measures that could become law late next year.",
      "Australia is trialing an age-verification system to assist in blocking children from accessing social media platforms, as part of a range of measures that include some of the toughest controls imposed by any country to date.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing harm to our kids, and I\u2019m calling time on it,\u201d Albanese said at a news conference.",
      "Albanese cited the risks to the physical and mental health of children from excessive social media use, in particular the risks to girls from harmful depictions of body image and misogynist content aimed at boys.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a 14-year-old kid getting this stuff, at a time where you\u2019re going through life\u2019s changes and maturing, it can be a really difficult time, and what we\u2019re doing is listening and then acting,\u201d he said.",
      "A number of countries have already vowed to curb social media use by children through legislation, though Australia\u2019s policy is one of the most stringent.",
      "No jurisdiction so far has tried using age-verification methods such as biometrics or government identification to enforce a social media age cut-off, two of the methods being trialed.",
      "Australia\u2019s other world-first proposals are the highest age limit set by any country, no exemption for parental consent and no exemption for pre-existing accounts.",
      "Legislation will be introduced in the Australian Parliament this year, with the laws coming into effect 12 months after being ratified by lawmakers, Albanese said.",
      "The opposition Liberal Party has expressed support for a ban.",
      "\u201cThe onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThe onus won\u2019t be on parents or young people.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we are announcing here and what we will legislate will be truly world leading,\u201d Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said.",
      "Rowland said platforms impacted would include Meta Platforms\u2019 Instagram and Facebook, as well as ByteDance\u2019s TikTok and Elon Musk\u2019s X. Alphabet\u2019s\u00a0YouTube would also most likely fall within the scope of the legislation, she added.",
      "TikTok declined to comment, while Meta, Alphabet and X did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Digital Industry Group, a representative body that includes Meta, TikTok, X and Alphabet\u2019s Google as members, said the measure could encourage young people to explore darker, unregulated parts of the internet while cutting their access to support networks.",
      "\u201cKeeping young people safe online is a top priority ... but the proposed ban for teenagers to access digital platforms is a 20th-century response to 21st-century challenges,\u201d said DIGI Managing Director Sunita Bose.",
      "\u201cRather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,\u201d she added.",
      "Last year, France proposed a ban on social media for those under 15, though users were able to avoid the ban with parental consent.",
      "For decades, the United States has required technology companies to seek parental consent to access the data of children under 13, leading to most social media platforms banning those under that age from accessing their services."
