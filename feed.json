      "British rock band The Who are to say their final goodbye to North America this summer",
      "LONDON -- British rock band The Who are to say their final goodbye to North America this summer.",
      "Singer Roger Daltrey and guitarist Pete Townshend confirmed Thursday that they will perform hits from six-decade career during \"The Song Is Over North America Farewell Tour,\" named after the band\u2019s 1971 hit.",
      "The band, which by the 1970s had become one of the world\u2019s biggest touring bands, easily filling the largest U.S. stadiums, will play their first gig in Florida on Aug. 16, with further dates in cities including New York, Toronto, Los Angeles and Vancouver, before a final date in Las Vegas on Sept. 28.",
      "\u201cEvery musician\u2019s dream in the early '60s was to make it big in the U.S. charts,\" Daltrey said. \u201cFor The Who, that dream came true in 1967 and our lives were changed forever.\u201d",
      "The band went from performing club shows to headlining the Woodstock festival in the U.S. and becoming one of the biggest box-office draw in the world. The band were inducted into the Rock n\u2019 Roll Hall Of Fame in 1990.",
      "Daltrey, 81, and Townshend, two years his junior, have been one of rock's most prolific double acts, surviving the deaths of drummer Keith Moon in 1978 and bass guitarist John Entwistle in 2002.",
      "\u201cToday, Roger and I still carry the banner for the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle, and, of course, all of our long-time Who fans,\" Townshend said. \u201cI must say that although the road has not always been enjoyable for me, it is usually easy: the best job I could ever have had. I keep coming back.\u201d",
      "Though Daltrey didn\u2019t write songs, he was able to channel Townsend\u2019s many and complicated moods \u2014 defiance and rage, vulnerability and desperation.",
      "Together, they forged some of rock\u2019s most defining sounds: the stuttering, sneering delivery of \u201cMy Generation,\u201d the anguished cry of \u201cThey\u2019re all wasted!\u201d from \u201cBaba O\u2019Reilly,\u201d and the all-time scream from \u201cWon\u2019t Get Fooled Again.\u201d",
      "Pre-sales will run from May 13 ahead of the general sale beginning May 16.",
      "\u201cWell, all good things must come to an end. It is a poignant time,\" Townshend said. \u201cFor me, playing to American audiences and those in Canada has always been incredible.\u201d",

      "Kali Uchis wrote the album that she knew her future self would need to listen to",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kali Uchis wrote the album she knew her future self would need to listen to. The Grammy-winning artist unknowingly was crafting her own audible remedy.",
      "\u201cI really did make the music that I needed for my grieving process, for just the place that I\u2019m at in my life right now,\u201d she says of the album out Friday.",
      "\u201cSincerely,\u201d (yes, the title includes the comma) began as a collection of letters to herself, friends and loved ones but took on a deeper meaning as the Colombian American songwriter gave birth to her first child and processed her mother's recent death. The first single, \u201cSunshine & Rain...,\u201d includes a clip of Uchis' mother saying, \u201cGood morning, sunshine.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanted to immortalize her in the project,\u201d said Uchis. \u201cI thought it was just a beautiful way to open the album.\u201d",
      "The 14-track album finds Uchis proudly wearing her heart on her sleeve with songs like \u201cDaggers!,\u201d where Uchis encourages a close friend to lean into self-love, or \u201cILYSMIH,\u201d which includes baby coos at the beginning and was written as she lay in her hospital bed with her newborn.",
      "Uchis hopes that after listening to her fifth full album, fans will feel more connected to themselves and more in touch with their emotions: \u201cI hope it will give them some type of solace.\"",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "UCHIS: I\u2019m a very deep feeler. I\u2019m very empathetic. I feel a lot. And I wanted to make a body of work that fully showed that vulnerability and that actually really dug deep into my heart in a way that none of my other albums ever had.",
      "I felt like I was ready to do that because I\u2019ve been making music long enough that I felt that it was that time for me, and then it just so happened that, shortly after working on the album, I became pregnant, which was such a big part of being able to feel even deeper than I ever have.",
      "UCHIS: It\u2019s crazy because a lot of times I feel, and especially with this album in particular, I felt that I really made music that my future self would need, that I didn\u2019t realize I was going to need at that time.",
      "The album is actually dedicated to my mom. My mom later ended up getting diagnosed, and she\u2019s no longer here. ... And so pretty much all of the songs ended up taking on a deeper meaning to me because of that and because of it being dedicated to her. ... At the time, I might not have even realized subconsciously that I was making all of this to heal myself.",
      "UCHIS: At one point, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna make sure each of these songs is like, this is my letter to the world, this is my letter to this person, this my letter to that, this one to myself.\u201d I tried to really conceptualize in a different way that I never have when making any other album. And then ... when my mom passed, a lot of what I had left from her is letters that she wrote to me, and so it ended up, like I said, just more and more reasons for me to realize that it was the correct title for the project.",
      "UCHIS: I never stick to one process, but one particular process that stuck out to me on a lot of the songs was that most of them were written with no music, just songs that came to me.",
      "For instance, \u201cILYSMIH\u201d \u2014 that one literally I was just recovering from labor, my son was sleeping next to me; I was still in my hospital bed when I got this idea for this song and started it, started recording it on my phone, started writing some lyrics down. ... There\u2019s one called \u201cAll I Can Say.\u201d I wrote that whole song in the car on the way to the studio. ... I try to just make beauty out of all of my experiences.",
      "UCHIS: Thematically, nature is kind of a reoccurring theme in my music because I am so inspired by nature and I feel nature is where God exists and nature is where a lot of my creativity just thrives.",
      "I feel like it just happened. Afterwards, I even thought, \u201cIs this too similar to what I\u2019ve already done?\u201d But \u2026 I just love the things that I love, and I just returned back to those nostalgic elements. I may branch out and try what people think is different sounds. Like on \u201cOrqu\u00eddeas,\u201d I did a lot of different genre-bending on \u201cSin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios)\" as well, but to me, that\u2019s still nostalgic because it\u2019s still music I grew up listening to.",
      "I return a lot to things that are core memories for me. It\u2019s soothing to my nervous system. I\u2019m the person who watches the same episodes of my favorite TV shows over and over again, ... I think that\u2019s what makes it beautiful too, is to see the evolution and know that it\u2019s still true to me. It's still true to my roots in music and where I started, but an evolved version.",
      "UCHIS: After she passed, one of the first things I did was go through all of the audio messages that she had ever sent me and I was just listening to all her messages over and over, wanting to hear her voice. When I heard that one I just thought of, \u201cOh how perfect is this that the song is called \u2018Sunshine &Rain...,\u2019 and she had said, \u201cGood morning, sunshine.\u201d It was for my son that she sent that message. I thought it was just a beautiful way to open the album, considering that it\u2019s dedicated to her.",
      "I struggled a lot with whether or not I wanted to share because I\u2019m a very, very private person. So I struggled a lot with if I even wanted to share that my mom was no longer here, but I felt I just had to not be afraid of that vulnerability and not pretend like it didn\u2019t affect me or didn\u2019t have some type of impact on me when it had such a big impact on me and still does. And I wanted to also honor her and honor her life in a way through art that I know that she would have loved and that she would have been proud of.",

      "A scrappy opera company that started 11 years ago in New York City is thriving by staying small",
      "NEW YORK -- Dan Schlosberg remembers the day 11 years ago when his upstart opera company put on its first performance \u2014 in a yoga studio before an audience of 30 people.",
      "\u201cWe did Kurt Weill\u2019s \u2018The Seven Deadly Sins\u2019 accompanied by an upright piano that we got for free on Craigslist and a violin,\u201d recalled Schlosberg, the company\u2019s music director and one of its founders.",
      "They named their company Heartbeat Opera, \u201cfrom the idea that singers would be feet away from you,\u201d Schlosberg said. \u201cAnd so you would be experiencing their voices at arm\u2019s length and that would make a resonance in your heart.\u201d",
      "Today, in an era when many opera companies are struggling financially, Heartbeat appears to be thriving, with an annual budget that just passed $1 million.",
      "But true to its initial vision, the company still performs in small venues, most with a seating capacity of about 200.",
      "\u201cVery few small companies take up the ambition to do the fullness of opera on a small scale,\u201d said Jacob Ashworth, another founding member and Heartbeat\u2019s artistic director. \u201cWe don\u2019t do small opera. We do big opera in a small space.\u201d",
      "And despite its success with critics and audiences \u2014 performances regularly sell out \u2014 the company has deliberately maintained a modest schedule.",
      "There\u2019s typically an opera-themed drag show around Halloween and then two operas staged in New York City performance spaces in the winter and spring. Each work is condensed to 90-100 intermission-less minutes with new orchestrations that require just a few musicians.",
      "Marc Scorca, president and CEO of Opera America, thinks Heartbeat is smart not to expand too quickly \u2014 a mistake that has caused some small companies to collapse.",
      "\u201cGrowth itself shouldn\u2019t be a goal. Excellence should be a goal,\u201d he said. \u201cI always prefer companies to plan their trajectory as slow as possible so they don\u2019t overstretch and overstep.\u201d",
      "Unlike some small companies, Heartbeat doesn\u2019t focus on new work or on bringing to light neglected old rarities. Instead, its website promises \u201cincisive adaptations and revelatory arrangements of classics, reimagining them for the here and now.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s that reimagining that attracted Sara Holdren, a director, writer and teacher who first worked with the company on Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d in 2017.",
      "\u201cTheir approaches to the storytelling feel extremely of our world and about our world,\u201d she said, \u201cwithout falling across that line into a sort of trite topicality where you say, \u2018Oh yes, I understand a relevant-with-a-capital-R political point is being made here\u2019.\u201d",
      "For Beethoven\u2019s \u201cFidelio,\u201d Heartbeat went to prisons and recorded the voices of incarcerated people, who appeared on video singing the Prisoners Chorus. For Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cEugene Onegin,\u201d the two main male characters became lovers, reflecting the composer\u2019s own sexuality.",
      "And for Richard Strauss\u2019 \u201cSalome\u201d this season, the teenage title character was dressed in a frilly pink skirt and sneakers; John the Baptist was imprisoned on stage in a cage with transparent sides instead of in an underground cistern; and during the Dance of the Seven Veils, it was a lascivious Herod who stripped off his clothes, not Salome.",
      "Heartbeat\u2019s casting for \u201cSalome\u201d reflected the premium it places on theatrical values in addition to vocal ability.",
      "Baritone Nathaniel Sullivan, who portrayed John the Baptist, recalled that \u201ca big part of the audition was just straight acting. And in the rehearsals, there was a real focus on the storytelling.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t experienced that in a lot of other opera companies to that extent,\u201d he said.",
      "Soprano Summer Hassan, who was cast as Salome, admits she was nervous at first \u201cbecause I had never done a role like this where I am the title character.",
      "\u201cI was really doubting myself, thinking how do I make this girl look so young?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they said, your physicality will do that on your own. Make her look confident and you will make her look like a confident child. They gave me the tools to figure out it was within me.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most striking aspect of this \u201cSalome\u201d was the re-orchestration by Schlosberg. Instead of more than 100 players as called for in the original, he took a cue from the opening notes on a clarinet and scored the piece for eight clarinetists (who also played other instruments) and two percussionists.",
      "Heartbeat\u2019s final local offering of the season will be Gounod\u2019s \u201cFaust,\u201d to run at the Baruch Performing Arts Center from May 13-25.",
      "\u201cI had mentioned to Jacob that I really love devil stories,\u201d said Holdren, who is directing the production. \u201cAnd I was fascinated with the idea of taking something so big and so weighed down with history and assumptions and seeing how much we could crack it open and blow the dust off.\u201d",
      "She sees Mephistopheles less as a \u201dmustache-twirling villain\u201d and more as \u201ca figure of hunger and loneliness slipping into the vacuums that human beings create when they are so desperate or disgusted with life that there\u2019s an opening for him.\u201d",
      "Her production will be set in contemporary times, sung in French but with new English-language dialogue, and it will make heavy use of shadow puppetry. It\u2019s the first Heartbeat offering for which Schlosberg has not done the re-orchestration.",
      "That task fell to Francisco Ladr\u00f3n de Guevara, a Mexican violinist and composer who has scored the opera for seven musicians, most of whom play two instruments, including Ashworth, who will play violin and mandolin and also conduct.",
      "Schlosberg will be back doing the arranging for a rare Heartbeat foray outside the city this summer. The company has been invited to stage a revised version of Samuel Barber\u2019s \u201cVanessa\u201d at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really excited by what they\u2019ve been doing, particularly in reimagining the classics for contemporary times,\" said Raphael Picciarelli, co-managing director of the festival.",
      "For Heartbeat\u2019s debut in Williamstown, the festival is setting up a new performance space that should make the company feel right at home. It\u2019s in an abandoned grocery store, and there will be seats for just over 200 people.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Smokey Robinson's lawyer said allegations of rape and sexual assault against him in a lawsuit from four former housekeepers are \u201cvile\" and \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "Attorney Christopher Frost said in a statement Wednesday that the evidence \u201cwill show that this is simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon.\u201d",
      "The suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday against the Motown music luminary seeks at least $50 million in damages over the alleged assaults, which the women say took place between 2007 and 2024. Robinson's wife, Frances Robinson, is also named as a defendant for allegedly enabling his behavior and creating an abusive work environment.",
      "\u201cWe will be addressing the numerous aspects of the complaint that defy credulity as well as issues relating to purported timelines, inconsistencies, and relationships between the plaintiffs and others,\u201d Frost's statement said.",
      "The four women each allege that Smokey Robinson would wait until he was alone with them in his Los Angeles house and then sexually assault and rape them over their objections, in some cases for many years.",
      "\u201cWe believe that Mr. Robinson is a serial and sick rapist, and must be stopped,\u201d the women\u2019s attorney John Harris said at a news conference Tuesday.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. The women, whose names are withheld in the lawsuit, appeared with their lawyers at the news conference. They didn't speak, and they covered their faces with masks.",
      "Frost called the news conference \u201cbizarre theatrics,\u201d and an attempt to \u201cenlist the public as an unwitting participant in the media circus they are trying to create. We ask anyone following this case to reserve judgment as the evidence comes to light and all the actual facts of the case unfold.\u201d",
      "One woman said that she worked for Robinson from 2012 until 2024, and was assaulted at least 20 times in that span. Another said that she worked for him from 2014 until 2020, and was assaulted at least 23 times.",
      "All of the accusers said they eventually quit over the assaults, though in some cases it took several years. And all said they feared coming forward over fears of retaliation, public shame and possible effects on their immigration status. The same fears have kept the women from going to police to report Robinson, their lawyers said, though they also said they believe criminal investigation is warranted.",
      "The suit seeks damages based on sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence and other allegations.",
      "Frost said that Robinson would soon address the allegations himself, and that they would be asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit.",
      "Robinson, a member of both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, was among the biggest hitmakers of the 1960s as a central part of the Motown Records machine \u2014 both with his group the Miracles and as a solo artist, with songs including \u201cTears of a Clown\" and \u201cThe Tracks of My Tears.\"",

    "story": [
      "A former model who alleges that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her almost 20 years ago has taken the stand at his retrial",
      "NEW YORK -- Days into Harvey Weinstein 's first sexual assault trial in 2020, prosecutors privately spoke for the first time with a former model who alleged that he had forced oral sex on her.",
      "But that jury was never told about Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola's claim. Prosecutors have said they still were investigating the allegation when Weinstein, a onetime movie tycoon-turned- #MeToo pariah, was convicted in February 2020 of charges based on other women's accusations.",
      "On Wednesday, Sokola began to tell a new jury her story.",
      "Sokola didn't look at Weinstein as she walked past him and onto the witness stand in a Manhattan courtroom where he's on trial again. An appeals court overturned his 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction, sending those charges back for retrial, and prosecutors subsequently added another sexual assault charge based on Sokola's allegations.",
      "As she began testifying about her life before the alleged 2006 assault, Weinstein looked toward her, with his right hand across his mouth.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults.",
      "The women, meanwhile, say the Oscar-winning producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "The Polish-born Sokola, 39, sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and its calls for accountability for sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "She was introduced to Weinstein while on a modeling trip to New York in 2002, when she was 16, according to prosecutors.",
      "In her lawsuits, Sokola said that shortly after she met Weinstein, he invited her to lunch to discuss her career but then sexually assaulted her. The lawsuits alleged he sexually harassed and emotionally abused her for years afterward.",
      "The criminal charge stems from one instance when Sokola maintains that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel in May 2006.",
      "Prosecutors have said it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries\u201d and met her visiting older sister, whom she was trying to impress.",
      "\u201cShe was proud of knowing him,\u201d her sister, cardiologist Dr. Ewa (pronounced EH\u2019-vah) Sokola, told jurors Wednesday.",
      "She said the three of them met in a hotel lobby, chatted for about an hour about Italian movies and the heavyset Weinstein's heart health, and then he and the model left the table together.",
      "Kaja Sokola was tense when she returned about a half-hour later \u2014 \u201clike somebody waiting for the result of an exam\u201d or the Oscars \u2014 but didn't say anything about the alleged sexual assault, Dr. Sokola told jurors.",
      "She said she was shocked to learn about the claim over a decade later, when she read about it in a magazine article.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers will get a chance to question Kaja Sokola in the coming days. In an opening statement last month, defense attorney Arthur Aidala questioned why she waited years to come forward. Prosecutors have argued that accusers were reluctant to speak up because of Weinstein's wealth and influence.",
      "Prosecutors have said Sokola's attorneys contacted them on the eve of Weinstein's first trial to say she was willing to be interviewed. Prosecutors have said they soon spoke with her and began investigating, but didn't initially pursue charges because Weinstein was convicted and the coronavirus pandemic loomed.",
      "They revived the Sokola investigation after New York's highest court reversed Weinstein's conviction.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola's allegation out of the retrial. They accused prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case for the improper purpose of bolstering the credibility\u201d of other accusers.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",

Looking for any tips you can give me \u2014 especially on my backswing and follow-through.\"",
      "Kelce said the early feedback was \u201ccrazy.\"",
      "\u201cSome of this stuff is like stuff other pros have put out and it's kind of generic stuff that everybody can use,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cBut there's been some stuff so far that's been like, \u2018Holy cow, I never thought about it like that.' So I'm excited about that.\u201d",
      "Kelce \u2014 who retired following the 2023 season after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles, played his role as man of the people to perfection during a pro-am ahead of the Truist Championship. He took time to answer questions from 14-year-old Benji Panzer, a middle school student who had credentials as part of an area sports broadcasting camp. Panzer asked Kelce about his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast that he tapes with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.",

He accepted gifts, too, including a Kelly green Eagles beer koozie. One fan who called himself T-Shirt Phil \u2014 did we mention the tourney was near Philly? \u2014 said he wanted to introduce Kelce to Phillies slugger Nick Castellanos.",

      "\u201cThe course is in great shape,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous. All the guys we played with agreed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe guys\u201d included PGA pros Stephan Jager and Shane Lowry.",
      "One unspecified member of the group sliced a ball into the crowd and struck the left hand of 25-year-old spectator Hudson Mokrejs, of Elverson, Pennsylvania, who needed an ice pack on his reddened wrist.",
      "\u201cWe were talking beforehand like, \u2018Man, wouldn\u2019t it be great to get hit by Jason Kelce's ball?' And then he shot it over the green,\u201d Mokrejs said. \u201cI was talking and all of a sudden I hear, \u2018Look out!\u2019 I turned and it just smacked me in the hand. I covered my hand. I didn't spill my drink. I had a Transfusion. Classic golf drink, you know what I mean? Chugged that real quick to get me healthy.\u201d",
      "Kelce noted the serene golf atmosphere made for more \u201cGo Birds\u201d chants more than the popular \u201cE-A-G-L-E-S\u201d chant that punctuates the Eagles\u2019 fight song.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so quick,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cThe \u2018E-A-G-L-E-S\u2019 you\u2019ve got start in halfway through. Someone\u2019s got to get it going.\u201d",
      "He can expect to hear more of them on the course on big-time golf events in the area.",
      "The 2026 PGA Championship will be held at Aronimink Golf Club in Newtown Square and the 2030 U.S. Open is at Merion Golf Club.",
      "\u201cPhilly is an unbelievable golf hub,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cThere's a lot of fans in the game. There's a lot of incredible courses with a lot of history to it.\u201d",

      "The indictment alleges Pitt forcibly touched his ex-girlfriend sexually in April 2020. In August 2020, the grand jury alleges Pitt forced oral sex on the woman and assaulted her with a 4-inch-by-4-inch (10-centimeter-by-10-centimeter) piece of lumber.",

      "NEW YORK -- Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, the hip-hop entrepreneur whose wildly successful career has been dotted by allegations of violence, will be brought to a New York courthouse Monday to be tried on charges that he used the influence and resources of his business empire to sexually abuse women. Jury selection is scheduled to begin in the morning and potentially take several days. Opening statements by the lawyers and the start of testimony is expected next week.",
      "The 17-page indictment against Combs reads like a charging document filed against a Mafia leader or the head of a drug gang, accusing him of engaging in sex trafficking and presiding over a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "The indictment says that with the help of people in his entourage and employees from his network of businesses, Combs engaged in a two-decade pattern of abusive behavior against women and others.",
      "Women were manipulated into participating in drug-fueled sexual performances with male sex workers that Combs called \u201cFreak Offs,\u201d prosecutors say.",
      "To keep women in line, prosecutors say Combs used a mix of influence and violence: He offered to boost their entertainment careers if they did what he asked \u2014 or cut them off if they didn't.",
      "And when he wasn't getting what he wanted, the indictment says Combs and his associates resorted to violent acts including beatings, kidnapping and arson. Once, the indictment alleges, he even dangled someone from a balcony.",
      "Combs and his lawyers say he is innocent.",
      "Any group sex was consensual, they say. There was no effort to coerce people into things they didn't want to do, and nothing that happened amounted to a criminal racket, they said.",
      "The trial is expected to take at least eight weeks.",
      "Combs, 55, has acknowledged one episode of violence that is likely to be featured in the trial. In 2016, a security camera recorded him beating up his former girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. Cassie filed a lawsuit in late 2023 saying Combs had subjected her to years of abuse, including beatings and rape.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, did.",
      "Combs\u2019 attorney, Marc Agnifilo has said Combs was \u201cnot a perfect person\u201d and that there had been drug use and toxic relationships, but said that all sexual activity between Combs, Cassie and other people was consensual.",
      "The trial is the latest and most serious in a long string of legal problems for Combs.",
      "In 1999 he was charged with bursting into the offices of an Interscope Records executive with his bodyguards and beating him with a champagne bottle and a chair. The executive, Steve Stoute, later asked prosecutors to go easy on Combs, who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and took an anger management class.",
      "Later that same year, Combs was stopped by police after he and his then-girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, fled a nightclub where three people were wounded by gunfire. Combs was acquitted of all charges related to the incident at a 2001 trial, but a rapper in his entourage, Jamal \u201cShyne\u201d Barrow, was convicted in the shooting and served nearly nine years in prison.",
      "Then in 2015, Combs was charged with assaulting someone with a weight-room kettlebell at the the University of California, Los Angeles, where one of his sons played football. Combs said he was defending himself and prosecutors dropped the case.",
      "Now, Combs faces his most serious case yet.",
      "If convicted, he faces the possibility of decades in prison.",

    "story": [
      "Jacques Agbobly has only been in the fashion business for five years",
      "NEW YORK -- When the email came from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Jacques Agbobly at first didn\u2019t quite believe it.",
      "The Brooklyn-based fashion designer had only been in the business for five years. Now, one of the world\u2019s top museums was asking for two of his designs to be shown in \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d the exhibit launched by the starry Met Gala.",
      "\u201cI was just floored with excitement,\u201d Agbobly said in an interview. \u201cI had to check to make sure it was from an official email. And then the excitement came, and I was like \u2026 am I allowed to say anything to anyone about it?\u201d",
      "Agbobly grew up in Togo, watching seamstresses and tailors create beautiful garments in part of the family home that they rented out. Studying fashion later in New York, the aspiring designer watched the Met Gala carpet from afar and dreamed of one day somehow being part of it.",
      "\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is the first Costume Institute exhibit to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years devoted to menswear. Unlike past shows that highlighted the work of very famous designers like Karl Lagerfeld or Charles James, this exhibit includes a number of up-and-coming designers like Agbobly.",
      "\u201cThe range is phenomenal,\u201d says guest curator Monica L. Miller, a Barnard College professor whose book, \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d is a foundation for the show.",
      "\u201cIt's super exciting to showcase the designs of these younger and emerging designers,\u201d says Miller, who took The Associated Press through the show over the weekend before its unveiling at Monday\u2019s Met Gala, \u201cand to see the way they've been thinking about Black representation across time and across geography.\u201d",
      "The exhibit covers Black style over several centuries, but the unifying theme is dandyism, and how designers have expressed that ethos through history.",
      "For Agbobly, dandyism is \u201cabout taking space. As a Black designer, as a queer person, a lot of it is rooted in people telling us who we should be or how we should act \u2026 dandyism really goes against that. It\u2019s about showing up and looking your best self and taking up space and announcing that you're here.\u201d",
      "The exhibit, which opens to the public May 10, begins with its own definition: someone who \u201cstudies above everything else to dress elegantly and fashionably.\u201d",
      "Miller has organized it into 12 conceptual sections: Ownership, presence, distinction, disguise, freedom, champion, respectability, jook, heritage, beauty, cool and cosmopolitanism.",
      "The \u201cownership\u201d section begins with two livery coats worn by enslaved people.",
      "One of them, from Maryland, looks lavish and elaborate, in purple velvet trimmed with gold metallic threading. The garments were intended to show the wealth of their owners. In other words, Miller says, the enslaved themselves were items of conspicuous consumption.",
      "The other is a livery coat of tan broadcloth, likely manufactured by Brooks Brothers and worn by an enslaved child or adolescent boy in Louisiana just before the Civil War.",
      "Elsewhere, there's a contemporary, glittering ensemble by British designer Grace Wales Bonner, made of crushed silk velvet and embroidered with crystals and the cowrie shells historically used as currency in Africa.",
      "There's also a so-called \u201cdollar bill suit\u201d by the label 3.Paradis \u2014 the jacket sporting a laminated one-dollar bill stitched to the breast pocket, meant to suggest the absence of wealth.",
      "The \u201cdisguise\u201d section includes a collection of 19th-century newspaper ads announcing rewards for catching runaway enslaved people.",
      "The ads, Miller notes, would often describe someone who was \u201cparticularly fond of dress\u201d \u2014 or note that the person had taken large wardrobes. The reason was twofold: The fancy clothes made it possible for an enslaved person to cloak their identity. But also, when they finally made it to freedom, they could sell the clothing to help fund their new lives, Miller says.",
      "\u201cSo dressing above one\u2019s station sometimes was a matter of life and death,\u201d the curator says, \u201cand also enabled people to transition from being enslaved to being liberated.\u201d",
      "The contemporary part of this section includes striking embroidered jackets by the label Off-White that purposely play with gender roles \u2014 like displaying an ostensibly \u201cmale\u201d jacket on a female mannequin.",
      "Stopping by a set of portraits from the early 19th century, as abolitionism was happening in the North, Miller explains that the subjects are Black men who were successful, well off enough to commission or sit for portraits, and dressed \u201cin the finest fashions of the day.\u201d Like William Whipper, an abolitionist and wealthy lumber merchant who also founded a literary society.",
      "They represent the beginnings of a Black middle and upper middle class in America, Miller says. But she points out a group of racist caricatures in a case right across from the portraits.",
      "\u201cAlmost as soon as they are able to do this,\u201d she says, referring to the portraits, \u201cthey are stereotyped and degraded.\u201d",
      "W.E.B. Du Bois, Miller points out, was not only a civil rights activist but also one of the best-dressed men in turn-of-the-century America. He traveled extensively overseas, which meant he needed \u201cclothing befitting his status as a representative of Black America to the world.\u201d",
      "Objects in the display include receipts for tailors in London, and suit orders from Brooks Brothers or his Harlem tailor. There is also a laundry receipt from 1933 for cleaning of shirts, collars, and handkerchiefs.",
      "Also highlighted in this section: Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist, writer, and statesman and also \u201cthe most photographed man of the 19th century.\u201d",
      "The show includes his tailcoat of brushed wool, as well as a shirt embroidered with a \u201cD\u201d monogram, a top hat, a cane and a pair of sunglasses.",
      "One of Miller\u2019s favorite items in the heritage section is Agbobly\u2019s bright-colored ensemble based on the hues of bags that West African migrants used to transport their belongings.",
      "Also displayed is Agbobly\u2019s denim suit embellished with crystals and beads. It's a tribute not only to the hairbraiding salons where the designer spent time as a child, but also the earrings his grandmother or aunts would wear when they went to church.",
      "Speaking of family, Agbobly says that he ultimately did tell them \u2014 and everyone \u2014 about his \u201cpinch-me moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone knows about it,\u201d the designer says. \u201cI keep screaming. If I can scream on top of a hill, I will.\u201d",

      "The Mother Monster, as she is known, kicked off the show at around 22:10 p.m. local time with her 2011 song \u201cBloody Mary.\u201d Cries of joy rose from the tightly-packed fans who sang and danced shoulder-to-shoulder on the vast stretch of sand.",

      "Ruth Buzzi, who rose to fame as the frumpy and bitter Gladys Ormphby on the groundbreaking sketch comedy series \u201cRowan & Martin\u2019s Laugh-In\u201d and made over 200 television appearances during a 45-year career, has died at age 88",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Ruth Buzzi, who rose to fame as the frumpy and bitter Gladys Ormphby on the groundbreaking sketch comedy series \u201cRowan & Martin\u2019s Laugh-In\u201d and made over 200 television appearances during a 45-year career, has died at age 88.",
      "Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, says her agent Mike Eisenstadt. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi's Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: \u201cShe wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.\u201d",
      "Buzzi won a Golden Globe and was a two-time Emmy nominee for the NBC show that ran from 1968 to 1973. She was the only regular to appear in all six seasons, including the pilot.",
      "She was first spotted by \u201cLaugh-In\u201d creator and producer George Schlatter playing various characters on \u201cThe Steve Allen Comedy Hour.\u201d",
      "Schlatter was holding auditions for \u201cLaugh-In\u201d when he received a picture in the mail of Buzzi in her Ormphby costume, sitting in a wire mesh trash barrel. The character was clad in drab brown with her bun covered by a hairnet knotted in the middle of her forehead.",
      "\u201cI think I hired her because of my passion for Gladys Ormphby,\u201d he wrote in his 2023 memoir \u201cStill Laughing A Life in Comedy.\u201d \u201cI must admit that the hairnet and the rolled-down stockings did light my fire. My favorite Gladys line was when she announced that the day of the office Christmas party, they sent her home early.\u201d",
      "The Gladys character used her purse as a weapon against anyone who bothered her, striking people over the head. On \u201cLaugh-In,\u201d her most frequent target was Arte Johnson\u2019s dirty old man character Tyrone F. Horneigh.",
      "\u201cGladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,\u201d Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. \u201cSo when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who\u2019s been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused. And that\u2019s almost everyone at some time or other.\u201d",
      "Buzzi took her act to the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts in Las Vegas, where she bashed her purse on the heads of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Lucille Ball, among others.",
      "Her other recurring characters on \u201cLaugh-In\u201d included Flicker Farkle; Busy-Buzzi, a Hollywood gossip columnist; Doris Swizzler, a cocktail-lounge regular who got drunk with husband Leonard, played by Dick Martin; and an inconsiderate flight attendant.",
      "\u201cI never took my work for granted, nor assumed I deserved more of the credit or spotlight or more pay than anyone else,\u201d Buzzi told The Connecticut Post. \u201cI was just thrilled to drive down the hill to NBC every day as an employed actor with a job to do.\u201d",
      "Buzzi remained friends through the years with \u201cLaugh-In\u201d co-stars Lily Tomlin and Jo Anne Worley.",
      "Born Ruth Ann Buzzi on July 24, 1936, in Westerly, Rhode Island, she was the daughter of Angelo Buzzi, a nationally known stone sculptor.",

      "Actor-comedian Russell Brand has been granted conditional bail after appearing in a London court to face charges of rape and sexual assault involving four women",
      "LONDON -- Actor-comedian Russell Brand was granted conditional bail by a London court on Friday after appearing to face charges of rape and sexual assault involving four women.",
      "Brand, 49, did not enter a plea. He previously denied the allegations made against him.",
      "He was swarmed by photographers as he arrived at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court for his first hearing since he was charged last month with one count each of rape, indecent assault and oral rape, as well as two counts of sexual assault.",
      "Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring told Brand to present himself at the Central Criminal Court, commonly known as the Old Bailey, in central London on May 30 and granted him bail on condition he keeps the court informed of where he is staying, either in the U.K. or in the U.S. He currently lives in Florida but is obliged to attend all future court appearances. If he doesn't abide by the conditions, he faces being remanded in custody.",
      "The comedian, author and \u201cGet Him To The Greek\u201d actor, who wore an open shirt and jeans, listened intently to the details of the charges as he sat in the dock. He spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth, address and that he understood his bail conditions.",
      "The alleged offenses took place between 1999 and 2005 \u2014 one in the English seaside town of Bournemouth and the other three in the Westminster area of central London. The accusers have not been identified.",
      "Brand has been interviewed by police about the allegations, which he denies. Brand has denied engaging in \u201cnon-consensual activity.\u201d In a video posted on X after he was charged, Brand said he welcomed the opportunity to prove his innocence.",
      "Brand is alleged to have raped a woman in 1999 at a hotel room in Bournemouth when she attended a Labour Party conference in the town. It is alleged that while the woman went to the bathroom, Brand removed some of his clothing and later pushed her on the bed, removed her underwear and raped her.",
      "A second woman accuses Brand of grabbing her by the forearm and attempting to drag her into a male toilet at a television station in London in 2001.",
      "A third accuser was a television worker Brand met in Soho, central London, in 2004. He is accused of grabbing her breasts before allegedly pulling her into a toilet and orally raping her.",
      "The final complainant is a radio station worker who met Brand while he was working for Channel 4 on a spin-off of the \u201cBig Brother\u201d reality television program between 2004 and 2005. Brand is alleged to have grabbed her by the face with both hands, pushed her against a wall and kissed her before grabbing her breasts and buttocks.",
      "The charges follow a September 2023 joint investigation by British media outlets Channel 4 and the Sunday Times.",
      "Known for his unbridled and risqu\u00e9 standup routines, Brand hosted shows on radio and television and wrote memoirs charting his battles with drugs and alcohol. He has appeared in several Hollywood movies and was briefly married to pop star Katy Perry between 2010 and 2012.",
      "In recent years, Brand has largely disappeared from mainstream media but has built up a large following online with videos mixing wellness and conspiracy theories. He recently said he had moved to the United States.",

    "story": [
      "A slab of Brooklyn wall that the artist Banksy emblazoned with a bandaged, heart-shaped balloon is emerging after more than a decade in storage",
      "NEW YORK -- When the enigmatic street artist Banksy spray-painted a heart-shaped balloon covered with a Band-Aid on the wall of a Brooklyn warehouse, the nondescript brick building was instantly transformed into an art destination and the canvas of an unlikely graffiti battle.",
      "Almost as soon as Banksy revealed the piece back in 2013, an anonymous tagger brazenly walked up and spray painted the words \u201cOmar NYC\u201d in red beside the balloon, to the dismay of onlookers.",
      "Days later, someone stenciled \u201cis a little girl\u201d in white and pink beside Omar\u2019s tag, followed by a seemingly sarcastic phrase in black: \u201cI remember MY first tag.\u201d Some think it was Banksy himself who secretly returned to the scene to add the rejoinder.",
      "The apparent graffiti battle didn\u2019t end there. Another tagger also attempted to leave his mark but was stymied by security guards. Today the phrase \u201cSHAN\u201d is still visible in light purple paint.",
      "Maria Georgiadis, whose family owned the now-demolished warehouse and ultimately removed the section of wall to preserve the artwork, says the graffiti pastiche is quintessentially New York.",
      "\u201cIt looks like a war going on,\u201d she said recently. \u201cThey\u2019re literally going at it on the wall.\u201d",
      "The preserved wall, dubbed \u201cBattle to Survive a Broken Heart,\u201d will be going up for sale May 21 at Guernsey\u2019s, the New York auction house.",
      "Georgiadis, a Brooklyn schoolteacher, says the sale is bittersweet. Her father, Vassilios Georgiadis, ran his roofing and asbestos abatement company from the warehouse adorned with the balloon.",
      "He died four years ago at age 67 from a heart attack, which is why some of the proceeds from the sale will be donated to the American Heart Association.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just very significant to us because he loved it and he was just so full of love,\u201d Maria Georgiadis said on a recent visit to the art warehouse where the piece was stored for more than a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s like the bandage heart. We all have love, but we\u2019ve all went through things and we just put a little Band-Aid over and just keep on moving, right? That\u2019s how I take it.\u201d",
      "The nearly 4-ton, 6-foot-tall (3.6-metric ton, 1.8-meter-tall) wall section is one of a number of guerrilla works the famously secretive British artist made during a New York residency in 2013.",
      "At the time, Banksy heralded the work by posting on his website photos and an audio track recorded partly in a squeaky, helium-induced voice.",
      "Guernsey auction house President Arlan Ettinger said it is impossible to know for certain because Banksy works clandestinely. But he said the neat stenciling and wording \u201cstrongly suggest that this was a gentle way for Banksy to put the other artist in his place.\u201d",
      "Ulrich Blanch\u00e9, an art history lecturer at Heidelberg University in Germany, called the piece a \u201cvery well executed\u201d stencil notable partly because of Banksy's decision to place it in Brooklyn\u2019s port area of Red Hook.",
      "\u201cThis part of NYC was not easy to reach at that time,\u201d he said by email. \u201cBanksy wanted people to go to places in NYC they never have seen and love them as well.\u201d",
      "But Blanche questioned whether the additional stenciled text was truly the work of Banksy, saying the word choice and design don\u2019t appear to comport with the artist\u2019s style at the time.",
      "\u201cTo call a graffiti guy a \u2018girl\u2019 is not something Banksy would do in 2013. This is misogynic and immature in a sexist way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThree different fonts that do not match and three colors \u2014 why should he do that? Too unnecessarily elaborated without reasons. So I think this was added by someone else.\u201d",
      "Blanch\u00e9 also said he is ambivalent about the pending sale, noting Banksy usually doesn't authorize his street pieces for sale. At the same time, he understands the burden placed on property owners to protect and maintain them.",
      "\u201cBanksy\u2019s works should be preserved, but for the community they were made for,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should not be turned into goods. They are made and thought for a specific location. Not portable. Not sellable.\u201d",
      "Spokespersons for Banksy didn't respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Maria Georgiadis\u2019 brother, Anastasios, said his father had also hoped to keep the piece in Red Hook after having cut it out of the wall and framed in thick steel for safekeeping.",
      "The elder Georgiadis, he said, envisioned the work as the centerpiece of a retail and housing development on the property, a dream he didn't realize. The property has since been sold off by the family.",
      "Ettinger said it is difficult to say what the piece might fetch. There is little precedent for a sale of a Banksy piece of this size, he said.",
      "In 2018, a canvas that was part of Banksy's \u201cGirl With Balloon\u201d series sold in London for 1.04 million pounds ($1.4 million), only to famously self-destruct in front of a stunned auction crowd.",
      "Maria Georgiadis said she hopes whoever buys the \u201dBroken Heart\u201d finds the same beauty and meaning her father drew from the piece.",
      "When Banksy painted it, the family business had been recovering from destructive floods caused by Hurricane Sandy the prior year. Georgiadis recalls her father had no idea who Banksy was but was moved by the simple image.",
      "\u201cMy dad had it in his head that Banksy knew what we went through,\u201d she said. \u201cHe goes, \u2018Can you believe it Maria? It\u2019s a heart.\u2019\u201d",

      "The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies \u201cto cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS\" and further requires that that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. The White House, in a social media posting announcing the signing, said the outlets \u201creceive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\u201d",
      "It's the latest move by Trump and his administration to utilize federal powers to control or hamstring institutions whose actions or viewpoints he disagrees with. Since taking office, Trump has ousted leaders, placed staff on administrative leave and cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to artists, libraries, museums, theaters and others, through takeovers of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has also pushed to withhold federal research and education funds from universities and punish law firms unless they agreed to eliminate diversity programs and other measures Trump has found objectionable.",
      "The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and have been preparing for the possibility of stiff cuts since Trump's election, as Republicans have long complained about them.",
      "Paula Kerger, PBS\u2019 CEO and president, said in a statement last month that the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rescind funding for public media would \u201cdisrupt the essential service PBS and local member stations provide to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cThis public-private partnership allows us to help prepare millions of children for success in school and in life and also supports enriching and inspiring programs of the highest quality.\u201d",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting sued Trump earlier this week over his move to fire three members of its five-person board, contending that the president was exceeding his authority and that the move would deprive the board of a quorum needed to conduct business.",
      "Just two weeks ago, the White House said it would be asking Congress to rescind funding for the CPB as part of a $9.1 billion package of cuts. That package, however, which budget director Russell Vought said would likely be the first of several, has not yet been sent to Capitol Hill.",
      "The move against PBS and NPR comes as his administration has been working to dismantle the U.S. Agency for Global Media, including Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which were designed to model independent news gathering globally in societies that restrict the press. Those efforts have faced pushback from federal courts, who have ruled in some cases that the Trump administration may have overstepped its authority in holding back funds appropriated to the outlets by Congress.",

      "LUSAKA, Zambia -- The United States will cut $50 million worth of aid a year to the southern African country of Zambia because of the \u201csystematic\" theft of medicines and medical supplies the money paid for, the U.S. ambassador said Thursday.",
      "The U.S. had discovered in 2021 that medicines and supplies that were meant to be provided free to Zambians had been taken and were being sold by pharmacies across the country, U.S. Ambassador to Zambia Michael Gonzales said at a press briefing.",
      "He said that an investigation of around 2,000 pharmacies in Zambia between 2021 and 2023 found that nearly half of them were selling medicines and products paid for by U.S. aid funds.",
      "The Zambian government had failed to do enough to address the corruption after the U.S. informed it of the theft scandal in April 2024, Gonzales said.",
      "There was no immediate government comment Thursday.",
      "The $50 million is part of $128 million the U.S. gives to Zambia a year for medicines, medical supplies and other support for its health sector. Gonzales said the cuts would affect medications for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, three critical diseases affecting Zambians.",

      "He said that the U.S. investigation into the theft also found that medications and supplies for Zambia paid for by the Global Fund and other international donors were also being sold in pharmacies.",
      "Gonzales said he had recommended to officials in Washington that the U.S. start cutting the aid from January next year to give Zambia time to plan new procurements of the life-saving drugs.",

Scientists from the National Cancer Institute looked at data that included more than 2 million cancers diagnosed in people 15 to 49 years old between 2010 and 2019.",
      "Of 33 cancer types, 14 cancers had increasing rates in at least one younger age group. About 63% of the early-onset cancers were among women.",
      "\u201cThese kinds of patterns generally reflect something profound going on,\u201d said Tim Rebbeck of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who studies cancer risk and was not involved in the research. \u201cWe need to fund research that will help us understand.\"",
      "The findings were published Thursday in Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.",
      "The researchers compared cancer rates in 2019 to what would be expected based on 2010 rates.",
      "Breast cancer made up the largest share of the excess cancers, with about 4,800 additional cases. There were 2,000 more colorectal cancers compared with what would be expected based on the 2010 rates. There were 1,800 more kidney cancers and 1,200 additional uterine cancers.",
      "Reassuringly, death rates were not rising for most cancers in the young adult age groups, although increasing death rates were seen for colorectal, uterine and testicular cancers.",

      "Gates met President Prabowo Subianto at the colonial-style Merdeka palace in Jakarta to discuss global health, nutrition, financial inclusion and public digital infrastructure, Indonesia\u2019s presidential office said in a statement ahead of the meeting.",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and Gates Foundation praised Indonesia's adoption of vaccines like Rotavirus for diarrhea and Pneumococcus for pneumonia and the country's efforts in reducing child mortality.",
      "He said ten million children under the age of five worldwide died when his foundation launched in 2000, with 90% of the deaths due to diarrhea, pneumonia or malaria. That number has now been cut in half to below five million, Gates said.",
      "\u201cIt's been an amazing time period. And there\u2019s many new tools coming,\u201d he told the meeting, which was also attended by prominent Indonesian businesspeople and philanthropists.",

      "Gates has granted more than $159 million to Indonesia since 2009. Much of it was allocated to the health sector, especially for vaccine procurement, Subianto said. Thanks to the funds, Subianto said Biofarma, a state-run pharmaceutical company, now can produce two billion doses of its polio vaccine every year, benefiting more than 900 million people in 42 countries.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration says that a prominent medical contrarian and critic of the drug industry will head its vaccine center",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Vinay Prasad, a prominent critic of the pharmaceutical industry and the Food and Drug Administration, has been named to oversee the health agency\u2019s program for vaccines and biotech drugs.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced the appointment Tuesday in a message to agency staff, praising Prasad's \u201clong and distinguished history in medicine.\u201d",
      "Prasad is the latest in a series of medical contrarians and critics of COVID-19 measures to join the federal government under President Donald Trump.",
      "Unlike political roles such as FDA commissioner, the job Prasad is stepping into has traditionally been held by an FDA career scientist. His appointment raises new questions about whether vaccines and other new therapies will face unnecessary scrutiny from regulators.",
      "Prasad replaces Dr. Peter Marks, FDA\u2019s longtime vaccine chief who resigned in March after clashing with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over concerns about the safety of vaccinations.",
      "In a social media post, Prasad likened Marks to \u201ca bobblehead doll that just stamps approval.\"",
      "Last year, he told former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy that Americans would probably be better off without the FDA in its current form.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about FDA 2024, I think they\u2019d probably be better off as a result of not having the FDA\u201d Prasad said during an appearance on Ramaswamy's podcast.",
      "A professor at the University of California San Francisco, Prasad's medical training is in cancer and blood disorders. He first came to prominence among academics for a series of papers scrutinizing the evidence behind new cancer therapies.",
      "Research by Prasad and his colleagues showed that many cancer drugs fast-tracked by the FDA have never been shown to improve or extend patient lives. Instead, the drugs are often approved based on alternate measures, such as the ability to shrink tumors, which are thought to predict their long-term benefits.",
      "The FDA has long defended this practice as a way of accelerating approval of medicines for desperately ill patients.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Prasad reached a much broader audience as a critic of mask mandates, lockdowns and moves to speed the availability of vaccine boosters from Pfizer and Moderna. Many of his views mirror those of other Trump appointees, including Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya.",
      "In 2022, Prasad and Makary were co-authors on a paper attacking the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. Those patients received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild.",
      "The paper concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions, prompting pushback from many health experts.",
      "In recent years, Prasad become a regular on podcasts associated with Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, which often portrays the FDA as beholden to the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Prasad's appointment is likely to alarm drug and vaccine makers, who depend on the predictability of FDA standards and procedures to guide drug development plans that can span years or even decades.",

      "Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital have agreed to a $750 million settlement of hundreds of sexual abuse claims by patients of disgraced and imprisoned former gynecologist Robert Hadden, bringing total legal payouts in civil cases involving the ex-doctor to over $1 billion, according to the plaintiffs' lawyer.",
      "Hadden, now 66, was accused of molesting patients during a decades-long career at prestigious New York City hospitals including Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian. He was convicted by a jury in 2023 of federal sex crime charges and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.",
      "The new settlements, approved by a Manhattan judge Monday, come in 576 legal cases against the Ivy League school, the hospital and others over the abuse by Hadden, plaintiffs' attorney Anthony T. DiPietro said.",

      "\u201cFor far too long, Columbia and New York-Presbyterian have prioritized protecting their reputations over protecting their patients,\" he said. \"This settlement sends a powerful message that we\u2019re here to ensure that institutions covering up exploitation and abuse will be held fully accountable for their crimes.\u201d",
      "DiPietro said the average payout to plaintiffs from the new settlement will be about $1.3 million. Columbia previously agreed to $277 million in settlements with more than 200 other plaintiffs over Hadden's sexual abuse, he said.",
      "Columbia confirmed the settlement but not the amount Tuesday. Lawyers for the school and New York-Presbyterian did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",

      "\u201cWe deeply regret the pain that his patients suffered, and this settlement is another step forward in our ongoing work and commitment to repair harm and support survivors,\u201d it said. \"We commend the survivors for their bravery in coming forward.\u201d",
      "New York-Presbyterian referred questions about the settlement to Columbia, saying the school employed Hadden.",
      "One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits, Laurie Maldonado, who sued Columbia, New York-Presbyterian, Hadden and others, said her case was not about money.",
      "\u201cIt's about accountability,\u201d she said in a statement provided by DiPietro. \"Columbia University enabled sadistic abuse, and now, they\u2019ve been forced to face the truth. We hope this sends a clear message to every institution: survivors will not be silenced, and those who protect abusers will be held responsible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, like Maldonado has.",
      "Hadden\u2019s accusers also included Evelyn Yang, the wife of former presidential candidate and New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang, who said Hadden abused her when she was pregnant with her first child.",
      "During Hadden's criminal trial, nine victims testified about how Hadden molested them during gynecology treatments, starting in the late 1980s, at prominent hospitals.",
      "Allegations of misconduct during examinations first surfaced in 2012. Hadden was indicted on state charges in 2014 as women kept coming forward. But in 2016, the office of the Manhattan district attorney at the time, Cyrus Vance Jr., allowed Hadden to plead guilty to two low-level felonies and a misdemeanor in a deal that required him to give up his medical license but did not require jail time and kept him out of the state\u2019s sex offender registry.",
      "Some of the women who had gone to state prosecutors were outraged, but their stories did not start receiving public attention until the #MeToo movement began gaining steam in 2017.",
      "Federal prosecutors in Manhattan got a grand jury indictment against Hadden in 2020, charges based on the fact that some patients at his New York offices had come into the city from other states.",
      "In November 2023, Columbia and Columbia University Irving Medical Center announced they would be notifying 6,500 former patients of Hadden of his federal sex crime convictions and giving victims the opportunity to apply for compensation from a $100 million settlement fund. The deadline to apply has been extended to May 15.",

    "story": [
      "Utah dentists say they\u2019re bracing for an increase in tooth decay among the state\u2019s most vulnerable people",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- With Utah's first-in-the-nation ban on fluoride in public drinking water set to take effect Wednesday, dentists who treat children and low-income patients say they're bracing for an increase in tooth decay among the state's most vulnerable people.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed the law against the recommendation of many dentists and national health experts who warn removing fluoride will harm tooth development, especially in young patients without regular access to dental care.",
      "The bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius, said she does not dispute that fluoride can have some benefits but thinks people should not be given it by the government without their informed consent.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. applauded Utah for being the first state to enact a ban and said he plans to direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation nationwide.",
      "Florida could soon become the second state to ban fluoride under a bill awaiting Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 signature. The Ohio and South Carolina legislatures are considering similar measures.",
      "A majority of Utah water systems already did not add fluoride. The state ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents receiving fluoridated water, with about 2 in 5 receiving it in 2022, according to CDC data. The law will impact about 1.6 million people in Salt Lake City and elsewhere in northern Utah who are losing fluoridation, state officials say.",
      "Dentists in Salt Lake City over the past week said many patients were unaware of the upcoming ban, and most did not realize the city had been adding fluoride to their drinking water for nearly two decades.",
      "\u201cI did not know about a ban,\u201d said Noe Figueroa, a patient at Salt Lake Donated Dental Services, a clinic that provides free or heavily discounted dental treatment to low-income residents. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not good. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good at all.\u201d",
      "At Donated Dental, providers expect their monthslong waitlist for children's procedures to grow significantly and their need for volunteer dentists to skyrocket. The effects of the ban in children\u2019s teeth will likely be visible within the next year, said Sasha Harvey, the clinic\u2019s executive director.",
      "\u201cRight now, we\u2019re scheduling into August and September for some 2-, 3-, 4-year-olds that are in so much pain that they can\u2019t eat properly, and there\u2019s nothing we can do but tell parents, \u2018You\u2019re gonna have to wait.\u2019 It\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Harvey said, adding that it's likely to get much worse.",
      "The fluoridation process involves supplementing the low levels of naturally occurring fluoride in most water to reach the 0.7 milligrams per liter recommended by the CDC for cavity prevention. Water treatment plants dump fluoride into the water in liquid or powder form and often use dosing pumps to adjust the levels.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population receives fluoridated drinking water, according to health officials. It was long considered among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Fluoride fortifies teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. It\u2019s especially important to children whose teeth are still developing. For some low-income families, public drinking water containing fluoride may be their only source of preventative dental care.",
      "Some supporters of the Utah law pointed to studies linking high levels of fluoride exposure to illness and low IQ in kids. The National Institutes of Health says it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose from fluoride added to water or toothpaste at standard levels.",
      "The governor said that, like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his children in a community without fluoridated water. Before signing the bill, Cox said there is no difference in health outcomes between communities with and without fluoride \u2014 a statement Utah dentists say is false.",
      "\u201cAny dentist can look in someone\u2019s mouth in Utah and tell exactly where they grew up. Did you grow up in a fluoridated area or a non-fluoridated area? We can tell by the level of decay,\u201d said Dr. James Bekker, a pediatric dentist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.",
      "The law shifts responsibility to individuals, meaning all Utah residents will need to be proactive about their oral health, Harvey said. Most patients at her clinic only come in when a toothache becomes unbearable, and many cannot spare the few dollars a month needed to buy fluoride supplements to add to their drinking water at home.",
      "Figueroa, the free dental clinic patient, said other expenses take priority.",
      "Fluoride toothpaste alone is insufficient for children because it doesn't penetrate the tooth's outer layer, Bekker said. When a person regularly ingests fluoridated water, their saliva bathes the teeth in fluoride throughout the day and makes them stronger.",
      "Bekker said he recommends Utah parents add fluoride supplements to their children\u2019s drinking water. But for families who don\u2019t visit doctors regularly, that may prove difficult.",
      "Fluoride tablets require a prescription from a doctor or dentist. Utah providers are working to make the supplement accessible over the counter, but Bekker said that change may be months or years away.",

      "Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is running for governor in 2026 and sharing new anecdotes in her upcoming political memoir, \u201cThe Purposeful Warrior,\u201d including her experience with miscarriage",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Ahead of a nationally watched bid to become Michigan\u2019s next governor, Democrat Jocelyn Benson is releasing a memoir this month that includes her first public discussion of a miscarriage she had about eight years ago \u2014 an experience she says will shape her commitment to increasing access to reproductive healthcare in the swing state.",
      "Benson, Michigan\u2019s secretary of state, is part of a crowded field seeking to succeed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and she\u2019s the only woman in the running so far.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of Tuesday's release of her political memoir entitled, \u201cThe Purposeful Warrior,\u201d Benson said miscarrying made her value easy access to reproductive health care in an emotional and difficult situation, something she wants to deliver for the state if elected.",
      "\u201cIt opened my eyes to the need to not just protect reproductive freedom and rights, but actually make sure they\u2019re real,\u201d said Benson.",
      "In a chapter entitled \u201cGrit and Grace,\u201d Benson describes finding out she was pregnant shortly after her son\u2019s first birthday and shortly before she launched her bid for secretary of state in 2017. Waves of worry over the timing and elation over becoming a mother of two ensued. But just a day later, she began to miscarry.",
      "She writes about the doctor\u2019s appointment during her eighth week of pregnancy where she learned about her options: surgery, medication or stillbirth and what to expect as her miscarriage continued. By the following morning, she had miscarried on her own.",
      "\u201cThe emotional impact of that stays with you for your whole life,\u201d she told AP.",
      "Benson said she struggled with shame and guilt, emotions she has learned many women experience.",
      "\u201cI want to tell my story to say it\u2019s OK to tell yours as well,\u201d she said.",
      "In the years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, women seeking public office have shared personal stories of miscarriages and abortions. Democrats and Republicans alike have spoken about their pregnancies as reproductive and maternal health care became a central concern for Americans.",
      "In Michigan, voters approved a ballot measure in 2022 to protect abortion access, in an election that also saw Democrats sweep statewide and legislative elections. But Benson said that protection isn\u2019t enough.",
      "Step one is to incentivize talented physicians to work in Michigan, she said. Step two is to bolster reproductive health care in rural Michigan, she said, suggesting mobile clinics that can reach remote areas.",
      "She noted the recent closure of three Planned Parenthood locations in Michigan, including its only location in the Upper Peninsula. Some Planned Parenthood locations provide abortions in addition to services such as birth control, disease screenings and miscarriage management.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Michigan leaders cited financial challenges exacerbated by a freeze of federal dollars for the closures. Federal law already prohibited taxpayer dollars from paying for most abortions.",
      "Centering reproductive rights in the 2026 primary will be another test of the issue\u2019s importance to Democratic voters. Benson will face Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson in the gubernatorial primary. Whitmer, who is term limited, has said she does not plan to endorse in the race.",
      "On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. John James, state Senate Minority Leader Aaric Nesbitt and former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox are vying for the nomination and likely also the endorsement of President Donald Trump.",
      "And the twist \u2014 Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, is pursuing the office as an independent. The move comes as Democrats lost considerable ground in the 2024 election. The state swung back to Trump in the 2024 election and Republicans gained a majority in the state House of Representatives, splitting control of the legislature.",
      "Among anecdotes from her memoir that include her tenure as the state's chief election official during the 2020 election and her law career before, Benson took a swing at Duggan over his handling of the 2018 primary election for governor. She criticized him for not supporting Whitmer early in the race and encouraging other Democrats, who are men, to pursue a run, citing reporting in the New Yorker years later.",
      "\u201cI will never forget the message those efforts sent to women across our state,\u201d Benson wrote. She noted that her own primary campaign became tied to Whitmer\u2019s by gender.",
      "\u201cThe argument went something like, surely we can\u2019t have more than one woman on the ticket at the same time,\u201d Benson wrote.",
      "Benson\u2019s memoir comments on Duggan were first reported by the Detroit News. A spokesperson for Duggan\u2019s campaign told the publication that the Detroit mayor endorsed Whitmer in the Democratic primary over two men.",

      "Attorneys general in 19 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging cuts to the U.S. Health and Human Services agency, saying the Trump administration's massive restructuring has destroyed life-saving programs and left states to pick up the bill for mounting health crises.",

The attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia signed onto the complaint.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. restructured the agency in March, eliminating more than 10,000 employees and collapsing 28 agencies under the sprawling HHS umbrella into 15, the attorneys general said. An additional 10,000 employees had already been let go by President Donald Trump's administration, according to the lawsuit, and combined the cuts stripped 25% of the HHS workforce.",

      "Kennedy has said he is seeking to streamline the nation's public health agencies and reduce redundancies across them with the layoffs. The cuts were made as part of a directive the administration has dubbed, \u201c Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis is not government reform. This is not efficiency,\u201d James said during a press conference Monday.",
      "The cuts have resulted in laboratories having limited testing for some infectious diseases, the federal government not tracking cancer risks among U.S. firefighters, early childhood learning programs left unsure of future funds and programs aimed at monitoring cancer and maternal health closing, the attorneys general say. Cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also have hampered states' ability to respond to one of the largest measles outbreaks in recent years, the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cThis chaos and abandonment of the Department\u2019s core functions was not an unintended side effect, but rather the intended result,\u201d of the \u201cMAHA Directive,\u201d they said. They want a judge to vacate the directive because they say the administration can't unilaterally eliminate programs and funding that have been created by Congress.",
      "The restructuring eliminated the entire team of people who maintain the federal poverty guidelines used by states to determine whether residents are eligible for Medicaid, nutrition assistance and other programs. A tobacco prevention agency was gutted. Staff losses also were significant at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",

Relying on birth and death certificates, it generates information on birth rates, death trends and life expectancy. It also operates longstanding health surveys that provide basic data on obesity, asthma and other health issues.",
      "The center has been barely touched in layoffs, and seems intact under current budget plans.",
      "But many other efforts were targeted by the cuts, the AP found. Some examples:",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, which surveys women across the country, lost its entire staff \u2014 about 20 people.",
      "It\u2019s the most comprehensive collection of data on the health behaviors and outcomes before, during and after childbirth. Researchers have been using its data to investigate the nation's maternal mortality problem.",
      "Recent layoffs also wiped out the staffs collecting data on in vitro fertilizations and abortions.",
      "Those cuts are especially surprising given that President Donald Trump said he wants to expand IVF access and that the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 playbook for his administration called for more abortion surveillance.",
      "The CDC eliminated its program on lead poisoning in children, which helped local health departments \u2014 through funding and expertise \u2014 investigate lead poisoning clusters and find where risk is greatest.",
      "Lead poisoning in kids typically stems from exposure to bits of old paint, contaminated dust or drinking water that passes through lead pipes. But the program's staff also played an important role in the investigation of lead-tainted applesauce that affected 500 kids.",
      "Last year, Milwaukee health officials became aware that peeling paint in aging local elementary schools was endangering kids. The city health department began working with CDC to test tens of thousands of students. That assistance stopped last month when the CDC\u2019s lead program staff was terminated.",
      "City officials are particularly concerned about losing expertise to help them track the long-term effects.",
      "\"We don't know what we don't know,\" said Mike Totoraitis, the city\u2019s health commissioner.",
      "Also gone is the staff for the 23-year-old Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, which had information on concerns including possible cancer clusters and weather-related illnesses.",
      "\u201cThe loss of that program is going to greatly diminish the ability to make linkages between what might be in the environment and what health might be affected by that,\u201d Breysse said.",
      "In some cases, it\u2019s not a matter of staffers leaving, but rather the end of specific types of data collection.",
      "Transgender status is no longer being recorded in health-tracking systems, including ones focused on violent deaths and on risky behaviors by kids.",
      "Experts know transgender people are more likely to be victims of violence, but now \u201cit\u2019s going to be much more challenging to quantify the extent to which they are at higher risk,\u201d said Thomas Simon, the recently retired senior director for scientific programs at the CDC's Division of Violence Prevention.",
      "The staff and funding seems to have remained intact for a CDC data collection that provides insights into homicides, suicides and accidental deaths involving weapons.",
      "But CDC violence-prevention programs that acted on that information were halted. So, too, was work on a system that collects hospital data on nonfatal injuries from causes such as shootings, crashes and drownings.",
      "Also going away, apparently, is the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. The system is designed to pick up information that's not found in law enforcement statistics. Health officials see that work as important, because not all sexual violence victims go to police.",
      "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which tracks job-related illnesses and deaths and makes recommendations on how to prevent them, was gutted by the cuts.",
      "Kennedy has said that 20% of the people laid off might be reinstated as the agency tries to correct mistakes.",
      "That appeared to happen last month, when the American Federation of Government Employees said that NIOSH workers involved in a black lung disease program for coal miners had been temporarily called back.",
      "But HHS officials did not answer questions about the reinstatement. The AFGE's Micah Niemeier-Walsh later said the workers continued to have June termination dates and \u201cwe are concerned this is to give the appearance that the programs are still functioning, when effectively they are not.\u201d",
      "There's been no talk of salvaging some other NIOSH programs, including one focused on workplace deaths in the oil and gas industries or a research project into how common hearing loss is in that industry.",
      "The HHS cuts eliminated the 17-member team responsible for the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, one of the main ways the government measures drug use.",
      "Also axed were the CDC staff working on the National Youth Tobacco Survey.",
      "There are other surveys that look at youth smoking and drug use, including the University of Michigan's federally funded \u201cMonitoring the Future\u201d survey of schoolkids.",
      "But the federal studies looked at both adults and adolescents, and provided insights into drug use by high school dropouts. The CDC also delved into specific vaping and tobacco products in the ways that other surveys don't, and was a driver in the federal push to better regulate electronic cigarettes.",
      "\"There was overlap among the surveys, but each one had its own specific focus that the other ones didn\u2019t cover,\u201c said Richard Miech, who leads the Michigan study.",
      "Work to modernize data collection has been derailed. That includes an upgrade to a 22-year-old system that helps local public health departments track diseases and allows CDC to put together a national picture.",
      "Another casualty was the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which tries to predict disease trends.",
      "The center, created during the COVID-19 pandemic, was working on forecasting the current multi-state measles outbreak. That forecast hasn't been published partly because of the layoffs, according to two CDC officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss it and fear retribution for speaking to the press.",
      "Trump hasn't always supported widespread testing of health problems.",
      "In the spring of 2020, when COVID-19 diagnoses were exploding, the president groused that the nation\u2019s ability to do more testing was making the U.S. look like it had a worse problem than other countries. He called testing \u201ca double-edged sword.\u201d",
      "Mooney, the Johns Hopkins historian, wonders how interested the new administration is in reporting on health problems.",
      "\u201cYou could think it\u2019s deliberate,\" he said. \u201cIf you keep people from knowing, they\u2019re less likely to be concerned.\u201d",

      "It was an unusual study about trust, vaccines in a historically Black community.",
      "WASHINGTON -- Some Denver parents got texts during this winter\u2019s brutal flu season with videos sharing why people in their neighborhoods chose flu shots for their kids, an unusual study about trust and vaccines in a historically Black community.",
      "But no one will know how it worked out: The Trump administration canceled the project before the data could be analyzed -- and researchers aren\u2019t the only ones upset.",
      "\u201cFor someone like me, from the Black community who income-wise is on the lower end, we don\u2019t often have a voice,\u201d said Denver mom Chantyl Busby, one of the study\u2019s community advisers. \u201cHaving this funding taken away from this project sends a horrible, horrible message. It\u2019s almost like telling us all over again that our opinions don\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "How to talk about vaccines with parents \u2013 or anyone \u2013 is taking on new urgency: At least 216 U.S. children died of flu this season, the worst pediatric toll in 15 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unvaccinated children are fueling one of the country's largest measles outbreaks in decades, and another vaccine-preventable disease \u2014 whooping cough \u2014 is soaring, too.",
      "At the same time Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. questions vaccines long proven to be safe and effective. Moves by the Trump administration are making it increasingly uncertain that COVID-19 vaccines will be available this fall. And the administration has slashed funding for public health and medical research, including abruptly stopping studies of vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand what it is that is creating this challenge to vaccines and why,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy and worries the country is entering \u201cscientific dark ages.\"",
      "At Denver Health, Dr. Joshua Williams is a pediatrician who every day has vaccine conversations with confused or worried parents. Some even ask if they\u2019ll get kicked out of his practice for refusing immunizations.",
      "Nope, Williams says: Building trust takes time.",
      "\u201cThe most satisfying vaccine-related encounters I have are the ones in families who had significant concerns for a long time, came to trust me over the years as I cared for broken arms and ear infections \u2013 and ultimately vaccinated their child,\u201d he said.",
      "But in the TikTok age, Williams wondered if digital storytelling \u2013 seeing and hearing what led other families to choose vaccination \u2013 might help those decisions. He chose flu shots as the test case \u2014 just under half of U.S. children got one this season. And Black children are among those most at risk of getting seriously ill from influenza.",
      "With a grant from the National Institutes of Health, Williams partnered with Denver\u2019s nonprofit Center for African American Health to host workshops bringing volunteers together to discuss how influenza and the flu vaccine had impacted their lives. Professionals helped those who wanted to go the extra step turn them into 2- to 3-minute polished videos.",
      "After two years of community engagement, five of those videos were part of the pilot study sending text messages to 200 families who get care at two Denver Health clinics.",
      "In one video, a mother described getting her first flu vaccination along with her young daughter, making her own health decisions after leaving a controlling relationship.",
      "In another, a grandmother explained how she\u2019ll never again miss a vaccine appointment after her grandson spent his 4th birthday hospitalized with the flu.",
      "Seeing \u201cpeople that they look like, that they sound like, who have experiences they\u2019ve been through that can go, \u2018Hey, I felt like you felt but this changed my life,\u2019\u201d is powerful, said Busby, who OK'd her kids' flu vaccinations after questioning Williams during multiple family checkups.",
      "The study's sudden cancellation means Williams can\u2019t assess if the texted videos influenced families' vaccine decisions \u2013 lost data from more than two years of work and already-spent NIH dollars. It also jeopardizes the researchers' careers. While considering next steps, Williams has asked permission of community members to use some of the videos in his own practice as he discusses vaccination.",
      "Williams gets personal, too, telling families that his kids are vaccinated and how his 95-year-old grandmother reminisces about the terror of polio during her own childhood before those vaccinations were developed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost the collective memory about what it\u2019s like to have these diseases in our community,\u201d Williams said, ruefully noting the ongoing measles outbreak. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to take a collective voice from the community saying this is important, to remind those in power that we need to be allocating resources to infection prevention and vaccine hesitancy research.\u201d",

      "There are likely several contributors to this season's severity, but a big one is that fewer children get flu shots, added O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.",
      "The flu vaccination rate for U.S. children has plummeted from about 64% five years ago to 49% this season.",
      "Flu vaccinations may not prevent people from coming down with symptoms, but research shows they are highly effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths, O'Leary said, adding that the decline in vaccinations \u201cis certainly playing a role\" in this season's loss of life.",
      "The season has not only been hard on children. CDC officials have described it as \u201c highly severe,\u201d and estimate that so far there have been at least 47 million illnesses, 610,000 hospitalizations and 26,000 deaths this season.",

    "summary": "Kentucky is reporting a 30.2% drop in drug overdose deaths in 2024",
    "story": [
      "Kentucky is reporting a 30.2% drop in drug overdose deaths in 2024",
      "The number of overdose deaths in Kentucky last year dropped by 30.2% \u2014 down to 1,410 lives lost \u2014 giving state leaders a surge of confidence that prevention and treatment efforts are making progress against an addiction epidemic they say is shattering families across the state.",
      "This was the third straight yearly decrease in drug overdose deaths for the state, although prior declines were substantially smaller. Kentucky has long been plagued by high rates of addiction to opioid painkillers, and fatal overdoses surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when treatment was hard to get and people were socially isolated.",
      "Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who announced the latest overdose statistics on Thursday, called the results a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d reflecting years of painstaking work to combat the spread and use of drugs.",
      "\u201cThis is what we have been hoping for and praying for,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here ought to give everyone who\u2019s worked so hard to get to this point ... hope that we can do even more.\"",
      "State Attorney General Russell Coleman, a Republican, said Kentuckians should \u201crejoice in every life saved from this scourge,\u201d but warned that powerful illicit drugs like fentanyl continue to pose a threat.",
      "\"As little as one pill can and is killing our sons and daughters,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "Fentanyl and methamphetamine continued to be the most prevalent drugs contributing to overdose deaths in Kentucky.",
      "Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has steered huge sums of federal funding to his home state to combat its addiction woes, said he was encouraged by the gains in combating the drug crisis, from stemming the flow of illicit drugs to offering treatment services in communities.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always worked to keep Kentucky at the forefront of our national response to the drug crisis,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \"We are finally making progress in restoring the Southern Border, but there\u2019s still a lot of work left to do in the commonwealth to help those struggling with addiction.\u201d",
      "Kentucky's drop reflected broader gains achieved in the U.S. There were about 97,000 U.S. overdose deaths in the 12 months that ended last June 30, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was down 14% from the estimated 113,000 for the prior 12-month period.",
      "Overdose death rates nationwide began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and more recently fentanyl.",
      "Beshear, seen as a potential candidate for the White House in 2028, said plenty of groups were deserving of credit for Kentucky's big decline in overdose deaths. He praised law enforcement efforts to remove dangerous drugs from circulation and the work of addiction treatment centers and other recovery services. And he credited those Kentuckians battling addiction who reached out for help.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s your first, fifth or 10th attempt, we want to stand behind you,\" the governor said. \"We want to provide you the best help that we can.\u201d",
      "Other factors, he said, include the distribution of Narcan, which can reverse overdoses of opioids, as well as the availability of addiction services through Medicaid and the work of syringe exchange programs.",
      "\u201cRegardless of what the politics say, syringe exchange programs work,\" Beshear said. \"They help us get to know people and they help us to save lives.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Coleman has rolled out a youth-focused initiative aimed at keeping young people away from deadly substances.",
      "With all those efforts, the challenge now is to continue driving down fatal overdoses, Beshear said.",
      "\u201cIt ought to tell us that an epidemic that arose in our time, we should be able to defeat in our time,\u201d the governor said.",

      "BERLIN -- Germany's domestic intelligence agency said Thursday it will await a court ruling before moving forward with plans to classify the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party as a \u201c right-wing extremist \u201d movement, a step that could subject the party to broader surveillance and scrutiny of its activities.",
      "The announced pause comes after the party, known as AfD, filed a lawsuit in the western city of Cologne against the move by the intelligence service and the party's supporters alleged a politically motivated crackdown.",
      "German officials have denied that allegation and have faulted what they called the party's \u201congoing agitation\u201d against refugees and migrants.",
      "The AfD\u2019s co-leaders, Tino Chrupalla and Alice Weidel, responded in a joint statement saying the intelligence service\u2019s decision Thursday was \u201ca first important step\u201d that would help \u201ccounter the accusation of right-wing extremism.\u201d",
      "The pause by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution means that it cannot move forward with previous plans to use enhanced tools like video and audio surveillance, and use of informants, to scrutinize the activities of the AfD, which came second in parliamentary elections in February. It does not mean that the intelligence agency has dropped those plans for good.",
      "The decision, months in the making, came days before the new German government led by conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office on Tuesday \u2014 replacing the outgoing coalition led by the Social Democrats' Olaf Scholz.",
      "The intelligence agency cited a number of pronouncements by AfD officials, including statements like, \"Every additional foreigner in this country is one too many,\u201d the German news agency DPA reported.",
      "The U.S. administration has criticized the decision by the intelligence service, prompting a retort from the German Foreign Ministry.",
      "In a social media post last week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on Germany to undo the classification, saying the move to give new powers to the spy agency to watch the opposition amounted to \u201ctyranny in disguise.\u201d",
      "The German Foreign Ministry responded by saying the decision resulted from an independent investigation to protect Germany's Constitution and the rule of law.",

      "Iraq's prime minister is visiting Turkey as the two neighboring countries move forward with efforts to strengthen cooperation",
      "ANKARA, Turkey -- Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani arrived in Turkey on Thursday for talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as their two neighboring countries move forward with efforts to strengthen cooperation and repair previously tense ties.",
      "The talks in Ankara are expected to focus on a new peace effort between Turkey and a Kurdish militant group that has a foothold in Iraq, as well as water supplies to Iraq. Erdogan\u2019s office said that Turkish and Iraqi officials will ink a series of cooperation agreements during the visit.",
      "Relations between Turkey and Iraq were often strained over Turkish military incursions into northern Iraq for operations against the banned Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, and the establishment of Turkish military bases there. Baghdad frequently condemned the incursions as a violation of its sovereignty.",
      "More recently, however, the two countries have deepened cooperation on security, including addressing the PKK presence in northern Iraq. Erdogan visited Baghdad last year for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "Also last year, Iraq announced that the Iraqi National Security Council had issued a ban on the PKK, although it stopped short of designating it as a terrorist organization.",
      "The visit comes after the PKK\u2019s jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, called on his group to dissolve and disarm as part of a new peace initiative with Turkey. The group declared a unilateral ceasefire in March and is now expected to hold a congress in northern Iraq, during which it would announce its dissolution, Turkish officials have said.",
      "The PKK, which has maintained bases in northern Iraq\u2019s semiautonomous Kurdish region, has fought Turkey for an autonomous Kurdish state. The conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives since the 1980s. Turkey and its Western allies have designated the PKK a terrorist organization.",

      "The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, which provide most of Iraq\u2019s fresh water, originate in Turkey. Experts fear that climate change is likely to exacerbate existing water shortages in Iraq, with potentially devastating consequences.",

      "TOKYO -- The mayor of Nagasaki on Thursday announced that the city will invite representatives \u201cof all countries\u201d and regions to the peace memorial marking the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of the city.",
      "The invitation to the 157 countries and regions that have diplomatic missions in Japan will include Russia, Belarus and Israel, who were excluded last year.",
      "Mayor Shiro Suzuki said he wants all representatives to see the brutal consequences of atomic weapons use as a lesson at a time of growing divisions and conflicts.",
      "The United States dropped its second atomic bomb on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after the first bombing of Hiroshima, together killing more than 210,000 people. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, ending World War II and its nearly half-century of aggression across Asia.",
      "Suzuki said his city is returning to its \u201cfundamental purpose\u201d of the ceremony \u2014 to mourn the atomic bomb victims and pray for lasting world peace. \"We want to go beyond national borders, overcome ideological differences and any other divisions to have global representatives gather in Nagasaki.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cAt a time of worsening divisions of the international society, I feel more strongly than ever about the importance for representatives of all countries to participate in the Nagasaki peace memorial and learn the atrocious and inhumane outcomes of the nuclear weapons use through their own eyes, ears and hearts.\u201d",
      "Suzuki did not invite Israel to the 2024 anniversary, citing concern of \u201cunforeseeable situations\u201d such as violent protests over the war in Gaza disrupting the memorial. But Israel's exclusion drew criticisms and boycot by ambassadors from the U.S. and five other Group of Seven nations \u2014 Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the U.K. \u2014 and the European Union.",
      "Russia and its ally Belarus have not been invited to the Nagasaki memorial event since 2022 following Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",

      "ALGIERS, Algeria -- As Europe celebrates the 80th anniversary of its triumph over fascism and the end of World War II, Algeria is remembering a darker anniversary: the colonial-era massacres that erupted the same day.",
      "In a message this week, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune framed commemoration as a matter of national pride and called the event a prelude to Algeria\u2019s fight for independence.",
      "\u201cThe commemoration of May 8 reflects the Algerians\u2019 commitment to freedom and dignity, for which they took to the streets with bare hands to confront an enemy,\u201d Tebboune said, calling French colonialism \u201cgenocidal\u201d and a crime against humanity.",
      "More than 500,000 tirailleurs from North Africa, West Africa and Madagascar fought for France during WWII. Some volunteered, others were forcibly conscripted. Many lost their lives. Across the board, they were generally paid less than European soldiers.",
      "Many Algerian veterans believed their service would lead to greater rights. But when the war ended, Algerians who dared to demand them were met with repression and violence, even as French leader Gen. Charles De Gaulle exalted how \u201cthe cause of liberty and justice\u201d had prevailed in a radio broadcast throughout France and its colonies, including Algeria.",
      "On May 8, 1945, Algerians filled city streets in Ain Temouchent, Guelma, Kherrata and Setif, waving flags and reviving pre-war calls for independence. After demonstrators faced police fire, anti-French riots broke out, killing more than 100. France subsequently launched an air and ground offensive that killed thousands of Algerians \u2014 45,000, according to Algerian authorities, and around 3,000, according to French statistics.",
      "The war's ending sparked similar disenchantment in Britain\u2019s colonies in East and West Africa, where more than 375,000 men enlisted. Soldiers who returned home expecting to be rewarded for their service instead faced racism and a continued lack of political representation. Both helped fuel the subsequent Mau Mau rebellion against British rule in Kenya, during which tens of thousands were killed.",
      "In recent years, memorials there as well as in South Africa have honored the service of African veterans. Elsewhere, including in Senegal, they\u2019ve commemorated injustice and violence that many endured post-war.",
      "For many in Algeria, the May 8 massacres awakened the anger and resolve that later fueled Algeria\u2019s war for independence.",
      "\u201cThey understood that the only possible and unique path to independence was armed struggle,\u201d historian Mohamed Ferrad said in an interview this week.",
      "V-E Day events have been going all week in Europe, where leaders have focused on the plight of Ukraine in its fight against Russia and values such as freedom and democracy. French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to speak on similar topics on Thursday evening.",
      "Meanwhile, Algeria\u2019s Ministry of War Veterans is marking the anniversary with a series of nationwide events and panels featuring firsthand accounts from veterans and lectures from historians on the battle for independence after 132 years of French colonialism.",
      "The massacres have been debated in popular books and films in Algeria and France and are a recurring theme when tensions flare between the two countries.",
      "Tebboune and Macron announced a truth commission-style \u201cdossier de memoire\u201d in 2022, led by a committee of historians from both countries. However its activities have stalled as relations deteriorated over issues such as immigration and how France\u2019s juggles ties between Algeria and its regional rival Morocco.",
      "French leaders, including Macron, have called for truth and recognition but stopped short of fulfilling Algeria\u2019s demands for a formal state apology for the massacres.",
      "\u201cAlgeria will never allow the memory issue to be forgotten or used as a bargaining chip, out of loyalty to our martyrs,\u201d Tebboune wrote in his Wednesday letter.",
      "A delegation of around 30 French lawmakers from leftist and centrist parties arrived in Algiers on Wednesday to participate in the commemorations of the massacres.",

      "Nearly two-thirds of the European Parliament meeting in Strasbourg, France voted to change wolves' status from \u2018strictly protected\u2019 to \u2019protected' in a vote of 371 to 162, with 37 abstentions.",
      "Centrist and right-wing groups celebrated the vote.",
      "\u201cFarmers can now breathe a sigh of relief,\" said Herbert Dorfmann, a spokesperson for the European People\u2019s Party, a coalition of center-right groups in the EU. Right-wing Dutch politician Sander Smit said on Twitter: \u201cThis is fantastic news.\"",
      "Environmental groups criticized the decision as politically motivated rather than scientifically grounded.",
      "\u201cThis is a sad day for biodiversity and wild animals,\u201d said L\u00e9a Badoz at the Eurogroup for Animals. Joanna Swabe, a spokesperson for Humane World for Animals, called for individual governments to increase national protection for wolves.",
      "Politician Jutta Paulus from the parliament's Greens party said the campaign to reduce the wolves' protection \u201cborrows from the Donald Trump playbook\u201d and \u201cignores scientific evidence and attacks legislation which has been proven to work for decades for no clear gain other than the scoring of cheap populistic points.\"",
      "Tuesday's vote was the final real hurdle before the measure becomes EU law. The change to the central Habitats Directive law will now likely be passed swiftly by the European Council and enter into force across the 27 member states.",
      "Once deemed necessary to combat threats to the apex predator, restrictions on hunting wolves have over the past few years lost public support as many EU environmental rules and regulations have come under pressure in recent years. Populist and extreme-right parties have criticized the measures as being thought up by urban elites with little knowledge of rural life.",
      "Farmers in many member states have been increasingly angered by attacks on livestock by packs of wolves that have thrived in woods and fields close to agricultural land.",
      "The political movement to ease rules on killing wolves was given top-level support by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. An ardent fan of horses, von der Leyen had a pony Dolly that was killed by a wolf three years ago.",
      "Last year, more than 50 European nations from Turkey to Iceland voted to change the biodiversity treaty known as the Bern Convention to curtail protections for wolves.",
      "Experts and environmental groups estimate there could be up to 19,000 wolves across Europe, with large populations thought to roam in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Poland, Romania and Spain. After nearly being wiped out in the 20th century, their numbers are estimated to have grown by at least 25% over the last decade.",
      "Programs around the world to protect wolves have been shown to benefit local ecosystems. Yellowstone National Park in the United States said reintroducing wolves in 1995 had led to a better regulated food chain that helped drive a bump in forest cover and animal populations. Yet American states like Wyoming and Montana have passed similar bills allowing for more killing of wolves, driven as in Europe by politics mixing agitated farmers and safety concerns.",
      "\u201cWolves are vital to healthy ecosystems, but today\u2019s vote treats them as a political problem, not an ecological asset\u201d, said Ilaria Di Silvestre, Director of Policy and Advocacy for Europe at International Fund for Animal Welfare. \u201cThe EU was once proud to lead on nature protection. Now we are seeing vital species like the wolf sacrificed for short-term political interests that will benefit no one.\u201d",

      "Jurors have begun deliberating in the case of two men charged with cutting down the Sycamore Gap tree in northern England",
      "LONDON -- Jurors began deliberating Thursday in the case of two men charged with cutting down the Sycamore Gap tree that once stood along the ancient Hadrian's Wall in northern England.",
      "Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, have pleaded not guilty to two counts each of criminal damage. The former friends each testified that they were at their separate homes that night and not involved.",
      "Justice Christina Lambert told jurors in Newcastle Crown Court to take as long as they need to reach unanimous verdicts in the trial that began April 28.",
      "The tree was not Britain\u2019s biggest or oldest, but it was prized for its picturesque setting along the ancient wall built by Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 122 to protect the northwest frontier of the Roman Empire.",
      "The tree was long known to locals but achieved international fame in Kevin Costner\u2019s 1991 film \u201cRobin Hood: Prince Of Thieves.\u201d It sat symmetrically between two hills along the historic wall and was a draw for tourists, landscape photographers and those taking selfies for social media.",
      "Prosecutors said the tree's value exceeded 620,000 pounds ($830,000) and damage to the wall, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was assessed at 1,100 pounds.",
      "Prosecutor Richard Wright told jurors in his closing argument that the men cut the tree down for \u201ca bit of a laugh\u201d in the dark of night during a blustery storm on Sept. 28, 2023, but had failed to realize the outrage they would spark in the \"arboreal equivalent of mindless thuggery.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey woke up the morning after and soon realized \u2014 as the news media rolled in, as the outrage of the public became clear \u2014 it must have dawned on them that they couldn\u2019t see anyone else smiling,\u201d Wright said. \u201cFar from being the big men they thought they were, everyone else thought that they were rather pathetic.\u201d",
      "The two men had once been best friends. But during the trial Graham blamed Carruthers and another man for cutting down the tree, saying they tried to frame him by taking his car to the scene of the crime and using his phone to shoot video of the tree being cut down.",
      "Andrew Gurney, a lawyer for Carruthers, said Graham\u2019s story didn\u2019t add up and he was projecting his guilt on his former friend.",
      "\u201cIs that a plausible chain of events or is that the desperate story of a man caught out?\u201d Gurney said.",
      "Wright mocked the duo's defense, saying common sense and a trail of evidence should lead jurors to convict them for their \u201cmoronic mission.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors showed grainy video from Graham\u2019s phone of the tree being cut down \u2014 a video sent shortly afterward to Carruthers' phone. Metadata showed it was taken at the tree's location in Northumberland National Park. Data showed Graham's Range Rover had traveled there.",
      "Wright said he couldn't say who cut the tree and who held the phone, but the two were the only people in the world who had the video on their devices.",
      "Text and voice messages exchanged the following day between Carruthers and Graham captured their excitement as the story went viral.",

      "Another 83 vultures that were rescued from the site and transported for treatment by helicopter or a special vulture ambulance were recovering.",
      "The mass poisoning was one of the worst seen in the famous Kruger National Park in northern South Africa, said SANParks, the national parks agency.",
      "Vultures are key to wildlife ecosystems because of the clean up work they do feeding on the carcasses of dead animals. But that also makes them especially vulnerable to poisoning by poachers, either intentionally or as a result of the killing of other animals. Hundreds of vultures typically feed on a carcass.",

      "His comments came as Ukraine\u2019s parliament unanimously approved a landmark minerals deal with the U.S. Ratification is a key step in setting in motion a deal which will allow Washington access to Ukraine\u2019s largely untapped minerals, deepen strategic ties and create a joint investment fund with the U.S. for the reconstruction of Ukraine.",

      "New Zealand is still one of a few countries in the world where sheep outnumber people",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- The vast number of sheep in New Zealand relative to the country\u2019s scant human population has long been the subject of jokes aimed at New Zealanders abroad. It\u2019s true: The country is one of a handful in the world that\u2019s still home to more sheep than people.",
      "But humans are catching up, according to new figures released Tuesday. With a population of 23.6 million sheep and 5.3 million people, there are about 4.5 sheep for each New Zealander, government statistics agency data showed.",
      "That\u2019s down from 22 sheep per person in 1982, when farming sheep for meat and wool was New Zealand\u2019s biggest earner. Now, years of falling wool prices prompted by a global shift to synthetic fibers have led farmers to change what they do with their land, the sector\u2019s biggest lobby group said.",
      "By land area, New Zealand is about the size of the United Kingdom, but it has a human population 13 times smaller than the U.K. That means there\u2019s plenty of room for sheep.",
      "For close to 150 years, the sheep industry was the backbone of New Zealand\u2019s economy and numbers boomed \u2014 peaking in 1982 when there were more than 70 million sheep and just 3.2 million people. Before \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d brought waves of tourists to the country, images of green fields filled with placid sheep against backdrops of snow-capped mountains dominated the country\u2019s marketing abroad.",
      "But over years of decline for global wool prices since \u2014 and despite recent rallies \u2014 the national flock has steadily diminished. Now dairy holds the biggest share of New Zealand\u2019s agriculture and horticulture-dominant export market.",
      "In 2023, Stats NZ, a government agency, said New Zealand in 2022 dipped below five sheep per person for the first time. The national flock had lost a million more sheep in Tuesday\u2019s figures, which recorded livestock numbers as of June 2024.",
      "Toby Williams, a spokesperson for sector lobby group Federated Farmers, said sheep farmers have switched to more lucrative pursuits \u2014 dairy, or the conversion of land from farming to pine forestry in order to sell carbon offsets.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m really honest, the wool industry is almost at that tipping point, if not already there, of not having a wool industry anymore,\u201d he said.",
      "The government has drawn up measures intended to slow the decline, including an announcement in 2024 that they will place limits on the scale of farmland that can be converted to carbon forestry.",
      "New government procurement guidelines launched in April urge the use of New Zealand wool products \u2014 such as carpets and insulation \u2014 in newly constructed or refurbished public buildings. But those measures are not expected to halt declining sheep numbers.",
      "Some sheep-farming countries are recording similar trends. New Zealand\u2019s closest neighbor Australia \u2014 the source of most of the sheep jokes about New Zealanders \u2014 is also home to more sheep than people, but the national flock is shrinking there too.",
      "The gap is slimmer: There are about three sheep per Australian.",

      "A large TV screen displayed images from St. Peter\u2019s Square and the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, where 133 cardinals were casting the first votes for pope, as locals in the Veneto town of Schiavon, near Vicenza, quaffed glasses of wine.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re waiting, and we\u2019re rooting for him,\u2019\u2019 said Giacomo Bonora, raising a glass of the local favorite, a red wine spritz, and using the local nickname for Parolin, \u201cDon Piero.\"",
      "Bonora said that when Parolin returns to the town of 2,600, he asks to be called \u201cDon Piero,\" the way a parish priest would be addressed, using the Veneto dialect for Pietro, rather than \u201ceminence,'' a cardinal's honorific.",
      "Parolin, 70, is a veteran diplomat who was Francis\u2019 secretary of state, essentially the Holy See\u2019s prime minister and No. 2 to the pope.",
      "Outside, a city worker stopped to show the parish sacristan a photo of Parolin when the town celebrated his elevation to secretary of state 12 years ago. Everyone is hopeful, but officials have been instructed not to speak to the media until a new pope is elected.",
      "Angelo Cisalto, the sacristan at the town's St. Margherita parish church, was heading home to keep an eye on the smoke coming out of the chimney.",
      "If it is white, it is his job to go and ring the church bells. Cisalto, 84, remembers Parolin as a child, 14 years his junior, and always devout. \u201cHe used to dress up as an altar boy, and at home, in his garage, he had a little altar,\u2019\u2019 where he would play saying Mass, Cisalto recalled. \u201cHe is a very good, very humble person.\"",
      "Back at Caff\u00e8 Centrale, clients ordered plates of cold cuts as the closed meeting of cardinals dragged on long past the expected hour. TV reporters whose air times had passed headed out for the night. Finally, black smoke emerged.",
      "\u201cTomorrow, we'll do it again,\u201d Bonora said.",
      "Locals recalled that Parolin came regularly to Schiavon before his mother died last summer. His father died when he was 10, and he entered the seminary in nearby Vicenza at 14. For a period, he was a parish priest in the foothills town of Schio before joining the Vatican's diplomatic corps.",
      "While closely associated with Francis\u2019 pontificate, Parolin is much more demure in personality and diplomatic in his approach to leading than the Argentine Jesuit he served \u2014 and he knows where the Catholic Church might need a course correction. Many see him as embodying Francis' pastoral message while being more open to conservative points of view. While his career has been spent in Italy, his job as a Vatican diplomat has seen him travel the world, giving him a global perspective.",
      "If he were elected, he would return an Italian to the papacy after three successive outsiders: St. John Paul II (Poland), Pope Benedict XVI (Germany) and Francis (Argentina).",

      "\u201cPeace is priceless, and war has no winners. History has taught us that no matter the driving reason or ideology, military aggression against another country is an unjust crime that is bound to fail,\" Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te told diplomats in Taipei.",
      "\u201cAuthoritarianism and aggression lead only to slaughter, tragedy, and greater inequality,\u201d he added.",
      "Turning more directly to China's threats, Lai said that both Taiwan and Europe were \u201cnow facing the threat of a new authoritarian bloc.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are seeing our decades-old undersea cables, crucial for communications and cybersecurity, being sabotaged. We are seeing external interference in our elections, crucial for healthy democratic development, through the spread of misinformation and disinformation, sowing intentional division in society. We are seeing our fair, free and open international rules-based markets being tested by all manner of gray-zone activities, dumping, pressures and intrusions,\u201d Lai said.",
      "Lai's remarks came during Taiwan's first-ever official commemoration of VE Day and at a time when Taiwan is making a diplomatic push for closer ties with fellow democracies that nevertheless have no formal ties with the island in deference to Beijing. Former President Tsai Ing-wen is visiting Lithuania and Denmark from Friday, while Foreign Affairs Minister Lin Chia-lung is visiting Texas.",
      "China fought alongside the Allies in Asia during World War II and received some military assistance from the then-USSR.",
      "China claims Taiwan as part of its territory to be annexed by force if necessary and says it has no right to international recognition. Just 12 countries, mostly small island nations in the South Pacific and Caribbean, have official diplomatic ties with Taiwan.",
      "Lai said that those who cherish peace \u201ccannot sit idly by and allow aggression. The outbreak of the war in Europe certainly had much to do with an authoritarian regime seeking to satisfy its expansionary ambitions, but its wider spread throughout Europe had much more to do with a lack of vigilance toward acts of aggression.\u201d",
      "China's Xi, who has said Taiwan's absorption by his authoritarian Communist regime is inevitable, was meanwhile being lauded by Russian President Vladimir Putin as \u201cour main guest\u201d at the Victory Day festivities. The Russian leader noted that he and Xi would discuss bilateral and global issues at their summit in Moscow.",
      "Xi is visiting for four days at a time when fighting with Ukraine, which Russia invaded more than three years ago, has closed airports in the Moscow region. The two leaders will also discuss Russia\u2019s supply of oil and gas to China, as well as cooperation within BRICS \u2014 the bloc of developing economies that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa but has since expanded to more countries.",
      "Putin and Xi have met over 40 times as their governments align their foreign policies to challenge the Western-led liberal democratic world order.",
      "China has offered strong diplomatic support to Moscow since the 2022 invasion and has emerged as a top market for Russian oil and gas, helping fill the Kremlin\u2019s war chest. Russia also has relied on China as the main source of machinery and electronics to keep its drones and other parts of its military machine running after Western sanctions curtailed high-tech supplies.",
      "Beijing hasn\u2019t provided weapons to use in Ukraine, but has backed the Kremlin diplomatically, blaming Western threats against Russia\u2019s security for sparking the war. China also has strongly condemned Western sanctions against Moscow, while Russia has consistently voiced support for Beijing on issues related to Taiwan.",
      "Taiwan's government is the inheritor to the Nationalist regime of Chiang Kai-shek, which battled Japanese invaders throughout the 1930s and up to the war's end in 1945. It was ultimately driven from China by Mao Zedong's Communist forces in 1949 and has since transitioned to a full democracy with strong but unofficial ties to the U.S., the EU, Japan and other industrialized democracies.",

Its staff includes Katie Wiles, the daughter of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, who along with LaCivita, led Trump\u2019s campaign. Katie Wiles is not involved with the client.",
      "Foreign consulting has long been a popular way for U.S. strategists from both parties to rake in cash between election cycles. But Berisha\u2019s decision to lean on Trump hands \u2014 and to highlight their involvement \u2014 makes clear how valuable they can be to candidates trying to harness populist sentiment and replicate Trump\u2019s rise. In Albania, like many other countries, being seen as having close ties to the U.S. and its leaders is also considered a major asset.",
      "Rama has his own connections with Trump allies. In December, Rama\u2019s Cabinet approved entering into negotiations with Atlantic Incubation Partners LLC, owned by Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, for development of a $1.6 billion luxury resort on the small island of Sazan.",
      "The Strategic Investment Committee awarded Kushner's company the status of strategic investor for 10 years.",
      "Throughout the campaign, Berisha has cast himself as a Trump-like figure and the victim of a politically motivated scheme that he blames in part on the U.S. billionaire George Soros, a booster of liberal causes around the world and longtime foil of conservatives.",
      "He launched his campaign with a promise to \u201cMake Albania Great Again,\u201d but later had to change the slogan amid concerns that it could be misinterpreted as a reference to \u201cgreater Albania\u201d and spark confrontation in the western Balkans over fears some in neighboring countries have about Albanian expansionism.",
      "The campaign now vows to make Albania \u201cgrandiose\": \u201cmadheshtore\u201d instead of \u201ce madhe.\"",
      "Like Trump, Berisha also has his own signature campaign hat \u2014 a blue one that features the No. 1, the Democrats' ranking on the ballot.",
      "While recent elections in Canada and Australia have demonstrated the power of backlash against candidates deemed too aligned with Trump, in other countries those ties have been a major boon. In Argentina, Javier Milei swept to power with a \u201cMake Argentina Great Again\u201d slogan and Trumpian flair.",
      "And in El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele has become one of Trump's strongest allies, agreeing to detain U.S. deportees in his country's notorious terrorism megaprison.",

      "Albania\u2019s Democratic Party and U.S. Republicans are \u201cnatural allies,\u201d they added, since both are \u201cagainst the woke culture and support family and free market too.\u201d",

      "Rama, the Socialist Party leader, derisively calls Berisha a \u201cswamp owl\u201d and frequently criticizes the Americans' involvement, with LaCivita even featured in a negative ad.",
      "The Democrats have not disclosed how much LaCivita is paid, but said \u201chis payment was done in line with the law and the election rules, here in Albania and in America\u201d and that the contract would eventually be made public.",
      "LaCivita has stressed he is being paid solely to advise the party and that he is not lobbying officials in the U.S.",
      "Manafort, they said, is part of LaCivita\u2019s team as \u201ca friend and collaborator, and he has been in Tirana at that capacity.\"",
      "Manafort was charged in 2017 by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team with, among other things, concealing from the U.S. government lucrative political lobbying work he\u2019d performed on behalf of a pro-Russia party in Ukraine. He was convicted of multiple financial crimes and sentenced to prison but ultimately pardoned by Trump.",
      "In addition to the campaign help, in late April the Democrats signed a $250,000-a-month lobbying contract with U.S.-based Continental Strategy to help them establish relationships in the executive and legislative branches, and to promote democracy, anti-corruption initiatives and governmental reforms, according to the company\u2019s filing with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.",

      "The arrangement has raised eyebrows in Albania and triggered an investigation by Albania\u2019s SPAK, the Special Structure Against Corruption and Organized Crime.",
      "The firm is being paid by the \u201cMake Albania Great Again Foundation,\" a newly created nonprofit founded by Nuredin Seci, an Albanian American contractor from New Jersey, with what is supposed to be money collected from the Albanian-American community.",
      "Seci did not respond to questions about the foundation and where the funding had come from sent to his Facebook account. Numbers and an email address associated with Seci appear to have been disconnected.",
      "Melissa Stone, a spokesperson for Continental, said, \u201cOur work is being funded by an American-Albanian businessman and active leader in the Albanian-America diaspora who loves America and loves Albania.\u201d",

      "\u201cAs part of our work to improve bilateral relations between Albania and the United States, we are actively petitioning the Trump Administration to launch a full-scale review and reversal of the Biden-era weaponization of Section 7031(c) against conservative, pro-American leaders, including President Sali Berisha,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "In May 2021, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken sanctioned Berisha for alleged \u201csignificant corruption\u201d and barred him and his wife and children from entering the U.S.",
      "Britain did the same a year later.",
      "Blinken said that during Berisha\u2019s 2005-2013 tenure as prime minister, the politician \u201cwas involved in corrupt acts, such as misappropriation of public funds and interfering with public processes, including using his power for his own benefit and to enrich his political allies and his family members,\" which Berisha denies.",
      "Last year, Berisha was charged with corruption for an alleged scheme in which he helped his son-in-law privatize public land to build apartment buildings in the capital, Tirana. The trial has yet to start.",

      "Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said the group\u2019s movements were negotiated with the government and further alleged that one of the six people who entered the Argentine ambassador\u2019s residence in March left the compound in August, contradicting earlier statements from the opposition.",

      "The government of Argentine President Javier Milei allowed the six people into the ambassador\u2019s residence when authorities loyal to Venezuela\u2019s ruling party issued warrants for their arrest, accusing them of promoting acts of violence to destabilize the country. The group included the campaign manager and communications director of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado as well as Fernando Martinez, a cabinet minister in the 1990s.",

      "After Rubio\u2019s announcement Tuesday, Machado thanked people involved in what she called an \u201cimpeccable and epic operation for the Freedom of five heroes of Venezuela.\u201d But Cabello alleged that only four people remained at the embassy after Martinez\u2019s departure.",
      "Since late November, the group had denounced the constant presence of intelligence service agents and police outside the residence. It had also accused the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of cutting electricity and water services to the compound. The government denied the allegations.",
      "\u201cThey put on their show, and in the end, they ended up negotiating,\u201d Cabello said Wednesday during his weekly show on state television.",
      "Cabello did not offer details of the group's movements to reach the U.S. But he alleged that Machado negotiated with the government to allow her mother to leave the country, which he said she did so Monday via a commercial airplane headed to Colombia's capital, Bogota.",
      "Machado, who was last seen in public in January, did not immediately respond to Cabello's allegations.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government routinely targeted its real or perceived opponents ahead of last year\u2019s presidential election, and its crackdown on dissent only increased after the country\u2019s National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared him the winner despite credible evidence to the contrary.",
      "The election results announced by the Electoral Council sparked protests across the country to which the government responded with force and ended with more than 20 people dead. They also prompted an end to diplomatic relations between Venezuela and various foreign countries, including Argentina.",

    "story": [
      "Brazil\u2019s Amazon state of Rondonia has passed a law in favor of cattle ranchers who converted a large area of rainforest inside the Jaci-Parana conservation zone and turned it into pasture",
      "SAO PAULO, Brazil -- With little fanfare and virtually no publicity, lawmakers in the Brazilian state of Rondonia have passed legislation in favor of hundreds of cattle ranchers who had illegally converted swathes of Amazon rainforest into pasture land.",
      "The new legislation, which was passed April 28 and took effect immediately, also grants amnesty to slaughterhouses that purchased cattle illegally raised inside what had been the Jaci-Parana conservation area, which the new law effectively dissolves.",
      "\u201cAll fines, notices of violation and other administrative penalties tied to the occupation and use of the area are automatically voided and carry no legal or financial consequences,\u201d declared the law.",
      "One of the beneficiaries of the amnesty is likely to be JBS SA, the world\u2019s largest meatpacker, which is poised to start selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange in June. According to a 2023 audit by Brazil\u00b4s Federal Prosecution Service, 12% of cattle purchased by JBS in Rondonia came from illegally deforested areas.",
      "In exchange for the amnesty, cattle ranchers must join Rondonia's environmental regularization program, which requires them to halt deforestation and submit a plan to reforest part of the area. The law does not give them the public land, but allows it to be used under concession for 30 years. They will also be allowed to sell cattle, despite a law forbidding commercial cattle in Brazil's protected areas. Around 216,000 head graze on pasture there, according to the state animal division.",
      "\u201cThe law is an affront. If it\u2019s not declared unconstitutional, it will pose one of the greatest threats to the protection of all conservation areas facing land invasions,\u201d said Wellington Lamburgini, a coordinator with the local chapter of the Pastoral Land Commission, a nonprofit affiliated with the Catholic Church. \u201cIt sends the message that this crime is tolerated and will eventually be legalized.\u201d",
      "State lawmaker Lu\u00eds do Hospital, who sponsored the bill, Alex Redano, president of the state parliament, and JBS all declined to comment.",
      "The expectation that illegally used land will become sanctioned has been the main driver of deforestation in the Amazon.",
      "Land-grabbers clear land in hopes it will eventually be legalized due to lax land laws or government amnesties. In most cases, the forest is cleared for pasture to show economic activity.",
      "In recent years, Rondonia\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office, state prosecutor\u2019s office and environmental agency have fined and prosecuted hundreds of cattle ranchers and four slaughterhouses for causing damage inside the Jaci-Parana conservation area, where large-scale cattle raising is forbidden.",
      "Fines and pending legal settlements total $280 million \u2014 a fraction of the more than $1 billion in damages estimated by Rondonia state. Many of the 778 identified land invaders have never been prosecuted. While several have been convicted, most have escaped punishment due to legal loopholes.",
      "The state prosecutor's office told The Associated Press it is considering appealing the new law.",
      "The attorney general's office declined to comment.",
      "In December 2023, the state's attorney sued JBS and three other slaughterhouses for buying cattle raised in Jaci-Parana. Months later, two of the slaughterhouses \u2014 Distriboi and Frigon \u2014 were ordered, along with three cattle ranchers, to pay $764,000 for causing environmental damage. Neither company responded to requests for comment.",
      "JBS is facing three lawsuits pending trial. In one of them, the company argued that it has an environmental monitoring program that has blocked over 20,000 farms in Rondonia alone, according to the company\u2019s defense included in the court filings. It also states that the lawsuit is based on purchasing only 73 heads of cattle, representing 0.0006% of the company\u00b4s purchases in the state.",
      "According to the company, the transaction, which took place 12 years ago, involved fraud from the cattle rancher, as he used geographic coordinates outside the Jaci-Parana reserve to make the sale appear legal. The producer has since been blocked from further sales.",
      "\u201cThe mere existence of this lawsuit \u2014 even if ultimately unsuccessful \u2014 could cause immeasurable harm to JBS and, by extension, to Brazil\u2019s economy, to which the company contributes significantly, accounting for roughly 2.1% of the national GDP,\" the company said in court filings.",
      "In a statement to AP, the meatpacker said that starting Jan. 1, 2026, it will only buy cattle from producers enrolled in its Transparent Livestock Platform, which allows ranchers to register information about their own suppliers, who will also be subject to JBS\u2019s socio-environmental compliance criteria.",
      "Last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the listing of JBS on the New York Stock Exchange despite strong opposition from environmental groups.",

      "BELEM, Brazil -- In the run-up to the annual U.N. climate conference, set to take place in Brazil\u2019s Amazon in November, the construction of a road is drawing attention, with critics arguing it will lead to environmental degradation.",
      "Before the talks, called COP30, the state government of Para is building a 13-kilometer (8-mile) avenue designed to ease traffic on a major highway that runs parallel.",
      "The road was planned long before Belem, a metropolitan area of 2.5 million people that sits on the edge of the Amazon, was chosen as conference host. That hasn't spared it sharp criticism, however, because the road is expected to cut across the last remnants of rainforest in Belem.",
      "Road building in the Amazon, which historically has often led to deforestation and development of surrounding areas, also stands in stark contrast to a central aim of climate conferences, and in particular this one: conservation of biodiversity.",
      "Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who has made the slowing of deforestation a central focus of his administration, has frequently boasted that this will be the first such conference in the Amazon rainforest.",
      "The Amazon is key to regulating the climate, because trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that heats the planet when released into the atmosphere.",

It was designated in 1993 to protect two lakes, a river basin and to restore a degraded rainforest. However, its rules allow private properties, government-approved deforestation and public works. Two university campuses are located within its limits.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week despite heightened uncertainty about how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will impact the U.S. and global economies.",
      "Jobless claim applications fell by 13,000 to 228,000 for the week ending May 3, the Labor Department said Thursday. That\u2019s in line with the 229,000 new applications analysts forecast.",
      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have mostly bounced around a healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since COVID-19 decimated the economy and wiped out millions of jobs.",
      "Even though Trump has paused or pulled back on many of his tariff threats, concerns remain about a global economic slowdown that could upend the U.S. labor market, which has been a pillar of the American economy for years.",
      "On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve held its benchmark lending rate at 4.3% for the third straight meeting, after cutting it three times in a row at the end of last year.",
      "Fed chair Jerome Powell said the risks of both higher unemployment and inflation have risen, an unusual combination that complicates the central bank\u2019s dual mandate of controlling prices and keeping unemployment low.",
      "Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment but that data has not yet shown significant harm to the economy.",
      "A contraction has already begun in the U.S., where the economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March as Trump\u2019s trade wars disrupted business. First-quarter growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the United States tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s massive tariffs went into effect.",
      "It was the first quarterly GDP decline in three years.",
      "Like his pledge to institute tariffs, Trump\u2019s promise to drastically downsize the federal government workforce has occupied much of the early weeks of his presidency and is still in motion.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when the job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 or \u201cDOGE,\u201d spearheaded by Elon Musk \u2014 will surface in the weekly layoffs data. However, the federal government staff reductions are already being felt, even outside of the Washington, D.C. area.",
      "Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains robust with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.",
      "Last week the government reported that U.S. employers added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April. The unemployment rate held at a historically healthy 4.2%, however, many economists anticipate that a negative impact from trade wars will materialize this year for American workers.",
      "Companies that have announced job cuts this year include Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta.",
      "The Labor Department reported that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week gyrations, inched up by 1,000 to 227,000.",
      "The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of April 26 fell to 1.88 million, a decrease of 29,000.",

      "Melinda French Gates entered some of the most powerful circles while leading the foundation she co-founded with her ex-husband, Bill Gates.",
      "She petitioned heads of state and convened other billionaires. Along with Gates, she won the trust of one of America's most admired investors, Warren Buffett, who has given more than $43 billion to the former couple's foundation.",

The foundation changed its name from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation after her departure.",
      "At an ELLE Women of Impact event in New York in April, which also launched her new memoir, French Gates said she left, in part, to respond to the U.S. rollback of women\u2019s rights.",
      "\u201cI thought, I want to be much more nimble than this, and I want to be able to set the agenda by myself without having to ask anybody else, and do it with my partners,\u201d she said.",
      "French Gates offered written responses to The Associated Press' questions about the foundation\u2019s 25th anniversary and its decision to close in 2045. She said the former couple had always intended to spend down their resources.",
      "\u201cUltimately, though,\" she wrote, \u201cthe timeline was Bill\u2019s decision to make with the board of trustees.\u201d",
      "The following responses have been edited for length.",
      "A: To me, the greatest measure of success would be if long after the foundation closed, someone, somewhere, was living a life that looked different because we existed. We talked a lot there about unlocking virtuous cycles. I like to think that right now, the foundation\u2019s work is contributing to a child getting a vaccine or a woman opening her first bank account \u2014 and that decades from now, their families and communities are going to continue to look different, because of what that child and that woman unlocked for the people around them.",
      "A: I was excited for us to launch the Giving Pledge because I believe that the most responsible thing to do with great wealth is give it away \u2014 and that you have an obligation to society to give it away as effectively as possible. I think it\u2019s important for people in that position to set norms around giving generously and to learn as much as possible from each other about how to be effective in their philanthropy.",
      "(As for gender), for too long, global health and development efforts treated women and girls as secondary \u2014 if they were considered at all. Data wasn\u2019t collected on their experiences. Their specific health needs were often ignored.",
      "There were so many questions that needed to be asked: What is the cost of all the unpaid labor women do at home? Will mobile banking make a difference if women don\u2019t have equal access to cellphones? Why are so many infectious diseases especially dangerous for women?",
      "We opened a gender equality division, but not just that \u2014 we made gender equality a priority across all of our work. And we put a lot of resources into expanding access to contraception, starting with a big commitment we made in 2012.",
      "A: When you\u2019re doing this kind of work, it doesn\u2019t take long to see that solutions that seem great on paper may not work in reality. We funded community toilets in India that people \u2014 especially women \u2014wouldn\u2019t use because they were dangerous to go to at night. We funded vaccines in Vietnam that had to be kept cold, but came in packaging that didn\u2019t fit into the small refrigerators most people had there. We funded a simple pump to help East African farmers irrigate their land, but women \u2014 who account for half of all smallholder farmers \u2014 wouldn\u2019t buy it, because they didn\u2019t want to be seen swaying their hips in the way the pump required.",
      "There are many ways to learn about the cultural norms and logistical issues that determine whether a solution is feasible \u2014 and they all boil down to engaging people with local knowledge and lived experience, and trusting what they tell you.",
      "A: It\u2019s easy for people to forget \u2014 or maybe they didn\u2019t ever know \u2014 how hopeless the situation seemed around the year 2000, when malaria, tuberculosis and HIV were totally out of control. Since then, efforts funded, in large part, by development aid have saved more than 65 million lives from those diseases alone.",
      "No doubt the work has just gotten a lot harder, but we never thought it was going to be easy. And we still have the key ingredients of success. The pipeline of innovations has never been stronger. More lower-income countries are taking a leading role. As some donors announce cuts, others are stepping up.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s still a little bit more that goes to the kids and some portion that, you know, I won\u2019t be wanting for anything for my consumption,\u201d Gates said. Even his climate-related investments, \u201call of the profits that come from that work go into the Gates Foundation.\u201d",
      "In interviews with The Associated Press, Gates spoke about the foundation\u2019s past work and future goals. His responses have been edited for length.",
      "\u201cI hope other people wallop me. Even today, there\u2019s probably a dozen people richer than I am, because I don\u2019t count the money that I\u2019ve already got in the foundation. I have just a bit over $100 billion outside of the foundation. I\u2019d love to be beat in all of this work. Somebody should try and pay more taxes than I did, and save more lives than I did, and give more money than I did, and be smarter than I\u2019ve been.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think 20 years is the right balance between giving as much as we can to make progress on these things and giving people a lot of notice that now this money will be gone. It will be spent. Hopefully, many of these diseases are eradicated, so nobody even knows, \u2018What was malaria? What was polio?\u2019 in the years ahead. You know, some foundations, if they\u2019ve been around 50 or 60 years, who knows how their work relates to the intent of the person who started that foundation? And I do think there\u2019ll be more rich people in the future than there are today. So yes, it will create a vacuum in 20 years, and we\u2019re letting people know way in advance that\u2019s what this will look like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s by some measures the most generous gift ever given and a real vote of confidence from Warren, who\u2019s a great friend and has always given me phenomenal advice and is very driven by these inequity issues. And that was in 2006, and so it\u2019s two years later that I give up my full-time work at Microsoft, and I move over. And I\u2019ve been full time at the foundation since 2008 for the rest of my life. It\u2019s my final, second career. You know, Warren, it\u2019s hard to overstate the impact he\u2019s had on me.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was a big hope, that the societal expectation for anybody who has a lot of money would be that they give the majority of it away, and that basically everyone would join into that. Now, we\u2019re not at that level, but I think year by year, people are saying, \u2018Hey, the fairness of this system, the legitimacy of this system really benefits if those who both through skill and luck, the system has rewarded them, that they put a lot of their resources and even, some of their time and energy into improving society.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cMany things now are making it less clear how much progress we\u2019ll make in these 20 years we have remaining. The donors are being somewhat less generous as they feel squeezed by an aging population and demands for Ukraine, both refugee costs, defense costs, a lot of things. And so telling the story of the success and the moral and geopolitical value of taking 1% of rich country budgets and saying, \u2018No, this is to save lives for very, very, very little money.\u2019 We\u2019re going to have to renew people\u2019s understanding and prioritization of these things in order to keep that piece. We have a lot of things we\u2019re optimistic about because we have new tools, new ways of protecting women from getting HIV, new ways of killing mosquitoes... And so it\u2019s incredible to come up with these low-cost things and tragic if we can\u2019t get them out to everyone who needs them. So, it\u2019s going to require renewing that commitment of those who are well off to help those who are in the greatest need.\u201d",
      "\u201cMelinda has made a phenomenal contribution to the foundation, helping us pick the right people and being in partnerships, traveling the world, bringing her perspective to things. I can\u2019t say enough good things about how she got us off on the right track. When we divorced, we hoped \u2014 I hoped \u2014 that she would choose to stay. She stayed for a period of time, continued to do great work, and then chose to do the philanthropy on her own.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur work is for saving children\u2019s lives. So it\u2019s true, if they have other priorities, it\u2019s hard to influence my commitment to not having mothers bleed to death or kids not dying from malaria. To be honest, the number of civil society actors that are in here trying to influence the work we do is so tiny. It\u2019s unbelievable. I mean, I could almost list their names on one piece of paper. Where are these people? We want more people second-guessing our work, criticizing our work. I mean, what\u2019s their idea about malnutrition? What\u2019s their idea on how to deal with these funding cuts? What do they want us to do?\u201d",

      "SEATTLE -- In its first 25 years, the Gates Foundation became one of the world\u2019s largest charitable foundations and one of the most powerful institutions in global health \u2014 an accomplishment that carried both accolades and controversy.",
      "Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates had grand ambitions for their foundation, but little experience in global health or philanthropy. They were moved by stories like those written by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof about children dying from diseases caused by a lack of sanitation. In characteristic Gates style, they tackled these problems with rigor, data and close oversight.",
      "As a result, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 formed in 2000 by the merger of two family foundations and funded by Gates\u2019 Microsoft wealth and later, by tens of billions from investor Warren Buffett \u2014 inserted itself into the architecture of global health.",
      "Along the way, the foundation\u2019s leaders redefined what it means to be philanthropists.",
      "\u201cAs I was learning about what children die of, you know, HIV and diarrhea and pneumonia, were all things that I was stunned how little was going into helping the poor countries,\u201d Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "He responded in a way few others could, by pouring billions into the foundation, which spent $100 billion in its first 25 years, with about half going toward global health.",
      "Thanks to its largesse, as well as the expertise of its employees, its connections to governments and companies, and the profile of its founders, the Gates Foundation now garners at least the same influence, if not more, in almost any global health forum as many countries.",
      "That era now has an end date. Gates announced Thursday that the foundation will close in 2045, pledging that he plans to donate 99% of his remaining fortune, which would be $107 billion today, to the nonprofit by then. Gates said the foundation can maintain its culture and workforce over that time.",
      "\"We\u2019ll be showing that we\u2019re doing the most we can and give a lot of predictability to the field by (saying,) \u2018We\u2019ll be here all of those 20 years, but not thereafter,\u2019\" he said.",
      "The foundation's influence over global health policy and its partnerships with companies and other private sector actors have long drawn questions.",

      "Others like Anuj Kapilashrami, global health professor at the University of Essex, argue the foundation's preference for low-cost treatments and interventions does not inherently help build the capacity of health systems.",
      "\u201cWe do not tackle the causes, the underlying drivers of what is producing ill-health, but we choose areas and health issues where we can just push these magic bullets: commodities, drugs (and) bed nets,\u201d she said.",
      "Mark Suzman, who has been with the foundation for 18 years and CEO since 2020, said close supervision of grantees and the foundation\u2019s data-driven processes are key to its success.",
      "\u201cWe are not a 'write the check, call us in three years and let us know what it looks like,\u2019\u201d kind of funder, Suzman said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be calling you up probably every week, and we\u2019ll have some opinions. But we want your opinions back.\u201d",
      "The foundation is proud of the many vaccines, medical devices and treatment protocols it has helped develop. It is optimistic about a pipeline of innovations, including potential vaccines for malaria and HIV, as possible accomplishments in its remaining 20 years.",
      "David McCoy, a physician who was then at the University College London, argued back in 2009 that only a small portion of the foundation\u2019s spending went directly to organizations located in the countries where they work, with most going to international organizations like the World Health Organization or to groups located in the U.S. and Europe.",
      "Suzman said he has been an internal champion of shifting more of the foundation's work from Seattle to in-country offices.",
      "The foundation\u2019s flagship issue, and the main way it measures its success, is in reducing preventable childhood deaths.",
      "The Gates Foundation helped establish two major public-private partnerships: Gavi, the vaccine alliance that funds and distributes vaccines for children, and the Global Fund, which, along with governments, funds the treatment and control of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria.",
      "The foundation says the two organizations have saved tens of millions of lives and are some of the most important examples of its impact.",
      "However, Amy Patterson, politics professor at The University of the South, Sewanee, says public-private partnerships like Gavi and the Global Fund diminish the power of civil society groups and citizens compared to public health systems.",

      "\u201cThat is not to discount the millions of lives saved, or children immunized, or women who have access to reproductive health, or the innovations that have brought efficiency,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cBut if you think about the social contract between states taking care of their people, how do we have that same kind of accountability in this type of a system?\u201d",
      "A huge moment in the early history of the foundation came in 2006 when Buffett pledged to donate a percentage of his Berkshire Hathaway shares annually, almost doubling the foundation\u2019s resources.",
      "Buffett teamed with Gates and French Gates again in 2010 to launch a new commitment for billionaires: to give away more than half their money in their lifetimes or at the time of their death.",
      "The Giving Pledge now has more than 240 people agreeing to those terms, far exceeding Gates\u2019 expectations. However, certainly not every billionaire has.",
      "Gates hopes others will surpass his giving.",

      "He acknowledged that cuts to foreign aid and health funding under President Donald Trump's current administration, wars, and economic turmoil significantly challenge the foundation's hopes of eradicating polio, controlling malaria, and reducing the number of child and maternal deaths in the next 20 years.",
      "\u201cThe metric that we should be measured against is the success of the whole global health field. Did we draw people in? Did we keep governments engaged, and therefore, do we get childhood death rates down from the 5 million to cut it in half again?\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you we will, because without the partners, that\u2019s not doable.

      "His announcement Thursday signals both a promise of sustained support to those causes, particularly global health and education in the U.S., and an eventual end to the foundation\u2019s immense worldwide influence. Gates says spending down his fortune will help save and improve many lives now, which will have positive ripple effects well beyond the foundation's closure. It also makes it more likely that his intentions are honored.",
      "\u201cI think 20 years is the right balance between giving as much as we can to make progress on these things and giving people a lot of notice that now this money will be gone,\u201d Gates said.",
      "The Gates Foundation has long been peerless among foundations \u2014 attracting supporters and detractors but also numerous unfounded conspiracy theories.",
      "In addition to the $100 billion it has spent since its founding 25 years ago, it has directed scientific research, helped develop new technologies, and nurtured long-term partnerships with countries and companies.",
      "About 41% of the foundation\u2019s money so far has come from Warren Buffett and the rest from the fortune Gates made at Microsoft.",
      "Started by Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates in 2000, the foundation plays a significant role in shaping global health policy and has carved out a special niche by partnering with companies to drive down the cost of medical treatments so low- and middle-income countries could afford them.",
      "\u201cThe foundation work has been way more impactful than I expected,\u201d Gates said, calling it his second and final career.",
      "The foundation\u2019s influence on global health \u2014 from the World Health Organization to research agendas \u2014 is both a measure of its success and a magnet for criticism. For years, researchers have asked why a wealthy family should have so much sway over how the world improves people\u2019s health and responds to crises.",
      "Gates said, like any private citizen, he can choose how to spend the money he earns and has decided to do everything he can to reduce childhood deaths.",
      "\u201cIs that a bad thing? It\u2019s not an important cause? People can criticize it,\u201d he said, but the foundation will stick to its global health work.",
      "The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation and for news coverage of women in the workforce and statehouses from Melinda French Gates\u2019 organization, Pivotal Ventures.",
      "The foundation\u2019s most prized metric is the drop in childhood deaths from preventable causes by almost half between 2000 and 2020, according to United Nations figures. The foundation\u2019s CEO Mark Suzman is careful to say they do not take credit for this accomplishment. But he believes they had a \u201ccatalytic role\u201d \u2014 for example, in helping deliver vaccines to children through Gavi, the vaccine alliance they helped create.",
      "The foundation still has numerous goals \u2014 eradicating polio, controlling other deadly diseases, like malaria, and reducing malnutrition, which makes children more vulnerable to other illnesses.",
      "Gates hopes that by spending to address these issues now, wealthy donors will be free to tackle other problems later.",
      "The Gates Foundation had planned to wind down two decades after Gates' death, meaning today\u2019s announcement significantly moves up that timetable. Gates plans to stay engaged, though at 69, he acknowledged he may not have a say.",
      "In its remaining two decades, the foundation will maintain a budget of around $9 billion a year, which represents a leveling off from its almost annual growth since 2006, when Buffett first started donating.",
      "Suzman expects the foundation will narrow its focus to top priorities.",
      "\u201cHaving that time horizon and the resources just puts an even greater burden on us to say, \u2018Are you actually putting your resources, your thumb down, on what are going to be the biggest, most successful bets rather than scattering it too thinly?\u2019\" Suzman said, which he acknowledged was creating uncertainty even within the foundation about what programs would continue.",
      "Major changes preceded the foundation's 25th year.",
      "In 2021, Melinda French Gates and Bill Gates divorced, and Buffett resigned as the foundation\u2019s trustee. They recruited a new board of trustees to help govern the foundation, and in 2024, French Gates left to continue work at her own organization.",
      "French Gates said she decided to step down partly to focus on countering the rollback of women\u2019s rights in the U.S. At the ELLE Women of Impact event in New York in April, she said she wanted to leave the foundation at a high point.",
      "\u201cI so trusted Mark Suzman, the current CEO,\" she said. \u201cWe had a board in place that I helped put in place, and I knew their values.\u201d",
      "Even as the foundation\u2019s governance stabilizes, the road ahead looks difficult. Enduring conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, global economic turmoil and cuts to foreign aid forecast fewer resources coming to global health and development.",
      "\u201cThe greatest uncertainty for us is the generosity that will go into global health,\u201d Gates said. \u201cWill it continue to go down like it has the last few years or can we get it back to where it should be?\u201d",
      "Even facing these obstacles, Gates and the foundation speak, as they often do, with optimism, pointing to innovations they\u2019ve funded or ways they\u2019ve helped reduce the cost of care.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible to come up with these low-cost things and tragic if we can\u2019t get them out to everyone who needs them,\u201d Gates said. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to require renewing that commitment of those who are well off to help those who are in the greatest need.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- When it comes to Medicaid, Rep. Juan Ciscomani is telling fellow Republicans he won't support steep cuts that could hit thousands of residents in his Arizona district \u2014 \u201cmy neighbors, people my kids go to school with\u201d \u2014 who depend on it.",
      "Republican Rep. Don Bacon, who represents the liberal-leaning \u201cblue dot\u201d of Omaha, Nebraska, is trying to protect several Biden-era green energy tax breaks. He's warning colleagues that \u201cyou can\u2019t pull the rug out from under\u201d businesses that have already sunk millions of dollars into renewable developments in Nebraska and beyond.",
      "And for Republican Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, it\u2019s simple: \u201cNo Salt. No Deal. For Real.\u201d He wants to revive \u2014 and bump up \u2014 what\u2019s known as the SALT deduction, which allows taxpayers to write off a portion of their state and local taxes. Capping the deduction at $10,000 hurt many of his Long Island constituents.",
      "\u201cGoverning is a negotiation, right?\u201d said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York, another Republican who is also involved in the talks. \u201cI think everybody is going to have to give a little.\u201d",
      "As GOP leaders draft President Donald Trump\u2019s \"big, beautiful bill\u201d of some $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $1.5 trillion in spending cuts by Memorial Day, dozens of Republicans from contested congressional districts have positioned themselves at the center of the negotiating table.",
      "While it\u2019s often the most conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus driving the legislative agenda \u2014 and they are demanding as much as $2 trillion in cuts \u2014 it\u2019s the more centrist-leaning conservatives who could sink the bill. They have been hauled into meetings with Trump at the White House, some have journeyed to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and many are huddling almost daily with House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "And they are not satisfied, yet.",
      "\u201cTo get everybody politically and policy-wise on the same page is going to require more conversations,\u201d said LaLota, who is among five Republicans pledging to withhold their support unless changes to the SALT deduction are included.",
      "Diving into the gritty details of the massive package, the GOP leaders are running into the stubborn reality that not all the ideas from their menu of potential tax breaks and spending cuts are popular with voters back home.",
      "Moreover, their work of compiling the big package is not happening in a vacuum. It comes amid growing economic unease rippling across the country as Trump has fired thousands of federal workers, including some of their own constituents, and as his trade war sparks concerns of empty store shelves and higher prices.",
      "Brendan Buck, a former adviser to an earlier House speaker, Paul Ryan, warned in an op-ed Wednesday that all the party's energy is being poured into one bill, with questionable returns.",
      "\"Many Republicans are hoping that the tax bill can blunt the economic damage caused by the Trump tariffs,\" Buck wrote in The New York Times, \u201cbut that is highly unlikely.\u201d",
      "Democrats are ready for the fight, warning that Trump and his fellow Republicans are ripping away health care and driving the economy into the ditch \u2014 all to retain tax breaks approved during Trump's first term that are expiring at year's end.",
      "\u201cWhat we see from Donald Trump and the Republicans is they are actually crashing the economy in real time,\u201d said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.",
      "\u201cWhy,\u201d the Democratic leader asked, \u201care Republicans jumping through hoops\u201d to try to reduce Medicaid and food stamps used by millions of Americans?",

      "The speaker's office has become a waystation with a revolving door of Republicans privately laboring to piece together the massive package.",
      "So far, GOP leaders have signaled they are walking away from some, but not all, of the steep Medicaid cuts. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the proposals could result in millions of people losing their coverage.",
      "Instead, what appears to still be on the table are tougher work requirements for those receiving Medicaid and food stamp assistance and more frequent eligibility tests for beneficiaries.",
      "That's not enough for the conservatives, who also number in the dozens and are insisting on deeper reductions.",

I think it\u2019s very important they know that.\u201d",

      "\u201cGo with a scalpel. Go pick out some things,\u201d Bacon told The Associated Press. He and the others warned that companies are already investing millions of dollars from the Inflation Reduction Act's incentives to green energy.",

      "Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Cory Booker of New Jersey visited Ciscomani's Tucson-based district last month to offer harsh condemnations.",
      "Kelly asked how many in the room were represented by Ciscomani, and then he warned about how scores of residents in the district could lose their health care coverage.",

    "story": [
      "The road to the U.S.-Ukraine minerals agreement was paved with challenges",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Last fall, weeks before Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy floated a pitch that proposed, among other things,\u202fan economic deal that would allow Washington access to Ukraine\u2019s largely untapped minerals and deepen strategic ties.",
      "Under pressure from Western allies and amid global war fatigue, Zelenskyy saw that the days of Biden administration-era robust military aid might be numbered, and so the pitch was part of the Ukrainian leader\u2019s so-called victory plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war. It was an offer that would appeal to Trump\u2019s penchant for transactions-based diplomacy in hopes of ensuring a steady flow of future American support in return.",
      "Seven months later, a landmark deal between Ukraine and the Trump administration on Ukraine\u2019s mineral resources was inked. But the road in between was paved with mutual recriminations, a historic Oval Office blowout, \u201chundreds\u201d of revisions, and finally, a chance meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis\u2019 funeral.",
      "Last minute snags threatened to undermine the signing of the agreement, but in the end Ukraine secured a deal that, once set in motion, brings closer ties with the U.S. and a provides a vehicle for future military assistance.\u202f Ukraine\u2019s parliament is expected to pass the agreement on Thursday, and other documents pertaining to the deal are being finalized.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that this is the first time in history that the United States considers Ukraine as a long-term strategic partner, economically,\u201d Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said at a media briefing in Kyiv on Thursday, hours before the parliament vote.",
      "Here\u2019s a timeline of the deal\u2019s conception and signing:",
      "In response to rising pressure from Western allies and clear battlefield disadvantages, Zelenskyy outlines a so-called victory plan to end the war. The plan sought to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s negotiating hand and proposed measures to boost its military potential, but also economic partnerships with Western allies.",
      "Ukraine is rich in natural resources, including critically important metals such as uranium, titanium, lithium, and graphite.",
      "Zelenskyy pitches the plan to the White House during a visit to Washington in late September, and later in a meeting with Trump at Trump Tower in New York.",
      "Giving American companies preferential access to Ukraine would serve as leverage against Russia as most mineral deposits are located very close to front-line areas. Having U.S. companies on the ground, the thinking goes, would cement Washington's interests in Ukraine and serve as a de facto security guarantee. Critical minerals used to manufacture weapons, aviation and batteries would also give the U.S. access to reserves in a global market dominated by China.",
      "Trump appears captivated by the idea and very soon after his inauguration in January starts touting the idea of getting Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elemnts.",
      "By February, the White House and Ukraine appear to have made significant progress toward reaching an agreement that would provide the U.S. with access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals.",
      "On Feb. 12, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent arrives in Kyiv, becoming the first senior Trump administration official to visit and expecting Zelenskyy to sign the deal that day amid a push by Washington quickly end the war. But the Ukrainian president declines, saying elements of the draft didn't align with his country\u2019s constitution. The deal would have given the U.S. 50% rights to Ukraine\u2019s minerals and mentioned nothing of security guarantees.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t let the ministers sign \u2026 because in my view it is not ready to protect us, our interest,\u201d Zelenskyy told The Associated Press at the Munich Security Conference in February.",
      "Bessent later said in an interview with Tucker Carlson that Zelenskyy \u201cblew up\u201d the deal.",
      "Zelenskyy shot back, saying Bessent\u2019s approach had been disrespectful.",
      "\u201cMy colleagues know that if someone taps their finger on an agreement and says, \u2018You must sign now\u2019 \u2014 I could only say to him, \u2018Stop tapping your finger and let\u2019s have a proper conversation,'\u201d Zelenskyy later said in recounting the meeting in April to reporters in Kyiv.",
      "The two sides agreed to a new draft later in February.",
      "And on Feb. 28, Zelenskyy arrived in Washington with the intention of signing the revised version of the deal. But Zelenskyy insists on adding explicit U.S. security guarantees to the deal, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin couldn\u2019t be trusted to comply with a ceasefire deal. A shouting match breaks out in the Oval Office, and Trump berates the Ukrainian president for not demonstrating gratitude for American support.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not in a good position. You don\u2019t have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards,\u201d Trump shouted.",
      "Zelenskyy leaves the White House with no deal and a deeply uncertain future with Washington. Shortly after, the U.S. pauses military aid and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine.",
      "According to multiple Ukrainian and Western officials, results from ceasefire talks between Ukrainian and U.S. delegates in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 marked a turning point after the disastrous Oval Office meeting.",
      "Ukraine agrees to a U.S. proposal for a full and immediate 30-day ceasefire, pending approval by the Kremlin, which had so far opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict without accepting any concessions. By piling conditions on both proposals for both full and partial ceasefires, Putin began testing Trump\u2019s patience.",
      "Meanwhile, technical discussions over the minerals deal resume. But the Trump administration introduces a new clause demanding that Ukraine reimburse the full amount of U.S. aid provided since the start of the full-scale invasion. Trump mentions a $500 billion figure as compensation, an amount many times more than the sum of aid provided.",
      "Ukrainian officials continue lobbying for a more equitable structure that respects Ukraine\u2019s strategic interests and state sovereignty. Zelenskyy spells out three core principles: The creation of a joint investment fund, 50-50 governance and the exclusion of debt repayment.",
      "Intensive negotiations continue, requiring Ukrainian and U.S. officials to work across time zones. Each day ushers in proposals and counterproposals.",
      "\u201cThere were likely hundreds of revisions and dozens of draft revisions,\u201d a senior European official close to the talks said. \u201cEvery morning meant a new batch of edits for each side.\u201d",
      "Svyrydenko said on April 18 that the two countries signed a memorandum of intent before a possible fuller agreement later. A draft, dated April 17 and obtained by The Associated Press, called for creating a joint U.S.-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, incorporated as a partnership in Delaware.",
      "The draft document was a version marked up by the United States and showed that the Trump administration could be willing to cede on some demands that Ukraine opposed.",
      "The draft was notable because it called for the U.S. to make a significant initial cash investment in the fund, in addition to receiving credit in the form of equity that is equivalent to the billions in U.S. military assistance already spent. Earlier versions had the U.S. investing no additional capital in Ukraine while having exclusive rights to the country\u2019s natural resources.",
      "Then, a breakthrough moment came on April 26 in the form of a tete-a-tete between Trump and Zelenskyy in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica at the sidelines of Pope Francis\u2019 funeral. Zelenskyy described it as a turning point and \u201cthe best conversation\u201d the two leaders have had to date.",
      "The exchange paved the way for the signing of the minerals deal in Washington four days later, he said.",
      "In the end, Zelenskyy didn't get explicit security guarantees as part of the deal. Still, the final agreement was considered a victory for Ukraine after months of diplomatic work.",
      "The signed deal crucially doesn't call for Kyiv to reimburse the U.S. for the aid it has already received \u2014 a concession from Trump. That concession was",
      "That concession was extracted after Ukrainians argued that recognizing past aid as debt retrospectively would go against agreements that Ukraine has made to obtain that aid with the U.S., European Union, International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka said. Instead, Ukrainians argued for future military assistance to count as part of investment into the fund.",
      "Bessent acknowledged that the agreement was a \u201ctacit security guarantee because of the economic partnership.\u201d",

      "Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s January-March net profit totaled 664.6 billion yen ($4.6 billion), down from 997.6 billion yen the same period a year ago. Quarterly sales totaled 12.36 trillion yen ($85.9 billion), up from 11 trillion yen.",

That estimate covers April and May, meaning it could grow in coming months.",
      "Consolidated vehicle sales for the fiscal year through March totaled 9.36 million vehicles, down slightly from 9.44 million vehicles the previous fiscal year.",

      "The Bank of England is cutting its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% amid concerns over the potential shock to global growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration",
      "LONDON -- The Bank of England cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% amid concerns over the potential shock to global growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration.",
      "The decision Thursday was widely expected, though there was an array of opinion on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, with two voting for a bigger half-point cut to 4%, and two voting to hold rates.",
      "Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey said inflationary pressures have continued to ease, paving the way for the fourth quarter-point rate cut since August.",
      "\u201cThe past few weeks have shown how unpredictable the global economy can be,\u201d he said. \"That\u2019s why we need to stick to a gradual and careful approach to further rate cuts. Ensuring low and stable inflation is our top priority.\u201d",
      "The decision is the first since President Donald Trump made his tariff announcement in early April. Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10% baseline tariff applied to U.K. goods entering the U.S., the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain.",
      "Some of that uncertainty, with regard to the British economy, could be lifted later Thursday when details of a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. are announced. At the very least, they are expected to lower the tariff burden.",
      "Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that a deal due to be announced at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) will be a \u201cfull and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come.\u201d",
      "Though the tariff burden may be eased, the biggest uncertainty facing the global economy is the potential for a U.S.-China trade war, which would dampen economic growth everywhere.",
      "The rate cut comes despite expectations that inflation will rise further above the bank's 2% target over coming months, from the current 2.6% as a result of a raft of price increases in April, such as domestic energy and water bills, and firms passing on tax rises to consumers.",
      "\u201cWhile headline inflation is expected to rise in the near-term, we do not expect that to persist,\u201d said Bailey, adding that it will be back around target in two years time.",
      "Unlike the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, which last month cut interest rates too, the U.S. Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday as its policymakers wait to see how Trump\u2019s tariffs affect the U.S. economy before making any moves.",
      "Most economists think the Bank of England will continue to lower borrowing rates over the coming months, though admitted that the three-way split in the voting may complicate its messaging.",
      "\u201cWe still think the Bank will cut rates at least twice more later this year, but much like the Fed\u2019s message yesterday, U.K. policy makers will want to see more data on how tariffs and domestic tax increases are being digested by the economy before moving decisively\u201d said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at asset management firm Aberdeen.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China is crippling an entire industry that hand-harvests geoducks",
      "SUQUAMISH, Wash. -- For over two decades, Suquamish tribal member Joshua George has dived into the emerald waters of the Salish Sea looking for an unusually phallic clam that\u2019s coveted thousands of miles away.",
      "George is a geoduck diver. Pronounced \u201cgooey-duck,\u201d the world\u2019s largest burrowing clam has been harvested in tidelands by George\u2019s Indigenous ancestors in the Pacific Northwest since before Europeans arrived.",
      "In recent years it has also become a delicacy in China, with Washington state sending 90% of its geoducks there, creating a niche yet lucrative American seafood export.",
      "But the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China is now crippling an entire industry that hand-harvests geoducks, leaving Washington state divers without work, Seattle exporters without business and Chinese aficionados with fewer of these prized clams.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in 24 years where I don\u2019t know when or if we\u2019ll be going back to work or if I have to find another job or what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d George said.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff-driven economic feud with China, which dates back to his first term in office, swiftly resumed in February within weeks of taking back the White House. By April, Trump had placed tariffs of at least 145% on China, which led China to retaliate with tariffs of 125% on the U.S.",
      "Top U.S. officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since the latest tariffs were imposed, but it is unclear where those talks will lead.",
      "Enter the geoduck, weighing about 2 pounds and so entrenched in local culture that it is the mascot for Evergreen State College in Olympia. The meaty mollusk is best described as sweet and briny, and it's often sliced raw for crisp sashimi out west while China consumers prefer it chewy in stir-fries or hot pot soups. Pre-tariff costs were as high as $100 per pound in restaurants, so it\u2019s a dish generally reserved for special occasions like Chinese New Year, or to celebrate a business gathering.",
      "Unlike other products with long-lasting shelf life and standing inventory, the trade war has had an immediate, direct effect on the delicate geoducks, which are shipped alive the same day of harvest.",
      "\u201cThe whole market, everybody just had to stop,\u201d said Jim Boure, general manager of Suquamish Seafoods, an enterprise of the Suquamish Tribe. \u201cWe started getting phone calls from buyers saying orders are canceled.\u201d",
      "The millions of pounds of geoducks shipped annually to China come from two main sources: wild harvests on tracts of seafloor that are split between the Washington State Department of Natural Resources and Puget Sound Treaty Indian Tribes, and tideland farms. The state\u2019s share is auctioned to private exporters that often hire contract divers to harvest them.",
      "As of late April, Washington state divers had only pulled about half of the expected harvest from the state tracts, said Blain Reeves, an aquatic resources division manager for the state\u2019s Department of Natural Resources. Last year, the state and tribes collectively harvested about 3.4 million pounds of wild Washington geoduck for sale. The state generated $22.4 million in revenue for their half of the clams, which went toward paying for aquatic restoration projects locally. The state doesn't track how much is harvested by private farmers.",
      "\u201cIf only half the pounds that were contracted are harvested, then our revenue is halved,\u201d Reeves said.",
      "The Suquamish operation has no orders to harvest for at the moment, but it still must keep up with the maintenance to stay ready for business if and when China comes calling.",
      "On a recent April day, George\u2019s team made a quick trip to collect a handful of the clams for state lab testing.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re doing the job, and it\u2019s not all this other political stuff behind the scenes and everything else, we love this,\u201d said George, adding that diving, which takes place early in the day so that the geoducks are on an airplane by evening, has allowed him to watch his kids grow up.",
      "Fellow diver Kyle Purser said he cherishes his underwater job, but now fears it's being taken away.",
      "\"When you\u2019re watching your money disappear and you\u2019ve got families to feed and not knowing when you're going to get your next paycheck, (it's) very stressful,\u201d he said.",
      "The geoduck import market was already facing weaker demand in recent years due to the Chinese economy\u2019s struggle to regain post-pandemic momentum. While the tariffs have only exacerbated troubles for geoduck sellers in Washington, there's also been an unintended consequence: The American trade war has inadvertently boosted the Canadian geoduck business, which is facing a mere 25% tariff from China in comparison to the 125% for the U.S.",
      "Washington state in the U.S. and Canada's British Columbia province are the two primary places where the wild geoducks grow naturally for commercial harvest. The two countries did healthy business primarily serving Chinese appetites for decades, in part because quantities are limited. It\u2019s a labor-intensive and heavily-regulated harvest, as divers must go several feet below the surface to dig for them.",
      "\u201cThey love the fact that it tastes like the sea,\u201d said James Austin, president of Canada\u2019s Underwater Harvesters Association. \u201cIt\u2019s a product that\u2019s really a hit with the Chinese. It\u2019s all about the wild coastline. It\u2019s really prestigious.\u201d",
      "Austin said he expects there will be 2.75 million pounds of Canadian geoducks harvested in 2025, worth approximately $60 million Canadian dollars ($43.4 million USD) in revenue.",
      "While demand has been relatively low but still steady for Canadian's geoducks, Austin said they're now the leading exporters for China, which has helped them negotiate higher prices as a result. For example, after Canada got hit with a 25% tariff in March, export sale prices dropped to $12 per pound, and after the U.S. got hit with a 125% tariff in April, Canadian geoducks are now being sold for $17 a pound.",
      "\u201cWe have no competitors right now,\u201d Austin said.",
      "Yang Bin at Beihai Huaxiashougang Health Industry Company in Beihai city of Guangxi province in China said their seafood wholesale important business no longer gets geoduck from the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t care about U.S. tariffs because we can get geoduck from other countries with stable prices,\u201d Yang said.",
      "On their first week back to work since the tariff fight brought business to a standstill in Washington state, Derrick McRae and his brother pulled up about 800 pounds of wild geoducks in just one April day.",
      "He donned a full-body diving outfit with an oxygen line tethered to his boat to dive under the cold waters of an inland sea channel west of Seattle. Kneeled on the seafloor, McRae used a water spray gun to move the sand covering the geoducks. In the cloud of sediment, he felt for the neck with his hand, pulling the clam and stuffing it in a net attached to him.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just kind of waiting on the edge of our seats to see what happens next,\u201d McRae said.",
      "At one of the southernmost inlets, farmer Ian Child said the tariff disruption is not just hurting his bottom line but the entire farming process. He usually places young geoducks in the sand in the summer, but he can\u2019t mix new crops with any existing unharvested clams.",
      "\u201cI think that the demand is still over there for the product,\u201d he said of China. \u201cI think they still want it. It\u2019s just a matter of where the tariffs will land.\u201d",

      "Investors continue to watch with trepidation President Donald Trump 's comments about the trade imbalance, as well as the reactions from various nations to appease the U.S. administration and the overall confusion over the long-term economic impact.",
      "Geo-political tensions also weighed on market sentiments, centered around the standoff between India and Pakistan. Pakistan has said it will avenge those killed by India\u2019s missile strikes, which New Delhi called retaliation for last month\u2019s massacre of Indian tourists in India-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan called the strikes an act of war and claimed it downed several Indian fighter jets.",
      "The missiles killed 31 people, including women and children, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the country\u2019s Punjab province, Pakistan\u2019s military said.

      "Indexes swiveled repeatedly through the day, and the Dow briefly climbed as many as 400 points on hopes that the United States and China may be making the first moves toward a trade deal that could protect the global economy. The world\u2019s two largest economies have been placing ever-increasing tariffs on products coming from each other in an escalating trade war, and the fear is that they could cause a recession unless they allow trade to move more freely.",
      "The announcement for high-level talks between U.S. and Chinese officials this weekend in Switzerland helped raise optimism, but some of that washed away after Trump said he would not reduce his 145% tariffs on Chinese goods as a condition for negotiations. China has made the de-escalation of the tariffs a requirement for trade negotiations, which the meetings are supposed to help establish.",
      "Such on-and-off uncertainty surrounding tariffs has helped create sharp swings within the U.S. economy, including a rush of imports in the hopes of beating tariffs. Underneath those swings, as well as surveys showing U.S. households are growing much more pessimistic about the future, the Fed said it continues to see the economy running \u201cat a solid pace\u201d at the moment.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that gives the central bank time to wait before making any potential moves on interest rates, even if Trump has been lobbying for quicker cuts to juice the economy.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much that we don\u2019t know,\u201d Powell said. So like the rest of Wall Street and the world, the Fed is waiting to see what will actually end up happening in Trump\u2019s trade war and whether his tariffs, which were much stiffer than expected, will hit as proposed.",
      "That\u2019s particularly the case after the trade war seems to be entering \u201ca new phase,\u201d Powell said, where the U.S. is conducting more talks on trade with other countries. The Fed also said it appreciates that risks to the economy are rising because of tariffs, which could both weaken the job market and push inflation higher.",
      "\u201cIf the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they are likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth and an increase in unemployment,\u201d Powell said.",
      "That could ultimately put the Fed in a worst-case scenario called \u201cstagflation,\u201d where the economy is stagnating while inflation remains high.",
      "In the meantime, big U.S. companies continue to produce fatter profits for the start of 2025 than analysts expected. The Walt Disney Co. jumped 10.8% after easily beating analysts\u2019 profit targets, raising its profit forecast and adding more than a million streaming subscribers.",
      "All told, the S&P 500 rose 24.37 points to 5,631.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 284.97 points to 41,113.97, and the Nasdaq composite gained 48.50 to 17,738.16.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Seventeen states are suing President Donald Trump 's administration for withholding billions of dollars for building more electric vehicle chargers, according to a federal lawsuit announced Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration in February directed states to stop spending money for electric vehicle charging infrastructure that was allocated under President Joe Biden \u2014 part of a broader push by the Republican president to roll back environmental policies advanced by his Democratic predecessor. The EV charger program was set to allocate $5 billion over five years to various states, of which an estimated $3.3 billion had already been made available.",
      "The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California, Colorado and Washington, and challenges the Federal Highway Administration's authority to halt the funding. They argue Congress, which approved the money in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, holds that authority.",
      "\"These funds were going to be used to shape the future of transportation,\u201d California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, calling it \u201cshort-sighted\u201d of Trump to revoke the funds.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t sit back while the Trump administration violates the law,\u201d Bonta, a Democrat, said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "EVs stood at about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com, a sign the market is growing \u2014 although the pace has slowed as the auto industry tries to convince mainstream buyers about going electric. The program was meant to assuage some concerns and build infrastructure along highway corridors first, then address gaps elsewhere once the state highway obligations were met.",
      "Some states with projects running under the program have already been reimbursed by the Biden-era federal funds. Others are still contracting for their sites. Still more had halted their plans by the time the Trump administration ordered states to stop their spending. Regardless, getting these chargers installed and operating has been a slow process with contracting challenges, permitting delays and complex electrical upgrades.",
      "It was expected that states would fight against the federal government\u2019s efforts to slow the nation\u2019s electric vehicle charger buildout. New York, for example, which is part of the suit, has been awarded over $175 million in federal funds from the program, and state officials say $120 million is currently being withheld by the Trump administration.",
      "Even the electric carmaker Tesla, run by Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency efforts to cut federal spending, benefited greatly from funding under the program, receiving millions of dollars to expand its already-massive footprint of chargers in the U.S.",
      "Despite threats to the program, experts have said they expect the nation\u2019s EV charging buildout to continue as automakers look to make good on massive electrification ambitions.",
      "Consumers thinking about buying an EV often cite concerns about the availability of charging infrastructure. It's a hurdle for people living in multifamily dwellings and in rural areas, or what are otherwise known as \u201ccharging deserts.\u201d It's also a problem for people who can't find a place to charge their vehicle near their work, or who often drive longer highway routes.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said withholding the funds was illegal and would kill thousands of U.S. jobs, ceding them to China.",
      "\"Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon \u2014 and the nation \u2014 by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding,\u201d Newsom said, referencing Trump's recent purchase of a Tesla in a show of support for Musk.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to withdraw funding for electric vehicle chargers is part of a broader push to roll back environmental policies advanced under Biden.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first week back in office, he signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again, reverse a 2030 target for electric vehicles to make up half of new cars sold, and end environmental justice efforts. At the same time, federal agencies under Trump have rolled back key rules and regulations and supported the build-out of the fossil fuel industry.",
      "The U.S. House also advanced proposals last week aimed at blocking California from enforcing vehicle-emission rules, including a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The Senate parliamentarian says the California policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",

      "Missouri is poised to become the first state to repeal a common tax on profits from stocks and real estate sales",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Investors who profit from selling stocks, real estate and other assets soon could reap an even larger benefit in Missouri, which is poised to become the first U.S. state to exempt capital gains from its income tax.",
      "Legislation that won final approval Wednesday would halt the capital gains tax this year for individuals and could eventually eliminate it for corporations, if state revenues keep growing. The tax repeal now heads to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has said he's \u201cvery supportive\u201d of it.",
      "Though proponents hope it can spur the economy, detractors assert that the capital gains tax repeal will primarily benefit the rich and result in less tax revenue for public schools and services. The Republican-led Legislature overcame objections by Democrats only after expanding the bill with greater tax breaks for seniors and disabled residents and new sales tax exemptions for diapers and feminine hygiene products.",
      "Missouri's unique income tax carve-out comes as Republican-led legislatures in at least eight other states have passed more traditional income tax rate reductions this year. It also comes as Congress weighs whether to renew and expand income tax breaks enacted during President Donald Trump's first term in office.",
      "Capital gains are profits from the sale of assets such as stocks, cryptocurrency or property. The federal government taxes long-term capital gains, on assets held for more than a year, at a lower rate than ordinary income.",
      "All states that tax income also tax capital gains. Missouri currently is among 32 states and the District of Columbia that tax capital gains at the same rate as wages and other income, according to the nonprofit Tax Foundation. Eight states tax capital gains at a lower rate than other income.",
      "Some Democratic-led states have been moving in the opposite direction. Maryland lawmakers last month passed a bill that would impose a 2% capital gains tax on those with incomes over $350,000. And Washington lawmakers recently passed legislation to impose an extra 2.9% tax on capital gains over $1 million. Minnesota already imposes a surcharge on capital gains and other investment income over $1 million.",
      "Proponents of axing the capital gains tax say the tax discourages investment and incentivizes people to hold onto assets instead of selling them and spending money elsewhere in the economy.",
      "\u201cWhen you tax something you get less of it,\" said Jonathan Williams, president and chief economist at the American Legislative Exchange Council, an association of conservative lawmakers and businesses. \"The idea is, of course, you want more investment in your state.\u201d",
      "Though ALEC has long backed the repeal of state capital gains taxes, Missouri House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said the idea came to him last year from friends at an employee-owned construction company that was getting hit with the tax. He said his legislation also could benefit family farmers who want to sell their land.",
      "The capital gains tax results in \"lost economic opportunity, financial sclerosis, lower wages -- all of which serve to make Missouri less competitive both domestically and internationally,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Curtis Trent, who handled the bill in the Senate.",
      "Opponents say the wealthy will get the greatest reward.",
      "Repealing Missouri's tax on capital gains would set \u201ca worrisome precedent\u201d nationally and \u201cworsen economic and racial inequities,\u201d said Sam Waxman, deputy director of state policy research at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "One government study found that white families are more likely to report capital gains than some minorities. Among middle-income taxpayers, about 8% of white families benefited from the federal government's tax rates on capital gains and dividends compared to just 3% of Black families and 1% of Hispanic families, according to a 2023 U.S. Treasury Department report.",
      "In Missouri, about 542,000 individual income taxpayers reported capital gains in 2022, amounting to just one-fifth of all filers, according to the Missouri Budget Project, a nonprofit research group that opposes the capital gains tax repeal. The group estimates that 80% of the tax relief would go to the wealthiest 5% of taxpayers.",
      "Legislative researchers estimate Missouri's capital gains tax repeal could cost the state about $262 million annually when fully implemented. But that's disputed by both supporters and opponents.",
      "The Missouri Budget Project estimates the cost could be nearly $600 million annually.",
      "Trent predicts the tax repeal will trigger \u201cincreased economic growth (that) will translate into increased tax revenue\" over time.",
      "Owen Zidar, an economics and public affairs professor at Princeton University, studied the impacts of 584 capital gains tax rate changes in states over four decades. Capital gains tax cuts tend to result in more people selling assets for gains, but not so much as to offset the lost tax revenue, he said.",
      "Zidar said he is skeptical of claims that Missouri's capital gains tax repeal will attract a lot of investment and economic activity.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a substantial revenue decrease,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "The more President Donald Trump talks about his efforts to reach deals with America\u2019s trading partners, the more confusing the tariff picture gets",
      "WASHINGTON -- The more President Donald Trump talks about his efforts to reach deals with America's trading partners, the more confusing the tariff picture gets. His team seems good with that, saying Trump is using \u201cstrategic uncertainty\u201d to his advantage.",
      "Trump says the United States does not have to sign any agreements, and that it could sign 25 of them right now. He says he is looking for fair deals on all sides, and that he does not care about other countries' markets. He says his team can sit down to negotiate the terms of a deal, and that he might just impose a set of tariffs on his own.",
      "\u201cI am struggling to make sense of it,\u201d Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote in an email.",
      "Late Wednesday on his social media site, Trump wrote that he\u2019ll be holding a news conference Thursday morning concerning a \u201cMAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY.\u201d He added that it would be \u201cTHE FIRST OF MANY!!!\u201d",
      "Although Trump's team holds up his best-selling book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d as proof that he has a master plan, much of the world is on tenterhooks. That has meant a volatile stock market, hiring freezes and all kinds of uncertainty even as Trump continues to promise that new factories and jobs are on the horizon.",
      "A look at how the trade talks may play out:",
      "As part of any deal, Trump wants to keep some of his tariffs in place. He believes the import taxes can generate massive revenues for a heavily indebted federal government even though other countries see the whole point of striking a deal as getting rid of tariffs.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a beautiful thing for us,\u201d Trump said recently about tariffs. \u201cIf you can use them, if you can get away with using them, it\u2019s going to make us very rich. And we\u2019ll be paying off debt, we\u2019ll be lowering your taxes very substantially because so much money will be taken in that we\u2019ll be able to lower your taxes even beyond the tax cut that you\u2019re going to be getting.\u201d",
      "So far this year, the U.S. government has collected $45.9 billion from tariffs, about $14.5 billion more than last year, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Those revenues could escalate sharply given the 10% baseline tariffs, the 145% rate being charged on Chinese goods and rates as high as 25% on steel, aluminum, auto and Mexican and Canadian imports.",
      "To reach Trump's stated goals of repaying the $36 trillion debt and reducing income taxes, his tariffs would need to raise at least $2 trillion annually without causing the economy to crash in ways that lead to lower overall tax revenues. That would be close to impossible mathematically.",
      "The Republican administration has said 17 of its major 18 trading partners have essentially presented them with term sheets, which list the possible compromises that they are prepared to make. Agreeing to a mutual understanding of the terms would be only the start of any trade talks.",
      "But foreign leaders have said it is unclear exactly what Trump wants or how deals could be codified into a durable agreement. They also know Trump approved the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2020, only to charge new tariffs on those same two trading partners this year.",
      "While meeting with Trump on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney suggested the next version of that agreement would need to be strengthened to prevent a repeat of the fentanyl-related tariffs imposed this year by Trump that Canada saw as arbitrary.",
      "\u2019Some things about it are going to have to change,\" Carney said.",
      "The 145% tariffs on China \u2014 and the 125% tariffs on the U.S. that Beijing imposed in response \u2014 hang over the entire negotiating process. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledges that those tariffs are not \u201csustainable.\u201d",
      "The first talks between the U.S. and China are set to begin this weekend in Switzerland, but they will likely be limited to finding ways to de-escalate tensions enough for meaningful negotiations to take place.",
      "The key issue is that China is the world's dominant manufacturer, which makes also makes it a leading exporter in ways that can supplant domestic industries. Because China suppresses domestic consumption and focuses on production, the rest of the world buys what it makes because there is not enough internal demand. The U.S. wants to rebalance trade, but it has done so also through tariffs on countries that could be its natural allies in defending their auto and tech industries against China.",
      "\u201cObviously in this trade puzzle, China is the biggest piece,\u201d Bessent said this week. \u201cWhere do we end up with China?\u201d",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian has suggested that a meaningful way for the Trump administration to jump-start talks would be to pull back on its rhetoric and punitive import taxes.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. truly wants to resolve the issue through dialogue and negotiation, it should stop threatening and pressuring and engage in dialogue with China on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,\u201d Lin said Tuesday.",
      "Asked on Wednesday whether he would reduce the tariffs on China as a condition for negotiations, Trump said, \u201cNo.\u201d",
      "The president also disputed statements by the Chinese government that his administration sought the talks in Geneva. \u201cWell, I think they ought to go back and study their files,\" Trump said.",
      "Not necessarily.",
      "Trump unilaterally imposed his universal tariffs without Congress, using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to do so, which has led to multiple lawsuits. The administration also maintains that any agreements to change the rates would not need congressional approval.",
      "Previously, presidents, including Trump in his first term with his \u201cPhase One\u201d China deal, could negotiate only \u201cmore limited agreements that have focused on select bilateral trade and tariff issues,\u201d according to a Congressional Research Service report updated this April. Other examples of limited deals include a 2023 agreement on critical minerals and a 2020 deal on digital trade with Japan.",
      "The challenge is that Trump has also made nontariff barriers such as safety regulations for autos and the value added taxes charged in Europe part of his talks. He wants other countries to change their nontariff policies in exchange for the U.S. reducing the new tariffs he introduced. Other countries, in return, might object to U.S. subsidies to its companies.",
      "In theory, it would take House and Senate approval to complete a deal that would address \u201cnon-tariff barriers and require changes to U.S. law,\u201d the Congressional Research Service report said.",
      "If other countries fail to satisfy him, Trump has suggested he will just do some kind of internal deals and set a tariff rate, although he technically already did that with his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. The import taxes announced by Trump then led to a financial market sell-off that caused him to pause some of his new tariffs for 90 days and charge the lower 10% baseline rate while negotiations take place.",
      "It appears Trump will agree not to impose the originally threatened tariffs if he thinks other countries are making adequate concessions, essentially meaning that the U.S. gives up nothing because the tariffs are new. But Trump might also pull back his tariffs without necessarily getting much in return.",
      "\u201cTrump is notorious for making maximalist demands and then retreating as negotiations go on, so we\u2019ll see how long he sticks with his formula,\u201d said William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. \u201cBut so far it is pretty clear that countries coming in and wanting a \u2018normal\u2019 trade negotiation with both sides making substantive concessions are being rebuffed.\u201d",

      "Researchers from vaccine-maker Moderna reported in a study published Wednesday that the new combo shot generated a stronger immune response against COVID-19 and most strains of flu than existing standalone shots in people 50 and older. Side effects were injection site pain, fatigue and headaches. Moderna previously reported a summary of the results from the company-sponsored trial in 8,000 people.",

A combo shot also might improve vaccination rates, the researchers wrote in the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.",
      "Dr. Greg Poland, who studies vaccine response at Mayo Clinic and was not involved in the new study, said he's not convinced that a combo shot would be popular. And while flu comes in seasonal waves, COVID-19 has been spreading throughout the year, Poland said, posing challenges for how to time the shots to keep protection strong.",

      "SKANEATELES, N.Y. -- Farmer Jeremy Brown taps the nose of a young calf. \u201cI love the ones with the pink noses,\u201d he says.",
      "This pink-nosed animal is just one of about 3,200 cattle at Twin Birch Dairy in Skaneateles, New York. In Brown\u2019s eyes, the cows on the farm aren\u2019t just workers: \u201cThey\u2019re the boss, they\u2019re the queen of the barn.\u201d",
      "Brown, a co-owner at Twin Birch, is outspoken on the importance of sustainability in his operation. The average dairy cow emits as much as 265 pounds (120 kilograms) of methane, a potent climate-warming gas, each year. Brown says Twin Birch has worked hard to cut its planet-warming emissions through a number of environmentally sound choices.",
      "\u201cRuminants are the solution, not the problem, to climate change,\u201d he said.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This story is a collaboration between Rochester Institute of Technology and The Associated Press.",
      "___",
      "Wearing a weathered hoodie and a hat promoting a brand of cow medicine, Brown was spending a windy Friday morning artificially inseminating some of the farm\u2019s massive Jerseys and Holsteins. He stepped over an electric manure scraper used to clean the animals' barn.",
      "The electric scraper means the dairy doesn't have to use a fuel-burning machine for that particular job. Twin Birch also recycles manure for use on crops, cools its milk with water that gets recirculated for cows to drink and grows most of its own feed.",
      "Despite all that, the farm has no desire to pursue a U.S. Department of Agriculture organic certification, Brown said. Doing so would add costs and require the farm to forego technology that makes the dairy business, and ultimately the customer\u2019s jug of milk, more affordable, he said.",
      "He raises a question many farmers have been asking: Is organic farming just a word?",
      "An increasing number of American farmers think so. America\u2019s certified organic acreage fell almost 11% between 2019 and 2021. Numerous farmers who implement sustainable practices told The Associated Press that they have stayed away from the certification because it\u2019s costly, doesn\u2019t do enough to combat climate change and appears to be losing cachet in the marketplace. Converting an existing farm from conventional to organic agriculture can cost tens of thousands of dollars and add labor costs.",
      "The rules governing the National Organic Program were published in 2000, and in the years after, organic farming boomed to eventually reach more than 5 million acres. But that has been declining in recent years.",
      "Any downward trend is significant, as organic farms make up less than 1% of the country's total acreage, and organic sales are typically only a tiny share of the nationwide total.",
      "Shannon Ratcliff, a farmer and co-owner of organically certified Shannon Brook Farms in Watkins Glen, New York, attributes the decline to a 2018 fraud case in Iowa involving a farmer selling grain mislabeled as certified organic. \u201cThe whole thing went crazy \u2014 work requirements for farmers ramped up and inspection levels were higher,\u201d she said.",
      "It's also just a tough business, Ratcliff said.",
      "Her co-owner, Walter Adam, also thinks younger generations' interest in farming of any kind is also declining.",
      "\u201cIt takes six months to learn everything,\u201d Adam said. \u201cWe can\u2019t find anybody as willing to work on the farm.\u201d",
      "Adam drives to Manhattan each week to sell their meat and eggs at markets, and spends Sunday mornings helping Ratcliff with business at the Brighton Farmers Market in Brighton, New York.",
      "Frank Mitloehner, a professor in animal science in the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences at University of California Davis, said lack of flexibility and efficiency are driving farmers away from organic in an era of rising prices for farmers. He said organic standards need to be overhauled or the marketplace risks organic going away completely.",
      "\u201cI am in awe that so many organic farmers were able to produce that way for that long,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems that they are losing consumer base in these financially troubling times.\u201d",
      "Still, there are consumers determined to buy organic. Aaron Swindle, a warehouse employee at a chain supermarket, spends every Sunday morning shopping for organic groceries at the Brighton Farmers Market.",
      "\u201cThe taste quality is different when it\u2019s growing nearby,\u201d Swindle said. He calls the Finger Lakes of New York a \u201ctrifecta,\u201d a region that contributes dairy, produce, and meat for its residents.",
      "John Bolton, owner of Bolton Farms in Hilton, New York, said he has some reservations about organic certification, but he\u2019s pursuing it for his hydroponic farm, which grows produce in nutrient-rich water instead of soil. It produces greens such as kale and chard and is popular as a supplier for restaurants in western New York, and draws waves of regular customers at the Rochester Public Market on weekends.",
      "Bolton doesn\u2019t use pesticides. On a chilly day this spring, he was at his greenhouse unloading 1,500 ladybugs to do the work of eliminating the operation\u2019s aphids. That's the kind of practice organic farms use to earn the certification, he said.",
      "He said his operations aren\u2019t immune to the dangers posed by climate change. Abnormally hot days affect their greenhouse, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to not only the people but the plants.\"",
      "But Bolton described the organic certification as economically and environmentally beneficial to his farm. Getting the certification will carry an expense, but he is confident it will be worth the price.",
      "\u201cIt helps with sales. And you feel good about it \u2013 you\u2019re doing the right practices,\u201d Bolton said.",

      "Sure, being on a budget limits your performance-car options",
      "New car prices continue to rise for the latest high-performance sports cars. Even a new Chevrolet Corvette, long considered a performance bargain compared to the likes of the Porsche 911, has a starting price of almost $70,000. But that doesn\u2019t mean driving enthusiasts on a budget can\u2019t find a car that\u2019s both fulfilling to drive and genuinely capable.",
      "The auto experts at Edmunds have come up with their five favorite performance vehicles for under $35,000. True, you won\u2019t be able to buy anything with a V8. The same applies to electric power \u2014 the best-value electric performers cost more. But the vehicles listed here have other distinct advantages. All of the following prices include destination fees.",
      "There\u2019s some irony in the first vehicle in a list of budget-performance cars not being a car at all. But Dodge\u2019s Hornet isn\u2019t your usual small SUV. First off, it has an Italian heritage. Though you wouldn\u2019t know it by its styling, the Hornet shares much of its mechanical design with the Alfa Romeo Tonale small luxury SUV. Second, it\u2019s genuinely powerful for a pint-size SUV. The GT version has a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that cranks out 268 horsepower and is good enough to get you from 0 to 60 mph in about 6.5 seconds. Another bonus: It has standard all-wheel drive for all-season driving and more cargo space than the typical performance car.",
      "2025 Hornet starting price: $31,590",
      "A Ford Mustang GT with its rumbly V8 is well beyond our $35,000 price cap. But the less expensive Ford Mustang EcoBoost is a viable substitute. Having a turbocharged four-cylinder under the hood might seem like heresy, but you can\u2019t argue with the output of 315 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. With its 10-speed automatic spinning the rear wheels, the Mustang EcoBoost can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in a quick 5.6 seconds. The newest Mustang provides a classic American driving experience while being comfortable, stylish and well equipped with the latest technology features.",
      "2025 Mustang coupe starting price: $33,515",
      "You\u2019re as likely to see a Mazda MX-5 Miata roadster in the hands of a cool-headed retiree on lonesome canyon roads as you are spotting one ripping through cones at an autocross. In both cases, the Miata\u2019s appeal comes down to the fun-to-drive fundamentals. A four-cylinder engine directs 181 horsepower to the rear wheels through either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. That\u2019s not much, but you don\u2019t need much when the car is as light as the Miata. A manual-equipped Miata went from 0 to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds at the Edmunds test track. Beyond the numbers, the Miata is all about playfulness. Quick steering, nimble handling and an easy-to-lower top combine to make any drive worthwhile.",
      "2025 MX-5 Miata starting price: $30,715",
      "The Subaru BRZ and Toyota 86 are mechanically related. Both use a four-cylinder rated at 228 horsepower that sends its power to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. Edmunds found these cars can sprint to 60 mph in about 6 seconds when equipped with the manual. There\u2019s enough power to be entertaining but not enough to get a new driver in too much trouble, making these fantastic beginner\u2019s sports cars. And there\u2019s a low center of gravity and classic rear-wheel-drive balance to help drivers enjoyably learn about car control. But the Toyabaru twins don\u2019t stop being fun once you master them.",
      "2025 Toyota GR86 starting price: $31,135; 2025 Subaru BRZ starting price: $32,380",
      "The Volkswagen GTI is the quintessential budget performance hatchback. It\u2019s fun and engaging to drive yet practical and comfortable day to day. Few cars can do as many things as well as the GTI. Its turbocharged four-cylinder engine produces 241 horsepower. For 2025, every GTI has a seven-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. Edmunds has found it\u2019s good for a 5.9-second 0-60 mph sprint. Besides performance, the GTI has a spacious cabin and a generous cargo area for its size. The original hot hatch that traces its American lineage all the way back to 1983 is a solid performance value.",
      "Starting manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price: $33,640",
      "Spending less than $35,000 can get you a fun vehicle to drive in 2025. Each model here has distinct advantages. You\u2019ll likely prefer the Hornet or Golf GTI if space and practicality are priorities. The Miata, BRZ and GR86 all provide a great feel and connection to the road; picking one of these comes down to whether you want a convertible top or the extra security of a coupe. The Mustang can\u2019t be beat for its classic pony car styling and heritage.",

      "A hearing before Nevada\u2019s high court could provide the first public view into a secretive case about who will control Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire after he dies",
      "CARSON CITY, Nev. -- A hearing Wednesday before Nevada's high court could provide the first public window into a secretive legal dispute over who will control Rupert Murdoch's powerful media empire after he dies.",
      "The case has been unfolding behind closed doors in state court in Reno, with most documents under seal. But reporting by The New York Times, which said it obtained some of the documents, revealed Murdoch's efforts to keep just one of his sons, Lachlan, in charge and ensure that Fox News maintains its conservative editorial slant.",
      "Media outlets including the Times and The Associated Press are now asking the Nevada Supreme Court to unseal the case and make future hearings public. The court is scheduled to hear arguments in the afternoon in Carson City, the capital.",
      "Murdoch\u2019s media empire, which also includes The Wall Street Journal and New York Post, spans continents and helped to shape modern American politics. Lachlan Murdoch has been the head of Fox News and News Corp. since his father stepped down in 2023.",
      "The issue at the center of the case is Rupert Murdoch's family trust, which after his death would divide control of the company equally among four of his children \u2014 Lachlan, Prudence, Elisabeth and James.",
      "Irrevocable trusts are typically used to limit estate taxes, among other reasons, and can\u2019t be changed without permission from the beneficiaries or via a court order.",
      "Rupert Murdoch has attempted to alter the trust, however, and Prudence, Elisabeth and James have united to try to stop that.

      "Sue Bird is giving another assist to USA Basketball, becoming the managing director of the women\u2019s national team",
      "NEW YORK -- Sue Bird is giving another assist to USA Basketball, becoming the managing director of the women's national team.",
      "The five-time Olympic champion was named to the newly created position Thursday and it marks a major change in the way the organization creates its roster and coaching staff.",
      "\u201cI played for USA Basketball for so long and always really enjoyed my time with them,\" Bird said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI love representing my country. I love being competitive on that stage. To have that opportunity to do it in a different role is exciting.\u201d",
      "Before the change, a committee made those decisions, but now in a move similar to what the USA men's national team does, Bird will be the one responsible for putting things together. Grant Hill has the same role on the men's side.",
      "\u201cWe are really, really excited about Sue for so many reasons,\u201d USA Basketball CEO Jim Tooley said in a phone interview. \u201cHer pedigree and standing in the sport is so strong. Not just in women\u2019s basketball, but all of sport. She\u2019s a tremendous leader and we're very excited that she took this on for us.\u201d",
      "The men's team has had a managing director for two decades with Jerry Colangelo serving in that spot from 2005-21 before Hill took over.",
      "\u201cShe's had five Olympic gold medals herself and understands what's involved,\u201d Tooley said. \u201cHaving the managing director position makes it easier to work with the staff for long term vision of the program. It's hard to do that with a committee that comes and goes and gets together a handful of times.\u201d",
      "Tooley said Bird's term will be for four years \u2014 the same as the Olympic cycle \u2014 and the change to this structure has been in the works for a few years, well before the decision to not select Caitlin Clark for the 2024 Paris Games team that left some people upset.",
      "\u201cDiscussions happened after the \u201821 Olympics and Sue served on the board last quad,\u201d Tooley said. \u201cWe got in discussions about the managing director role and we sat with her awhile and she gave it a lot of consideration and thought. It\u2019s an enormous responsibility.\u201d",
      "Bird said she's used to the pressure of USA Basketball where it's basically win a gold medal or bust. The Americans have won eight straight, including one at last year's Paris Olympics.",
      "\u201cThis is a different type of pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm hoping to bring all that I learned as a player, all my experience, all my understanding. The whole goal is to win a gold medal and it feels at times that's the only option. ... I know what it's like to be a player, know what it's like as a player to build teams and have teams come together and see what clicks.\u201d",
      "Before the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, the Americans will play in the FIBA World Cup in Germany next year. The first qualifying event will take place in November. Besides figuring out what players will be on that team, Bird will have to decide who will be coaching the squad. There is no clear-cut choice right now.",
      "\u201cOf course I\u2019ve started to think about it, jotting some names down here and there,\u201d Bird said. \u201cIt's the first priority without a doubt. There are so many qualified coaches in college and the WNBA.\u201d",
      "Bird said that she doesn't have a specific time frame to have a coach in place.",

      "The top-ranked player is returning to tennis at the Italian Open this week after his settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency raised questions, since it conveniently allowed Sinner not to miss any Grand Slams and come back at his home tournament.",
      "\u201cAt the start of the suspension I received some surprising messages from some players, whereas there were others who I would have expected to hear from that didn\u2019t send anything,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to name names.\u201d",
      "The settlement was made after WADA appealed a decision last year by the International Tennis Integrity Agency to fully exonerate Sinner for what it deemed to be an accidental contamination by a banned anabolic steroid in March 2024.",
      "Many fellow pros feel Sinner was treated too lightly and Sinner recently discussed how he didn\u2019t really feel comfortable in the locker room and the players' lounge during his run to a second straight Australian Open title in January, noting that \u201cplayers were looking at me differently.\u201d",

      "In the final month of his ban, Sinner practiced with Jack Draper, Lorenzo Sonego and Rune at his training base in Monaco.",
      "At the start of his suspension, Sinner was banned from entering any sanctioned sports event.",

      "In March, professional cyclist Giulio Ciccone posted a photo on Instagram of himself posing during a bike outing with Sinner and Ferrari endurance drivers Alberto Giovinazzi and Alessandro Pier Guidi.",
      "Cahill has announced he will retire at the end of the year and Vagnozzi was asked if he would consider then coaching Sinner on his own.",
      "\u201cI would be able to do it on my own,\" Vagnozzi said. \"But with players of this level it\u2019s important to have another viewpoint. And it\u2019s important to sometimes split up the weeks you spend with the player. Otherwise it\u2019s a 365-day/year job and that\u2019s a bit much.",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019m hoping that Darren stays on for another five years, because we have such a great relationship. He might be the best coach ever in terms of results and other factors.\u201d",
      "Vagnozzi referred to how Sinner is the fourth player the Australian has coached to No. 1 after Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt and Simona Halep. \u201cBut most of all, he\u2019s a special person.\u201d",
      "Sinner will play his opening match on Saturday against No. 99 Mariano Navone, who beat 18-year-old Italian wild card Federico Cin\u00e0 6-3, 6-3 on Thursday. Sinner enters on a 21-match winning streak but hasn\u2019t played an official match since January.",
      "Also, the red clay at the Foro Italico is not Sinner\u2019s best surface. Only one of his 19 career titles has come on the dirt, in Umag, Croatia, in 2022.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the surface where he is the least sure of himself,\u201d Vagnozzi said. \u201cBut last year he had a good clay season, reached the semifinals in Monte Carlo and the French Open and the quarterfinals in Madrid. \u2026 So I think he can do well here, too.\u201d",

      "Real Madrid earned almost 139 million euros ($154 million) from its title-winning campaign in the Champions League last season and this season's winner should get more.",
      "Last year's prize fund of more than 2 billion euros ($2.22 billion) rose by 25% this season in the expanded format featuring more teams (36, up from 32) and more games (eight instead of six in the first stage).",
      "So expect PSG or Inter earn at least 150 million euros ($170 million) if the team winds up as champion.",
      "These coffers can be further boosted across June and July, when both teams will be in the United States for the expanded 32-team Club World Cup. Winning that competition could net PSG or Inter more than $100 million from the $1 billion prize money fund.",
      "The finalists have never met in the Champions League.",
      "That's a refreshing rarity for two big clubs who regularly compete in Europe.",
      "PSG became the third French team to reach the European Cup final on two occasions, after Reims (1956 and \u201859) and Marseille (1991 and \u201993). PSG's other time was in 2020, when losing to Bayern Munich 1-0 in Lisbon.",
      "PSG's road to Munich has gone mostly through England. After seeing off fellow French club Brest in the playoffs, PSG has beaten Liverpool, Aston Villa and lastly Arsenal in successive rounds in the knockout stage \u2014 having also defeated then-Premier League champion Manchester City in a key victory in the next-to-last round of the league stage. Qualification was in the balance at that stage, with PSG having won just one of its first five league games only to win its last three.",
      "Inter was a two-time European champion before PSG was even founded in 1970, after titles in 1964 and 1965, while the Italian team added a third European crown in 2010.",
      "Unlike PSG, Inter qualified directly to the last 16 after finishing in fourth place, conceding just one goal in its eight league games. In the knockout stage, Simone Inzaghi's team overcame Feyenoord in the round of 16, Bayern in the quarterfinals and Lamine Yamal and Barcelona in a pair of epic legs in the semifinals.",

      "The Warriors said Curry would be sidelined at least a week after the injury Tuesday night forced him out early in second quarter of Game 1, which they went on to win 99-88. He had 13 points in 13 minutes to help Golden State build a comfortable lead and take home-court advantage away from the Timberwolves.",

      "Curry missed multiple games because of injuries during the 2016 and 2018 playoffs, absences the Warriors endured on their way to the NBA Finals. They lost to Cleveland in seven games for the 2016 championship, and they swept the Cavaliers in 2018 for a third title in four years.",

      "The Pittsburgh Steelers have run out of patience with wide receiver George Pickens",
      "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers have run out patience with wide receiver George Pickens, agreeing Wednesday on a trade that sends the talented but mercurial 24-year-old to the Dallas Cowboys.",
      "The Steelers will get a third-round pick in the 2026 draft and a fifth-rounder in 2027. The Cowboys get a sixth-round choice in two years.",
      "The trade was first reported by ESPN.",
      "Pickens is about to enter the final year of the rookie deal he signed in 2022 when the Steelers took the former Georgia star in the second round. The 6-foot-3, 200-pound Pickens has spent his first three seasons in the NFL being equal parts productive and petulant, mixing highlight-reel catches with bouts of immaturity along the way.",
      "Pickens joins a Cowboys offense that could use another downfield threat to pair with star CeeDee Lamb. Dallas\u2019 second-leading pass catcher behind Lamb last year was tight end Jake Ferguson, with Jalen Tolbert\u2019s modest 49 receptions a distant third.",
      "Dallas didn't address the need for a No. 2 receiver in the draft, with first-year coach Brian Schottenheimer saying he liked the youth that was already on the roster. Owner and general manager Jerry Jones made reference before the draft to \u201csubstantive\u201d trades the Cowboys were pursuing. This qualifies as one.",
      "The Steelers, particularly head coach Mike Tomlin, frequently backed Pickens as he endured what the team frequently described as a version of growing pains while he adjusted to life in the NFL.",
      "Pickens has been one of the most dynamic receivers in the league when he's on the field and engaged, which is not always a given. Pickens led the league by averaging 18.1 yards per catch in 2023 and has 174 receptions for 2,841 yards and 12 scores in 48 games.",
      "Yet he's also consistently struggled to keep his emotions in check. Last season alone he twice ended games by getting into dust-ups with opposing defensive backs, first when he grabbed Dallas' Jourdan Lewis by the facemask and then when he tussled with Cleveland's Greg Newsome II rather than try to get in position for a last-second Hail Mary.",
      "That doesn't include a fine for using an expletive on his eye black against the Cowboys, a rule he said he was unaware of at the time. Pickens also drew widespread criticism in 2023 for what could generously be described as inattentive downfield blocking for his teammates.",
      "Considering his volatility, the Steelers didn't seem interested in signing Pickens to a contract extension and he became expendable when they traded for two-time Pro Bowler DK Metcalf in March, whom they promptly signed to a five-year contract.",

      "Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty is not running in the Preakness Stakes and that means for a fifth time in the past seven years there is no chance of a Triple Crown champion going into the race",
      "Just a few days after winning the Kentucky Derby, Sovereignty was ruled out of running in the Preakness Stakes.",
      "It is the second time in four years the owner and trainer of the Derby champion opted to skip the Preakness in favor of the Belmont Stakes in June. Rich Strike also bypassed the Preakness in 2022 after winning at Churchill Downs at odds of 80-1.",
      "Country House did not run in 2019 because of illness after getting elevated to Derby winner when Maximum Security was disqualified for interference, the races were run out of order in 2020 and Medina Spirit ran and finished third in the 2021 Preakness after being DQed from his first-place finish in the Derby for a positive drug test.",
      "That means this is the fifth time in seven years that the Preakness gates open at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore without even a chance at a Triple Crown. That was only the case once in the previous 33 years from to 1986-2018, and that happened because a horse was retired because of injury after taking the Run for the Roses.",
      "Horse racing has changed from its heyday, when stars of the sport like War Admiral, Secretariat and Seattle Slew were used to running every couple of weeks. Breeding, money and other factors have changed that, and the top 3-year-old horses eligible for the Triple Crown race far less often, with bigger stretches in between.",
      "\u201cMost trainers hate running their horses back in two weeks,\u201d NBC Sports analyst Randy Moss said. \u201cThey feel like it\u2019s bad for the horses.\u201d",
      "Beginning in the early 21st century, many of the Derby horses who finish between second and 20th started getting more rest to wait five weeks for the Belmont. It was essentially automatic that the Derby winner would go, though not anymore.",
      "\u201cThe trainers of Derby winners that do run back in the Preakness do it out of a sense of tradition \u2014 not because they like it,\u201d Moss said.",
      "Sovereignty's Bill Mott made that clear the morning after his horse passed Journalism down the stretch in the mud at Churchill Downs with a record audience watching, casting doubt on the Preakness.",
      "\u201cWe want to do what\u2019s best for the horse,\u201d Mott told reporters in Louisville, Kentucky, on Sunday. \u201cOf course, you always think about a Triple Crown, and that\u2019s not something we\u2019re not going to think about.\u201d",
      "The debate has been raging for decades about horses not being able to handle the grind of three premier races over a span of five weeks. That was primarily because no one swept the Triple Crown between Affirmed in 1978 and American Pharoah in 2015, a 37-year drought that made industry stakeholders question tradition versus modern-day changes.",
      "Justify doing it in 2018 to give the sport a pair of Triple Crown champions in four years quieted that talk. The recent uncertainty about Derby winners going to the Preakness reignited the chatter.",
      "Prominent owner Mike Repole shared a proposal on social media Tuesday that would move the Belmont up to second in the rotation and shift the Preakness back to provide more spacing. Others have suggested moving the Preakness back to the first Saturday in June and the Belmont to the first Saturday in July.",
      "No one really knows. And does there need to be seismic change like the pitch clock in baseball?",
      "Maybe, maybe not. After all, the previous two Derby winners \u2014 Mystik Dan last year and Mage in 2023 \u2014 wheeled back after two weeks to finish in the money at the Preakness.",
      "They didn't win, but their trainers wanted to give it a shot. And Bob Baffert-trained American Pharoah and Justify completing the Triple Crown showed it was possible.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see Triple Crown winners because there will occasionally be horses like American Pharoah and like Justify who are good enough to blow up any of the current thoughts about spacing,\u201d Moss said.",
      "And trainers who aren't worried about it. Baffert and 89-year-old fellow Hall of Famer D. Wayne Lukas have shown a willingness to go for it after winning the Derby \u2014 and even when they don't. Lukas intends to run American Promise in the Preakness after a 16th place finish in Kentucky.",
      "Others have chosen to play it more safe, which, if that becomes the trend, puts the future of the Preakness in peril.",

      "Pending approval, the $2.8 billion House settlement will allow schools to share revenue with athletes directly for use of their name, image and likeness",
      "The $2.8 billion NCAA settlement awaiting final approval from a federal judge is touted as a solution for thousands of athletes to finally get the money they deserve and provide some clarity to recruiting. For some, it may have come too late.",
      "Sophomore distance runner Jake Rimmel says he was one of five walk-ons cut from Virginia Tech\u2019s cross country team after Thanksgiving break. Rimmel decided to take a leave of absence and train independently while considering his next move \u2014 something that\u2019s proven easier said than done.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their hands tied right now, so there\u2019s just not many opportunities for me,\u201d Rimmel told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019ve just been having to bet on myself and trust the process. It\u2019s just been lonely. I\u2019ve been at home training by myself and living with my family again. Thank God for my family and all, I appreciate them. It\u2019s still kind of lonely though, being out of the norm, not being at school and with my friends.\"",
      "Pending approval, the so-called House settlement will allow schools to share revenue with athletes directly for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL). That could secure generational wealth for some but not others, and replacing scholarship caps with roster limitations is expected to leave walk-ons, partial scholarship earners, nonrevenue sport athletes and high school recruits at risk. There are deep concerns about the potential impact on sports that feed the U.S. Olympic teams.",
      "U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken told attorneys handling the settlement to come back to her with a plan soon to protect athletes currently or recently on rosters at schools across the country, a request seen as a way to soften the blow.",
      "That filing came late Wednesday, with attorneys saying schools must offer athletes who lost their spots a chance to play \u2014 at their old school or their new school \u2014 without counting against the roster limits for as long as they have eligibility.",
      "There is no guarantee those athletes will win a spot on the roster and, for now, thousands of athletes like Rimmel have no idea where they might be this fall or are in jeopardy of no longer playing college sports at all. And many athletes balancing school and their sport are unaware of what\u2019s at stake and have more questions than answers.",
      "Belmont track and field athlete Sabrina Oostburg said everything she knows about the settlement is from personal research.",
      "\u201cMy school doesn\u2019t do a lot of education around it (the settlement). Every now and then, we\u2019ll be told, \u2018Hey, if you want to sign up to potentially get some money from this House settlement that\u2019s happening, you can do that,\u2019\u201d Oostburg said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the education we\u2019re being given is optional to consume, even though it\u2019s limited.\u201d",
      "Oostburg is used to taking matters into her own hands, securing over 50 NIL deals by herself. She has contacted lawyers and asked for updates on the settlement, but she\u2019s not quite reassured. The chaotic nature of college athletics, so obvious to the public, is even worse for the athletes themselves.",
      "\u201cBeing a college athlete, it\u2019s so hard to stay up to date with what\u2019s happening every day because it\u2019s so constantly changing,\u201d she said.",
      "Smaller, nonrevenue-generating programs don\u2019t often have a point person to navigate NIL deals or educate athletes. At Belmont, Oostburg said, NIL-related responsibilities are managed by an already busy compliance office.",
      "\u201cTo take time to learn about what\u2019s happening is just so time-consuming, especially if you\u2019re not in that one percent or one of the football players where they have people dedicated to helping them stay up to date,\u201d she said.",
      "Over the next six weeks, athletes will wrap up their spring semesters and many of them have league tournaments or even NCAA championship competition ahead before what many expect will be the final summer before college sports sees some of the most dramatic changes in history.",
      "For athletes like Rimmel, those changes are already here. On the bright side, his name was among those on an eight-page list of \u201cdesignated student-athletes\u201d released in Wednesday's court filing, meaning he is one of many who will be able to seek a roster spot without counting against a school's roster limit.",
      "Some of the others cut from the Virginia Tech program have given up on their dreams of collegiate running altogether. Rimmel hasn't given up completely; he spoke with his former coach recently, who said the Hokies' athletics department is still trying to figure out what\u2019s to come.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still kind of hoping I might be able to find my way back there next fall,\" he said.",

      "It is Presti's first time winning the award and the first time since 1994 that the franchise \u2014 which was then called the Seattle SuperSonics \u2014 had its top executive voted as the winner. Bob Whitsitt won it that season.",
      "Presti, the Thunder's executive vice president and general manager, got 10 first-place votes from a panel of 30 basketball executives \u2014 one from each of the NBA\u2019s teams \u2014 who ranked their top three choices in order. Presti appeared on 22 of those 30 ballots.",
      "\u201cI look at it like it\u2019s a tremendous privilege to be able to do it,\u201d Presti said at the start of the season when asked about his job. \u201cEventually someone else is going to be the person that\u2019s doing it, and for me, while I\u2019m serving the position, I think I\u2019ve said this in the past, it\u2019s not my job, it\u2019s the Thunder\u2019s job. I\u2019m just serving the position the best that I can and hopefully doing a good job with it for as many people as possible, and I enjoy it.\u201d",
      "Cleveland\u2019s Koby Altman was second with six first-place votes, after the Cavaliers won 64 games and finished atop the Eastern Conference standings. Detroit\u2019s Trajan Langdon also got six first-place votes and was third, after the Pistons went from a 14-win team to a 44-win playoff team in his first year leading that front office.",
      "Houston\u2019s Rafael Stone (four first-place votes) was fourth, the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 Lawrence Frank (one first-place vote) was fifth and the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 Rob Pelinka (also one first-place vote) was sixth. Pelinka engineered the biggest trade of the season, the one that brought Luka Doncic to the Lakers from the Dallas Mavericks \u2014 but was listed on only five of the 30 ballots cast.",

      "Sacramento\u2019s Monte McNair was 11th, while Orlando\u2019s Jeff Weltman and San Antonio\u2019s Brian Wright tied for 12th.",
      "The executive of the year award is not like most NBA season honors that are voted on by a global panel of 100 writers and broadcasters who cover the league and cast ballots shortly after the end of the regular season.",
      "Awards that were part of that voting process and have already had their results unveiled: Cleveland's Kenny Atkinson winning Coach of the Year, Atlanta\u2019s Dyson Daniels winning Most Improved Player, San Antonio\u2019s Stephon Castle winning Rookie of the Year, Cleveland\u2019s Evan Mobley winning Defensive Player of the Year, New York\u2019s Jalen Brunson winning Clutch Player of the Year, and Boston\u2019s Payton Pritchard winning Sixth Man of the Year.",
      "Other awards announced by the league since the end of the regular season: Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry won the Twyman-Stokes teammate of the year award, Warriors teammate Draymond Green won the hustle award and Boston\u2019s Jrue Holiday won the sportsmanship award for the second time in his career. The league\u2019s social justice champion will be revealed Wednesday.",

      "GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- Florida basketball coach Todd Golden has signed a contract extension that raises his annual salary to $6 million, a lucrative bump nearly a month after the Gators won the national championship.",
      "Golden inked a six-year, $40.5 million extension Tuesday night, adding a year to his current deal and putting him under contract through the 2030-31 season. He signed a two-year extension in March 2024 that increased his average salary to $4.1 million annually.",
      "His latest raise is a significant commitment from Florida and puts Golden nearly on par with football coach Billy Napier, who is scheduled to make $7.4 million in 2025.",
      "Golden\u2019s deal pays $6 million a year (beginning April 16, 2025), with a $300,000 pay hike every year after.",
      "The new money makes the 39-year-old Golden the second-highest-paid basketball coach in the Southeastern Conference behind Arkansas\u2019 John Calipari, who earns $8 million annually. Golden, once an assistant under Bruce Pearl at Auburn who got his first head coaching job at San Francisco in 2019, previously ranked 12th out of 16 coaches in the league.",
      "He now jumps to fifth among the seven active coaches with national titles, behind Bill Self of Kansas, Calipari, UConn\u2019s Dan Hurley and Michigan State\u2019s Tom Izzo.",
      "Golden\u2019s new deal is nearly fully guaranteed. Florida would owe him 85% of the remaining value if the school fired him without cause at any point.",
      "Golden\u2019s buyout to leave Gainesville starts at $16 million next season and drops annually: $11 million in 2026-27; $4 million in 2027-28; $3 million in 2028-29; $2 million in 2029-30; and $1 million in 2030-31.",
      "However, Golden can leave for the NBA at a much lower price. His NBA buyout begins at $3 million next season and drops to $2 million (2026-28) and then $1 million in 2028-29.",
      "Included in Golden\u2019s annual compensation is a $500,000 signing bonus, a $500,000 annual longevity incentive and a $60,000 annual expense account. In addition to that, he gets $70,000 annually in travel allowance for using the university athletic association\u2019s plane and other fringe benefits valued at $62,000.",
      "He would get a $100,000 bonus for winning the SEC regular-season championship, a $50,000 bonus for winning the SEC Tournament, a $100,000 bonus for making the NCAA Tournament and a $50,000 bonus for every NCAA Tournament victory.",
      "With Golden at the helm for his third season in Gainesville, the Gators finished 36-4 and beat Houston to clinch the program\u2019s third national title. They won their final 12 games, including four in the NCAA Tournament in come-from-behind fashion.",
      "Florida\u2019s style of play under Golden has drawn rave reviews, leading to sellouts in eight of the team\u2019s last 10 home games. Florida averaged 84.8 points a game this season after setting the program record (85.6) during the 2023-24 campaign.",
      "Golden became the third coach this century to win a national title within his first three seasons on the job, joining North Carolina\u2019s Roy Williams (2005) and UConn\u2019s Kevin Ollie (2014). Williams and Ollie accomplished the feat in their second seasons.",
      "Golden has a modest rebuild on his hands now. Leading scorer Walter Clayton, the Final Four\u2019s Most Outstanding Player, is headed to the NBA along with fellow guards Alijah Martin and Will Richard. Forwards Alex Condon and Rueben Chinyelu are going through the NBA draft process with the potential to stay in school and return for next season.",
      "Backup guard Denzel Aberdeen (Kentucky) and backup forward Sam Alexis (Indiana) transferred, and assistant coaches Kevin Hovde (Columbia) and John Andrzejek (Campbell) took head coaching jobs.",

      "MILAN -- Inter Milan has another Champions League final to look forward to. Once the players catch their breath, that is.",
      "In the end it took extra time, two astonishing comebacks and 13 goals to separate Barcelona and Inter and see the Italian club \u2014 which was a mere seconds away from elimination \u2014 prevail 7-6 on aggregate after winning another rollercoaster encounter 4-3 on Tuesday.",
      "Substitute Davide Frattesi was the extra-time star for Inter, firing home in the 99th minute to leave the Barcelona players slumped to the ground while his Nerazzurri teammates \u2014 including those on the bench \u2014 were racing to celebrate with him.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened tonight. I\u2019m lucky I managed to finish the game, I screamed so much (in celebration) that I saw everything black,\u201d Frattesi told Italian broadcaster Sky.",
      "Moments earlier, he'd been encouraging the already loud San Siro crowd to make more noise and the atmosphere grew more feverish after Frattesi delivered on his super-sub reputation again.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s part of my career,\" the midfielder said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t given so much incredible talent, but I am always the last one to give up and the first one to believe we can do it. At 3-3, I told Marcus (Thuram) that we would go through.\u201d",
      "Three-time European champion Inter, which lost the 2023 final to Manchester City, will face either Paris Saint-Germain or Arsenal in Munich on May 31 for the title. PSG beat Arsenal 1-0 in London last week in their first match. The return leg is Wednesday in Paris.",
      "Inter coach Simone Inzaghi thinks his squad has shown in wins over Barcelona in the semis and Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals that it can compete against the very best.",
      "\u201cMy players have been extraordinary, they've put out there two monstrous performances to get to this final,\u201d he said. \"We have to continue. The final will be played against a really great team, whether it's Arsenal or PSG. Barcelona and Bayern are probably the best teams in Europe at the moment, but it will still be difficult.\"",
      "There was little sign at halftime of the drama to play out. Inter was comfortably leading 2-0 after Lautaro Mart\u00ednez scored and earned a penalty, which was converted by Hakan \u00c7alhano\u011flu.",
      "But Barcelona had been in that position before, having gone 2-0 down early last week in the first leg before securing a thrilling 3-3 draw.",
      "And Eric Garc\u00eda scored nine minutes after the break before Dani Olmo headed in the equalizer six minutes later.",
      "Raphina appeared to have secured the win for Barcelona when he put the Spanish club ahead two minutes before full time, tucking away the rebound after Yann Sommer had saved his initial shot.",
      "However, 37-year-old Francesco Acerbi astonishingly leveled in stoppage time \u2014 with his first goal in European competition \u2014 to add another 30 minutes of time.",
      "Frattesi had proved crucial off the substitutes' bench before, both for Italy and Inter, and so he was again, controlling Mehdi Taremi's pass and beating Pau Cubars\u00ed before curling past Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny.",
      "Barcelona almost leveled again but Sommer made a fingertip save to push Lamine Yamal's shot past his post.",
      "Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said he told his players \u201cI know everyone is disappointed \u2026 but at the end we can be proud of our performance.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud of my team,\" he said. \"We have to accept it and we start again next season.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Mike Shildt had seen enough, and he was so angry with plate umpire Adrian Johnson that he made a spectacle by tossing his spectacles.",
      "A tantrum by San Diego's manager following the first major league ejection of star slugger Fernando Tatis Jr. fired up the Padres, who overcame a three-run deficit in the eighth inning to beat the New York Yankees 4-3 on a soggy Monday night and extend their winning streak to six.",
      "\u201cShilty came down the tunnel and he was still chirping,\u201d said Xander Bogaerts, who hit a go-ahead, two-run single off Luke Weaver that followed Manny Machado's two-run double. \u201cI think he was ready to fight.\u201d",
      "Tatis was ejected after a strikeout, causing Shildt to rush out onto the field, throwing his lineup card and then his glasses. He argued so vociferously with Johnson and first base ump Quinn Wolcott that third base coach Tim Leiper ran over in case intervention was needed.",
      "\u201cMy glasses made it. I did have my head about me to make sure,\u201d Shildt said after the game. \u201cI got some \u2014 a lot of BPs on my shoulders \u2014 not as operable as I\u2019d like but it came into play, and I made sure it stayed in the grass. I didn\u2019t want them scratched. I like these glasses a lot.\u201d",
      "Devin Williams entered with a 3-0 lead and walked Tyler Wade with one out in the eighth, then allowed a single to Brandon Lockridge. Williams threw four straight changeups, his famous Airbender, to Tatis. The two-time All-Star took the third at the bottom of the strike zone for strike two, then swung over an even lower pitch.",
      "He said something in Johnson's left ear before taking a turn to the dugout and was immediately tossed. Tatis said it was his first ejection since winter ball as an 18-year-old.",
      "\u201cAh, what did I say? I forgot,\u201d Tatis said, laughing. \u201cI'm just happy I got the boys hyped.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d just been complaining all game. It was a rough night,\u201d he added. \u201cAfter the strikeout I just let him know what I thought.\u201d",

      "\u201cTatis made me hot,\u201d Arraez said. \u201cI love Mike Shildt. He supports his players, and when I saw that thing, I said: `We come back!'\u201d",
      "Yankees manager Aaron Boone brought in Weaver, who had not allowed a run in 13 prior appearances this year. Machado doubled on a 1-1 fastball, cutting the deficit to 3-2, and Bogaerts singled on a first-pitch cutter.",
      "\u201cTati had some pitches that (he) didn\u2019t agree with \u2014 I didn\u2019t agree with earlier and made my comments from the dugout known, which I don\u2019t do a ton,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cDid it. Walks away, hand over his mouth, and next thing you know he\u2019s ejected walking away with his back turned for his first major league ejection.\u201d",
      "Shildt's ejection was the 15th of his six-season big league managerial career.",
      "\u201cI probably have the fewest amount of player ejections in my time managing, so our players play, they stay in the game, they\u2019re very respectful, rightfully so, to the umpires,\u201d he said. \u201cI'll let the body of the work for the umpire grade speak for itself, and we\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d",
      "A two-time All-Star acquired from Milwaukee in December, Williams has a 10.03 ERA in 14 games with the Yankees, walking 10 in 11 2/3 innings. On a night with near-constant rain that caused a pair of 28-minute delays, Williams said he had trouble with his landing spot.",
      "\u201cI couldn't figure it out with the release point on my fastball,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cIt's part of the business. It's part of being in New York,\" said starter Carlos Rod\u00f3n, booed during a poor first season with the Yankees in 2023. \u201cIf you don't pitch well, you're going to be get booed but if you pitch well, they're going to praise you. They're going to love you.\u201d",

      "The Braves haven't had a no-hitter since Kent Mercker pitched one at Dodger Stadium on April 8, 1994. They haven't thrown one at home since Sept. 11, 1991, when Mercker went the first six innings in a combined no-no with Mark Wohlers (two innings) and Alejandro Pe\u00f1a (one inning) in a 1-0 win against the Padres.",
      "Braves shortstop Nick Allen made a nifty play on a hard-hit grounder with one out in the third to keep the latest no-hit bid intact for a while.",
      "\u201cAll you want as a defender is just to make plays for him, when you kind of look up at the board and you\u2019re seeing what you\u2019re seeing, no hits or something like that,\u201d Allen said. \u201cYou want to get everything, dive for anything. Unfortunately, they got the one in the eighth. But he threw it so well today, and with conviction. And that\u2019s all you can ask for. And when he does that, I mean, look what happens.\u201d",
      "Smith-Shawver walked two batters in the first before striking out Spencer Steer to end the inning. He also issued two walks with two outs in the fourth, then retired the next 10 batters before Espinal\u2019s hit.",
      "\u201cI feel like I used my heater pretty well today. I feel like I had good results on it all day. And then it was curveball-split,\" Smith-Shawver said. \u201cIt was really just kind of leaning on that (fastball) and getting myself into good counts and getting myself out of bad counts. But I thought everything was kind of working today.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Winning the second draw at the NHL draft lottery and moving up from having the 14th pick to No. 4 is the latest development setting up a momentous summer for the Utah Hockey Club",
      "When the Utah Hockey Club selected Tij Iginla with the sixth pick and took 10 other players in the first draft since the team moved to Salt Lake City, fans were excited, thinking they would be in the NHL right away.",
      "General manager Bill Armstrong tried to temper expectations, telling them, \u201cNo, it takes some time.\u201d After an unexpected victory off the ice Monday night in the draft lottery, the expectations for the club's future are Rocky Mountain high once again.",
      "Utah won the second random draw of lottery balls to move up from the 14th pick to No. 4, adding to an already momentous summer that could feature a free agent spending spree with tons of salary cap space and an owner not afraid to spend money, the first phase of massive arena renovations taking place and the full-time name getting unveiled before next season.",
      "\u201cIt's a game-changer for us,\u201d Armstrong said on a post-lottery video call with reporters. \"These are exciting times for Utah. ... Just great stuff for the franchise. I can\u2019t express in words on the excitement of when that happened and the opportunity in front of us.\u201d",
      "Armstrong has over $22 million in room, and with Ryan Smith's ownership group in charge, there's every indication Utah can spend to the annually increasing cap. That was never the case under a procession of penny-pinching owners over the past decade as the Arizona Coyotes.",
      "Utah committed $80 million-plus in player salaries this past season, and Smith Entertainment Group along with the city are investing plenty to upgrade downtown Delta Center and increase the capacity of full-ice views to over 16,000 for hockey in an arena initially designed and built primarily for basketball for the NBA's Jazz.",
      "\u201cWe are excited for the challenge as we kick off this never-before-done renovation project,\u201d Ryan and wife Ashley Smith said last week. \u201cThis transformation will create the most compelling, welcoming and exciting experience for hockey fans, while also allowing us to maintain the steep vertical seating for basketball that has made Delta Center such a dynamic venue.\u201d",
      "And, possibly soon, a venue for playoff hockey. Utah was in the race until the final few weeks of the season before finishing seven points out of the second and final wild-card spot in the Western Conference.",
      "\u201cWe were a pretty good team that chased it down the stretch playing meaningful games and chasing a playoff spot,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to that point where we\u2019re becoming a really good team that\u2019s going to have a chance to get into the playoffs.\u201d",
      "Not counting the expanded pandemic playoffs in 2020, this organization has not qualified since 2012. The building blocks to end that decade-plus drought are there, from captain Clayton Keller and 2022 No. 3 pick and budding star Logan Cooley to two-time Stanley Cup-winning defenseman Mikhail Sergachev \u2014 acquired at the draft last year \u2014 and top goaltender Karel Vejmelka.",
      "And after drafting a league-high 42 players over the past four years, there might be a temptation to use the fourth pick for immediate help, like someone who is established but still young and entering or in his prime.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something that obviously we\u2019ll always talk about,\" Armstrong said. \"We\u2019ll never shut that door. That\u2019s always been an avenue for us to get players, and we\u2019re at the position right now as a team where we\u2019re trying to make that next step, so we\u2019ll always look at that. That\u2019s part of the process.\u201d",
      "The final step in the naming process is happening, too. The finalists have been narrowed down to Mammoth, Outlaws and Utah Hockey Club, complete with a permanent logo and new jerseys.",
      "If the branding process goes as swimmingly as the first year with Smith's group in charge, the results on the business side could even exceed the hockey progress.",
      "\u201cThey made a lot of promises, and they exceeded them with what they accomplished in a short period of time,\u201d Commissioner Gary Bettman said last week at a meeting of Associated Press Sports Editors in New York. \u201cWhat they accomplished is a testament to Ryan and everybody out there. They dreamed big and they accomplished everything they needed to do, and we\u2019re thrilled to have them in the league. It\u2019s been an incredibly positive experience, and the players love it, too.\"",
      "More high-quality players are coming next year and into the future, though Armstrong cautioned that the lottery doesn't speed up the building process and, \u201cOne pick's not going to change our franchise.\u201d But that doesn't dull the internal excitement.",
      "\"You\u2019ve got a chance to get a real game-changer,\" Armstrong said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have the opportunity to pick a real good player high in the draft and take a big swing here.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Eggs are less likely to crack when they fall on their side, according to experiments with over 200 eggs.",
      "What does this mean for the best way to crack an egg for breakfas t? Not much, since a break around the middle is the best way to get the golden yolk and runny whites to ooze out.",
      "But scientists said it could help with hard-boiling eggs in a pot: Dropping eggs in horizontally may be less likely to cause a stray crack that can unleash the egg's insides in a puffy, cloudy mess.",
      "It's commonly thought that eggs are strongest at their ends \u2014 after all, it's how they're packaged in the carton. The thinking is that the arc-shaped bottom of an egg redirects the force and softens the blow of impact.",
      "But when scientists squeezed eggs in both directions during a compression test, they cracked under the same amount of force.",
      "\u201cThe fun started when we thought we would get one result and then we saw another,\u201d said Hudson Borja da Rocha with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped run the experiments.",
      "The researchers also ran simulations and dropped eggs horizontally and vertically from three short heights up to 0.4 inches (10 millimeters).",
      "The egg result? The ones dropped horizontally cracked less .",
      "\u201cThe common sense is that the egg in the vertical direction is stronger than if you lay the egg down. But they proved that's not the case,\u201d said materials scientist Marc Meyers with the University of California, San Diego who was not involved with the new study.",
      "Scientists found that the egg's equator was more flexible and absorbed more of the energy of the fall before cracking. The findings were published Thursday in the journal Communications Physics.",
      "Eggs are also usually nestled top-down into homemade contraptions for egg drop challenges as part of school STEM projects, which partially inspired the new study. It's not yet clear whether the new results will help protect these vulnerable eggs, which are dropped at much loftier heights.",

      "More than a dozen states are suing the Trump administration for withholding funds from for the buildout of electric vehicle chargers across the U.S. The federal lawsuit says $5 billion allocated to states under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed ...",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Seventeen states are suing President Donald Trump 's administration for withholding billions of dollars for building more electric vehicle chargers, according to a federal lawsuit announced Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration in February directed states to stop spending money for electric vehicle charging infrastructure that was allocated under President Joe Biden \u2014 part of a broader push by the Republican president to roll back environmental policies advanced by his Democratic predecessor. The EV charger program was set to allocate $5 billion over five years to various states, of which an estimated $3.3 billion had already been made available.",
      "The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California, Colorado and Washington, and challenges the Federal Highway Administration's authority to halt the funding. They argue Congress, which approved the money in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, holds that authority.",
      "\"These funds were going to be used to shape the future of transportation,\u201d California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, calling it \u201cshort-sighted\u201d of Trump to revoke the funds.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t sit back while the Trump administration violates the law,\u201d Bonta, a Democrat, said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "EVs stood at about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com, a sign the market is growing \u2014 although the pace has slowed as the auto industry tries to convince mainstream buyers about going electric. The program was meant to assuage some concerns and build infrastructure along highway corridors first, then address gaps elsewhere once the state highway obligations were met.",
      "Some states with projects running under the program have already been reimbursed by the Biden-era federal funds. Others are still contracting for their sites. Still more had halted their plans by the time the Trump administration ordered states to stop their spending. Regardless, getting these chargers installed and operating has been a slow process with contracting challenges, permitting delays and complex electrical upgrades.",
      "It was expected that states would fight against the federal government\u2019s efforts to slow the nation\u2019s electric vehicle charger buildout. New York, for example, which is part of the suit, has been awarded over $175 million in federal funds from the program, and state officials say $120 million is currently being withheld by the Trump administration.",
      "Even the electric carmaker Tesla, run by Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency efforts to cut federal spending, benefited greatly from funding under the program, receiving millions of dollars to expand its already-massive footprint of chargers in the U.S.",
      "Despite threats to the program, experts have said they expect the nation\u2019s EV charging buildout to continue as automakers look to make good on massive electrification ambitions.",
      "Consumers thinking about buying an EV often cite concerns about the availability of charging infrastructure. It's a hurdle for people living in multifamily dwellings and in rural areas, or what are otherwise known as \u201ccharging deserts.\u201d It's also a problem for people who can't find a place to charge their vehicle near their work, or who often drive longer highway routes.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said withholding the funds was illegal and would kill thousands of U.S. jobs, ceding them to China.",
      "\"Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon \u2014 and the nation \u2014 by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding,\u201d Newsom said, referencing Trump's recent purchase of a Tesla in a show of support for Musk.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to withdraw funding for electric vehicle chargers is part of a broader push to roll back environmental policies advanced under Biden.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first week back in office, he signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again, reverse a 2030 target for electric vehicles to make up half of new cars sold, and end environmental justice efforts. At the same time, federal agencies under Trump have rolled back key rules and regulations and supported the build-out of the fossil fuel industry.",
      "The U.S. House also advanced proposals last week aimed at blocking California from enforcing vehicle-emission rules, including a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The Senate parliamentarian says the California policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",

      "The agency's law enforcement office, which is investigating the attack, was searching for a \u201cperson of interest\u201d spotted by a witness. Officials were also looking for the owner of a vehicle seen in a parking lot near the cove behind a condominium building that may be connected with the Sunday evening attack, according to NOAA.",

      "A new study out in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment finds that wildfires fueled by climate change are linked to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic burden",
      "Wildfires driven by climate change contribute to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic costs from wildfire smoke in the United States, according to a new study.",
      "The paper, published Friday in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment, found that from 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to about 15,000 deaths from exposure to small particulate matter from wildfires and cost about $160 billion. The annual range of deaths was 130 to 5,100, the study showed, with the highest in states such as Oregon and California.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more of these wildfire smoke events,\u201d said Nicholas Nassikas, a study author and a physician and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. So he and multidisciplinary team of researchers wanted to know: \"What does it really mean in a changing environment for things like mortality, which is kind of the worst possible health outcome?\u201d",
      "Lisa Thompson, a professor at Emory University who studies air pollution and climate change and was not involved in the paper, said it is one of the first studies she has seen to isolate the effect of climate change on mortality. Looking at the impacts across time and space also made it unique, she said.",
      "The paper's researchers focused on deaths linked to exposure to fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 \u2014 the main concern from wildfire smoke.",
      "These particles can lodge deep into lungs and trigger coughing and itchy eyes with short-term exposure. But longer term they can make existing health problems worse and lead to a range of chronic and deadly health issues. Children, pregnant people, the elderly and outdoor workers are among the most vulnerable. The Health Effects Institute estimated the pollutant caused 4 million deaths worldwide.",
      "Evidence is emerging that PM2.5 from wildfire smoke is more toxic than other pollution sources. When wildfires encroach into cities, burning cars and other toxics-containing materials, it adds to the danger.",
      "Numerous studies have tied human-caused climate change \u2014 caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas \u2014 to a growth in fires in North America. Global warming is increasing drought, especially in the West, and other extreme weather. Drier conditions suck moisture from plants, which act as fuel for fires. When drier vegetation and seasons are mixed with hotter temperatures, that increases the frequency, extent and severity of wildfires and the smoke they spew.",
      "Jacob Bendix, professor emeritus of geography and environment at Syracuse University, said he was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the findings but not surprised.",
      "\u201c(T) hese numbers are really significant. I think there\u2019s a tendency for people outside of the areas actually burning to see increasing fires as a distant inconvenience \u2026 This study drives home how far-reaching the impacts are,\u201d said Bendix in an email. He wasn't involved in the study.",
      "The study\u2019s authors drew on modeled and existing data to reach their findings. First, they sought to understand how much area burned by wildfires was attributable to climate change. They did that by analyzing the real climate conditions \u2014 heat and rain, for instance \u2014 when wildfires erupted from 2006 to 2020, and compared that to a scenario where weather measurements would be different without climate change.",
      "From there, they estimated the levels of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke tied to climate change using the same approach. Lastly, integrating the current understanding of how particulate matter affects mortality based on published research, they quantified the number of deaths related to PM2.5 from wildfires and calculated their economic impact.",
      "This framework showed that of 164,000 deaths related to wildfire-PM2.5 exposure from 2006 to 2020, 10% were attributable to climate change. The mortalities were 30% to 50% higher in some western states and counties.",
      "Marshall Burke, global environmental policy professor at Stanford University, said the evidence linking climate change to burned areas was \u201crock solid,\u201d but the subsequent steps were harder.",
      "\u201cLinking burned area to smoke is trickier because you never know exactly which way the wind\u2019s going to blow,\u201d he said, and he wondered how the death estimates compared to fatalities tied to general air pollution.",
      "Still, their approach was sensible and reasonable, Burke said.",
      "Johns Hopkins University lecturer in climate and energy policy Patrick Brown said he had some concerns about the study. One was conceptual. The study acknowledges the power non-climate drivers have on wildfires, but it doesn't give them proper weight, he said in an email.",
      "Brown, who was not involved in the study, worries decision-makers could wrongly conclude that mitigating planet-warming carbon emissions is the only solution. \u201cYet in many regions, the more immediate life\u2011saving action may be fuel breaks, prescribed burns, ignition\u2011source regulation, public health efforts, etc.,\u201d he said.",
      "Land management practices such as prescribed burns can reduce wildfire fuel, Nassikas said. But ultimately, the study notes, the problem of deaths from wildfire smoke will only get worse without the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\u201cPart of the study is raising awareness,\" he said. \u201cAnd then once we kind of understand that \u2026 now what are the interventions that we can deploy at a personal level, at a community level, and then obviously at a larger level across the country and across the world?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Skype users are scrambling to find an alternative after Microsoft shut down the pioneering internet phone service which let people make cheap long distance calls and chat with other users",
      "LONDON -- Skype is dead. What now?",
      "Microsoft's shutdown of Skype on May 5 sent millions of users scrambling to find an alternative to the pioneering internet phone service.",
      "Skype, which Microsoft bought in 2011, was beloved by a dwindling group of users who appreciated how it let them make cheap long-distance calls as well as communicate with other users through chat messages, voice or video calls.",
      "Some liked its simplicity and ease of use \u2014 an advantage, for example, when setting up a communications app for an elderly parent living far away.",
      "Or they just used it out of habit.",
      "Skype was founded in 2003 and was among the first in a wave of communication services that used voice over internet protocol technology (VoIP), which converts audio into a digital signal.",
      "Skype's disappearance also inconveniences Americans and other expatriates living overseas who signed up because they needed an U.S.-based number to receive text authentication codes from, say, a bank back home. It was also handy for calling 800 numbers for free even if you weren't living in North America.",
      "Here is a guide for life after Skype:",
      "Microsoft announced in late February that it was shutting down Skype on May 5 and shifting some of its services to Microsoft Teams, its flagship office videoconferencing and group collaboration platform.",
      "Skype users can use their existing accounts to log into Teams and have the option to automatically migrate their contacts and chats.",
      "If you had a Skype number or a calling subscription, it stopped automatically renewing on April 3.",
      "If your account still has credit, you can access Skype's dial pad from the web portal or Teams to make calls.",
      "Skype numbers won't immediately expire on May 5 so you'll still be able to receive calls until your subscription expires. But you'll have to use Teams or keep the Skype dial pad open on the web portal to receive them.",
      "If your Skype number hasn't expired and you don't want to lose it, you should transfer it to another provider.",
      "Skype numbers can be ported to a phone carrier or any number of other VoIP services. But you'll have to start the process through the new provider, not Skype.",
      "Google users can access the online search giant's internet phone service to make calls from a smartphone or a desktop web browser. You can get your own Google Voice phone number and use features like call forwarding and voicemail. Or you can port your number from another service like Skype, but it will cost $20.",
      "Calls to U.S., Canadian or Puerto Rican numbers are free. Rates for other countries vary.",
      "The free version of Google Voice is only available to U.S. residents physically located in the 48 contiguous states, so that means expatriate Americans can only use it if they registered before they moved overseas.",
      "\u201cYou cannot sign up for a Google Voice number while outside the USA,\u201d according to a help page. \u201cDo not try to circumvent this by using a VPN.\u201d",
      "Owned by Japan's Rakuten, Viber was long considered one of the closest competitors to Skype. One key difference is that Skype users don't need a phone number and are identified by their usernames, while Viber users need a number to register for service.",
      "Similar to Skype, Viber users can buy credit or packages to call phone numbers around the world but it's no longer possible to get a Viber number to receive calls.",
      "The videoconferencing service that\u2019s become a byword for online company meetings offers a calling service, Zoom Phone, and features like number porting and the ability to send and receive SMS text messages.",
      "Take note that Zoom Phone isn't free. There are various calling plans that involve a monthly subscription cost and extra fees for international calls.",
      "Microsoft users have the option of making calls on Teams, dubbed Teams Phone. Like Zoom Phone, you'll need to buy a subscription and pay extra for international calls.",
      "But it's not an option for regular people because Microsoft says Teams Phone isn't for consumer use and is only available to small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "If you absolutely need a U.S. number but live overseas, sign up for service with a low-cost virtual wireless carrier that offers cheap cellphone plans or pay-as-you-go rates.",
      "One provider, Tello, offers monthly plans for as little as $5 and says users can activate its service even if they're living outside the U.S.",
      "Because mobile virtual network operators like Tello are essentially wireless phone companies that piggyback off a bigger carrier's physical network, you can't use it to make calls on a computer or an app.",
      "There are a slew of Skype pretenders offering phone calls over the internet, such as Zoiper, VoIP.ms, CallCentric, Mytello, and Virtual Landline. Many are aimed at business users.",
      "Some are capitalizing on Skype\u2019s disappearance. Hushed, which started as an anonymous calling app, bills itself as a Skype alternative. Users can buy a phone number from the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom or Puerto Rico or port their own number.",
      "It warns that some of its numbers aren't guaranteed to work with third-party verification text messages.",
      "\u201cWe do not intentionally block anyone from receiving these codes, but it\u2019s common that some services will prevent verification texts from being sent to certain phone numbers due to their own security policies,\" Hushed says on its website.",
      "Maybe you can't decide which calling service you want to switch to. If you want to save your current number, there are services to just park your number like NumberBarn.com and Parkmyphone.com.",
      "They let you store a phone number for a monthly fee while relaying any text messages sent to that number. You can port the number to another service whenever you want.",
      "Beware, you can only port in U.S. or Canadian phone numbers.",
      "What about an international eSIM? They're the virtual version of the mobile phone SIM card that you can buy and add to your phone when you're on a trip to save on roaming fees.",
      "They offer cheap data access rates so you can use the internet without worrying about racking up a huge bill when you get home.",
      "Unfortunately, you can't port a Skype number to an international eSIM because of \u201cthe fundamental differences\" between VoIP services and traditional mobile networks, said Pedro Maiquez, co-founder of eSIM provider Holafly. \u201cSkype numbers are not tied to a mobile carrier\u2019s physical infrastructure, making them incompatible with mobile eSIM solutions.\"",

      "The U.S. Justice Department is doubling down on its attempt to break up Google by asking it to give up the underlying technology powering the company's digital ad network. The proposed remedy joins a separate federal effort to separate the Chrome browser from its dominant search engine.",
      "The government's latest proposal was filed late Monday in a Virginia federal court two-and-half weeks after a federal judge ruled that parts of its lucrative digital ad network have been improperly abusing its market power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers.",
      "In a 17-page filing, Justice Department lawyers argued that U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema should punish Google by ordering the company to offload its AdX business and DFP ad platform, tools that bring together advertisers, who want to market their products, and publishers, who want to sell commercial space on their sites, to bring in revenue.",
      "Not surprisingly, it's an idea that Google vehemently plans to oppose when the penalty phase of the antitrust case \u2014known as remedy hearings \u2014 begins in late September. Google already has vowed to appeal Brinkema's ruling that the technology powering the ad network has been breaking the law, but can't do that until the judge rules on its punishment in a decision expected late this year or early next year.",
      "Google said in its own filing Monday that divestiture of AdX and DFP wouldn\u2019t be technically feasible because neither piece of technology is capable of working outside of Google's proprietary infrastructure. The company proposed its own remedies to restore competition, and reiterated its intent to appeal the ruling.",
      "\u201cDivestiture is not as simple as selling either the AdX or DFP source code to a willing buyer,\u201d Google wrote.",
      "The attempt to tear down Google's ad network comes on top of the Justice Department's ongoing effort to have the company part with its popular Chrome browser and impose other restrictions to curtail the power of its ubiquitous search engine, which another federal judge branded an illegal monopoly in a ruling last August.",
      "The remedy hearings in the search case are scheduled to conclude later this month, with a ruling from U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta expected by Labor Day.",
      "If the Justice Department is able to persuade the two different judges to order its proposed dismantling of Google, it would be the biggest breakup of a U.S. company since AT&T was forced to spin off its phone service into seven separate regional companies more than 40 years ago.",
      "Google's Play Store for apps running on its Android software that powers most of the world's smartphones also was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal jury in 2023 and is battling a judge's order that would require it to overhaul a commission system that generates billions of dollars in annual revenue.",
      "But hobbling its search engine and digital ad network would be far bigger blows because they are the key cogs in a business that generated $265 billion in revenue last year.",
      "Google is confronting the breakup threats at the same time the advent of artificial intelligence is changing the way consumers are using technology and seeking information online \u2014 a shift that could also siphon traffic and money away from a powerhouse that began in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Despite the adversity, Google is still delivering robust financial growth to its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., which is currently valued at $2 trillion.",

      "\u201cThis is an application that Greece \u2014 and Europe \u2014 needs to confirm children\u2019s ages when they use social media,\u201d said Digital Governance Minister Dimitris Papastergiou. \u201cIt will also serve as an identification tool for upcoming initiatives.\u201d",
      "Unlike stricter approaches adopted in some European countries, Greece has made the app\u2019s use voluntary, though officials argue it offers more powerful controls. The initiative aligns with broader EU-wide efforts to standardize age verification across member states.",
      "The app is integrated with Greece\u2019s government services platform, already widely used to pay taxes, navigate bureaucracy, and even buy soccer tickets, and works with existing digital ID systems for adults.",
      "Parents will log in using their online tax identification credentials.",
      "The general age of digital consent has been set at 15, and officials have invited major digital platforms to collaborate on the rollout.",
      "\u201cDear platforms, we ask for your cooperation so that together we can protect children at a vulnerable age,\u201d Papastergiou said.",
      "Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis voiced support for the initiative, expressing concern over technology\u2019s impact on family life. \u201cYou see families in restaurants where parents and children are all on their phones, and you wonder when they actually talk to each other,\u201d he said.",
      "A 2024 survey by Greek research organization KMOP found that 76.6% of children aged 9\u201312 have internet access via personal devices, 58.6% use social media daily, and 22.8% have encountered inappropriate content.",
      "The app\u2019s launch is part of a broader set of government measures aimed at curbing youth violence and aligns with EU plans to strengthen online protections for minors.",

    "story": [
      "Judges in several states may soon get a new tool to stop dangerous drivers from speeding again",
      "A teenager who admitted being \u201caddicted to speed\u201d behind the wheel had totaled two other cars in the year before he slammed into a minivan at 112 mph (180 kph) in a Seattle suburb, killing the driver and three of the five children she was transporting for a homeschool co-op.",
      "After sentencing Chase Daniel Jones last month to more than 17 years in prison, the judge tacked on a novel condition should he drive again: His vehicle must be equipped with a device that prevents accelerating far beyond the speed limit.",
      "Virginia this year became the first state to give its judges such a tool to deal with the most dangerous drivers on the road. Washington, D.C., already is using it and similar measures await governors' signatures in Washington state and Georgia. New York and California also could soon tap the GPS-based technology to help combat a recent national spike in traffic deaths.",
      "\u201cIt's a horror no one should have to experience,\u201d said Amy Cohen, who founded the victims' advocacy group Families for Safe Streets after her 12-year-old son, Sammy Cohen Eckstein, was killed by a speeding driver in front of their New York home more than a decade ago.",
      "Andrea Hudson, 38, the minivan driver who was killed when Jones ran a red light, was building a backyard greenhouse with her husband to help educate several kids who shuttle between homes during the school day, her father, Ted Smith, said.",
      "Also killed in the March 2024 crash near Hudson's home in Renton, Washington, were Boyd \u201cBuster\u201d Brown and Eloise Wilcoxson, both 12, and Matilda Wilcoxson, 13. Hudson's two children were sitting on the passenger side and survived, but they spent weeks in a hospital.",
      "\u201cYou always hear of these horrific accidents, and it\u2019s always far away, you don\u2019t know anybody. But all of a sudden, that\u2019s my daughter,\" Smith said. \u201cThis guy did not swerve or brake. And it was just a missile.\u201d",
      "Smith knew Washington state Rep. Mari Leavitt, who reached out to offer condolences and tell him she was sponsoring legislation to mandate intelligent speed assistance devices as a condition for habitual speeders to get back their suspended licenses.",
      "Leavitt predicts it will have an even more powerful impact than revoking driving privileges, citing studies showing around three-quarters of people who lose their licenses get behind a wheel anyway.",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, the state saw a 200% increase in drivers cited for going at least 50 mph (80 kph) over the speed limit, according to the Washington Traffic Safety Commission.",
      "\u201cI guess I don\u2019t understand why someone is compelled to want to drive that fast,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cBut if they choose to drive that fast with the speed limiter, they can\u2019t. It's going to stop them in their tracks.\u201d",
      "The measure, which Washington legislators passed last month and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson is expected to soon sign, is called the BEAM Act, using the first letters of the names of the four victims: Buster, Eloise, Andrea and Matilda.",
      "Because Jones, 19, didn't receive a speeding ticket in his two previous crashes, he likely wouldn't have been required to use the speed-limiter ahead of the fatal one. And because it could be 2029 before the law takes effect, the judge's requirement at sentencing only applies to his time on probation after being released from prison, Smith said.",
      "Competing tech companies that joined forces to lobby for ignition interlock requirements for drunken drivers have been working in unison again the last few years to pitch intelligent speed assistance.",
      "Brandy Nannini, chief government affairs officer at one manufacturer, Grapevine, Texas-based Smart Start, said fleet vehicles including school buses in the nation's capital have been trying it out for years.",
      "But it took a lot of refinement before the GPS technology could instantly recognize speed limit changes and compel vehicles with the devices installed to adjust accordingly.",
      "\u201cWe've got a lot more satellites in the sky now,\u201d said Ken Denton, a retired police officer who is the chief compliance officer at Cincinnati-based LifeSafer, part of the coalition of companies.",
      "When court-mandated, the devices would prevent cars from exceeding speed limits or whatever threshold regulators set. An override button allows speeding in emergencies, but states can decide whether to activate it and authorities would be alerted any time the button is pushed.",
      "A more passive version, which beeps to alert drivers when they are going too fast, is required for new cars in the European Union. California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a similar proposal last year, explaining vehicle safety requirements are set by the federal government and he was concerned a patchwork of state laws could stir confusion.",
      "Before Del. Patrick Hope agreed to sponsor the proposal in the Virginia Legislature, he tried out the device in Nannini's car, which was calibrated to not go more than 9 mph (14 kph) over the speed limit.",
      "\u201cThat was my first question: Is it safe?\u201d Hope said.",
      "Not only did he come away convinced it was safe, Hope is now pondering whether to install it on the cars of his three children, all of whom are new drivers.",
      "For those mandated by a court, the price could be hefty: $4 per day and a $100 installation fee. The fee would be reduced for low-income offenders.",
      "Cohen with Families for Safe Streets, which provides support services to the loved ones of crash victims, knows firsthand the kind of impact slowing down speeders can make. A year after her son was struck and killed in front of their New York apartment, another boy was injured in the same spot.",
      "By then, the road's speed limit had been lowered.",
      "\u201cThat boy lived when he was hit, and mine did not,\u201d she said. \"When you are going a few miles slower, there's more time to stop. And when you hit somebody, it's much less likely to be deadly.\u201d",

      "BOSTON -- Fans of the hugely popular video game series Grand Theft Auto will have to wait a little longer to play the latest version.",
      "In a post on X Friday, Rockstar Games said it delayed the launch of Grand Theft Auto VI until May 26, 2026. It apologized for the delay of a game, the release of which has been talked about for several years. It didn't provide any specifics on why the release date has been pushed back from fall of this year.",
      "\u201cWith every game we have released, the goal has been to try and exceed your expectations and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe hope you understand we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.\u201d",
      "Shares of Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar\u2019s parent company, fell Friday by nearly 7%.",
      "Strauss Zelnick, the chairman and CEO for Take-Two Interactive Software, stood by Rockstar in a statement and said it supports the company taking additional time to realize their creative vision. He said it still expects a \u201cgroundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence,\u201d Zelnick said in a statement. \"As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders.\u201d",
      "Fans of the game reacted to the delay with disappointment but also a shrug -- since it has been suggested the game would be released in 2024 and then this year.",
      "On a Reddit discussion forum dedicated to the game, several fans noted they had seen this before and wouldn't be surprised if the release was delayed again. Others took a more optimistic tone, saying an exact release date means it will actually happen this time around.",
      "One of the last times the game garnered this much buzz was in 2023, when a trailer for the game was leaked online. At the time, Rockstar released the first look of the sixth game 15 hours earlier than planned, citing the leak.",
      "That 90-second trailer gave fans a taste of what comes next for the game. The trailer suggested the next installment would be set in the Miami-inspired Vice City and star a female protagonist, a first for the franchise, named Lucia.",
      "It is unclear whether the delay means any, or all, of these details will remain part of Grand Theft Auto VI.",

      "Two major scientific societies say they will fill the void from the Trump administration\u2019s dismissal of scientists writing a cornerstone federal report on what climate change is doing to the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two major scientific societies on Friday said they will fill the void from the Trump administration's dismissal of scientists writing a cornerstone federal report on what climate change is doing to the United States.",
      "The American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union said they will work together to produce peer-reviewed research documents assessing the current and future national impacts of climate change because a science-based report required by law is suddenly in question and being reassessed by President Donald Trump's White House.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump's Republican administration told about 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment that they were no longer needed and that the report was being reevaluated. That report, coming once every four to five years, is required by a 1990 federal law and was due out around 2027. Preliminary budget documents show slashing funding or eliminating offices involved in coordinating that report, scientists and activists said.",
      "\u201cWe are filling in a gap in the scientific process,\u201d AGU President Brandon Jones said. \u201cIt's more about ensuring that science continues.\u201d",
      "Meteorological society past president Anjuli Bamzi, a retired federal atmospheric scientist who has worked on previous National Climate Assessments, said one of the most important parts of the federal report is that it projects 25 and 100 years into the future.",
      "With the assessment \u201cwe're better equipped to deal with the future,\u201d Bamzi said. \u201cWe can't be an ostrich and put our head in the sand and let it go.\u201d",
      "Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, also chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy, said the two organizations joining to do this report \u201cis a testament to how important it is that the latest science be summarized and available.\u201d",
      "Hayhoe, who was a lead author of reports in 2009, 2018 and 2023, said \u201cpeople are not aware of how climate change is impacting the decisions that they are making today, whether it\u2019s the size of the storm sewer pipes they\u2019re installing, whether it is the expansion of the flood zone where people are building, whether it is the increases in extreme heat.\"",
      "They need that knowledge to figure out how to adapt to harms in the future and even the present, Hayhoe said.",
      "The national assessment, unlike global United Nations documents, highlights what\u2019s happening to weather not just in the nation but at regional and local levels.",
      "Jones said he hopes the societies' version of the assessment can be done in just one year.",
      "The last climate assessment report, released in 2023, said that climate change is \u201dharming physical, mental, spiritual, and community health and well-being through the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events, increasing cases of infectious and vector-borne diseases, and declines in food and water quality and security.\"",
      "In 2018, during Trump's first term, the assessment was just as blunt, saying: \"Climate change creates new risks and exacerbates existing vulnerabilities in communities across the United States, presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth.\"",
      "But University of Illinois climate scientist Donald Wuebbles, who led one of 2018's two national reports, said he worries about what kind of document this new administration will try to issue, if any.",
      "\u201cI think they'll put out something that will, like, it'll be be scientifically based, but it will be pretty crappy,\u201d Wuebbles told The Associated Press.",
      "Watering down or killing the national assessment will not keep the message about the importance of climate change from getting out, Wuebbles said. The scientific societies' efforts to fill the void will have some value because it will be a statement of the scientific community, and, in the end, he said, science is about data and observations.",
      "\u201cWe know this is an extremely important problem. We know it is human activities driving it. So the question is: What do you do about it?\u201d Wuebbles said.",
      "Storms and wildfires don't care if it's a red state or a blue state, Hayhoe said.",

      "A Wisconsin man has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times, and scientists are studying his blood to treat snakebite",
      "NEW YORK -- Tim Friede has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times \u2014 often on purpose. Now scientists are studying his blood in hopes of creating a better treatment for snake bites.",
      "Friede has long had a fascination with reptiles and other venomous creatures. He used to milk scorpions' and spiders' venom as a hobby and kept dozens of snakes at his Wisconsin home.",
      "Hoping to protect himself from snake bites \u2014 and out of what he calls \u201csimple curiosity\u201d \u2014 he began injecting himself with small doses of snake venom and then slowly increased the amount to try to build up tolerance. He would then let snakes bite him.",
      "\u201cAt first, it was very scary,\" Friede said. \u201cBut the more you do it, the better you get at it, the more calm you become with it.\u201d",
      "While no doctor or emergency medical technician \u2014 or anyone, really \u2014 would ever suggest this is a remotely good idea, experts say his method tracks how the body works. When the immune system is exposed to the toxins in snake venom, it develops antibodies that can neutralize the poison. If it's a small amount of venom the body can react before it's overwhelmed. And if it's venom the body has seen before, it can react more quickly and handle larger exposures.",
      "Friede has withstood snakebites and injections for nearly two decades and still has a refrigerator full of venom. In videos posted to his YouTube channel, he shows off swollen fang marks on his arms from black mamba, taipan and water cobra bites.",
      "\u201cI wanted to push the limits as close to death as possible to where I\u2019m just basically teetering right there and then back off of it,\" he said.",
      "But Friede also wanted to help. He emailed every scientist he could find, asking them to study the tolerance he'd built up.",
      "And there is a need: Around 110,000 people die from snakebite every year, according to the World Health Organization. And making antivenom is expensive and difficult. It is often created by injecting large mammals like horses with venom and collecting the antibodies they produce. These antivenoms are usually only effective against specific snake species, and can sometimes produce bad reactions due to their nonhuman origins.",
      "When Columbia University's Peter Kwong heard of Friede, he said, \u201cOh, wow, this is very unusual. We had a very special individual with amazing antibodies that he created over 18 years.\u201d",
      "In a study published Friday in the journal Cell, Kwong and collaborators shared what they were able to do with Friede's unique blood: They identified two antibodies that neutralize venom from many different snake species with the aim of someday producing a treatment that could offer broad protection.",
      "It's very early research \u2014 the antivenom was only tested in mice, and researchers are still years away from human trials. And while their experimental treatment shows promise against the group of snakes that include mambas and cobras, it's not effective against vipers, which include snakes like rattlers.",
      "\u201cDespite the promise, there is much work to do,\u201d said Nicholas Casewell, a snakebite researcher at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in an email. Casewell was not involved with the new study.",
      "Friede's journey has not been without its missteps. Among them: He said after one bad snake bite he had to cut off part of his finger. And some particularly nasty cobra bites sent him to the hospital.",
      "Friede is now employed by Centivax, which is trying to develop the treatment, and he's excited that his 18-year odyssey could one day save lives from snakebite. But his message to those inspired to follow in his footsteps is quite simple: \u201cDon't do it,\" he said.",

      "A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus in the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus in the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth, possibly within the first two weeks of May.",
      "It\u2019s too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph (242 kph), if it remains intact.",
      "\u201cWhile not without risk, we should not be too worried,\u201d Langbroek said in an email.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\u201d",
      "The Soviet Union launched the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus (nearly 500-kilogram) spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics' Jonathan McDowell said in an email.

      "In recent days, Trump has dialed back his attacks on Powell, saying he will not fire Powell before the end of the top central banker's term next year. Trump has reiterated his displeasure with the level of interest rates, however, urging the central bank to lower them.",
      "Speaking at a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Powell said the economy remains in \"solid shape\" but warned Trump's tariff policy could cause higher inflation and an economic slowdown.",
      "\"If the large increase in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they're likely to generate a rise in inflation and a slowdown of economic growth,\" Powell said Wednesday.",
      "\"All of these policies are evolving, however, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain,\" Powell added.",
      "When asked about Trump's call for lower rates, Powell shrugged off criticism from the president.",
      "\"It doesn\u2019t affect our doing our job at all,\" Powell said. \"We\u2019re always going to consider only the economic data, the outlook, the balance of risks \u2013 and that\u2019s it.\"",

      "If the Fed raises interest rates as a means of protecting against tariff-induced inflation under such a scenario, it risks stifling borrowing and slowing the economy further. On the other hand, if the Fed lowers rates to stimulate the economy in the face of a potential slowdown, it threatens to boost spending and worsen inflation.",
      "Still, Powell pointed to solid economic performance as a reason to take a patient approach as policymakers await the impact of tariffs.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well-positioned to wait for greater clarity,\" Powell told an audience at the Economic Club of Chicago.",
      "Powell noted the possibility of a shift in economic conditions, saying, \"Life moves pretty fast.\"",
      "The rate decision arrives days after fresh data showed robust job growth in April.",
      "Despite flagging consumer sentiment and market turmoil, the labor market has provided a bright spot since Trump took office. Meanwhile, inflation cooled in March, the most recent month for which data is available.",
      "Even so, recession fears are mounting on Wall Street as Trump's tariffs threaten to upend global trade. Goldman Sachs earlier this month hiked its odds of a recession from 35% to 45%. JPMorgan pegged the probability of a recession this year at 60%.",
      "A government report last week showed the U.S. economy shrank over the first three months of 2025, much of which took place as Trump's flurry of tariff proposals stoked uncertainty among businesses and consumers.",
      "U.S. gross domestic product, or GDP, declined at a 0.3% annualized rate over three months ending in March, according to government data released on Wednesday. The figure marked a sharp dropoff from 2.4% annualized growth over the final three months of 2024.",
      "The rate decision on Wednesday also marks the first adjustment of borrowing costs since Trump's closely watched \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2, which triggered the biggest single-day stock market drop since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Days later, Trump suspended a major swathe of the tariffs, sending the market to one of its largest ever single-day increases. A simultaneous escalation of tariffs on Chinese goods kept the effective tariff rate at its highest level in more than a century, the Yale Budget Lab found.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision last month, lifted an injunction issued by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that had halted deportations under the AEA -- but said detainees must be given due process to challenge their removal in the district where they were detained.",
      "GFF and JGO \"have not been given notice of what they allegedly did to join TdA, when the joined, and what they did in the United States, or anywhere else, to share or further the illicit objectives of the TdA,\" Judge Hellerstein's opinion said. \"Without such proof, Petitioners are subject to removal by the Executive's dictate alone, in contravention of the AEA and the Constitutional requirements of due process.\"",
      "Hellerstein also said Trump was not justified when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\"I hold that the predicates for the Presidential Proclamation that TdA has engaged in either a 'war,' 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion' of the United States do not exist,\" Hellerstein's opinion said. \"There is nothing in the AEA that justifies a finding that refugees migrating from Venezuela, or TdA gangsters who infiltrate the migrants, are engaged in an 'invasion' or 'predatory injunction.'\"",
      "Judge Hellerstein set a hearing in the matter for May 21.",

    "story": [
      "Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman was meeting recently with representatives from a teachers union when things quickly devolved",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was meeting last week with representatives from a teachers union in his home state when things quickly devolved.",
      "Before long, Fetterman began repeating himself, shouting and questioning why \u201ceverybody is mad at me,\u201d \u201cwhy does everyone hate me, what did I ever do\u201d and slamming his hands on a desk, according to one person who was briefed on what occurred.",
      "As the meeting deteriorated, a staff member moved to end it and ushered the visitors into the hallway, where she broke down crying. The staffer was comforted by the teachers who were themselves rattled by Fetterman's behavior, according to a second person who was briefed separately on the meeting.",
      "The interaction at Fetterman's Washington office, described to The Associated Press by the two people who spoke about it on the condition of anonymity, came the day before New York Magazine published a story in which former staff and political advisers to Fetterman aired concerns about the senator's mental health.",
      "That story included a 2024 letter, also obtained by the AP, in which Fetterman's one-time chief of staff Adam Jentleson told a neuropsychiatrist who had treated Fetterman for depression that the senator appeared to be off his recovery plan and was exhibiting alarming behavior, including a tendency toward \u201clong, rambling, repetitive and self-centered monologues.\u201d",
      "Asked about the meeting with teachers union representatives, Fetterman said in a statement through his office that they \u201chad a spirited conversation about our collective frustration with the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to our education system.\u201d He also said he \"will always support our teachers, and I will always reject anyone\u2019s attempt to turn Pennsylvania\u2019s public schools into a voucher program.\u201d",
      "Fetterman earlier this week brushed off the New York Magazine story as a \u201cone-source hit piece and some anonymous sources, so there\u2019s nothing new.\u201d Asked by a reporter in a Senate corridor what he would say to people who are concerned about him, Fetterman said: \u201cThey\u2019re not. They\u2019re actually not concerned. It\u2019s a hit piece. There\u2019s no news.\u201d",
      "Reached by telephone, Aaron Chapin, the president of the Pennsylvania State Education Association who was in the meeting with Fetterman, said he didn\u2019t want to discuss what was a private conversation.",
      "The teachers union encounter adds to the questions being raised about Fetterman's mental health and behavior barely three years after a he survived a stroke on the 2022 campaign trail that he said almost killed him. That was followed by a bout with depression that landed him in Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for six weeks, barely a month after he was sworn into the Senate.",
      "The scrutiny also comes a time when Fetterman, now serving third year of his term, is being criticized by many rank-and-file Democrats in his home state for being willing to cooperate with President Donald Trump, amid Democrats' growing alarm over Trump's actions and agenda.",
      "Fetterman \u2014 who has been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, in which the heart muscle becomes weakened and enlarged, and auditory processing disorder, a complication from the stroke \u2014 has talked openly about his struggle with depression and urged people to get help.",
      "In November, he told podcast host Joe Rogan that he had recovered and fended off thoughts of harming himself.",
      "\u201cI was at the point where I was really, you know, in a very dark place. And I stayed in that game and I am staying in front of you right now and having this conversation,\u201d Fetterman said.",
      "But some who have worked closely with Fetterman question whether his recovery is complete.",
      "In the 2024 letter to Dr. David Williamson, Jentleson warned that Fetterman was not seeing his doctors, had pushed out the people who were supposed to help him stay on his recovery plan and might not be taking his prescribed medications. Jentleson also said Fetterman had been driving recklessly and exhibiting paranoia, isolating him from colleagues.",
      "\u201cOverall, over the last nine months or so, John has dismantled the early-warning system we all agreed upon when he was released,\u201d Jentleson wrote. \u201cHe has picked fights with each person involved in that system and used those fights as excuses to push them out and cut them off from any knowledge about his health situation.\u201d",
      "Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where Williamson works, declined to make him available for an interview, citing privacy and confidentiality laws protecting patient medical information.",
      "Fetterman has long been a wild card in the political realm, forging a career largely on his own, independently from the Democratic Party.",
      "As a small-town mayor in Braddock, the plainspoken Fetterman became a minor celebrity for his bare-knuckled progressive politics, his looks \u2014 he\u2019s 6-foot-8 and tattooed with a shaved head \u2014 and his unconventional efforts to put the depressed former steel town back on the map.",
      "He endorsed the insurgent Democrat Bernie Sanders in 2016\u2019s presidential primary and ran from the left against the party-backed Democrat in 2016\u2019s Senate primary. In 2020, when he was lieutenant governor, he became a top surrogate on cable TV news shows for Joe Biden's presidential bid and gathered a national political following that made him a strong small-dollar fundraiser.",
      "Elected to the Senate in 2022, he has made waves with his casual dress \u2014 hoodies and gym shorts \u2014 at work and at formal events and his willingness to chastise other Democrats.",
      "Fetterman returned to the Senate after his hospitalization in 2023 a much more outgoing lawmaker, frequently joking with his fellow senators and engaging with reporters in the hallways with the assistance of an iPad or iPhone that transcribes conversations in real time.",
      "Yet two years later, Fetterman is still something of a loner in the Senate.",
      "He has separated himself from many of his fellow Democrats on Israel policy and argued at times that his party needs to work with, not against, Trump. He met with Trump and Trump\u2019s nominees \u2014 and voted for some \u2014 when other Democrats wouldn't.",
      "He has stood firmly with Democrats in other cases and criticized Trump on some issues, such as trade and food aid.",
      "One particularly head-scratching video of Fetterman emerged earlier this year in which he was on a flight to Pittsburgh apparently arguing with a pilot over his seatbelt.",
      "Despite fallout with progressives over his staunch support of Israel in its war in Gaza, Fetterman was still an in-demand personality last year to campaign in the battleground state of Pennsylvania for Biden and, after Biden dropped his reelection bid, Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "Since Trump won November's election \u2014 and Pennsylvania \u2014 things have changed. Many one-time supporters have turned on Fetterman over his softer approach to Trump and his willingness to criticize fellow Democrats for raising alarm bells.",
      "It nevertheless brought Fetterman plaudits.",
      "Bill Maher, host of the political talk show \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher,\" suggested that Fetterman should run for president in 2028. Conservatives \u2014 who had long made Fetterman a target for his progressive politics \u2014 have sprung to Fetterman\u2019s defense.",
      "Still, Democrats in Pennsylvania say they are hearing from people worried about him.",
      "\u201cPeople are concerned about his health,\" said Sharif Street, the state's Democratic Party chairman. \u201cThey want to make sure he\u2019s OK. People care about him. There\u2019s a lot of love for him out there.\u201d",

      "Washington state Gov. Bob Ferguson has signed a bill into law that sets limits on rent increases",
      "Washington state Gov. Bob Ferguson signed a bill into law Wednesday that sets limits on rent increases, making the state among the first in the nation to provide protections for tenants.",
      "The rent stabilization measure, House Bill 1217, adds Washington to states like Oregon and California that have sought new ways to curb homelessness.",
      "Bill sponsor Sen. Emily Alvarado, a West Seattle Democrat, said the measure sets common-sense guardrails on the state\u2019s rental-housing market \u201cso that hardworking families and older adults don\u2019t get unchecked excessive rent increases.\u201d",
      "\u201cHousing is not a luxury. It\u2019s a basic human need,\u201d Alvarado said at the bill signing. \u201cAnd everyone in this state deserves a stable and affordable home.\u201d",
      "The measure caps rent increases at 7% plus inflation or 10% \u2014 whichever is lower. The restrictions include single-family homes. The rent-increase cap for manufactured homes is 5%. Lawmakers approved the plan on a 54-44 vote, with five Democrats joining the Republican opposition.",
      "Ferguson praised Alvarado and the many advocates across the state who worked hard to get the bill passed.",
      "It almost didn't make it.",
      "It successfully moved through both houses, but two amendments added on the Senate floor sent it into a conference committee. Those amendments increased the cap from 7% to 10% plus inflation and exempted single-family homes. Opponents of the bill argued that developers would leave the state if it became law and said similar policies in Oregon and California added to those states\u2019 financial burdens instead of slowing the homeless crisis.",
      "Oregon's rent-control bill was passed in 2019 and later updated to cap rent increases at either 7% plus the annual 12-month average change in the consumer price index for the U.S. West, or 10% \u2014 whichever is lower.",
      "The conference committee got the cap down to 7% plus inflation or 10% \u2014 whichever is lower, and restored protections for the 38% of renters who live in single-family homes. With Ferguson's signature, it's now law.",
      "\u201cThis law is a good beginning. It\u2019s long overdue and it\u2019s urgently needed,\u201d Alvarado said. \u201cForty percent of the people in the state of Washington are renters or manufactured homeowners and before today they had no protections over how high the rent can go, leading to pain and to devastating destabilization of families and communities.\u201d",
      "Ferguson also signed nine other bills to help homeowners and renters. He said when he campaigned for governor, affordable housing was the top issue voters raised, so he supports bills to help make it easier to secure housing.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s make this the session of affordable housing,\u201d he said before signing the first measure.",
      "The other measures included limits on certain provisions in rental agreements, notices for mobile home communities, and property tax relief for disabled veterans.",

      "The White House has discussed deporting migrants to Libya, sources say.",
      "A federal judge ruled Wednesday that deporting noncitizens to Libya without due process would violate his existing court order, after sources said the White House has discussed such plans.",
      "Lawyers representing a group of migrants filed an emergency motion seeking to prevent their deportation to Libya or Saudi Arabia, citing both press reports and firsthand accounts from migrants who alleged they were actively being prepared for removal to Libya or Saudi Arabia on military aircraft.",
      "Sending noncitizens to Libya or Saudi Arabia without giving them a chance to raise concerns about their safety \"blatantly defies this Court's preliminary injunctions,\" lawyers representing the migrants argued in an emergency motion filed in federal court in Boston, where U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy last month issued a preliminary injunction barring the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens to any country other than their place of origin without due process.",
      "In his order Wednesday, Judge Murphy clarified that any \"allegedly imminent removals\" to a country like Libya or Saudi Arabia would violate the preliminary injunction he issued last month.",
      "\"If there is any doubt -- the Court sees none -- the allegedly imminent removals, as reported by news agencies and as Plaintiffs seek to corroborate with class-member accounts and public information, would clearly violate this Court's Order,\" Judge Murphy wrote about potential deportations to Saudi Arabia or to Libya, an Arab country located in North Africa that the U.S. State Department has advised American citizens not to travel to due to \"crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict.\"",
      "\"Any Class Member who is removed to Libya faces a strong likelihood of imprisonment followed by torture and even disappearance or death,\" the plaintiffs' motion said. \"Indeed, given Libya's human rights record, it is inconceivable that Class Members from other countries would ever agree to removal to Libya, but instead would uniformly seek protection from being removed to Libya.\"",
      "To support their application for the emergency order, lawyers representing the noncitizens included a series of exhibits showing the scramble that played out over the last day as the attorneys sought to determine if any of their clients were bound for Libya. According to the lawyers, Laotian, Vietnamese and Philippine immigrants are at risk of removal.",
      "According to two lawyers whose correspondence was included as exhibits, their clients were informed that they would be removed to Libya and were asked to sign documents agreeing to the deportations. When one of the men and a group of other migrants declined to sign the document, they were allegedly handcuffed in separate rooms \"in order to get them to sign it,\" according to one lawyer.",
      "\"ICE [Immigrations and Customs Enforcement] did not advise him that he has a right to request a reasonable fear interview, nor did ICE provide me with any notice of their intention to remove him to Libya, in clear violation of the district court's orders,\" another lawyer wrote.",
      "Reports that the administration is considering deportations to Libya follow the government's deportation of several hundred alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador as part of a $6 million deal the Trump administration made with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to house detainees at the CECOT mega-prison there.",
      "Lawyers representing the noncitizens said they reached out to the Trump administration to confirm whether any class members are onboard flights to Libya and Saudi Arabia but had not heard back.",
      "Asked earlier Wednesday if the United States will be sending migrants to Libya, President Donald Trump told reporters, \"I don't know, you'll have to ask Homeland Security.\"",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who was asked about potential plans Wednesday morning prior to Trump's comments, said, \"I can't confirm anything.\"",
      "Libya's Government of National Unity has denied any connection to reports regarding the deportation of migrants to that country, saying in a statement that \"the Government affirms that it rejects the use of Libyan territory as a destination for the deportation of migrants without its knowledge or consent.\"",
      "ABC News has reached out to Libya's competing government, the Government of National Stability, for comment.",
      "Officials with the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",

      "A bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. warning him that cuts to the agency could severely impact the Indian Health Service (IHS).",
      "The letter -- delivered on Tuesday from Sens. Jeff Merkley (D- Ore.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) -- expressed concern over the IHS' ability to take care for more than 2.8 million American Indians and Alaska Natives.",
      "In April, HHS began laying off about 10,000 workers and consolidating 28 institutes and centers into 15 new divisions. Including the roughly 10,000 people who have left over the last few months through early retirement or deferred resignation programs, the overall staff at HHS is expected to fall from 82,000 to around 62,000 -- or about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "IHS has been exempted from probationary employee staffing reductions, but the senators noted that cuts to other agencies within HHS that serve Native communities are impacting IHS.",
      "They added that the hiring freeze is exacerbating existing critical staffing issues, including a need for laboratory technicians and administrative personnel.",
      "\"We urge you to take immediate action to ensure that the IHS programs serving Native communities have the resources and staffing necessary to fulfill their missions and halt any further actions affecting Tribal health care delivery without first engaging in meaningful Tribal consultation,\" the letter read.",
      "Merkley, Schatz and Murkowski also described in the letter how American Indians and Alaska Natives are an incredibly vulnerable population \"falling behind in nearly every health metric.\"",
      "In the 2023 National Health Interview Survey -- run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) -- 21.8% of those who identify as only American Indian or Alaska Native reported being in fair or poor health, which was the highest rate seen among any racial or ethnic group.",

      "President Donald Trump has dispatched Vice President JD Vance all over the world in the opening months of the administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- When JD Vance was running for vice president, he walked across an airport tarmac in Wisconsin one August day when his campaign travels happened to intersect those of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and approached Air Force Two. Besides wanting to take a poke at Republican Donald Trump's rival for avoiding the press, Vance said, \"I just wanted to check out my future plane.\u201d",
      "It's an aircraft he now knows well.",
      "In the opening months of Trump's term, Vice President Vance has traveled all over the globe \u2014 family in tow \u2014 to conduct top-level diplomacy for the administration, in addition to taking a number of domestic trips. His international forays have featured a mix of meetings with world leaders, sharply crafted speeches advancing U.S. policy, \u201csoft power\u201d appearances to build goodwill and family time at tourist sites along the way.",
      "Vance's trips have included a five-day trip to Europe in February, a hastily reorganized trek to Greenland in March and a tour of Italy and India in April that was notable for the vice president's brief meeting with Pope Francis the day before the pontiff died.",
      "In his first big moment on the world stage in February, Vance pressed Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d message at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris and spoke of maintaining U.S. dominance in the surging industry. From there, he attended a security conference in Munich, where the vice president left his audience stunned with his lecturing remarks about democracy and scant focus on Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "In March, Vance delivered pointed remarks while in Greenland, scolding Denmark for not investing more in the security of its territory and demanding a new approach. Trump has upset many Greenlanders with his aggressive claims that the U.S. needs to take control of the island away from Denmark.",
      "There's been dealmaking, too.",
      "In India last month, Vance announced after meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they had agreed on a negotiating framework for a U.S.-India trade deal. In Italy, he held talks with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, in addition to his separate audiences with the pope and a top Vatican official.",
      "Vance has been accompanied on his overseas trips by his wife, Usha, and their 7- and 5-year-old sons and 3-year-old daughter. The kids are usually in pajamas as they board Air Force Two for the overnight flights.",
      "The Vances have gazed aloft at the newly restored Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City and been photographed, with the children in traditional Indian dress, in front of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Without their children, the Vances also visited Dachau in Germany.",
      "Brad Blakeman, a former senior official in George W. Bush's administration who has provided planning advice to Vance\u2019s office for some of his foreign travel, said that, while some personal time is woven in, these are not vacations.",
      "\u201cYou try and balance the policy with the culture aspect of the trip so that you\u2019re honoring the customs and culture of the places that you are visiting,\u201d he said. Visiting iconic cultural sites while abroad shows respect and builds rapport with host nations that can enhance diplomacy.",
      "It\u2019s also important to be mindful that the president and vice president travel at the public\u2019s expense, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the balancing act that always has to be done because of the stewardship of the taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d he said.",
      "Joel Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University who specializes in the U.S. vice presidency, said the journeys also could be intended to build Vance's foreign policy chops.",
      "\u201cPart of foreign travel for a vice president is establishing a national security and diplomatic credential,\u201d he said, noting that it's particularly important for Vance.",
      "At age 40, Vance served just two years in the Senate before ascending to the office.",
      "Vance is also the second-youngest person and the first of the millennial generation to hold the job.",
      "\u201cGenerations\u201d author Jean Twenge, a San Diego State University psychology professor who studies generational differences, said the ease with which Vance moves between work and leisure is emblematic of his generation.",
      "\u201cThe research suggests that, just with internet use and social media use, the lines between work time and family time blur, that you switch tasks much more quickly than, say, Gen Xers or boomers,\u201d she said.",
      "Vance frequently switches gears on the road. Last week, he wedged in a quick beer with service members in Germany \u2014 and autographed the \u201ckegerator\u201d built by one airman \u2014 after days of wall-to-wall official and cultural activities throughout Italy and India.",
      "Usha Vance was originally slated for a solo trip to Greenland with one of their sons to attend a dogsled race. But that plan was scrapped amid growing discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark over the visit and Trump\u2019s tough talk of the U.S. taking the territory away from a NATO ally. Instead, the vice president joined the trip, and their visit was limited to a U.S. military base there.",
      "On his Italy trip, Vance took heat on X for being photographed inside the Sistine Chapel. Photography there is usually forbidden, but the session turned out to have been sanctioned by the Vatican, as has happened on past visits by U.S. dignitaries.",
      "A decision during the same trip to close the Roman Colosseum to the public so Usha Vance and the children could take a tour drew some grumbling from tourists stranded outside. A consumer group has since filed a legal complaint.",
      "In India, the Taj Mahal, normally swarming with tourists, was also closed to visitors to accommodate the Vances, according to local media reports.",
      "American officials are often formally invited to make such cultural diversions, and it\u2019s not unusual for the U.S. Secret Service, which provides protection for top U.S. officials, to ask for the sites to be closed to the public for security reasons during presidential and vice presidential tours.",
      "The Vances appear to have tried on occasion to avoid such disruptions. In France, the family visited the Louvre on a Tuesday, a day when the museum is closed to the public.",
      "Other recent vice presidents also have taken family members along on trips. Presidents do, as well.",
      "As vice president, Democrat Joe Biden often took one of his older granddaughters on trips, a practice he continued as president. Presidents' children, including Malia and Sasha Obama and Chelsea Clinton, went along on some trips with their parents, too.",
      "Practices differ, but the idea is the same: Time in office is short, so make the most of it and expose your children to the world.",
      "Usha Vance said as much during the family visit to India, where her parents were born. She hadn't visited in decades, and her husband and children had never been there.",
      "In an interview with India's NDTV, she said she'd been anxious to make the \u201ctrip of a lifetime\u201d with them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve wanted to share with my new nuclear family,\u201d the U.S. second lady said, adding that they knew Vance would have a chance to visit India as vice president. \"We always knew that, when that opportunity arose, we would all come with him.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe think of it as sort of a gateway, the first of many trips to come, I hope,\" she said.",
      "One aim of vice presidential travel abroad is often soft diplomacy, or the building of favorable attitudes toward the U.S. through imagery and symbolism.",
      "When Vance, with his wife of Indian descent and their children, is photographed at the Taj Mahal, it sends a message of solidarity with that nation. When he visits the Vatican and worships there, it emphasizes common ground with Catholics around the world.",
      "Likewise, when Vance appears in public with his children, it could help drive home his quest to encourage large families and build goodwill among American voters, said University of Dayton political scientist Christopher Devine, co-author of \u201cDo Running Mates Matter?\u201d",
      "\u201cI wonder, with JD Vance, if it's an effort to soften his image,\" Devine said. \u201cHe's someone who has not been particularly popular ever since he entered the national scene, and appearing with family tends to make people a little more likable, harder to hate.\u201d",

      "A pathologist hired by attorneys for death row inmates says a South Carolina man executed by firing squad was conscious and likely in extreme pain for as long as a minute",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A man who was put to death last month in South Carolina's second firing squad execution was conscious and likely in extreme pain for as long as a minute after the bullets, meant to quickly stop his heart, struck him lower than expected, according to a pathologist hired by his attorneys.",
      "An autopsy photo of Mikal Mahdi's torso showed only two distinct wounds from the three volunteer prison employees who all had live ammunition in the April 11 execution, according to the pathologist's report, which was filed Thursday with a letter to the state Supreme Court titled \u201cnotice of botched execution.\u201d",
      "Prison workers suggested two bullets entered his body at the same spot.",
      "\u201cThe shooters missed the intended target area and the evidence indicates that he was struck by only two bullets, not the prescribed three. Consequently, the nature of the internal injuries from the gunshot wounds resulted in a more prolonged death process,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Arden, a pathologist hired by attorneys for condemned inmates.",
      "Arden said that likely meant Mahdi took 30 to 60 seconds to lose consciousness \u2014 two to four times longer than the 15 seconds that experts including Arden and ones hired by the state predicted for a properly conducted firing squad execution.",
      "During that time Mahdi would have suffered excruciating pain as his lungs tried to expand and move into a broken sternum and ribs, as well as from \u201cair hunger\u201d as the damaged lungs struggled and failed to bring in needed oxygen, Arden said.",
      "Witnesses to the execution heard Mahdi cry out as the shots were fired, groan again some 45 seconds later and let out one last low moan just before he appeared to draw his final breath at 75 seconds.",
      "Mahdi, 42, was executed after admitting he killed Orangeburg Public Safety officer James Myers in 2004, shooting him at least eight times before burning his body. Myers\u2019 wife found him in the couple\u2019s Calhoun County shed, which had been the backdrop to their wedding 15 months earlier.",
      "Prison officials have given no indication that there were problems with Mahdi's execution. A shield law keeps many details private, including the training and methods used by the firing squad.",
      "The official autopsy did not include X-rays to allow the results to be independently verified; only one photo was taken of Mahdi\u2019s body, and no close-ups of the wounds; and his clothing was not examined to determine where the target was placed and how it aligned with the damage the bullets caused to his shirt, Arden said in a report summarizing his findings.",
      "\u201cI noticed where the target was placed on Mikal\u2019s torso, and I remember thinking to myself, \u2018I\u2019m certainly not an expert in human anatomy, but it appears to me that target looks low,\u2019\u201d said David Weiss, an attorney for Mahdi who was also a witness at his death.",
      "In the official autopsy report, pathologist Dr. Bradley Marcus wrote that the reason there were only two wounds is that one could have been caused by two bullets entering the body at the same spot. Marcus said he spoke to an unnamed prison official who reported that when the three volunteer firing squad members practice, sometimes their targets end up with just one or two holes from three live rounds.",
      "Arden called that virtually unheard of in his 40 years of examining dead bodies and said Marcus told him in a conversation that the possibility was remote.",
      "The autopsy found damage in only one of the four chambers of Mahdi's heart \u2014 the right ventricle. There was extensive damage to his liver and pancreas as the bullets continued down.",
      "\u201cThe entrance wounds were at the lowest area of the chest, just above the border with the abdomen, which is an area not largely overlying the heart,\u201d Arden wrote.",
      "In their conversation Marcus also said the severe amount of liver damage was not anticipated and he \u201cexpected the entrance wounds to be higher on the chest,\u201d Arden wrote in his report.",
      "In contrast the autopsy on Brad Sigmon, the first man killed by firing squad in the state, showed three distinct bullet wounds and his heart was obliterated, Arden said. He added that the autopsy report in that case included X-rays, adequate photos and a cursory examination of his clothes.",
      "Without X-rays or other internal scans to follow the path of the bullets through Mahdi\u2019s body, no additional light could be shed on the two-bullets-through-one-hole claim, Arden said.",
      "Weiss said he was stunned that so little was done in the autopsy even after the pathologist saw only two holes in his chest. The apparent errors in how the execution was carried out are a major problem, he asserted.",
      "\u201cHis heart was missed, and in all likelihood only two out of three shots were fired,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cAnd I think that raises incredibly difficult questions about the type of training and oversight that is going into this process.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was obvious to me as a lay person upon reading his autopsy report that something went wrong here. We should want to figure out what it was that went wrong when you\u2019ve got state government carrying out the most serious, most grave possible type of function,\u201d Weiss said.",
      "Mahdi's body was cremated preventing a second autopsy, Weiss said.",
      "South Carolina allows condemned inmates to choose whether to die by lethal injection, electric chair or firing squad. Three in the past year have chosen lethal injection, but the past two opted for the firing squad, saying they feared the other methods \u2014 autopsies have shown that lethal injection causes a rush of fluid into the lungs, and burns have been found on bodies after electrocutions.",
      "Twenty-six people remain on South Carolina's death row. Stephen Stanko, who has two death sentences for murders in Horry County and Georgetown County, has run out of appeals and likely will be scheduled to die in June.",

      "The trial of a Michigan police officer charged with second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of a 26-year-old Black man has ended in a mistrial",
      "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- A jury couldn\u2019t reached a unanimous verdict Thursday in the second-degree murder trial of a Michigan police officer who shot Patrick Lyoya, a Black man, following a traffic stop in 2022.",
      "The judge declared a mistrial and ended the proceedings, a partial victory for Christopher Schurr, who still could face another trial. Lyoya\u2019s death had sparked weeks of protest in Grand Rapids, especially after the city\u2019s police chief released video of the confrontation.",
      "Schurr shot Lyoya, a Congolese immigrant, in the back of the head while the 26-year-old lay facedown on the ground. Schurr told jurors that he feared his life was at stake after losing control of his Taser during an intense struggle in a residential neighborhood.",
      "\u201cThank you for your time,\u201d Judge Christina Mims told the jury.",
      "The mistrial came a day after three former Memphis police officers were acquitted in the beating death of Tyre Nichols after a traffic stop. His death more than two years ago was the first post-George Floyd case that revealed the limits of an unprecedented reckoning over police reform and racial injustice in Black America.",
      "Schurr, a seven-year veteran of the Grand Rapids police department, was fired shortly after he was charged in 2022.",
      "Schurr stopped a Nissan Altima driven by Lyoya for improper license plates on April 4, 2022.",
      "Body camera and dash camera footage showed Lyoya running after Schurr requested his driver\u2019s license. Schurr tackled him and a struggle ensued. The officer tried to subdue Lyoya by firing his Taser but he was unsuccessful.",
      "Lyoya eventually got control of the device, which fires electrically charged probes, and Schurr repeatedly demanded that he stop resisting and drop the Taser.",
      "Schurr was on top of Lyoya when he shot him in the head. Videos were a key part of trial and were repeatedly shown to the jury.",
      "The struggle with the Taser was central to Schurr\u2019s defense. He testified that he was \u201crunning on fumes\u201d after the fight and in great fear because a Taser can cause \u201cexcruciating pain\u201d and injury.",
      "\u201cI believed that if I hadn\u2019t done it at that time, I wasn\u2019t going to go home,\u201d Schurr said of shooting Lyoya.",
      "The prosecutor, however, argued that the Taser had already been deployed twice by Schurr by that time and could only be used in a different mode if Lyoya had decided to turn it against the officer.",
      "It\u2019s not known why Lyoya was trying to flee. Records show his driver\u2019s license was revoked at the time and there was an arrest warrant for him in a domestic violence case, though Schurr didn\u2019t know it. An autopsy revealed his blood-alcohol level was three times above the legal limit for driving, according to testimony.",
      "Lyoya ultimately joined a list of other Black immigrants who sought better lives in the U.S., only to suffer abuse or death at the hands of law enforcement. Before him were Botham Jean, Amadou Diallo and Abner Louima \u2014 all men whose cases increased awareness around the global impact of systemic racism in policing.",
      "As in many U.S. cities, Grand Rapids police have been occasionally criticized over the use of force, particularly against Black people, who make up 18% of the population.",

      "CHANDLER, Ariz. -- There were dozens of statements submitted to the court by family and friends of Christopher Pelkey when it came time to sentence the man convicted of shooting him during a road rage incident. They provided glimpses of Pelkey\u2019s humor, his character and his military service.",
      "But there was nothing quite like hearing from the victim himself \u2014 in this case, an AI-generated version.",
      "In what's believed to be a first in U.S. courts, Pelkey\u2019s family used artificial intelligence to create a video using his likeness to give him a voice. The AI rendering of Pelkey told the shooter during the sentencing hearing last week that it was a shame they had to meet that day in 2021 under those circumstances \u2014 and that the two of them probably could have been friends in another life.",
      "\u201cI believe in forgiveness and in God who forgives. I always have and I still do,\u201d Pelkey's avatar told Gabriel Paul Horcasitas.",
      "The AI version of Pelkey went on to share advice for people to make the most of each day and to love each other, not knowing how much time one might have left.",
      "While use of artificial intelligence within the court system is expanding, it's typically been reserved for administrative tasks, legal research, case preparation. In Arizona, it's helped inform the public of rulings in significant cases.",
      "Using AI to generate victim impact statements marks a new \u2014 and legal, at least in Arizona \u2014 tool for sharing information with the court outside the evidentiary phases.",
      "Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Todd Lang, who presided over the road rage case, said after watching the video that he imagined Pelkey, who was 37 at the time of his killing, would have felt that way after learning about him. Lang also noted the video said something about Pelkey's family, who had expressed their anger over his death and had asked for Horcasitas to receive the maximum sentence.",
      "Horcasitas was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 10.5 imprisonment.",
      "\u201cEven though that's what you wanted, you allowed Chris to speak from his heart as you saw it,\" Lang said.",
      "The Associated Press left phone and emailed messages Wednesday seeking comment from Horcasitas' lawyer.",
      "Pelkey\u2019s sister, Stacey Wales, raised the idea of her brother speaking for himself.",
      "For years, while the case worked its way through the legal system, Wales said she thought about what she would say at the sentencing hearing. She struggled to get words down on paper.",
      "But when she thought about what her brother would say to the shooter, knowing he would have forgiven him, the words poured out of her.",
      "In Arizona, victims can give their impact statements in any digital format, said victims\u2019 rights attorney Jessica Gattuso, who represented the family.",
      "Arizona Supreme Court Justice Ann Timmer didn't address the road rage case specifically in an interview Wednesday. But she said the rise in popularity and accessibility to AI in recent years led to the formation of a committee to research best practices in the courts.",
      "Gary Marchant, a member of the committee and a law professor at Arizona State University, said he understands why Pelkey\u2019s family did it. But he warned the use of this technology could open the door to more people trying to introduce AI-generated evidence into courtrooms.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a real concern among the judiciary and among lawyers that deepfake evidence will be increasingly used,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to create it and anyone can do it on a phone, and it could be incredibly influential because judges and juries, just like all of us, are used to believing what you see.\u201d",
      "Marchant pointed to a recent case in New York, where a man without a lawyer used an AI-generated avatar to argue his case in a lawsuit via video. It took only seconds for the judges on the appeals court to realize that the man addressing them from the video screen didn\u2019t exist at all.",
      "In the Arizona case, Wales said the AI-generated video worked because the judge had nearly 50 letters from family and friends that echoed the video's message.",
      "\u201cThere was a solid gold thread through all of those stories \u2014 that was the heart of Chris,\u201d Wales said. \u201cThis works because it talks about the kind of person Chris was.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- As the Social Security Administration undergoes massive changes and staffing cuts ushered in by the Trump administration, an increasing share of older Americans \u2014 particularly Democrats \u2014 aren't confident the benefit will be available to them, a poll shows.",
      "The share of older Americans who are \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d confident has risen somewhat since 2023, according to the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in April. In the poll, about 3 in 10 U.S. adults age 60 or older are \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d confident that Social Security benefits will be there for them when they need it, up from about 2 in 10 in an AP-NORC poll conducted in 2023.",
      "That shift looks very different depending on older Americans' political party, though. There has been a substantial decrease in confidence among older Democrats. About half of Democrats age 60 or older are \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all confident\u201d that Social Security will be there for them when they need it, a sizable swing from 2023, when only about 1 in 10 said they were \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d confident.",

In contrast with older Democrats, about 6 in 10 Republicans age 60 or older are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d confident that Social Security will be there when they need it, up from only about one-quarter who thought this in 2023.",
      "The findings point to a partisan divide in the ongoing debate over the benefits program, which serves millions of people. When the 2023 poll was conducted, a Democratic president, Joe Biden, was in the White House, which may have contributed to older Democrats' confidence in the program. Now, large changes including mass federal worker layoffs, cuts to programs and office closures are being ushered in by Republican President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire adviser Elon Musk. A planned cut to nationwide Social Security phone services was eventually walked back.",
      "Musk, who recently said he is preparing to wind down his role with the Trump administration, garnered widespread condemnation when, in March, he said on a podcast interview with Joe Rogan that the Social Security program is a \u201cPonzi scheme.\u201d",

      "Dennis Riera, a 65-year-old Republican in Huntington Beach, California, says Musk\u2019s comments have made him feel very worried.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a shame that something that so many people have relied on for so many generations is being looked at as a Ponzi scheme,\u201d Riera said.

      "Voters in recent weeks have flooded town halls to express their displeasure with the cuts, and both political parties expect Social Security to emerge as a key issue in next year\u2019s midterm elections.

      "The Social Security Administration has for decades moved closer toward its go-broke date, when it will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035, according to the 2024 Social Security and Medicare trustees report.",
      "Social Security would then only be able to pay 83% of benefits. A common misconception is that Social Security would be completely unable to pay benefits once it reaches its go-broke date.",
      "Roughly 72.5 million people, including retirees and children, receive Social Security benefits.",
      "Older Americans are generally more confident that Social Security will be available to them than younger adults are, according to the poll. About half of U.S. adults under age 30 are \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d confident that Social Security will be there for them, which is unchanged from 2023.",
      "That skepticism transcends party loyalty. Younger Republicans aren't sure, on the whole, whether Social Security will be around to benefit them.

      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- After three former Memphis police officers were acquitted Wednesday in the beating death of Tyre Nichols, community and civil rights leaders expressed outrage over another disappointment in the long push for police reform.",
      "Nichols' death at a traffic stop more than two years ago sparked nationwide protests and renewed calls for systemic change as the first post-George Floyd case that revealed the limits of an unprecedented reckoning over racial injustice in Black America.",
      "Now, Wednesday's acquittals again show the need for reforms at the federal level, civil rights leaders said.",
      "\u201cTyre and his family deserve true justice \u2014 not only in the courtroom, but in Congress, by passing police reform legislation once and for all,\" NAACP President Derrick Johnson posted on social media. \"Traffic stops should never be a death sentence, and a badge should never\u2014 ever \u2014 be a shield to accountability.\u201d",
      "The Rev. Al Sharpton, who spoke Wednesday to Nichols' mother and stepfather, said they were outraged.",
      "\u201cJustice can still be delivered,\u201d Sharpton added in a statement, referring to the officers' upcoming sentencing in a federal civil rights case. \u201cTyre\u2019s death was preventable, inexcusable, and tragic.\u201d",
      "Nichols, 29, was on his way home on Jan. 7, 2023, when he was stopped for an alleged traffic violation. He was pulled out of his car by officers, one of whom shot at him with a Taser. Nichols ran away, according to video footage that showed him brutally beaten by five officers. An autopsy found he died from blows to the head.",
      "Three officers were acquitted Wednesday of all state charges, including second-degree murder, in the fatal beating. All five officers, the city of Memphis and the police chief are being sued by Nichols\u2019 family for $550 million. A trial has been scheduled for next year.",
      "\u201cLet this be a rally and cry: We must confront the broken systems that empowered this injustice and demand the change our nation \u2014 and Tyre\u2019s legacy \u2014 deserves,\u201d said civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing the family in the lawsuit.",
      "After Floyd's 2020 murder by a former Minneapolis police officer, states adopted hundreds of police reform proposals, creating civilian oversight of police, more anti-bias training and stricter use-of-force limits, among other measures. But federal reforms in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act have been stuck in Congress without enough bipartisan support to get enacted during the Biden administration.",
      "The Nichols case sparked a 17-month federal investigation into the Memphis Police Department, which found a host of civil rights violations, including using excessive force, making illegal traffic stops and disproportionately targeting Black people.",
      "Last year, police traffic-stop reforms put in place in Memphis after Nichols\u2019 death were repealed by GOP Gov. Bill Lee, despite pleas from civil rights advocates.",
      "One of the ordinances had outlawed traffic stops for reasons unrelated to a motorist's driving, such as a broken taillight and other minor violations. Lee echoed arguments from Republican lawmakers who said Nichols\u2019 death needed to result in accountability for officers who abuse power, not new limits on traffic stops.",
      "Speaking after Wednesday's acquittal, Shelby County District Attorney Steven Mulroy said: \u201cOur office will continue to push for accountability for everybody who violates the law, including if not especially, those who are sworn to uphold it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re going to have any silver lining from this dark cloud of both the event itself and in my view today\u2019s verdict, it has to be that we need to reaffirm our commitment to police reform,\u201d he said.",
      "Thaddeus Johnson, a former Memphis police commander and a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice, said Nichols' beating and Wednesday's acquittal compound wounds from generations of policing problems in the majority-Black city.",
      "\u201cI do believe that reform is local, but I do believe this has kind of put a black eye on things,\u201d Johnson told the AP. \"People feel like police cannot be held accountable. Or they won\u2019t be held accountable.\u201d",
      "Andre Johnson, a pastor at Gifts of Life Ministries in Memphis and a community activist, said he was disappointed but not surprised at the verdict.",
      "\u201cIt is extremely difficult to convict officers even when they are on camera,\u201d he said, calling the acquittal \u201da loud and clarion acknowledgement that certain groups of people do not matter.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor a lot of people who have had engagement with police officers, the message is loud and clear: that even if we get you on camera, doing what you did to Tyre, that you cannot face justice.\u201d",

      "FBI Director Kash Patel is breaking with the Trump administration over a budget proposal that would dramatically slash funding for the bureau",
      "WASHINGTON -- FBI Director Kash Patel broke with the Trump administration Wednesday over a budget proposal that would dramatically slash funding for the bureau, telling lawmakers, \u201cWe need more than what has been proposed.\u201d",
      "The 2026 budget proposal released on Friday calls for a funding cut of more than $500 million for the FBI as part of what the White House said was a desire to \u201creform and streamline\u201d the bureau and reduce \u201cnon-law enforcement missions that do not align\u201d with the priorities of President Donald Trump. Patel warned that such a cut would be harmful for the FBI as it reorients priorities to focus on violent crime.",
      "Asked to specify at a House Appropriations subcommittee which positions would need to be cut if the funding reduction was implemented, Patel replied: \u201cAt this time, we have not looked at who to cut. We are focusing our energies on how not to have them cut by coming in here and highlighting to you that we can\u2019t do the mission on those 2011 budget levels.\u201d",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, pressed Patel for details, saying, \u201cThis is your budget. You have to have some idea of what you want to fund or not fund, or where you can cut or not cut, and provide that information\u201d to the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "\u201cThat's the proposed budget \u2014 not by the FBI,\u201d Patel replied. \u201cThe proposed budget that I put forward is to cover us for for $11.1 billion, which would not have us cut any positions.\u201d",
      "Patel also defended the FBI's plan to relocate about 1,000 FBI employees from the Washington area to cities around the country, one of the first initiatives he revealed upon being sworn in as director in February.",
      "\u201cPart of the process is not just putting people out sporadically, throwing darts on the map. What we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve taken a process with the (career employees) at the FBI and said, \u2018Where are some of the most violent crime places in America?\u2019\u201d Patel said.",
      "Patel also clashed during one contentious exchange with Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, who served as a House impeachment manager during the second of two impeachment cases against Trump in his first term.",
      "She asserted that the FBI had become \u201cweaponized\u201d under Patel and confronted him over a book he had authored, saying a list of Trump adversaries he included in it amounted to an \u201cenemies list\" and was being used by Trump as a \u201cblueprint for revenge.\u201d",
      "Patel replied that he was the one who had been \u201ctargeted by a weaponized FBI,\" presumably referring to the fact that he was among the people whose records were secretly seized by the Justice Department years earlier as part of media leak investigations when he was a staffer on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence conducting an investigation into Russian election interference.",
      "\u201cYou should read the book because there\u2019s no enemies list (in) that book,\u201d Patel continued. \"There are people that violated their constitutional obligations and their duties to the American people, and they were rightly called out. And you should give that book to every one of your constituents so they can read\" about it.",

      "Witnesses in criminal cases are sometimes excluded from attending trials to prevent them from shaping their testimony in response to what other witnesses have said or what evidence has been presented.

      "\u201cCourts recognize that having defendant\u2019s family members present at trial advances the values served by the right to public trial, i.e., ensuring fair proceedings; reminding the prosecutor and judge of their grave responsibilities; discouraging perjury; and encouraging witnesses to come forward,\u201d Hippler wrote.",
      "Kohberger, 30, a former graduate student in criminal justice at nearby Washington State University, is charged in the stabbing deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 13, 2022.",
      "Prosecutors have said they intended to seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted at his trial, which is set to begin in August.",
      "Hippler said the court must balance Kohberger's right to a public trial with the state's interest in obtaining forthright testimony from witnesses. But, he added, there is little risk of Kohberger's family members shaping what they might say from the witness stand in response to what they observe at the trial: The scope of their proposed testimony is narrow, and they have previously given recorded interviews that will help guard against them altering what they say.",

      "The rent stabilization measure, House Bill 1217, adds Washington to states like Oregon and California that have sought new ways to curb homelessness.",
      "Bill sponsor Sen. Emily Alvarado, a West Seattle Democrat, said the measure sets common-sense guardrails on the state\u2019s rental-housing market \u201cso that hardworking families and older adults don\u2019t get unchecked excessive rent increases.\u201d",

      "It almost didn't make it.",
      "It successfully moved through both houses, but two amendments added on the Senate floor sent it into a conference committee. Those amendments increased the cap from 7% to 10% plus inflation and exempted single-family homes. Opponents of the bill argued that developers would leave the state if it became law and said similar policies in Oregon and California added to those states\u2019 financial burdens instead of slowing the homeless crisis.",

      "___",
      "A video showing a Minnesota woman at a playground last week openly admitting to using a racist slur against a Black child has garnered millions of views. But what's been equally appalling for some is that the woman has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in crowdfunds.",
      "In the video, a man in Rochester, a city roughly 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of Minneapolis, confronts the woman for calling a 5-year-old boy the N-word. The woman appears to double-down on the racist term and flips off the man confronting her with both of her middle fingers.",
      "The woman, who could not be reached for comment, has since amassed over $700,000 through Christian fundraising platform GiveSendGo for relocation expenses because of threats she received over the video. The fundraising page said she used the word out of frustration because the boy went through her 18-month-old child's diaper bag. The Associated Press has not verified this assertion.",
      "\u201cI called the kid out for what he was,\u201d she wrote, adding that the online videos have \u201ccaused my family, and myself, great turmoil.\u201d",
      "The flurry of monetary contributions has reignited multiple debates, from whether racist language and attacks are becoming more permissible to the differences between \u201ccancel culture\u201d and \u201cconsequence culture.\u201d Many want to see the woman face some sort of comeuppance for using a slur, especially toward a child. Others say despite her words, she does not deserve to be harassed. The confrontation is reminiscent of others from the internet age in which the instigator of assaults or verbal attacks obtained almost folk hero status, while the victim received a tepid show of support by comparison.",
      "The NAACP Rochester chapter started its own fundraising campaign for the child\u2019s family. The GoFundMe page had raised $340,000 when it was closed Saturday per the wishes of the family, who want privacy, said the civil rights organization. It was speaking on behalf of the family of the child, who the organization said was on the autism spectrum.",
      "\u201cThis was not simply offensive behavior\u2014it was an intentional racist, threatening, hateful and verbal attack against a child, and it must be treated as such,\u201d the NAACP Rochester chapter said in a statement.",
      "The Rochester Police Department investigated and submitted findings to the Rochester City Attorney\u2019s Office for \u201cconsideration of a charging decision,\u201d spokesperson Amanda Grayson said in a statement Monday.",
      "GiveSendGo did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The donations did and did not surprise Dr. Henry Taylor, director for the Center of Urban Studies at the University at Buffalo.",
      "But shifts in the political and cultural climate have emboldened some people to express racist and bigoted views against people of color or those they consider outsiders. A more recent backlash, from the White House to corporate boardrooms, against diversity, equality and inclusion initiatives have amplified those feelings.",
      "The racism \u201chovering beneath the surface\" comes from blame, Taylor said. \"People are given someone to hate and someone to blame for all of the problems and challenges that they are facing themselves,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "The volume of monetary contributions in the Rochester case is reminiscent of the surge of support for individuals like Kyle Rittenhouse, Daniel Penny and George Zimmerman. All three men were legally found to have acted in self-defense or in defense of others after the death of a Black victim \u2014 except Rittenhouse, who killed two white protesters at a racial justice demonstration against police.",
      "The support and opposition in these cases has often been split along party lines.",
      "In the woman\u2019s case, a contingent of supporters just want to fight cancel culture, said Franciska Coleman, an assistant professor of law at University of Wisconsin Law School, who has written about cancel culture and social regulation of speech. For some it can include donating \u201cto everyone who they in quotes try to \u2018cancel.\u2019\u201d",
      "Some people are fixated on how \u201cit just seems too much that this mother of two young kids is getting death threats and rape threats,\u201d Coleman said.",
      "Conservative commentators have gone online to applaud her for not capitulating to angry internet mobs while acknowledging she used a hateful word. \u201cNo one\u2019s excusing it. But she didn\u2019t deserve to be treated like a domestic terrorist,\u201d conservative podcast host Matt Walsh said in a Facebook post.",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- The Democratic controlled cities of Salt Lake City and Boise adopted new city flags this week showing support for LGBTQ+ people in defiance of their states\u2019 Republican-controlled Legislatures, which have banned traditional rainbow pride flags at schools and government buildings.",
      "Utah's capital of Salt Lake City created new flag designs while Boise, the capital of Idaho, made the traditional pride flag one of its official city flags. The move in Utah came hours before a ban on unsanctioned flag displays took effect Wednesday.",
      "The cities' mayors spoke Tuesday morning to discuss their individual plans and offer each other support, said Andrew Wittenberg, a spokesperson for Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall's office.",
      "\u201cMy sincere intent is not to provoke or cause division,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cMy intent is to represent our city's values and honor our dear diverse residents who make up this beautiful city and the legacy of pain and progress that they have endured.\u201d",
      "Idaho\u2019s flag ban took effect April 3, barring government buildings from displaying any flags except those on a short list including the U.S. flag, flags of military branches and official flags of government entities. A separate ban containing some exemptions for school buildings takes effect July 1.",
      "Supporters said the laws would encourage political neutrality from teachers and other government employees. Opponents argued they aimed to erase LGBTQ+ expression and wrest authority from cities and towns that did not align politically with the Republican Legislatures.",
      "More than a dozen other states are considering similar measures.",
      "The pride flag has regularly flown over Boise's City Hall for years, and Mayor Lauren McLean kept the flag aloft even after Idaho's law took effect. McLean said she believed the law was unenforceable.",
      "But Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador recently warned he would ask lawmakers to add an enforcement mechanism in the 2026 legislative session.",
      "Under the Utah law, state or local government buildings can be fined $500 a day for flying any flag other than the U.S. flag, the state flag, a city or county flag, military flags, Olympic and Paralympic flags, official college flags or tribal flags. Political flags are not allowed.",
      "Last week, McLean responded to the Idaho law by issuing a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag, along with a flag honoring organ donors. It allowed both to be flown alongside Boise's traditional blue flag featuring the Capitol building and the slogan \u201cCity of Trees.\u201d",

      "\u201cRemoving the flag now after years of flying it proudly would not be a neutral act,\u201d said council member Meredith Stead. \u201cIt would signal a retreat from values we\u2019ve long upheld and send a disheartening message to those who have found affirmation and belonging through its presence at city hall.\u201d",
      "Some in attendance held pride flags while others waved the U.S. flag. At times, shouts erupted, prompting a brief recess.",
      "Utah in March became the first state to enact a ban on unsanctioned flags at all government buildings. Republican Gov. Spencer Cox let the bill become law without his signature. He said he thought it went too far in regulating local governments but chose not to reject it because his veto would likely be overridden by the Legislature.",
      "Utah's law does not explicitly mention LGBTQ+ pride flags, but the bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican Rep. Trevor Lee, repeatedly stated he aimed to ban them.",
      "Council members in Salt Lake City unanimously approved new designs Tuesday evening, adding the city\u2019s emblem \u2014 a sego lily \u2014 atop the traditional rainbow LGBTQ+ pride flag and the blue, pink and white transgender flag. They also adopted a red and blue flag for Juneteenth, a federal holiday celebrated on June 19 that commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S.",

It demands a trial by jury and over $25,000 for damages including loss of earnings and attorney fees to be paid by Scott and the school. A message was sent Wednesday to school officials seeking comment on the lawsuit.",

      "Scott also played for the Indiana Pacers and then-Vancouver Grizzlies before returning to the Lakers for the 1996-97 season, his last as a player in the league. He was a valued mentor for a team that featured Shaquille O\u2019Neal and 18-year-old rookie Kobe Bryant. Scott later was Bryant\u2019s head coach with the Lakers.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday that Russia was \u201casking for too much\u201d in its initial peace offer as the United States looks to bring about an end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "The vice president, speaking at a Washington meeting hosted by the Munich Security Conference, did not elaborate on Moscow's terms, but said he was not pessimistic about the possibility of a peace deal. That is a more sanguine assessment than President Donald Trump's recent skepticism that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to end the war that begin in February 2022 when Russia invaded.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that the Russians are uninterested in bringing this thing to a resolution,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWhat I would say is right now: the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict. We think they\u2019re asking for too much,\u201d he said.",
      "Vance did not repeat any of the criticisms of Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Vance had aired during an Oval Office blowup in February with the Ukrainian leader, and he made a point of saying the U.S. appreciated Ukraine's willingness to have a 30-day ceasefire. But the Republican vice president, citing Russia\u2019s unwillingness on that point, said the U.S. would like to move past that and have the Russian and Ukrainian leaders sit down directly to negotiate a long-term settlement that would end the fighting.",
      "\u201cWhat the Russians have said is, \u2018A 30-day ceasefire is not in our strategic interests.\u2019 So we\u2019ve tried to move beyond the obsession with the 30-day ceasefire and more on the, what would a long-term settlement look like,\u201d Vance said.",
      "Vance's talk at the conference event followed his appearance at the organization's February summit in Germany, where he ruffled feathers for his comments that free speech is \u201cin retreat\u201d across Europe. Vance addressed that Wednesday and said his comments applied to the U.S. under Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, just as they did to Europe.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018Europe bad, America good.\u2019 It\u2019s that I think that both Europe and the United States, we got a little bit off track, and I encourage us all to get back on track together,\u201d he said.",
      "On the Middle East, Vance did not shed light on the timing of planned talks between the U.S. and Iran over Iran's nuclear program. He said the Trump administration felt the inspection and enforcement provisions in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal negotiated under Democratic President Barack Obama were \u201cincredibly weak\u201d and \u201callowed Iran to sort of stay on this glide path toward a nuclear weapon if they flip the switch and press go.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe think that there is a deal here that would reintegrate Iran into the global economy, that would be really good for the Iranian people, but would result in the complete cessation of any chance that they can get a nuclear weapon. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re negotiating toward,\u201d Vance said.",

      "Investigators found that multiple factors likely led to the crash. But as with several previous military aviation accidents, investigators had to make some assumptions because the CH-53 was not equipped with a flight data recorder capable of surviving a crash.",
      "The limits of night vision goggles also have been identified as a potential factor in the fatal collision of an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger jet near Reagan Washington National Airport in January that killed 67 people. The goggles can reduce a pilot's ability to determine distance and can be degraded by weather or light pollution.",
      "The Marine helicopter was flying in icing conditions with low cloud cover that obscured the mountainous terrain along the flight path. The crew was using night vision goggles, which likely did not give them the clear picture needed to avoid a crash into terrain, investigators found.",
      "The precipitation and clouds probably degraded the goggles' performance and possibly gave the crew a false sense that they were maintaining the safe distances needed in the flight, investigators found.",
      "The pilot and crew chief \u201cmost likely believed they were operating legally and within their comfort level,\u201d investigators found.",
      "Ultimately, though, investigators found that the pilot's failure to avoid the terrain was the primary cause of the crash. They also found that the commanding officer, who was relieved of duty due to a loss of confidence in an ability to lead, should not have given the crew approval to fly.",
      "The Super Stallion vanished during the overnight flight on its way back to Miramar from Creech Air Force Base. The helicopter was discovered in the morning near the mountain community of Pine Valley.",

      "Three former Memphis officers have been acquitted of all state charges, including second-degree murder, in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols after he ran away from a traffic stop",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Three former Memphis officers were acquitted Wednesday of all state charges, including second-degree murder, in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols after he ran away from a traffic stop, a death that sparked nationwide protests and prompted renewed calls for police reforms in the U.S.",
      "An out-of-town jury from a majority-white county took about 8 1/2 hours over two days to find Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith not guilty on all charges after a nine-day trial in state court in Memphis, which is majority-Black. After the jury's verdict was read, the defendants hugged their lawyers as relatives of the former officers cried. Outside the courtroom, one relative yelled, \u201cThank you, Jesus!\u201d",
      "Martin Zummach, Smith\u2019s attorney, told The Associated Press by text: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to defend a good person. It\u2019s nerve racking to represent an innocent man. \u201c",
      "The three defendants still face the prospect of years in prison after they were convicted of federal charges, though they were acquitted of the most serious charges there, too. Two other former officers previously pleaded guilty in both state and federal court, including Emmitt Martin, who defense attorneys blamed for the majority of the violence.",
      "Bean and Smith are out on bond and under house arrest after their federal convictions. Haley is being held in federal prison.",
      "Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, fled a traffic stop after he was yanked out of his car, pepper-sprayed and hit with a Taser. Five officers who are also Black caught up with him and punched, kicked and hit him with a police baton, struggling to handcuff Nichols as he called out for his mother just steps from his home. Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating.",
      "Footage of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries, video that prompted intense scrutiny of police in Memphis.",
      "Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Nichols\u2019 family, issued a statement expressing outrage at the outcome of the trial.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s verdicts are a devastating miscarriage of justice,\u201d the statement reads. \u201dThe world watched as Tyre Nichols was beaten to death by those sworn to protect and serve.\u201d",
      "Memphis District Attorney Steve Mulroy said he respects the jury but thinks the evidence was there for every charge that prosecutors brought.",
      "\u201cWas I surprised that there wasn\u2019t a single guilty verdict on any of the counts or any of the lesser-included offenses, given the overwhelming evidence that we presented? Yes, I was surprised. Do I have an explanation for it? No.\u201d",
      "He said he spoke to Nichols\u2019 family briefly and, \u201cThey were devastated. ... I think they were outraged, and we can understand why they would be outraged, given the evidence.\u201d",
      "Former Memphis officers Desmond Mills Jr. and Martin, who were also involved in the beating, did not stand trial in state court after they agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors. They also pleaded guilty in federal court, where sentencing for all five officers is pending.",
      "At trial, defense attorneys emphasized that Martin kicked and punched Nichols several times in the head.",
      "The defense also seemed to score points with their use-of-force experts, who testified that the three officers on trial acted in compliance with police department policies and widely accepted law enforcement standards. Attorneys for Bean and Smith called character witnesses who testified that the men were good officers who did their job the right way.",
      "Mills testified for the prosecution, saying he regrets his failure to stop the beating, which led to Nichols\u2019 death from blunt force trauma. Nichols suffered tears and bleeding in the brain, Dr. Marco Ross, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, said in court testimony.",
      "The officers had been charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. In addition to beating Nichols, prosecutors also said the officers failed to intervene and failed to tell medical personnel that Nichols had been hit repeatedly in the head.",
      "Mills acknowledged on the stand that he had a duty to intervene, but didn\u2019t. He admitted Nichols never punched or kicked any of the officers.",
      "But Mills also bolstered the defense's case when he said Nichols was actively resisting arrest and not complying with orders to present his hands to be cuffed. Under cross-examination, he indicated he would not have struck Nichols if Nichols had put his hands behind his back. He also agreed that an officer is not safe until a suspect is handcuffed and searched for a weapon.",
      "Zummach noted in closing arguments that credit and debit cards that did not belong to Nichols were found in his car when it was searched after the beating and said it was likely why Nichols ran from the traffic stop. Defense lawyers have argued that the fatal beating would not have taken place if Nichols had just allowed himself to be handcuffed.",
      "\u201cThis is Emmitt Martin\u2019s and Tyre Nichols\u2019 doing,\u201d Zummach said.",
      "The jury for the state trial was chosen in Hamilton County, which includes Chattanooga, after Judge James Jones Jr. ordered the case be heard from people outside of Shelby County, which includes Memphis. Defense lawyers for the officers had argued that intense publicity made seating a fair jury difficult.",
      "Prosecutor Paul Hagerman told reporters outside the courtroom that the Chattanooga area was chosen for jury selection after the city was shown in a study to have the least amount of pre-trial publicity among Tennessee\u2019s largest cities.",
      "In December, the U.S. Justice Department said a 17-month investigation showed the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people.",

      "Attorneys for a Utah man who has been on death row for 37 years are due before a state judge as they seek to spare the convicted murderer from execution because he has dementia",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Attorneys for a Utah man who has been on death row for 37 years are due before a state judge Wednesday as they seek to spare the convicted murderer from execution because he has dementia.",
      "Ralph Leroy Menzies was sentenced to die in 1988 for the killing of Maurine Hunsaker, a mother of three. His attorneys say the 67-year-old inmate's dementia is so severe that he cannot understand why he's facing execution.",
      "If he is deemed competent, Menzies could be one of the next U.S. prisoners executed by firing squad after the method was used on two South Carolina men in recent weeks: a man convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend\u2019s parents in 2001 and a man who killed an off duty police officer in 2004.",
      "Medical experts brought in by prosecutors say Menzies still has the mental capacity to understand his situation, while those brought in by the defense say he does not. The hearing Wednesday will be the last in Menzies' competency case before Judge Matthew Bates issues an opinion, said Eric Zuckerman, a lawyer for Menzies.",
      "Menzies is not the first person to receive a dementia diagnosis while awaiting execution.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in 2019 blocked the execution of a man with dementia in Alabama, ruling Vernon Madison was protected against execution under a constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Madison, who killed a police officer in 1985, died in prison in 2020.",
      "That case followed earlier Supreme Court rulings barring executions of people with severe mental illness. If a defendant cannot understand why they are dying, the Supreme Court said, then an execution is not carrying out the retribution that society is seeking.",
      "\u201cIt's not just about mental illness. It can be also the consequence of brain damage or stroke or dementia \u2014 the fundamental question being whether he has a rational understanding of the reasons he is being executed,\u201d said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "More than half of all pris\u00adon\u00aders sen\u00adtenced to death in the U.S. spend more than 18 years on death row, according to the organization.",
      "Menzies earlier chose a firing squad as his method of execution. Utah death row inmates sentenced before May 2004 were given a choice between that and lethal injection. For inmates sentenced in the state after that date, lethal injection is the default method of execution unless the drugs are unavailable.",
      "Since 1977 only five prisoners in the U.S have been executed by firing squad. Three were in Utah, most recently in 2010, and the others in South Carolina.",
      "Hunsaker, a 26-year-old married mother of three, was abducted by Menzies from the gas station where she worked. She was later found strangled and her throat cut at a picnic area in the Wasatch Mountains of northern Utah. Menzies had Hunsaker\u2019s wallet and several other belongings when he was jailed on unrelated matters. He was convicted of first-degree murder and other crimes.",
      "Over nearly four decades, attorneys for Menzies filed multiple appeals that delayed his death sentence, which had been scheduled at least twice before it was pushed back.",
      "Zuckerman said there will be further hearings before any execution warrant can be issued.",

      "MOOSE, Wyo. -- A 5-year-old bear that was a member of a well-known and beloved grizzly family in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park died after it was hit by a vehicle, the same fate that befell his mother late last year, wildlife officials said Tuesday.",
      "Park rangers found the body of the male bear, known as Grizzly No. 1058, about 125 yards (114 meters) from Highway 26 near the Buffalo Fork River on Tuesday. The bear was one of four cubs that emerged in May 2020 with their mother, Grizzly No. 399, who was often called the world's most famous grizzly bear.",
      "Grizzly No. 399, who was beloved for decades by countless tourists, biologists and professional wildlife photographers, was hit and killed by a vehicle in October on a highway south of Jackson, Wyoming. Park officials used wildlife tags to confirm the relationship between the two bears.",
      "Grizzly No. 1058 had been seen occasionally in the park since he was weened in 2022, but no sightings of him had been reported this spring. After he was hit by the vehicle, he made his way to a patch of willows, where he died.",
      "Park officials said Tuesday he may have been dead for several days before his body was found.",
      "At 28 years old, No. 399 was the oldest known reproducing female grizzly in the Yellowstone ecosystem. Each spring, wildlife enthusiasts eagerly awaited her emergence from her den to see how many cubs she had birthed over the winter \u2014 then quickly shared the news online. The bear had 18 known cubs in eight litters over the years, including the litter of four in 2020. She stood around 7 feet (2.1 meters) tall and weighed about 400 pounds (180 kilograms).",
      "Named for the identity tag attached to her ear by researchers, the grizzly was often seen near roads in Grand Teton, drawing crowds and creating traffic jams.",
      "The driver who struck and killed No. 399 was not speeding, and the bear\u2019s death was ruled an accident. Park officials have not released any additional details about the crash that killed No. 1058.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump plans to announce while on his trip to Saudi Arabia next week that the United States will now refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia, according to two U.S. officials.",

      "The two U.S. officials spoke with The Associated Press on Tuesday on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. The White House and National Security Council did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "The Persian Gulf has been widely known by that name since the 16th century, although usage of \u201cGulf of Arabia\u201d and \u201cArabian Gulf\u201d is dominant in many countries in the Middle East.

      "The name of the body of water has become an emotive issue for Iranians who embrace their country\u2019s long history as the Persian Empire. A spat developed in 2017 during Trump\u2019s first term when he used the name Arabian Gulf for the waterway.

There are instances where countries refer to the same body of water or landmark by different names in their own documentation.",
      "In addition to Saudi Arabia, Trump is also set to visit Doha, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, which also lie on the body of water. Originally planned as Trump\u2019s first trip overseas since he took office on Jan. 20, it comes as Trump has tried to draw closer to the Gulf countries as he seeks their financial investment in the U.S. and support in regional conflicts, including resolving the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and limiting Iran\u2019s advancing nuclear program.",
      "The U.S. president also has significant financial ties to the countries through his personal businesses, over which he has retained ownership from the Oval Office.",

      "The bill redistributes power from Birmingham city officials \u2014 who currently appoint a majority of the nine-person board members \u2014 to the governor, the lieutenant governor and the surrounding suburbs that are also in the board's jurisdiction. Board members approve rate hikes and manage infrastructure projects.",
      "The bill's sponsors said that the move was necessary to correct mismanagement and improve the efficiency of the system. The bill passed along party lines 66 to 27 last week and now goes to Republican Gov. Kay Ivey\u2019s desk.",

    "story": [
      "UK interest rates have been cut to 4.25% from 4.5% and the governor of the Bank England has hinted more could follow in the coming months.",
      "Andrew Bailey said he would not \"give predictions as to when and how much\", but said he was \"still of the view that the path, gradually and carefully, is downwards\".",
      "The reduction in rates on Thursday marks the fourth cut within the past year and the Bank considered an even bigger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit UK economic growth.",
      "Mr Bailey welcomed a UK-US deal on tariffs and said it was \"important as a signal, I hope, of many more to come\", adding a UK trade deal with the European Union would be \"beneficial\".",
      "\"Maybe we need a bit of a jolt to the system to remind us that trade is important,\" Mr Bailey said, adding he hoped the likes of deals between the UK and US, and the UK and India, would help to \"rebuild the world trading system\".",
      "On Thursday, the UK and US announced a deal to avoid tariffs on certain goods in order to boost trade.",
      "As it announced the latest cut in interest rates, the Bank said that while a trade war could hit economic growth, it could lead to lower inflation in the UK over time as countries such as China look to divert cheap goods originally bound for America.",
      "Mr Bailey said the path for rates was \"downwards\", but said future rate cuts were likely to be \"gradual and careful\".",

      "The Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, but could continue to face higher repayment costs when renewing.",
      "However, mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year.  On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.14%, while a five-year deal was 5.08%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so rates being cut will have an impact on monthly repayments.",

      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC she had a \"really good rate\", but then got \"caught out\" when rates were previously increased.",

      "The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit carried out an initial investigation into the fire, but Neso noted that detectives found there \"no evidence to suggest\" the incident was suspicious.",
      "The power outage and subsequent closure of Heathrow led to more than 270,000 journeys being affected.",

      "The power outage affected 66,919 domestic and commercial customers, including Heathrow Airport, Neso said.",

      "Neso's chief executive Fintan Slye said: \"It is important that the right lessons are learnt from this incident to prevent future instances where possible and to manage them effectively when they do occur.\"",
      "Power was restored to Heathrow's substations by 06:25 using circuits from another nearby substation, Neso said, and the flow of electricity to all four of Heathrow's passenger terminals was restarted by 10:56.",
      "But Flights did not resume until after 18:00 that day, once safety checks were completed. Planes were able to land and take off through the night to allow Heathrow to get back up to full capacity.",
      "Neso said the re-energisation of the entire airport was only fully completed by 14:23.",
      "Other customers' power was restored by 12:24, the report said, and supply from the North Hyde substation was reinstated the following day.",

      "The airport said at the time that its objective \"was to reopen as soon as safely and practically possible after the fire\".",

      "Over time though, the UK government says lowering tariffs on the likes of clothing, jewellery, and frozen prawns \"could\" lead to cheaper prices and more choice.",
      "This deal could also be a big win for UK businesses which manufacture the goods which have seen tariffs slashed, such as car makers and whisky distillers.",
      "For example, tariffs on whisky and gin being imported to India from the UK will be halved from 150% to 75% before reducing to 40% by the 10th year of the deal. Car tariffs will fall from more than 100% to 10%.",
      "That will provide a boost to those two industries, which look set to be hit hard by US tariffs, as it will mean Indian companies wanting to import those products will pay less import charges than before.",
      "If businesses end up exporting more goods to India and make higher profits, this could lead to them spending more on hiring staff, investing and also paying more tax.",
      "In India, consumers could see much more choice among the goods which have been included under the deal. Clothing manufacturing businesses and jewellers will also be able to access the UK market which will boost their margins.",

      "This deal has been a long time in the making, with on-off negotiations going on for some three years.",
      "However it appears US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on goods entering America has prompted other world leaders to consider striking free-trade deals with one another.",
      "The UK's deal with India is its third biggest after its agreements with Australia and Japan. For context, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU.",
      "The EU is the biggest trade partner for both the UK and India. Therefore, a free trade agreement between India and the EU would be more significant than the one with the UK. Both India and the EU have said they aim to finalise this by the end of 2025.",
      "Last year trade between the UK and India totalled \u00a342bn. The UK government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.",
      "It is said over time it will boost the UK economy by \u00a34.8bn. This is a tiny proportion of the UK economy which was worth \u00a32,851bn last year.",
      "However, India is also forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. It is also home to 1.45bn people - about 20 times the population of the UK -which is a lot of potential customers.",
      "The UK is also a high priority trading partner for India, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1tn (\u00a3750bn) by 2030.",
      "What does this mean for visas?",
      "One of the reasons the UK India free trade deal has taken so long to reach is that India had made big demands about visas for Indian professionals and students to work and study abroad.",

      "But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much.",
      "This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value \u2013 its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets.",
      "Let's look at another measure \u2013 the price of each share.",
      "An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%.",
      "An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%.",
      "What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival \u2013 just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit.",
      "One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets.",
      "UK's Deliveroo to be bought by US firm DoorDash",
      "This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing.",
      "There are many reasons.",
      "Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half.",
      "How can there be such a huge disparity?",
      "Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies \u2013 the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla)",
      "Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings \u2013 still a massive premium to the UK.",
      "One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand.",
      "UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled.",
      "Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds.",
      "But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets \u2013 and they have been dead right.",
      "In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%.",
      "Positive comments",
      "But there are changes afoot.",
      "The government's so-called \"Edinburgh Reforms\", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others.",
      "There have also been positive comments on the attractiveness of the UK from financial giants like Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan.",
      "They both noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year.",
      "The secret that UK stocks are cheap has been out there for some time. That is precisely why private buyers from the US and elsewhere have swooped on UK-listed companies meaning they disappear from the UK stock market.",
      "Even some of the biggest ones left are considered candidates for a move. Shell boss Wael Sawan told the BBC that while he had \"no immediate\" plans to move, he and his company \"got a very warm welcome\" when they held their big reception for investors in New York. Shell trades at a 35% discount to its US-listed peers and many of its shareholders aren't happy about it.",
      "What the DoorDash swoop on Deliveroo seems to highlight once again is that companies listed in the US can summon greater financial firepower with which to expand or acquire their rivals.",
      "Deliveroo will join the likes of Arm Holdings, Morrisons, CRH Holdings, Ultra, Meggitt and many others as companies who used to be listed on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "Does it matter? Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges.",
      "But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here.",
      "Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate.",
      "Trading on the London Stock Exchange is dwarfed by the trading of currencies, bonds and complex contracts but it has always been a centre of gravity for financial activity and one which many argue has lost its power to attract."

      "Boss Sam Altman said OpenAI would remain under the control of its non-profit board, while becoming what is known in the US as a public benefit corporation.",
      "Mr Altman had put forward a similar plan in December - but without clarifying the control of the non-profit.",
      "The update follows widespread scrutiny of the startup, which began as a non-profit and faced criticism, including from co-founder Elon Musk, that its quest for growth is pushing it to stray from its original mission of creating technology for the benefit of humanity.",
      "Last month, a group of former open AI staff and outside experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, wrote to regulators in California and Delaware, which have power over non-profits, asking them to intervene to block the conversion.",

      "In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said the non-profit would continue to control OpenAI, receiving a \"big\", yet-to-be determined stake in OpenAI's business arm, which would give it access to money to put towards its own goals.",
      "He said the new plan would still allow the organisation to stop operating under its current complex governance structure, which had capped its profits.",

      "Unlike traditional for-profit companies, which are bound to act in service to shareholders, a public benefit corporation is also responsible for a public mission.",
      "In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said he believed that growth and extending access to AI, which would take money, was consistent with the firm's mission, because it would help people \"build incredible things for each other and continue to drive society and quality of life forward\".",

    "summary": "The South American country is turning to wind power, but some local people are unhappy.",
    "story": [
      "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.",
      "With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.",
      "But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.",
      "\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.",
      "His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.",
      "\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.",
      "The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.",
      "Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.",
      "Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.",
      "Mr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.",
      "\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.",
      "His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.",
      "\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.",
      "These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.",
      "\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.",
      "\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"",

    "story": [
      "UK interest rates have been cut to 4.25% from 4.5% and the governor of the Bank England has hinted more could follow in the coming months.",
      "Andrew Bailey said he would not \"give predictions as to when and how much\", but said he was \"still of the view that the path, gradually and carefully, is downwards\".",
      "The reduction in rates on Thursday marks the fourth cut within the past year and the Bank considered an even bigger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit UK economic growth.",
      "Mr Bailey welcomed a UK-US deal on tariffs and said it was \"important as a signal, I hope, of many more to come\", adding a UK trade deal with the European Union would be \"beneficial\".",
      "\"Maybe we need a bit of a jolt to the system to remind us that trade is important,\" Mr Bailey said, adding he hoped the likes of deals between the UK and US, and the UK and India, would help to \"rebuild the world trading system\".",
      "On Thursday, the UK and US announced a deal to avoid tariffs on certain goods in order to boost trade.",
      "As it announced the latest cut in interest rates, the Bank said that while a trade war could hit economic growth, it could lead to lower inflation in the UK over time as countries such as China look to divert cheap goods originally bound for America.",
      "Mr Bailey said the path for rates was \"downwards\", but said future rate cuts were likely to be \"gradual and careful\".",
      "The minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided. Of the nine members, five voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.",
      "The Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, but could continue to face higher repayment costs when renewing.",
      "However, mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year.  On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.14%, while a five-year deal was 5.08%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so rates being cut will have an impact on monthly repayments.",
      "A typical tracker mortgage-holder is likely to see about \u00a329 knocked off their monthly repayments following the latest cut, said the banking trade body UK Finance.",
      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC she had a \"really good rate\", but then got \"caught out\" when rates were previously increased.",
      "\"A drop would help because I've just been made redundant, so that would help a wee bit. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was, though,\" she said.",
      "Interest rates are the Bank's main tool in try to maintain the annual rate of inflation at, or close to, its target of 2%.",
      "The most recent UK inflation figures show prices rose 2.6% in the year to March. However, the rate is expected to jump following a series of household bill increases at the start of April \u2013 including energy and water prices.",
      "The Bank said it expected inflation to rise \"temporarily\" to 3.5% this year due to the bill increases before falling back due lower oil and gas prices set to feed through in the coming months.",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "UK inflation rate: How quickly are prices rising?",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",
      "But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank expects UK growth for the first three months of this year to be stronger than it originally forecast at 0.6%, boosted by US firms stockpiling goods ahead of Trump's tariffs coming into effect. The official figures are set to be released next week.",
      "A boost in growth would be welcome news to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority in order to boost living standards.",
      "The government's Budget decision to increase National Insurance last month for employers kicked in last month, but the Bank said the effect of the tax increase \"appears to have been fairly small to date\", though it added business confidence had taken a hit in recent months.",
      "A lot of firms are taking a \"wait and see\" approach to whether the UK economy picks up before hiring and investing, it said.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the latest rate cut was \"welcome news\", but added: \"There is more to do, and I know families are still facing cost of living pressures.",
      "Mr Bailey said the UK had \"still a lot to do\" on growth: \"We have seen over the last, really since the financial crisis, 15 years or so now, the rates of growth be consistently lower than they were before that.\"",

      "Why are prices still rising?",
      "Inflation has fallen significantly since hitting 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years.",
      "However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly.",
      "Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of higher food prices.",
      "Why does putting up interest rates help to lower inflation?",
      "When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high.",
      "The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.",
      "In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises.",
      "But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy.",
      "For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals.",
      "Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment.",

      "However he warned that the introduction of US tariffs has shown \"how unpredictable the global economy can be\". The Bank said it expected the tariffs to slow the UK economy and lead to lower inflation than expected.",

      "Students collecting their results in person can do so from 08:00.",

      "This year's first GCSE exams began on Monday 5 May in England, and will last until Wednesday 25 June.",
      "The government's plan is to bring each student's exam results and certificates into one online set of digital education records.",

      "Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) also welcomed the move, and called for the use of digital technology in education to go even further.",
      "He said the digital approach should be extended to exams themselves, which are still done using pen and paper and can create a \"massive burden\" for schools who are required to securely transport thousands of exam papers.",
      "He said the development of education technology had so far been \"frustratingly piecemeal\", adding that the government should \"invest in creating the infrastructure schools and colleges need to make this a reality\".",

      "Andrew Johnston, 30, from Carlisle, was charged with raping one woman and raping and sexually assaulting another but said both women had told a \"pack of lies\".",
      "Mr Johnston, who competed as a singer on the ITV talent show in 2008, told Southwark Crown Court he had \"never sung a note\" since the allegations were made against him.",
      "A jury of nine women and three men cleared him of all the charges.",
      "As the not guilty verdicts were read out, Mr Johnston, wearing a grey suit, held his head in his hands and sobbed.",
      "The alleged offences happened a number of years after he shot to fame as a choirboy on the show, the court heard.",
      "'Never aggressive'",
      "Prosecuting, Maryam Syed KC, said the singer had been \"engaging in consensual sexual activity\" with one woman, but he allegedly removed his condom, and she \"repeatedly told Mr Johnston to stop\" but he did not.",
      "The other woman told police she engaged in consensual sex with the singer and asked him to use a condom, the court heard.",
      "The woman said she started to feel his hands around her neck and \"no matter how many times she removed them\", he kept putting his hands back around her throat, Ms Syed said.",
      "It was alleged he then stopped and removed the condom, then carried on with the sex.",
      "Mr Johnston described his lovemaking as \"fast, energetic, maybe a bit passionate\" but said he was never aggressive, always used a condom and that the sex was consensual.",
      "He previously told the jury: \"I did not rape those two girls.\"",
      "Ms Syed put it to Mr Johnston that it is his case that these two women had stood in the witness box \"and told this jury a pack of lies\".",

      "Speaking to BBC News, Vikander, 36, said she was \"thrilled\" to be returning to the stage, but added it was a \"daunting thing to do... it's my first time on stage as an adult\".",
      "The production will play at London's Bridge Theatre for eight weeks from 10 September, organisers announced on Wednesday.",
      "\"I grew up being at the theatre a lot, my mother [Maria Fahl] was a stage actress, and I think even when I was dreaming of becoming an actress myself, being on stage was the journey that I kind of visualised,\" Vikander said.",
      "\"Back in Sweden, where I'm from, if you're an actor then really what you are is on stage. And you're lucky to maybe have a TV show or film every couple of years, because that's how small the industry is in Sweden.",
      "\"So I think that's what I always saw in front of me. And then life happened, and throughout the years [theatre] has always been something I've been waiting for and thinking 'it will happen'.\"",
      "The play has been adapted and directed by Simon Stone, and will also star The Walking Dead's Andrew Lincoln.",
      "Vikander will play lead character Ellida, the sea-loving daughter of a lighthouse-keeper.",
      "Ellida is married to a Norwegian doctor, but when a sailor she used to be engaged to suddenly returns, she is forced to choose between her current and former lover.",
      "The play marks the introduction of the character Hilde Wangel, one of the doctor's daughters from a previous marriage.",
      "Hilde goes on to appear in one of Ibsen's later plays, The Master Builder, a new adaptation of which is coincidentally also currently in the West End, starring Ewan McGregor.",
      "An adaptation of another Ibsen play, Enemy of the People, opened in London last year starring Doctor Who actor Matt Smith.",
      "'Perfect match'",
      "Director Stone has previously helmed films such as The Dig and The Daughter, while his extensive theatre credits include productions of Yerma, Phaedra, Medea and Angels in America.",
      "\"He once again is going to take a classic and reinvent it and make it be something that is relatable to our modern audience today,\" Vikander said.",
      "\"And when I was told he was doing Ibsen and The Lady from the Sea, I guess that going back to my Scandinavian and Swedish heritage, it kind of felt like a perfect match.\"",
      "Vikander said she felt the reason many of the classics are still being performed in the West End is they tackle many of the same subjects society still grapples with today.",
      "\"I have discussions with my friends, I just passed 35, I'm getting close to my 40s soon and I have my kids, but I still feel extremely young. Really young. Sometimes I'm like, 'I'm 25 still!'",
      "\"But then I also realise I'm entering this very new chapter which is really exciting, but I think if you are in a place where you feel like you haven't fulfilled certain dreams or tried things, you're still wondering where these choices or action would have led you, then I think it's extremely human thing.",
      "\"Women throughout history have been held back, maybe because they didn't have the same opportunities, or they financially couldn't do some things, or ended up in situations where it was harder to break away from the role of being a mother.",
      "\"So therefore when I read it, I feel like I totally understand the turmoil this woman goes through, and I don't think humans have changed that much from a core, emotional point of view. And I think that's why we're interested in these stories.\"",
      "She added: \"It's incredible that the big universal questions are something we're still battling in the same way.\"",
      "Vikander said she was \"super excited and wonderfully nervous\" to begin the workshopping process with Stone in the coming weeks, out of which he will begin to produce the final script.",
      "As the show is still being developed, it has not yet been confirmed what the setting will be for this production.",
      "Another UK adaptation of The Lady from the Sea performed in 2017 at the Donmar Theatre moved the story to the Caribbean in the 1950s.",
      "The new adaptation is billed as her UK stage debut, but Vikander notes it's actually her first theatre of any kind since she was 19.",
      "\"I did theatre for my teens for a lot of years, like a child actor, and then the last thing I did was when I was a dancer for the Stockholm Opera House,\" she explained.",
      "\"I grew up watching my mother doing theatre, and I 'd always watch from afar, and I can't wait to try and do it myself.",
      "\"It's a daunting thing to do, obviously, it's my first time on stage as an adult, and it's on the London stage, and obviously I want to make sure people get their ticket money's worth! But I'm really excited.\""

    "summary": "As Trump turns his attention to what he calls the \"dying\" US film industry, his solution has provoked strong reactions.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has said he will hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he ramps up trade disputes with nations around the world.",
      "Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he was authorising the US Department of Commerce and Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "He later said he would consult Hollywood executives to see if \"they're happy\" with his proposal, after the news sent shockwaves through the industry.",
      "So what might this mean for both the US film industry and the global movie business, including the UK?",
      "Is Hollywood 'dying'?",
      "Announcing the new tariffs, Trump declared that Hollywood was \"dying\". So is it?",
      "It's true that the industry has been through a really rough time in recent years.",
      "The pandemic saw production close down and the impact is ongoing.",
      "Hollywood studios spent $11.3 billion on productions in the second quarter of 2024, a 20% drop from the same period in 2022, as studios continued to cut costs in an attempt to recover from Covid losses.",
      "Any shoots of recovery were then severely stifled by the 2023 actors and writers strikes.",
      "Then the wildfires struck earlier this year.",
      "And for several years now, more and more people - not just youngsters - have been turning to YouTube and other streaming platforms for content.",
      "The US remains a major film production hub and according to Variety, 2025 has seen a rebound in box office numbers since last year, with overall domestic revenues up 15.8% on 2024 so far.",
      "Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?",
      "Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?",
      "The latest Marvel superhero film, Thunderbolts*, topped the North American box office this weekend, raking in an estimated $76 million, marking a promising start to the summer season.",
      "But Hollywood is definitely still up against it.",
      "What is Trump proposing?",
      "The president says he wants to \"immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands. We want movies made in America again!\"",
      "This has led to questions about whether the tariffs would also apply to American film companies producing films abroad.",
      "Several recent major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. Hit franchises like Mission Impossible also shoot overseas.",
      "We also don't yet know if the tariffs will be applied retrospectively.",
      "Trump later told reporters that \"other nations have been stealing the movies and movie-making capabilities from the United States\", which may suggest he was only referring to non-US films.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai told the BBC that \"no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made\", and added that the administration is \"exploring all options\".",
      "We will have to wait for more detail.",
      "What incentives do other countries offer?",
      "Many countries offer tax breaks to encourage film production such as New Zealand, Australia and the UK and that's something Trump wants to take on.",
      "But it's not the only reason a US film company might wish to film abroad.",
      "Some choose to do so for the specific location, exotic and exciting backdrops for example. Who could forget Tom Cruise's ascent of the Burj Khalifa, Dubai, in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol?",
      "What could it mean for the next James Bond movie, a franchise now owned by US giant Amazon, but based on an iconic British character who works for MI6, based in London?",
      "And it's not just other countries that offer incentives - other US states are luring film production away from Hollywood.",
      "Georgia, Illinois and Kentucky are among the many other US states which California are now competing with.",
      "Gavin Newsom, California's governor, who Trump described as \"grossly incompetent\" when speaking about the movie tariffs on Monday, is currently pushing for his plan to more than double the state's film and TV tax incentives to $750 million annually.",
      "While Newsom has made no comment yet on Trump's proposal, his senior communications advisor told Deadline: \"We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law.\"",
      "How would any such tariffs actually work?",
      "There are more questions than answers at this stage.",
      "The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a moratorium on tariffs for digital goods until 2026. Presumably films count as digital goods.",
      "And what would they base the tariffs on? Box office revenue or production costs? Is streaming content included? That would have a huge impact on US companies like Netflix. What about post-production ie editing?",
      "Tim Richards, Vue Entertainment CEO and founder, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"A big part of this is what constitutes US film - is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?\"",
      "And how do you even classify a foreign film when so many are co-productions and are often shot in several countries?",
      "Trump appeared to be talking about film and not TV but it's not 100% clear at this stage. Would tariffs apply to films made for streaming or just cinema releases? We'll have to wait for more detail. And of course, Trump may rollback on the proposals as he has done with some other tariffs.",
      "What could it mean for other countries?",
      "Obviously, putting a 100% tariff on foreign films means a huge cost increase for those production companies who want to sell to the US market.",
      "Commenting on Trump's announcement, the UK government's Culture Media and Sport Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage MP said: \"Last month the Culture, Media and Sport Committee warned against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe. President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real.",
      "\"Making it more difficult to make films in the UK is not in the interests of American businesses. Their investment in facilities and talent in the UK, based on US-owned IP, is showing fantastic returns on both sides of the Atlantic. Ministers must urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way.\"",
      "Head of media and entertainment trade union Bectu in the UK, Philippa Childs, said in a statement: \"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\"",
      "Kirsty Bell, chief executive of production company Goldfinch, questioned how the tariffs would work, pointing out that blockbusters like Barbie, which was distributed by US film studio Warner Bros Pictures, \"was actually shot virtually entirely in the UK\".",
      "\"If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,\" she told PA.",
      "The governments of Australia and New Zealand have also spoken out in support of their countries' film industries.",
      "\"Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry,\" Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said.",
      "New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference that his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs.",
      "\"But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,\" he added.",
      "And with the Cannes film festival just around the corner, uncertainty hangs in the air with many US film producers looking to sell foreign distribution rights.",
      "Could such tariffs work?",
      "Tariffs could incentivise US film companies to make more films on home soil but the risk is that if it's more expensive than to do so abroad, some films just won't get made.",
      "More incentives or rebates could help offset this but we just don't know at this stage if that's under discussion on a national scale.",
      "NPR Radio film critic Eric Deggans warned that the tariffs, should they be introduced, could further harm the industry.",
      "Other countries may respond by placing tariffs on American films, he told the BBC, making it \"harder for these films to make profits overseas\".",

    "summary": "After pushing the much-anticipated sequel into 2026, developer Rockstar gives fans a new glimpse of the game.",
    "story": [
      "Just when you'd come to terms with the fact that Grand Theft Auto 6 had been delayed until next year, Rockstar Games goes and drops a brand new trailer.",
      "Last week, the video game developer announced the game had been pushed back to May 2026, shocking fans who were expecting it to land this autumn.",
      "It's been 12 years since the last GTA game was released, and the long wait for the most anticipated sequel of all time just became even more agonising.",
      "But earlier, the company released a new, three-minute trailer, giving eager players a stack of new information to dissect in the meantime.",
      "Here are some of the highlights.",
      "The record-breaking first trailer for GTA 6, published online in late 2023, introduced players to protagonists Jason and Lucia -  a couple who live a life of crime in Leonida, the fictional US state where the game is set.",
      "We now know a bit more about their backstory.",
      "The new trailer opens with Jason doing odd jobs before driving around Vice City - the Miami-inspired location from the 2002 PlayStation 2 game.",
      "According to Rockstar, Jason was a troubled teen who joined the army to escape his bad influences, but fell back into crime after returning home.",
      "In the trailer he eventually collects Lucia from prison, where she has been serving time for \"protecting her family\".",
      "From there, the clip launches into a montage of action sequences, romantic scenes and glimpses of the game's wider world.",
      "We see the couple carrying out armed heists, partying on a yacht and riding a jetski together.",
      "According to a description on Rockstar's website, the two want to forge a new life together but are plunged into \"the middle of a conspiracy\" after an \"easy score goes wrong\".",
      "New characters revealed",
      "Players also got to put names to faces of some of game's wider cast, including bank robber Raul Bautista, smuggler Brian Heder and rap combo Real Dimez.",
      "Like GTA 5, which was heavily based on Los Angeles and its surrounding areas, the sequel also appears to contain accurate recreations of some of Florida's most famous landmarks.",
      "Vice City's version of Miami's art deco, neon-lit beachfront appears in the trailer, as does the Grassrivers swampland, inspired by the Florida everglades.",
      "Rockstar also revealed the Leonida Keys, the industrial Ambrosia region, sleazy Port Gellhorn and the mountainous Kalaga National Park.",
      "In each case, it suggested the areas would be home to different groups and factions, from \"hillbilly mystics\" to biker gangs.",
      "The trailer did not appear to include any gameplay footage, but was made up of cinematic sequences usually seen between story missions.",
      "But fans were quick to praise the game's next-generation graphics in the trailer and a series of screenshots published by Rockstar.",
      "Video game trailers are sometimes created using powerful PCs but a note at the end of the trailer said the scenes in it were taken from a PlayStation 5 console.",
      "But that doesn't answer questions about new ways of interacting with the game's world, or whether players can switch between characters on-the-fly as they could in GTA 5.",
      "Why has GTA 6 taken so long?",
      "The hype around GTA 6 is huge, and Rockstar has form for delaying its games and a reputation for perfectionism.",
      "When it announced the delay last week it told fans it needed extra time to \"deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve\".",
      "According to Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier, the delay was to also to avoid \"crunch\" - a gaming industry term for enforced overtime.",
      "The company was previously criticised by some staff over the practice - it accepted that some worked \"long hours\" but said some accounts were exaggerated.",
      "When GTA 6's delay was announced, shares in Rockstar's parent company, Take Two Interactive, dropped by 10%.",
      "The industry was banking on the game - which will initially be available only on Xbox and PlayStation 5 - to boost console sales and break software sales records.",
      "However, having a firm date of 26 May 2026 for GTA 6 means that other publishers can now avoid releasing their own games at the same time.",

    "story": [
      "More victims of the infected blood scandal will die without ever receiving full compensation, a government minister has said.",
      "The paymaster general Nick Thomas-Symonds was giving evidence to a special session of the public inquiry into what's been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history.",
      "It's thought 30,000 patients in the UK were infected with HIV or hepatitis B and C after being treated with a contaminated blood clotting product or given a blood transfusion in the 1970s and 80s.",
      "Mr Thomas-Symonds agreed it was \"profoundly unsatisfactory\" that just 106 final compensation awards have been paid, almost a year after a damning report into the scandal was published.",
      "What is the infected blood scandal?",
      "'Infected blood has ruined my life for 40 years'",
      "\"I'm never going to think this is satisfactory until everybody has received the compensation that is due,\" the Cabinet Office minister said.",
      "\"The objective should be absolutely to pay [people] as soon as possible.\"",
      "A final report into the scandal, published last year, found that the disaster could largely have been avoided if different decisions had been taken by the health authorities at the time.",
      "The report said too little was done to stop the importing of contaminated blood products from abroad in the 1970s and 80s, and there was evidence that elements of the scandal had been covered up.",
      "Last month the chair of the public inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff, ordered two days of extra hearings after he received \"letter after letter, email after email\" expressing concerns about the way the government's compensation scheme has been managed.",
      "The Chancellor Rachel Reeves set aside \u00a311.8bn in the last budget to make final awards to victims and their family members, but the latest figures show less than 1% of that total, some \u00a397m, has been paid out to date.",
      "Survivors of the scandal and some bereaved relatives have also received a series of smaller interim compensation payments over the last three years.",
      "Eleven victims and their representatives gave evidence in an emotional panel session in front of an audience of around 300 people in Westminster.",
      "'Betrayed and disappointed'",
      "Andrew Evans, chair of the campaign group Tainted Blood, told the hearing many victims and their families had been left feeling \"betrayed and disappointed\".",
      "\"People have given up on any expectation of receiving anything,\" he said.",
      "\"They have lost all hope of ever getting justice and we can't be doing this for much longer.\"",
      "Other witnesses criticised the way in which individuals were being contacted and \"invited\" to come forward to claim final compensation, describing it as \"waiting for your lottery ticket to come up\".",
      "Gary Webster, a haemophiliac who was infected with HIV and hepatitis C when a pupil at Treloar's School in Hampshire in the 1970s and 80s, said that \"[some] people will not get their compensation and a lot of claims will die with them.\"",
      "\"It's just too slow and people won't get the justice they deserve,\" he added.",
      "Under the current rules, if someone infected with HIV or hepatitis B or C dies before receiving full compensation, then any final award can be passed on to their relatives through their estate.",
      "But compensation can also be claimed by those affected by the scandal \u2013 a partner, sibling or parent of a child, for example \u2013 for the separate impact on their lives.",
      "And if they die before that compensation is agreed, then their claim will die with them and cannot be passed on.",
      "In questioning later in the day, Mr Thomas-Symonds, who leads on the response for the government, said he was \"restless for further progress on payments\".",
      "The Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA), an independent body set up to pay victims of the scandal, has said it expects the \"bulk\" of awards to be made to infected survivors by the end of 2027, with most of those affected, such as family members and carers, paid by the end of 2029.",
      "Mr Thomas-Symonds said he regarded that timeline as a \"backstop\" rather than a target to work towards.",
      "\"The logic for that is there may be other people who have not yet come forward at this stage [to claim],\" he said.",
      "\"I've never been anything but clear they are absolute backstops and I expect these payments to speed up [in the future].\"",

    "story": [
      "A former health ombudsman has condemned mental health services for their handling of two vulnerable young men who died in their care.",
      "Sir Rob Behrens, who was parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO) from 2017 to 2024, spoke at the Lampard Inquiry, which is examining the deaths of more than 2,000 people under mental health services in Essex over a 24-year period.",
      "Sir Rob said it was \"a disgrace\" how Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) had failed in its care of 20-year-old Matthew Leahy, who died in 2012, and a 20-year-old man referred to as Mr R, who died in 2008.",
      "\"This was the National Health Service at its worst and needed calling out,\" Sir Rob said.",
      "'Near-complete failure'",
      "Sir Rob referred in his inquiry appearance to several reports made during his tenure, including \"Missed Opportunities\", which looked into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Mr Leahy and Mr R.",
      "Mr Leahy was found unresponsive at the Linden Centre in Chelmsford. He reported being raped there just days before he died.",
      "Sir Rob told the inquiry the PHSO identified \"19 instances of maladministration\" in Mr Leahy's case by North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust - a predecessor to EPUT - including that his care plan was falsified.",
      "The former ombudsman said there had been \"a near-complete failure of the leadership of this trust, certainly before it was merged\" with South Essex Partnership Trust to become EPUT.",
      "\"This was an indictment of the health service,\" he added.",
      "Sir Rob paid tribute to Matthew's mother, Melanie Leahy, who campaigned for more than a decade for a public inquiry, calling her \"an exemplary complainant\".",
      "\"She was very well prepared for every meeting, she was courteous but assertive. She knew what she wanted out of an investigation.",
      "\"Given the tragedy that she'd been through, it was a remarkable contribution to public life that she performed over many years,\" Sir Rob said.",
      "He also said that the way some doctors spoke about Mr R was \"staggering\".",
      "Mr R was found unresponsive in the Linden Centre in December 2008 and died afterwards. Sir Rob Behrens found he had been failed multiple times by those treating him.",
      "\"Some clinicians were interviewed after he died, and they had a very patronising approach to him\" he told the inquiry.",
      "\"In their view, [Mr R] didn't have mental health problems at all, and he had been admitted because he wanted somewhere to live because he was homeless. That is staggering.\"",
      "'No confidence'",
      "In a report called \"Broken Trust\", published in 2023, Sir Rob referenced there were more than a dozen different health and care regulators playing important roles in patient safety.",
      "\"Political leaders have created a confusing landscapes of organisations, often in knee-jerk reaction to patient safety crisis points,\" the report said.",
      "Sir Rob agreed with a suggestion put to him by Nicholas Griffin KC, chief counsel to the inquiry, that some incidents \"fall through the gaps\" due to the complexity of the complaints process and therefore are not investigated.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who simply don't know where to go,\" Sir Rob said.",
      "\"At the moment, I have no confidence that people trust the system because they don't know where to go when they want to make a complaint.\"",
      "Sir Rob said that Essex was \"not exceptional\" and the issues he had discovered there could be seen in other places as well.",
      "\"The absence of leadership\u2026 not communicating effectively with patients, the safety issues around ligature points\u2026 and the absence of training and development - these are still issues which the NHS has to address generally, not just in Essex,\" he said.",
      "The former ombudsman also told the inquiry that he was prevented from investigating a significant number of deaths\u00a0due to a \"serious limitation\" in his office's powers.",
      "Sir Rob Behrens explained the ombudsman could only investigate following a complaint, but that for understandable reasons of bereavement or trauma, many families in Essex did not complain following the deaths of loved ones.",
      "Sir Rob said if the ombudsman had the power to take its own initiative then \"the resolution of these tragic issues could have been speeded up very dramatically\".",
      "EPUT chief executive Paul Scott has apologised for deaths under his trust's care.",

    "story": [
      "Women pregnant with larger babies have been given the option to choose how and when to give birth in a bid to lessen the risk of injury to the child.",
      "The \"big baby\" trial aimed to find out if starting labour earlier than 38 weeks made it less likely for infants who appeared large in the womb to be born with shoulder dystocia, where the shoulder becomes stuck during delivery.",
      "Study findings from between 2018 and 2022 showed giving birth a week to 10 days earlier reduced the risk, researchers said.",
      "It is hoped the data from the \u00a32.5m Coventry-based trial will give doctors and midwives more confidence in facilitating natural births.",
      "Coventry nurse Eve Morgan took part in the study 2018 after monitoring found her baby could reach 9lb (4kg).",
      "Ms Morgan, who developed gestational diabetes when she was pregnant, had a cervical sweep to help bring on her choice of a natural labour.",
      "As a result, she safely delivered her 7lbs 8oz boy (3.4kg) 10 days early.",
      "\"They said [the] baby grows so much in the last kind of week or so,\" she said. \"I'm quite petite myself. They said he would have been big for me.\"",

      "Results were gathered from 2,893 women in 106 hospitals in the UK, who consented to be randomly allocated to induction or standard delivery.",
      "What is shoulder dystocia?",
      "Shoulder dystocia occurs in 1 in 150 vaginal deliveries, delaying birth and leading to possible complications, including a stretching in the nerves of the infant's neck.",
      "The NHS says the condition occurs more often in bigger babies but there is uncertainty over how often.",
      "It is estimated it could affect 1 in 25 women with a big baby who have a vaginal delivery.",
      "Large babies are defined as those who weigh more than 90% of other babies the same age, the NHS said.",
      "Prof Quenby said the trial findings empowered women to decide \"how and when they want to deliver their baby\".",
      "Trial data crucially revealed babies did not suffer more harm if they were delivered later. It also showed earlier delivery reduced the need for emergency Caesarean section and did not increase the risk of tearing.",
      "\"Whether you're induced at 38 weeks or whether you choose to wait for a natural labour, in both groups the baby's outcomes were the same,\" Prof Quenby said.",
      "\"Both groups had a risk of shoulder dystocia, it was actually slightly higher if you waited for labour naturally - but babies didn't do any worse if you wait for labour naturally.\"",
      "She added all the babies were born in an NHS hospital, where staff were trained on delivering natural births.",
      "Komal Mehmood, from Coventry, is 38-weeks pregnant with her second child, which is measuring as large.",
      "She said she found the results of the trial helpful when deciding her birth plan.",

      "The upper estimate  of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said.",
      "The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved \u2013 it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy.",
      "It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June.",
      "Costs and savings",
      "In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around \u00a3919,000 to \u00a310.3m.",
      "This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need.",
      "By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from \u00a35.84m to \u00a359.6m.",
      "But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of \u00a310m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over \u00a311m.",
      "One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours.",
      "It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain.",
      "And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost \u00a32,000 a day.",
      "Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is \"workable, effective and enforceable\".",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment.",
      "She said she was still \"firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"For me, assisted dying and giving people a choice at the end of their life when they are facing a terminal illness is about the human cost, it's not about pounds and pence.\"",
      "But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: \"This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'.\"",
      "Leadbeater told Today the eligibility criteria under the bill was \"extremely strict\".",
      "She said: \"You have to be terminally ill. There are multiple layers of safeguarding built into the bill, including a multi-disciplinary panel of experts.",
      "\"So we are assessing mental capacity, we are checking for coercion at every level of this process to make sure that this is the clear and settled informed wish of the person who is terminally ill.\"",
      "She said that the bill was \"only about terminally ill adults who have less than six months to live\". \"The bill does not cover people with disabilities,\" she added.",
      "Prof Katherine Sleeman, professor of palliative care at King's College London, said the cost of end of life care was \"very, very high\", adding \"obviously if someone is not living those last months of life then it's lower\".",
      "However, she cautioned that the figures in the assessment were estimates."

      "However, attempts to make the UK more self-sufficient in blood products failed, so the NHS continued using foreign supplies.",
      "Campaigners say haemophiliacs could have been offered an alternative treatment called Cryoprecipitate. This was much harder to administer, but was made from the blood plasma of a single donor, lowering the infection risk.",
      "BBC News has also uncovered evidence children were infected with hepatitis C and HIV after being placed on clinical trials of new treatments - often, without their family's consent.",
      "As late as November 1983, the government insisted there was no \"conclusive proof\" that HIV could be transmitted in blood, a line robustly defended by former Conservative health minister Ken Clarke when he appeared before the inquiry.",

Instead, alongside teaching calming techniques, parents should discuss and test out feared situations. \"To reduce worries, it can help to write them down or talk about them at a special 'worry time' once a day.\"",

We get lots of calls from parents in that position. When they see their child struggling it can make them question themselves and they just don't know where to turn.",

    "summary": "Why is the number of autism diagnoses changing? And what does it mean for autistic people?",
    "story": [
      "You might have seen the social media videos: the \"five signs you're autistic\". You may have heard about long waiting lists for autism diagnosis. You might know, or sense, that the numbers of people deemed autistic are going up, fast.",
      "There's a lot at stake. These numbers mean fiercely different things to different people. To some, autism is a fear (what if this happens to my child?); to others it's an identity, maybe even a superpower.",
      "So what's the truth about the number of autistic people - and what does it mean?",
      "To count something, you first need to say what it is you're counting.",
      "For someone to be diagnosed with autism, they need to have \"persistent difficulties in social life and in social communication,\" says Ginny Russell, an associate professor in psychiatry at University College London (UCL) and the author of The Rise of Autism. She's using the criteria for autism from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM.",
      "She says examples of this behaviour can range from a lack of turn-taking in conversation to being completely non-verbal.",
      "Restricted interests and repetitive behaviours are part of a second group of traits required to meet the criteria, she says. So things like \"hand flapping or rocking or skin picking, but also sticking to repeated routines, like eating the same food every day.\"",
      "The data",
      "But what evidence is there that the number of people meeting those criteria has risen?",
      "Ms Russell led a study that looked at changes in rates of autism diagnosis in the UK over 20 years. It drew on a big sample of data from about nine million patients who were registered at GP surgeries.",
      "They found eight times as many new autism diagnoses in 2018 as in 1998. \"It was an enormous increase,\" she says, \"best described as exponential.\"",
      "And it's not just happening in the UK. Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".",
      "But - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.",
      "Ms Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?",
      "Why are diagnoses rising?",
      "The definition of autism has not been static. The first studies to describe autism appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, says Francesca Happ\u00e9, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London, who's been researching autism since 1988.",
      "\"The original descriptions of autism are of children who have pretty high support needs, typically are very late to talk,\" she says. \"Some don't talk at all. And the focus really was on children, of course, and largely on males.\"",
      "But the definition was broadened, Prof Happ\u00e9 says, when in the 1990s Asperger's syndrome was added to diagnostic manuals. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.",
      "The eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.",
      "Another subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.",
      "Today, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.",
      "The autism net has been cast wider.",
      "Autism in women and girls",
      "One group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.",
      "Studies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.",
      "It's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism.",
      "\"I've been doing this maybe 15, 20 years or so,\" she says. \"In the early days, they were virtually all males that were coming forward for diagnosis. And now they're nearly all females who I see.\"",
      "Ms Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.",
      "She says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".",
      "Because autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).",
      "Now we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.",
      "She says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.",
      "More adults diagnosed",
      "The rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Ms Hendrickx says this shows another way the autism net has been cast wider: it now includes more people with lower support needs.",
      "\"We are talking, I think, more about individuals with no intellectual disability,\" she says. \"I think people with delays in their development, in their speech, are much more likely to have been diagnosed much, much earlier because the signs were much clearer at a very young age.\"",
      "There's data to back this up. One study shows that between 2000 and 2018, new autism diagnoses of those with intellectual disability rose about 20%, while autism diagnoses in those without intellectual disability rose 700%. Autism's centre of gravity has shifted.",
      "For Ellie Middleton, an autistic and ADHD content creator and author, that's a good thing.",
      "The 27-year-old says that sceptics questioning the increase in diagnoses should instead be asking: \"how did all of these people spend so much of their life undiagnosed, unsupported and let down?\"",
      "She says she became very mentally unwell before being diagnosed with autism. \"I was on the maximum dose of antidepressants that any fully grown adult could be on at the age of 17,\" she says. \"I couldn't be left alone, I couldn't go out.\"",
      "Her autism diagnosis three years ago helped her to change the way she lives her life and to keep her mental health in a better place.",
      "But others worry that the version of autism people now see in the media and in their social media feeds is distorting public perceptions.",
      "A focus on celebrities can \"glamorise\" autism, says Venessa Swaby, who is also autistic and runs support groups for autistic children and their parents through her organisation A2ndvoice. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".",
      "As the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.",
      "Environmental causes",
      "There's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.",
      "The internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.",
      "Disproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger. Others say there must be something in what we eat, drink, or breathe that's causing more autism.",
      "But, as we've seen, the data suggest the rise in diagnoses can be explained by a broadening autism definition rather than an increase in the amount of underlying autism. And there's solid research showing that autism is largely a product of the genes you inherit from your parents.",
      "Is there any evidence that environmental causes could be playing some part in the rise, even if a small one?",
      "Ginny Russell looked at research into different potential environmental factors and found only a few that were plausible to explain some of the rise.",
      "\"There is definitely a quite well established link between autism and the age of the parent,\" she says. \"If the parent is older you're more likely to have an autistic child, but it's not a huge effect.\"",
      "She also says that there's some evidence around \"preterm birth and infection during pregnancy and also some birth complications\".",
      "But Ms Russell says it's important to put those possible factors into perspective.",
      "\"I honestly believe that the vast majority of the increase is due to what I would call a diagnostic culture,\" she says. \"Our conception of the condition has changed, and that's meant that there's been an increase.\"",

    "story": [
      "UK interest rates have been cut to 4.25% from 4.5% and the governor of the Bank England has hinted more could follow in the coming months.",
      "Andrew Bailey said he would not \"give predictions as to when and how much\", but said he was \"still of the view that the path, gradually and carefully, is downwards\".",
      "The reduction in rates on Thursday marks the fourth cut within the past year and the Bank considered an even bigger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit UK economic growth.",
      "Mr Bailey welcomed a UK-US deal on tariffs and said it was \"important as a signal, I hope, of many more to come\", adding a UK trade deal with the European Union would be \"beneficial\".",
      "\"Maybe we need a bit of a jolt to the system to remind us that trade is important,\" Mr Bailey said, adding he hoped the likes of deals between the UK and US, and the UK and India, would help to \"rebuild the world trading system\".",
      "On Thursday, the UK and US announced a deal to avoid tariffs on certain goods in order to boost trade.",
      "As it announced the latest cut in interest rates, the Bank said that while a trade war could hit economic growth, it could lead to lower inflation in the UK over time as countries such as China look to divert cheap goods originally bound for America.",
      "Mr Bailey said the path for rates was \"downwards\", but said future rate cuts were likely to be \"gradual and careful\".",
      "The minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided. Of the nine members, five voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.",
      "The Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, but could continue to face higher repayment costs when renewing.",
      "However, mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year.  On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.14%, while a five-year deal was 5.08%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so rates being cut will have an impact on monthly repayments.",

      "\"How do we reduce re-offending? How do we deal with people's drug addiction, mental health problems, the fact that people leave prison they don't know where to live, people don't have a job? That is also a really important part of my job,\" he says.",

Prisons were full, and months later thousands of inmates were released early as part of an emergency plan to ease overcrowding and free up space.",

      "\"We recently opened HMP Millsike,\" he says, describing the new category C prison which opened in East Yorkshire in March, with capacity for up to 1,500 inmates. \"We've got more cells opening across the country. We need to keep building prison places because the population is going up.\"",
      "Last month, three prison officers were seriously injured at HMP Frankland, in Durham, after they were attacked with makeshift weapons and hot oil by one of the men responsible for the Manchester Arena bombing. Hashem Abedi was being held in a separation centre - used to house a small number of the most dangerous and extremist inmates - at the category A, maximum security jail.",
      "\"What happened in Frankland is absolutely shocking,\" Lord Timpson says. \"The level of violence in prisons is far too high - and it is increasing.",

The review will provide long-term solutions for the justice system and examine the use and composition of non-custodial sentences, including community alternatives to prison and the use of fines. Increased tagging will also be considered.",

      "\"We want them to have a one-way ticket - not a return back into prison or back into non-custodial sentences,\" Lord Timpson says.",
      "\"What's really important is we embrace technology and look at the evidence - tagging can have some very important benefits.\"",
      "But the use of electronic tagging to monitor offenders has been problematic. In recent months several probation staff have told the BBC offenders who should be tagged, have not been. The security company Serco has been contracted by the government to manage tagging since October 2023.",

      "The UK government has hit back against claims by opposition parties that the newly-agreed trade deal with India could disadvantage British workers.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC there was \"no situation\" in which he would \"ever tolerate\" British workers being undercut as a result of a trade agreement.",
      "One part of the deal extends an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) from one to three years - meaning people on short-term visas will only make social security payments in their home country when working abroad.",
      "Opposition parties claim this could mean Indian workers are cheaper to employ than British workers - not least since UK employer Nics have just risen.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch claimed she had refused a similar trade-off when she was business secretary, because the deal contains \"two-tier taxes\" which would cost the UK \"hundreds of millions\".",

      "\"The Conservatives recently, well a few years ago when they were in government, signed one with Chile for five years. So no, British workers are not being undercut,\" he said.",
      "\"What the Conservatives are confused about, and Reform as well, is a situation where a business in India seconds someone for a short period of time to the UK, or a UK business seconds a worker to India for a short period of time, where you don't pay in simultaneously now to both social security systems,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.",

      "\"We always want to see trade deals done with other countries\u2026 that's what we had Brexit so we could open up some of those deals, but actually this is a bad deal.\"",
      "Reynolds said the deal was a \"huge economic win for the UK and would deliver \"faster growth, higher wages, more tax revenue brilliant wins for goods and for services\".",
      "He said previously that Indian workers would still be required to pay the NHS immigration surcharge and would not be eligible for benefits from the National Insurance system.",
      "The Business Secretary also dismissed opposition claims that many more Indian workers would come to the UK than British workers would go to India.",
      "'Gamechanger' for Scotch whisky industry",
      "The deal - which took three years to negotiate - will make it easier for UK firms to export some goods including whisky, cars and other products to India, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports to the UK.",
      "Last year, trade between the two countries totalled \u00a342.6bn. The government has said the deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.",
      "The UK government said lowering tariffs on the likes of clothing, jewellery, and frozen prawns \"could\" lead to cheaper prices and more choice for consumers.",

      "\"We are the only other country in the world with access to that procurement market so when you have that kind of success that will involve more British workers on a short term basis going to India,\" Reynolds said.",

    "story": [
      "You have to go back more than 100 years, to before 1922, for an election where Labour was not dominating Welsh politics.",
      "Rooted in the industrial heritage of the country which was once the home of the UK's first Labour MP, Keir Hardie, the party has beat all others in Wales in every major Westminster election ever since.",
      "Labour has always been the largest party in Cardiff Bay too, and has won every election for the Welsh Parliament.",
      "But for the first time, the outlook for Welsh Labour at the next Senedd election on May 7 2026 is much less clear.",
      "Led by Eluned Morgan, it faces a fight to hold on to the reins of the Welsh government, and the sway it has held over Welsh politics.",
      "How do you vote in the Senedd election?",
      "What's your Senedd constituency?",
      "What does the Senedd do?",
      "Polls have shown Labour neck and neck with two parties - the pro-independence Plaid Cymru, and Nigel Farage's Reform UK.",
      "But a survey published this week suggested Plaid Cymru was pulling ahead, with Labour falling behind Farage.",
      "Both Plaid and Reform are hoping they can leapfrog Labour and become the largest group in the Senedd, as are the Welsh Conservatives, who are polling behind the other three.",
      "A new voting system means the next Senedd could be split between about four parties of a similar size, raising questions about exactly how the next Welsh government could be brought together.",
      "A senior Tory has said a coalition in the next parliament is \"nailed on\", and there is talk among some about whether parties would need to share the top job of first minister.",
      "The Welsh Parliament, or Senedd Cymru, is what we now call the institution set up as the National Assembly in 1999.",
      "Whoever can command control of the parliament forms the Welsh government - the ministers which run the services Westminster decided to hand over to Cardiff Bay, including the NHS.",
      "While it has never won a majority, Labour has led every single government since 1999, with the assistance of Plaid and the Lib Dems.",
      "The potential for a shake-up in the Senedd is partly down to plans to expand the number of politicians there from 60 to 96 - the brainchild of former First Minister Mark Drakeford and former Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price.",
      "As well as more politicians, the new parliament is likely to better reflect the proportion of votes won by each party - more so than the mixed system used up until now.",
      "This is important when it is considered against polls that suggest Welsh voters are divided.",
      "Two recent ones - from Survation and Beaufort Research - have put Labour ahead of Plaid and Reform but only just.",
      "But a poll by ITV Wales and Cardiff University conducted in late April placed Plaid on 30%, with Reform behind on 25% and Labour on 18% - a historic low. The Conservatives were placed at 13%, the Lib Dems 7% and the Greens 5%.",
      "All recent polling for Labour on Senedd voting intention is lower than how the party performed at the last general election, where it got 37% of the vote.",
      "Cardiff University politics expert Prof Richard Wyn Jones said the previous mixed proportional and first-past-the-post system helped Labour win around 50% of the seats in Wales with \"a third of the vote\".",
      "He said elections in both Wales and Scotland next year will be the \"most high-profile test for the Starmer administration\".",
      "\"It would be utterly seismic if they are not the largest party in Wales,\" he told BBC Wales.",
      "Prof Wyn Jones spoke before Tuesday's poll was published - as did everyone else in this article. He said Labour's chances of coming first should not be written off.",
      "\"But even if Labour is only barely ahead, that would be seismic because it would mean the Labour group in the Senedd is essentially not much bigger than the current Labour group in the Senedd, and the Senedd would be 36 seats bigger,\" he said.",
      "So, what could be behind it all?",
      "The post-pandemic period has been tough for Welsh Labour \u2013 plunged into crisis over the donation of \u00a3200,000 from a man convicted of illegally dumping waste to its now-former leader, Vaughan Gething.",
      "The row exposed splits within the Labour group of 30 MSs. Despite Welsh Labour having a landslide general election result, several Welsh ministers resigned to force Gething's ouster, prompting the rise of Morgan as first minister.",
      "Even before Drakeford decided to step down in late 2023, triggering the leadership contest that Gething won, Labour MSs had been arguing over transport policies, including the default 20mph speed limit, while the government has been struggling with long waits in the Welsh NHS.",
      "Former Labour special advisor turned lobbyist Cathy Owens, of Cavendish Cymru, partly blamed the leadership crisis and factors at a UK level.",
      "Or, as she puts it: \"As soon as Labour won power at UK level... everybody realised that Keir Starmer wasn't the most exciting leader we've had and then Labour had to make lots of difficult decisions.\"",
      "'We were lecturing over 20mph'",
      "NHS waits and the controversial 20mph speed limit were always among the top three issues relayed on the doorstep at the general election, according to a well-connected Welsh Labour activist.",
      "They said a mix of Welsh and UK issues were at play, but argued that the Welsh government \"got complacent\".",
      "The activist blamed the \"way\" the 20mph speed limit was delivered - \"it told voters we weren't listening to them and we were essentially lecturing them\".",
      "\"I agree with the desired outcomes of the policy, but you can't treat voters like that,\" they said.",
      "Alun Davies, Labour Blaenau Gwent MS, acknowledged the public was \"frustrated with politics\" but said: \"Labour remains the party that probably most people in Wales feel represents their own values.\"",
      "The politician, who is involved in the production of the party's manifesto, said: \"Eluned has got the power to transform Welsh Labour's fortunes during an election campaign.",
      "\"She is very straight-talking - what you see is what you get.\"",
      "Wales' Labour first minister says she will 'call out' Starmer",
      "Politics 'doesn't work' for many people in Wales",
      "Cathy Owens said the current first minister needed two things to get to 30% of the vote or more, \"one of which is to reduce waiting times\".",
      "For the second thing, Ms Owens said Morgan needed help from her party colleagues in the UK government - \"some funding, or some extra investment\" over and above what is automatically provided through the existing Barnett formula system, which is largely based on population.",
      "\"Now, that is proving more of a sticky wicket,\" she said. \"There has been no evidence of a win so far on that\".",
      "The relationship between Welsh and Westminster Labour has become a big part of the story of Morgan's time as Welsh Labour leader.",
      "She has been increasingly keen to distance herself from Sir Kier Starmer - on Tuesday she gave a speech where she was willing to call out his government, should it take decisions that \"harm\" Welsh communities.",
      "'The polls tell a good story'",
      "One party hoping to benefit from the turn in Labour's fortunes is Plaid Cymru.",
      "The left-leaning party has long struggled to beat its strong showing in the first assembly election of 1999 when it won almost 29% of the vote, but the splintering of British politics has presented Plaid with an opportunity.",
      "Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has been presenting himself as a first minister in waiting, while the party has published plans on health and the economy it said it would enact if it formed the next Welsh government.",
      "Unlike their political cousins in Scotland, the SNP, Plaid has never won a Welsh election and came third last time round.",
      "It took part in a short-lived coalition with Labour between 2007 and 2011, and helped Labour govern more recently in the form of the co-operation deal which ended in summer 2024.",
      "\"We're not getting too carried away with the polls,\" Plaid's Senedd party chairman Llyr Gruffydd said. \"But the polls do tell a good story for us.\"",
      "\"We will clearly be highlighting the need for change. It's a tired government.\"",
      "He said the party will face a challenge in helping \"people realise that this is a different electoral system. Every single vote counts - there will not be a wasted vote\".",
      "It was put to Gruffydd that it was difficult for Plaid to be seen as anti-establishment when it had been involved in helping Labour govern. \"We won't shy away from the fact that we've been punching above our weight... and still achieving elements of our manifesto,\" he said. \"Imagine what we could do if we were in government.\"",
      "'There's so much frustration'",
      "One party hoping to make their big entrance into Welsh politics is Farage's Reform UK.",
      "The party has polled closely to Labour and Plaid Cymru and came second in 13 seats at the last general election. While it has five MPs in England, and some councillors in Wales, it has no-one at Senedd at present.",
      "It is celebrating its recent English local election successes, where it made big gains, won control of 10 councils, two mayors and a by-election from Labour.",
      "Pointing to who the party is in Wales is difficult - it is yet to decide who will stand for them at the next election, or who might act as a figurehead.",
      "They are not starting from scratch - Farage's previous party UKIP had a short-lived stint in the Senedd after it won seven AMs in 2017.",
      "At least one of their former AMs is hoping to become a Reform MS - Caroline Jones. She is hoping to stand for Reform in the seat of Pen-y-bont Bro Morgannwg - which covers Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan.",
      "Opponents accuse Reform of simply being a protest party, something that would be denied by Jones. She told BBC Wales that another former UKIP Senedd politician, and one-time Tory MP and ex-Abolish the Assembly AM, Mark Reckless, was working with a team on policy for the Senedd.",
      "\"At the moment, there's so much frustration among the public - we are offering something different.\"",
      "Jones added: \"You have to have a party that's representative of the people, as opposed to just representing their own interests.\"",
      "UKIP's time in the Senedd was characterised by two changes in leadership, rows, and splits. At one point there were more UKIP AMs who had been leader than had not - including Jones herself.",
      "\"The Reform party is united,\" she said. \"There are hardly any arguments at all, and anything that people disagree on.\"",
      "Other parties may try to capitalise on Farage's relationship with the controversial US president Donald Trump to galvanise opposition to Reform.",
      "Jones said that was not a negative: \"If we've got special links with America, then I think it's to be capitalised on.\"",
      "Asked if she thought the party needed a Welsh figurehead, she said: \"That's above my pay grade.\"",
      "'This is what we're for'",
      "The Conservatives have a relatively new leader in the Senedd - Darren Millar, who took over late last year after a row over the leadership of Andrew RT Davies.",
      "Under Millar the party has tried to present itself as a serious alternative to Labour, with the Senedd leader keen to show he can be the next first minister and not simply an opposition force.",
      "But the Tories are still in the shadow of a disastrous general election, where the party went from having won 14 seats in the 2019 vote to zero. Recently it has been polling in fourth place. It came second in the Senedd election in 2021.",
      "Samuel Kurtz, chairman of the Tory group in the Senedd, said he was excited by the prospect of the election and the \"opportunities of a different political landscape come 8 May 2026\".",
      "The MS for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire said: \"We need to put forward a positive vision for what Wales could look like. We have had 25 years of the same party in charge, the same government, and a tried and tested method of pretty much trying the same thing.",
      "\"It's saying, look, this is what we're for. We're for a stronger economy, we're for the ability for families to have choice over certain things like education, we're for agriculture, we're for tourism.\"",
      "He added: \"What we've really done with Darren is really hunker down as to what is our USP as Welsh Conservatives, what are we for... rather than just saying we are against the 20mph speed limit for example, or we're against the tourism tax.\"",
      "Asked why he thought the Welsh Conservatives were struggling in polls, former Senedd Tory adviser Anthony Pickles said: \"Because the national party is still so involved in trying to work out its future strategy, its very difficult for the Welsh Conservatives to be diverging, and creating their own brand proposition\".",
      "Smaller parties are thought to be at a disadvantage in the new system - with experts suggesting parties need 13% to 15% to win seats.",
      "That is not to say they won't try - with the Greens among those who will be hoping to enter the Welsh Parliament for the first time.",
      "The Liberal Democrats, who won one regional seat at the last Senedd election and one at the last general election, are hoping to win more.",
      "Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds previously told the BBC: \"We'll have gold everywhere. Look at what we did in England [at the last general election].",
      "\"No-one thought we would win 72 seats. The results were coming in fast and furious that night and I reckon it is going to be like that next May as well.\"",
      "Who could work with who?",
      "It is early days, but the prospect of the electorate being split four ways or more raises questions about how the next government could be formed.",
      "Politicians can be reluctant to talk about the topic with 12 months to go, but for Labour, you would assume a deal with the Conservatives or Reform would be unthinkable. Ministers have instead worked with Plaid and the Lib Dems in the past.",
      "Plaid have ruled out working with Reform, but not Labour or the Tories.",
      "The Conservative's Kurtz declined to talk about who the party might work with, but said the likelihood of a coalition is \"nailed on - it'll have to be a coalition. No one party will reach the threshold of governing on their own\".",
      "Plaid's Gruffydd said a rotating first ministership - similar to how the coalition running the Irish government has operated with rotating prime ministers - \"could be on the agenda\".",
      "\"It depends on the arithmetic,\" he said, suggesting it could be discussed if there are \"two parties thoroughly at the same kind of level\".",
      "But Ms Owens said if Labour held at 27% as in some recent polls, you are \"more likely to have a Labour first minister\", with the party a few seats or more ahead of Plaid.",
      "Prof Wyn Jones also argued the upheaval in geopolitics could play a role.",
      "It could not be predicted, he argued, whether something happening worldwide could make people feel more positive about Labour.",
      "The expert added: \"This is such a hugely uncertain time that everything that we are saying needs to be caveated.\""

      "Earlier Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Breakfast: \"I'm not going to insult your viewers by pretending that winter fuel didn't come up on the doorstep, of course it did, and I know that people aren't happy about winter fuel allowance in lots of cases.\"",
      "Government sources spent Tuesday morning scotching the suggestion that a formal review of the policy is under way, and by the afternoon they were adamant.",
      "\"There will not be a change to the government's policy,\" the prime minister's official spokesman said.",

      "Henry Zeffman: Seven things we have learnt from the election results",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "That will be a disappointment to those Labour MPs who believed that reversing the policy on winter fuel would be the clearest sign to the public that the prime minister, as he said on Friday morning, \"gets it\".",
      "Others closer to government thinking questioned whether there would be any political benefit to changing course at this stage, believing the damage has been done.",
      "Given the categorical denial of any wiggle room on winter fuel, more topical perhaps is the debate over the government's welfare reforms.",
      "The changes in eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) were announced in March but require parliamentary approval. A vote in the House of Commons is likely next month.",
      "Given Sir Keir's colossal majority there is no prospect of the government losing that vote. But there is the possibility that it becomes the locus of broader disaffection with the government's direction.",
      "One Labour MP who identified winter fuel and Pip as the two key reasons for Labour's poor showing last week said the latter was a more acute problem.",
      "\"When people were complaining about winter fuel on the doorstep you'd look at the [canvassing] sheet and often it's people who have never voted for us or haven't voted for us for a long time. With Pip, they were our people.\"",
      "Even those Labour MPs who are more frustrated than angry at the decline in the party's support over the past ten months believe that Sir Keir and his team need to do more to carry their parliamentary ranks with them.",
      "\"There's still a lot of goodwill,\" one said. \"But if we don't have a sense of what the strategic direction is soon then the PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party] will become unmanageable.\"",
      "Pat McFadden, one of the most senior cabinet ministers but also the director of Labour's successful 2024 general election campaign, will deliver a presentation to MPs about the local election results on Wednesday evening.",
      "Questions about the party's strategic direction will be paramount. Though the principal beneficiary of Thursday's local elections at Labour's expense was Reform UK, there are plenty in Labour who worry just as much about bleeding votes on their left flank to more progressive parties such as the Greens.",
      "Many are noting that in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election the Conservative vote more than halved, at least partly due to defections to Labour to stop Reform. Meanwhile, the Green vote actually nudged upwards.",
      "\"We couldn't squeeze the progressive vote - and we'll need to do that at the general election,\" one government source said.",
      "Cooler heads believe that in the scenario of a general election where the most plausible prime ministers were Sir Keir or Nigel Farage, voters on the broad left would inevitably coalesce around Labour.",
      "And whereas the next general election is as much as four years away, events over the next few weeks could help.",
      "A UK-EU summit on May 19 is seen as an opportunity to put significant meat on the bones of the European \"reset\" for which the prime minister has spent much of the past year pushing.",
      "Party strategists believe that a clear demonstration from the prime minister that he believes the UK should be more closely allied to Europe will boost progressive support.",
      "It could also solve other problems. If the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) were to upgrade its forecasts for economic growth as a result of closer ties to the EU, then that would give Rachel Reeves more money to spend in this autumn's Budget.",
      "Before the EU summit, however, comes next week's immigration white paper - which will contain more detail of the government's plans to reduce legal migration and improve the asylum system.",
      "This is seen in government both as a crucial way to demonstrate to sceptical voters that Labour is serious about dealing with their concerns about immigration, as well as a potentially tricky moment for the progressive segment of Labour's coalition.",
      "\"We can't be sheepish about this, we need to make an argument to our own people that there's nothing progressive about letting people smugglers run the English Channel or letting cheap foreign labour undercut good wages,\" one government source said.",
      "And once the rage subsides, many in the Labour Party remember that things could be worse.",
      "Unlike the Conservatives, confronting arguably a much deeper malaise, Labour are in government at control of the levers of power.",
      "\"Things are going to materially improve over the coming years,\" a senior government source said. \"There is no way through this that doesn't involve making people feel better off.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 10:20:32 GMT",
    "summary": "It suggests the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019.",
    "story": [
      "There is no doubt that Reform performed well in Thursday's local council elections. The party won most votes, most seats and overall control of most councils.",
      "True, the party's share of the votes cast across all 23 councils where elections took place on Thursday was no more than 31%. So despite doing well, it secured far from a majority of those voting.",
      "However, its performance was enough to put Reform well ahead of the Conservatives \u2013 who traditionally dominate county councils - on 23%, the Liberal Democrats on 17% and Labour on 14% when you tally up the votes in those parts of England that went to the polls on Thursday.",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "At the 2024 general election Reform secured 14% of the vote but just 5 out of 650 seats at Westminster. But crucially, being ahead of everyone else in 2025 ensured the first-past-the-post election system helped Reform.",
      "Its tally of 677 council seats represented 41% of all those being contested on Thursday, 10 points above its share of the vote, a nod to both the nature of the voting system and Reform's ability to cluster votes. That boost helped the party win control of as many as 10 councils, something that Reform's predecessor, UKIP, never managed at the height of its popularity in the run up to the 2015 general election.",
      "In Staffordshire, Reform won 72% of the seats on 41% of the vote. In Kent, 37% of the vote delivered it 70% of the seats, while in Derbyshire the same share was rewarded with 66% of all the councillors.",
      "Instead of insulating Conservative and Labour from the impact of a third-party challenge, as it has done so often before, first past the post exacerbated their losses. In both cases Reform took nearly half of all the seats those parties were defending.",
      "The map above is the most detailed local election mapping ever produced by the BBC. It details the strength of the Reform vote in every ward that voted on Thursday and shows support for Reform varied considerably.",
      "That variation has some striking and important features. They suggest the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019 - and that Reform's success cannot simply be dismissed as a short-lived protest vote.",
      "Brexit still a fault line",
      "Reflecting the party's anti-EU stance, Reform did much better in wards that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum than it did in wards that backed Remain.",
      "In wards where more than 65% voted Leave in 2016, Reform won on average as much as 45% of the vote. In contrast, in places where a majority backed Remain, only 19% voted for Reform.",
      "Although talked about much less by politicians nowadays, Brexit is still an important fault line in our politics. Reform's appeal is significantly concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right.",
      "Even so, the fact that even in pro-Remain wards the party was able to win as much as a fifth of the vote was testimony to the scale of the swing that it enjoyed on Thursday.",
      "The Brexit division is also evident in the demographic character of the places where Reform did best and those where it did less well.",
      "University graduates and those in professional and managerial jobs were least likely to vote for Brexit in 2016. Reform found it more difficult to do well in places where they are most numerous.",
      "Reform won 39% of the vote in heavily working-class wards but only 19% in the most middle-class ones.",
      "The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining. Next highest was Romney Marsh in Kent and Chadsmoor in Staffordshire.",
      "Meanwhile, support for the party averaged 43% in wards where more than half of adults have few, if any, educational qualifications. In contrast, it polled just 19% where more than two in five have a degree.",
      "Reform's lowest share of the vote, 3.7%, was in the Parks ward in Oxford, situated in the heart of the famous university city.",
      "Immigration is also a key issue for Reform. However, this perhaps makes the party less appealing to those from a minority background.",
      "Certainly, on average the party only polled 22% in wards where more than one in five identify as other than 'white', compared with a tally of 33% in places where more than 95% told the 2021 Census that they were 'white'.",
      "In summary, Reform did best in what has sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' Britain \u2013 places that have profited less from globalisation and university expansion and where a more conservative outlook on immigration is more common.",
      "A problem for the two main parties",
      "Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are likely to recover from the drubbing they received on Thursday unless they can appeal more to this slice of Britain.",
      "Although polls indicate that Reform finds it easier to win over former Conservative voters than their Labour counterparts, Reform's average share of the vote was strikingly just as high in wards that Labour were defending as it was in places that the Conservatives were trying to retain.",
      "The party on average won 32% of the vote in previously Labour wards and 32% in Conservative ones.",
      "As a result, Labour lost seats to Reform at much the same rate as the Conservatives, a pattern that cost Labour control of the one council they were defending, Doncaster.",
      "In contrast, Reform's advance was more muted in wards that the Liberal Democrats and the Greens were defending.  The party's average share in these wards was just 22%. As a result, Reform had relatively little success in taking seats from these two parties.",
      "Liberal Democrat and Green wards \u2013 unlike many Conservative and Labour ones - are heavily populated by university graduates.",
      "Reform's success on Thursday undoubtedly reflects the mood of an electorate that still has little faith in the Conservatives and which now is disappointed by Labour's performance in office.",
      "However, it is evidently proving most popular in a very distinctive part of Britain that overturned the political tables a decade ago in voting for Brexit - and which now has done so again.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 04:54:59 GMT",
    "summary": "A powerful prime minister tries and fails to stop an Old Labour stalwart's progress to City Hall.",
    "story": [
      "Regional mayors are now commonplace in England: Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, Ben Houchen in the Tees Valley and Tracy Brabin in West Yorkshire are all well-known spokespeople for their areas.",
      "But the most prominent directly-elected mayor in Britain was also the first: London.",
      "As is fitting for a city as exciting as London, the first election for that coveted position included allegations of betrayal, stitch ups and intrigue \u2013 and one candidate ended up in prison.",
      "Twenty five years ago Tony Blair's government, elected in 1997 and known as New Labour, was very keen on a new form of devolution.",
      "They wanted mayors like those in America, big personalities elected with powers and budgets (but not too many powers, or too big a budget).",
      "In the end, only one was created by Blair's government.",
      "The 1998 Greater London Authority referendum, held in May that year, asked whether there was support for creating a Greater London Authority with a directly elected mayor and Assembly.",
      "The voters were less keen than New Labour - just 34% turned out to vote, but the majority was clear nonetheless: 72% in favour.",
      "The 'Yes' vote won in every London borough, with support lowest in Bromley with 57% and highest in Haringey with 84%.",
      "Now London was to have a mayor, who would it be?",
      "The obvious candidate was Ken Livingstone, the former left-wing firebrand (and publicity-friendly) leader of the Greater London Council (GLC), who went toe-to-toe with the Thatcher government - and lost.",
      "The GLC was abolished in 1986, leaving London in the unenviable position of having 32 boroughs (and the City of London) but no overall strategic elected body for the largest city in Europe.",
      "However, Livingstone's ability to alienate prime ministers wasn't confined to Conservatives.",
      "Tony Blair was also not a Ken fan.",
      "\"Red\" Ken, as he was known, was Old Labour, not New Labour.",
      "The message from Downing St was clear: Stop Ken.",
      "The party management tried to get the very popular Mo Mowlam to stand, then switched to Frank Dobson.",
      "A bearded, avuncular figure who was serving as New Labour's first health secretary, he was 'persuaded' to stand against his old comrade Ken.",
      "Dobson had initially, and somewhat bravely, declared his desire to remain at health, but then had to give up his cabinet seat to run for a job he didn't want.",
      "The internal workings of Labour can be difficult for outsiders - and many insiders - to navigate.",
      "In this case, an electoral college was mandated which led to the popular Livingstone not winning selection.",
      "The vote was a third each for party members, trade unions and London MPs and other elected representatives.",
      "In the final ballot Livingstone won 60% of party members and 72% of affiliated unions, but Dobson won 86% of MPs, MEPs and Greater London Assembly candidates.",
      "Dobson therefore won a narrow overall victory, and the Blairites were accused of rigging the whole thing to keep Old Labour Ken from the nomination.",
      "Livingstone for his part had promised not to run as an independent, then decided that that was what he was going to do after all.",
      "The Tories also had a colourful time choosing their candidate.",
      "In September 1999 the novelist Jeffrey Archer was selected by party members, beating Steve Norris.",
      "But in a plot twist reminiscent of one of his books, Archer withdrew from the race a few months later after it was alleged he had committed perjury in a famous libel case.",
      "Lord Archer had secured the Conservative nomination with backing from former prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, who in 1992 had made him a peer.",
      "Five years earlier, in 1987, Archer had won a libel case against The Daily Star which published a story that he had paid off a sex worker called Monica Coghlan.",
      "After his selection as a mayoral candidate, a former friend of Archer's told the News of the World that he had lied in the libel trial and asked him to provide a false alibi.",
      "Archer stood down from the race, and starred in a production of his courtroom play, The Accused, in London's West End while waiting for his trial to start.",
      "In July 2001 he was found guilty and spent two years in jail, but retained his peerage and membership of the House of Lords as there was no mechanism to remove them at the time.",
      "Norris was selected as the Conservative Party candidate to replace Archer.",
      "A very different type of Tory, Norris advocated for gay rights and had a relaxed approach to monogamy.",
      "He was also a former transport minister who was obsessed with buses.",
      "In that role, he had a hand in approving the Jubilee line extension from Green Park to Stratford, and the privatisation of London's bus services.",
      "In the rough and tumble world of turn of the century politics, he was given the nickname \"Shagger\".",
      "A brief snippet from a Guardian profile piece published during that first mayoral campaign gives a flavour of Norris' complex appeal.",
      "\"The day his original candidature was announced was marked by a letter to the Times from his father-in-law, a retired rear-admiral, expressing astonishment at Norris's public plans to marry the fourth of his famous five mistresses \u2026 since as far as the rear-admiral knew, Norris was still married to his daughter.\"",
      "Norris was a self-made man, a millionaire car salesman who grew up in working class Liverpool, attending the same school as Paul McCartney.",
      "Not many 2025 Tories can boast that sort of hinterland.",
      "There may have been some intrigue in the Lib Dem selection process, but it is lost to history if there was.",
      "Their candidate was the estimable Susan Kramer, who was subjected to condescension and mansplaining throughout the campaign - this was a time when female Labour MPs were referred to as \"Blair's Babes\" by tabloid and broadsheet newspapers alike.",
      "Livingstone was to mount the first - and so far only - successful independent bid for Mayor of London.",
      "Dobson ran a campaign that never really captured the imagination of London's voters, and his old comrade won the historic poll despite a late surge in support for the Tory candidate.",
      "The May 2000 election was a disaster for New Labour: Dobson got just 13% of the vote and was eliminated in the first round along with Susan Kramer, who polled a respectable 11.9% for the Lib Dems.",
      "Livingstone led by 39% to 27% of first preference votes and polled a total of 776,427 votes to 564,137 for Norris, after second preferences were calculated.",
      "It was a bloody nose and a notable defeat for the previously unassailable Tony Blair.",
      "The BBC News website has an archive of reports from this election, a time capsule of the way politics used to be.",
      "It reported that Dobson's \"humiliation in the mayoral poll was underlined as he came fourth in the mayoral contest in Barnet and Camden - the seat which includes his parliamentary constituency\".",
      "The 2000 election reports reveal Livingstone said he would \"fight for the interests of Londoners as mayor, demanding more money from the government and telling ministers they were wrong over plans to partially privatise the London Underground\".",
      "London Underground, now part of Transport for London, remains in public hands under the control of the Mayor of London.",
      "It also reported that Blair \"made it clear Mr Livingstone would not be allowed to return to Labour after standing against an official party candidate\".",
      "Blair was wrong about that: in 2004 Livingstone was the Labour candidate, and he won, again defeating Norris.",
      "Livingstone was his party's standard bearer again in both 2008 and 2012, on both occasions losing to a young Conservative contender called Boris Johnson.",

      "The patchwork of different election results across England has been truly fascinating, throwing up all sorts of lessons.",
      "Here are seven things we have learnt from the contests:",
      "These are really bad results for the Labour Party",
      "Sometimes in politics what is most obvious is most important. These are a bad set of results for the Labour Party at their first electoral test since being swept to office ten months ago in a landslide of epic proportions.",
      "\"We did it!\" the prime minister told his jubilant supporters back then as seat after seat fell to Labour, adding: \"It feels good, I have to be honest.\"",
      "That's not so much the vibe these days.",
      "Leaving the eight-hour count after the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, Labour campaigners were utterly dejected, not least at having lost by only six votes, the closest result in any by-election ever.",
      "Yet even if they had won by six votes, the trend would have been the same -  a governing party which has burnt through goodwill at an unimaginable pace.",
      "It's possible to overstate how dramatic the contrast with the 2024 general election is, though.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer's victory was broad but shallow, his 411 seats procured on just over a third of the vote. Perhaps it's not surprising that the so-called loveless landslide has been followed by a rude awakening.",
      "Labour's debate on what to do next is just beginning",
      "\"On every door it was the same story - winter fuel and Pip.\"",
      "That's what a Labour campaigner in Runcorn told me, referring to the early decision this government made to means-test the winter fuel allowance and the more recent announcement that eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment will be tightened.",
      "Speaking to Labour MPs from different wings of the party over the course of the day, it's been surprising how many have pretty much stuck to that same theme. For almost all of them, the original sin of this government was the decision on winter fuel.",
      "There are nuances within that position. Some believe the cut could have been communicated better, making the case that some pensioners were receiving the benefit who simply didn't need it. Others think it was never worth the political risk for the amount of money it would raise.",
      "To stress, it is not just the left of the Labour Party, comprised of a handful of MPs willing to criticise Starmer publicly, who are saying this. I had a conversation with an MP on the right of the party who believes the situation is so dire, the damage so fundamental, that Rachel Reeves should simply reverse the cut.",
      "That is extremely unlikely. But it is where the debate may be headed when MPs return to the Commons and compare notes next week.",
      "And of course a crucial part of that debate is the parlous economic situation inherited by the government which, those around the prime minister insist, necessitated unpleasant decisions which were always bound to be unpopular. If it had not been winter fuel, it would have been something else \u2013 the argument goes.",
      "The consolation of sorts for Labour is that fixing their political predicament is in their hands. They are the government and the levers of power are at their command. The next general election is up to four years away. All in Labour agree that people need to be made to feel better off - and they hope that if that can be achieved, the political challenges melt away.",
      "For the Conservatives, things are somehow getting worse",
      "Turns out the only way wasn't up. The Conservatives were reduced to their fewest MPs ever last July. That annihilation is now being visited on their local politicians.",
      "Kemi Badenoch took charge of a crushed Conservative Party and has only had six months to begin trying to turn things round. Still, I am yet to meet a Conservative who will sincerely argue that she has made a good start.",
      "I have, though, lost count of Conservative MPs and advisers who say to me that, in a funny way, they need Labour to be doing better. The Conservatives are still tarnished in many voters' eyes by their governing record, meaning that the receptacle for voters' immediate frustration with Labour, in Runcorn and elsewhere, is Reform UK.",
      "But it's more than just a story about the government's woes, as longstanding Conservative strongholds such as Staffordshire and Lincolnshire falling to Reform show. Some of the results simply need to be stated to see how startling they are.",
      "Conservatives had run Staffordshire County Council since 2009. They had 56 of the 62 councillors on Thursday morning. Now they have only 10.",
      "The Lib Dems have taken dozens of seats from the Tories. They have pushed the party into third place in this set of elections. Leader Sir Ed Davey is claiming to have seized the title of the party of \"Middle England\".",
      "There does not seem to be any appetite at all in the Conservative Party to even begin a conversation about changing leader yet again. Robert Jenrick throwing his support behind the woman who beat him to the leadership was a significant moment.",
      "Whoever is leader, a Conservative Party performing at this level is a Conservative Party in an existential crisis.",
      "'Not Labour enough': MPs' despair at voters' verdict on government",
      "Sir John Curtice: Reform challenging traditional party dominance",
      "For Reform, with victory comes responsibility",
      "It's hard to come up with the right superlatives for Nigel Farage's political achievement. Suffice to say the Reform surge evident in opinion polling has turned out to be real.",
      "Yes, under Farage's leadership Ukip won the European elections in 2014 and the Brexit Party did the same in 2019.",
      "Their success in five constituencies at the general election - including Farage himself finally making it into parliament at the eighth attempt - suggested Reform UK was something different to his previous incarnations. That is surely now proven beyond all reasonable doubt.",
      "Reform has now won control of ten councils, and with victory comes responsibility.",
      "When Ukip ran up victories in the European elections, its mandate was to scrutinise the Brussels institutions its voters loathed.",
      "Now its mandate is to make its own voters' lives better. That is a different task. The traditional main parties will be hoping that following responsibility comes accountability, and that if Reform councils and mayors fail, the party's brand will suffer.",
      "It's not just Reform benefitting from the main parties' unpopularity",
      "The Liberal Democrats have made solid gains across what was once traditional Tory territory, which is essentially local politics catching up with what happened at the general election last July.",
      "In Devon they gained 18 council seats, mostly at the Conservatives' expense, to become the largest party, and have won control of Oxfordshire, Shropshire and Cambridgeshire.",
      "They are ecstatic to have leapfrogged the Conservatives into third place in the BBC's Projected National Share.",
      "The Greens are making gains too, although their failure to win or even come second in the West of England mayoral contest will sting. The battle between the Greens and Labour for younger, urban progressives is likely to come to the fore in future local elections.",
      "Whoever is the change candidate wins",
      "Labour's general election slogan was just one word: change. No wonder that it appeared at the start of new MP Sarah Pochin's victory speech in Runcorn too.",
      "If there's one thing every politician and strategist from every party seems to agree on, it is that people are crying out for things to be better. In other words, for change.",
      "It was the mantle Keir Starmer managed to seize in opposition. His challenge is to reclaim it while being in government.",
      "The task facing each opposition party in their different ways is to stop him doing so and convince voters that they have the best shot of improving their lives.",

      "Who won the local election in my area?",
      "Sir John Curtice: Reform challenging traditional party dominance",
      "The era of fragmentation is here...at least for now",
      "The two-party double act which has governed Britain for a century appears to be under massive strain. It may be time to get used to elections in this country - parliamentary, mayoral, council - being won on low shares of the vote by very fine margins. Under our First Past The Post system (where the winner is simply the person with the most votes), if you have lots of parties with relatively even support, things can get really unpredictable.",
      "Yet if there's another lesson of British politics in recent years it's that politics is volatile. The death of the two-party system has been pronounced before. At the 2010 general election, Labour and the Conservatives only got 65% of the vote combined. By 2017 that figure was back up to 82%. In 2024 it was back to 57%. Things can change fast in politics - they have done, again and again.",
      "As politics begins to move at social media speed, who's to say Reform cannot fall away as fast as they rose?",
      "It's a counter-argument worth bearing in mind. On the other hand, it is no longer preposterous to say that Nigel Farage could be the next prime minister.",
      "The range of possible political futures which could unfold in the UK over the next few years is simply vast. Anyone who tells you what is going to happen next needs a whopping great dose of humility.",

      "Speaking to journalists as his party stormed to victory in Durham, Farage set out what that was likely to mean in Reform-led councils across the country.",
      "\"I think you all better really be seeking alternative careers,\" he warned council staff who were \"working on climate change initiatives, or Diversity, Equality and Inclusion\" or opting to work from home.",
      "He added: \"We want to give council taxpayers better value for money, reduce excessive expenditure, find out who long-term contracts are with, reduce the scale of local government back to what it ought to be - providing social care, providing SEN needs for kids, mending pot holes.\"",

      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said essential services were being under-funded while councils were spending \"fortunes on net-zero pet projects, building rainbow crossings or hiring \u00a370,000 a year diversity managers\".",
      "Asked if there would be sackings, he said his party would be sending in auditors to see what jobs there are and \"if they are good value for money\".",

      "Asylum seeker accommodation",
      "Reform has railed against high levels of immigration and the numbers coming to the UK in small boats across the channel.",
      "In its general election manifesto it said it would implement a freeze on non-essential immigration. Those with certain skills - for example in healthcare - would still be allowed to come to the UK.",
      "Local councils don't have control over nationwide immigration policy, but Farage has said his party will \"resist central government plonking hundreds of these young men in these counties that we now run\".",
      "Grimes said Reform would not \"allow our communities to be a dumping ground for illegal migrants\".",
      "In her victory speech, Reform's new mayor for Greater Lincolnshire Dame Andrea Jenkyns said: \"I say 'no' to putting people in hotels. Tents are good enough for France; they should be good enough for you in Britain.\"",
      "The Home Office is responsible for housing adult asylum seekers and while councils can object, they have little power to stop people being housed in their areas.",
      "A rise in the numbers of people seeking asylum has led to hotels being increasingly used for accommodation.",
      "In its manifesto the Labour government promised to stop using hotels for this purpose, which in 2023/24 cost \u00a33.1bn; however early this year a minister confirmed the number of hotels had risen since the election.",
      "Inexperience 'an advantage'",
      "Many of the party's newly elected councillors have little political experience, however Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice says that will be \"an advantage\".",
      "Tice admitted there would need to be \"a learning process\" and it would be \"ridiculous\" to say there would be no mistakes, but that Reform councillors would be \"honest where we get things wrong\".",

      "As concerns around competency were aired by activists, party chairman Zia Yusuf confirmed Reform UK would be expanding its centre for excellence to train up new councillors.",
      "Yusuf has pushed Reform's Centre for Excellence as a means of professionalising the party and says it has already trained up 1,000 candidates.",

      "Though some of the results are still to be reported, Reform are clearly the winners of Thursday's local elections.",
      "Across the 23 councils where a ballot was held, the party won more votes and more seats than any of its opponents by a clear margin. The party is probably heading for around 700 seat gains and won two mayoral contests.",
      "Meanwhile, it has won overall control of no less than seven councils, including the once Labour fiefdom of Durham and the two largest counties,  Kent and Lancashire.",
      "The party performed best in wards which voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 referendum. Yet even in places which voted to remain in the EU, the party was still routinely able to win as much as a fifth of the vote.",
      "The party seemed able across the country to tap into voters' widespread dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and Labour.",
      "Reform wins Runcorn by-election by just six votes and gains first mayor",
      "Reform wins Runcorn by-election by just six votes and gains first mayor",
      "In the BBC's projection of what would have happened if a nationwide election had been held on Thursday, Reform were credited with 30% of the vote. That easily beats the 23% that Ukip scored at the height of their popularity in 2013. It is the first time that a party other than Conservative or Labour has been placed first.",
      "Meanwhile, Reform also won the Runcorn by-election, albeit by the narrowest of margins. Never before has a pro-Brexit party candidate won a by-election, other than two local Tory MPs who defected to Ukip in 2014.",
      "For both the Conservatives and Labour the result was worse than their spokespersons feared. The Conservatives lost two in three of the seats they were defending and at best are likely to be left with control of just one council, Buckinghamshire.",
      "In a clear indication of the Conservatives' vulnerability to the challenge from Nigel Farage's party, its vote fell most heavily in places where the Reform advance was strongest. Their score in the BBC projection is by far a record low.",
      "Labour also lost two in three of the seats they were defending, though it had the consolation of winning three mayoral elections, albeit only by a narrow margin. Their projected share is the lowest since 2008, when the party suffered from the financial crash and the MPs' expenses scandal.",
      "In contrast, the Liberal Democrats were able to withstand the Reform tide, recording over 100 net gains. The party was particularly successful in councils that it had targeted, most notably Devon and Shropshire. Overall, however, the party's performance in votes was largely in line with that of other recent local elections. Much the same was true of the Greens, who made a modest gain of 38 seats.",
      "Before Thursday, commentators were asking whether the local elections would herald the end of Conservative and Labour's joint dominance of British politics. We certainly cannot rule out the possibility that this proves to be the case.",

    "story": [
      "Dame Andrea Jenkyns has been elected as the mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, giving the party she represents, Reform UK, its most powerful office to date.",
      "In her victory speech, she declared it was a \"new dawn in British politics\" and vowed Reform would \"reset Britain to its glorious past\".",
      "She beat the Conservative candidate by more than 40,000 votes, which will feel like like a personal vindication for the former Tory MP.",
      "But she showed she had lost none of her talent for generating controversy when she walked out on a Sky News interview after being asked about her view that illegal migrants should be \"put in tents\" and criticisms of her Tory opponent's South African accent.",
      "A former Greggs worker and Miss UK finalist, Dame Andrea will now control an annual budget of \u00a324m and hold powers over skills, transport and economic development in the region.",
      "The result marks a remarkable political comeback for an MP voted out less than a year ago in the general election.",
      "But as Dame Andrea's meandering political career shows, she has form for bouncing back from crushing disappointments with attention-grabbing election wins.",
      "Shock election triumph",
      "It all started in 2009, when she won a seat on Lincolnshire County Council, narrowly defeating the far-right British National Party's candidate.",
      "The result did not stand for long though. She was forced to resign after it emerged her part-time job as a music tutor for a council-run music service made her ineligible to run as a candidate.",
      "A by-election was held and Jenkyns squeaked home by 16 votes, again ahead of the BNP.",
      "Four years on, she lost her council seat to UKIP, a Eurosceptic party founded by Nigel Farage - Reform UK's leader and, ironically, now Dame Andrea's boss.",
      "Two years passed before her next comeback in 2015, when she burst onto the national scene with one of the biggest shocks of the general election that year.",
      "She ousted shadow chancellor Ed Balls, winning the Morley and Outwood constituency by 422 votes and knocking a brick out of Labour's red wall.",
      "Jenkyns - who worked at a Greggs bakery after leaving school at 16 - said she was \"lost for words\".",
      "In her campaign, she presented herself as a \"strong Yorkshire lass\" from humble beginnings.",
      "Born in Humberside in 1974, Jenkyns went straight into a job after finishing school, working her way up from a Saturday shop assistant to senior management.",
      "An amateur opera singer and a vocal coach, she also worked as a music tutor in secondary schools.",
      "When she hit her 30s, she decided to retrain and completed a diploma in economics from the Open University before graduating from the University of Lincoln aged 40 after studying international relations and politics.",
      "Her father was a lorry driver with his own haulage business.",
      "He pushed her towards the limelight at an early age, entering her in the Miss UK beauty contest.",
      "\"My dad sent my photo off without telling me and I ended up getting into the final,\" she told the Express newspaper.",
      "\"It was an interesting moment.\"",
      "Her father's death in 2011 - after he contracted the MRSA infection in hospital - spurred her to run for Parliament.",
      "Brexit backer",
      "As an MP, Jenkyns was a passionate Brexit backer and a strong critic of Theresa May's handling of the UK's departure from the EU when she was prime minister.",
      "In a striking intervention at Prime Minister's Questions, Jenkyns said May had \"failed to deliver on her promises\" and suggested she should resign.",
      "Once May had stood aside, Jenkyns found favour with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who appointed her as an assistant government whip in 2021 and a junior education minister a year later.",
      "A loyal ally, Jenkyns consistently defended Johnson, including during her appearance on the BBC's Have I Got News For You programme, when she described him as \"one of our better prime ministers\".",
      "When Johnson resigned in 2022, Jenkyns lost her composure outside Downing Street.",
      "She was filmed giving the middle finger to protesters shortly before Johnson's resignation.",
      "A backlash followed and in her defence, Jenkyns said she was \"only human\" and had received \"huge amounts of abuse from some of the people who were there over the years\".",
      "\"I responded and stood up for myself,\" she said.",
      "She was made a dame in Johnson's resignation honours in 2023.",
      "Jenkyns retained her ministerial role under Liz Truss but was later dismissed by the following prime minister, Rishi Sunak.",
      "She then failed to win re-election to the successor seat of Leeds South West and Morley at the 2024 general election.",
      "Bouncing back with Reform",
      "Back in the political wilderness, Jenkyns began flirting with Reform UK last year.",
      "Dame Andrea had made clear her sympathies with Nigel Farage's party, urging the Conservatives to unite with it to prevent a Labour \"supermajority\" at the general election.",
      "Attending Reform UK's conference last autumn, Dame Andrea insisted she was \"not defecting\" but was keen to find out whether Farage's party was \"the true home of conservatism\".",
      "Two months later, Jenkyns announced she was officially joining Reform UK and would stand as the party's candidate to be mayor of Greater Lincolnshire.",
      "Dame Andrea said she had \"fought to the bitter end\" but the Conservative Party was now \"beyond salvage\".",
      "Twelve years on from her defeat to Farage's former party in a local election in Lincolnshire, Jenkyns has delivered a significant electoral victory for her former foe.",
      "Back in the county where it all began, the new mayor has once again proved her bouncebackability.",

    "summary": "The spacecraft was meant to go to Venus but has been stuck in orbit for more than 50 years.",
    "story": [
      "Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft is expected to crash back to Earth this week after being stuck in orbit for more than half a century.",
      "Kosmos 482 was launched in 1972 as part of a mission to Venus but it never escaped low Earth orbit and separated into four pieces, according to Nasa.",
      "One of those pieces, believed to be the lander probe, is expected to re-enter our atmosphere around 10 May and at least part of it could survive the journey without burning up, according to Nasa.",
      "There is much we don't know about the re-entry, including where it might land, but even if any of it does survive, 70% of the planet is covered by sea so it is unlikely to cause significant damage.",
      "\"It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris.\" said Mr Stijn Lemmens, Senior Space Debris Mitigation Analyst at the European Space Agency.",
      "The lander capsule is a tough, spherical object about a metre wide and weighs nearly half a tonne.",
      "It was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it has a robust heat shield and durable structure.",
      "This is why experts think it may survive an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely long since degraded after more than 50 years in space.",
      "The risk to people on the ground is considered low, but the capsule's projected flight path could see it land anywhere between 51.7\u00b0 north and south latitude, covering most of the inhabited world.",
      "This means it could potentially land anywhere from as far north as London to as far south as the southern tip of South America.",
      "Uncontrolled space debris incidents have occurred before.",
      "Mr Lemmens explained that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently,\" happening weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones. Objects typically burn up in the earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground.",
      "China's Long March 5B booster re-entered over the Indian Ocean in 2022, and the Tiangong-1 space station mostly burned up over the Pacific in 2018.",
      "Kosmos 482 is now being closely tracked by international space agencies.",
      "Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft \"should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entries\".",
      "This allows for precise predictions of landing locations, reducing the risk of any debris impacting populated areas, thereby protecting people and property while \"managing the environmental impact of space debris.\""

    "story": [
      "In a significant blow to the government's clean energy ambitions the Danish energy company Orsted has cancelled plans for a huge windfarm off the coast of East Yorkshire.",
      "The Hornsea 4 project would have become one of the biggest offshore wind farms in the world with a potential capacity of 2.4GW \u2013 enough to power more than a million homes.",
      "Orsted said the project no longer made economic sense, despite signing a 15-year contract with the UK government guaranteeing to sell power at an agreed price.",
      "The UK's offshore wind sector has faced soaring costs in recent years, as the government has acknowledged.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it recognised \"the effect that globally high inflation and supply chain constraints are having on industry across Europe.\"",
      "But this is the second developer to pull out of a major offshore project.",
      "The Swedish company Vattenfall halted development of a 1.4GW wind farm off the coast of Norfolk in July 2023, again due to rising costs.",
      "Thay project was sold to the German energy company RWE, which has said it plans to see the project through.",
      "However, the difficulties offshore developers are facing raise significant questions about the viability of the government's clean power by 2030 target \u2013 one of the Labour government's five central \"missions\".",
      "Just over half of the country's power currently comes from wind, solar, nuclear and biomass \u2013 organic matter.  The government wants to raise that to 95% by 2030 \u2013 so in just five years' time.",
      "In order to meet that target the UK will need to triple offshore wind capacity and double the amount of solar and onshore wind power on the system, according to estimates by Aurora Energy.",

      "A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild.",
      "Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction.",
      "But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo.",
      "It has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge.",
      "This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany.",
      "Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home.",
      "\"I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,\" he said. \" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.\"",
      "Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.",
      "Though not officially classed as a \"big cat\" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food.",
      "Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction.",
      "\"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom.",

      "The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring.",
      "\"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says.",
      "To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind.",
      "But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males.",
      "So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available.",
      "\"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo.",
      "Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem.",
      "\"If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,\" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg told us.",
      "We're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills.",
      "There are puncture marks on its throat \u2013 a sure sign.",
      "\"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.",
      "The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction.",
      "\"Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals.\" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure.",
      "\"We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements.\"",

      "Sandeels are a vital source of food for marine life including seabirds that live along the UK coastline.",
      "Two bans for English and Scottish waters were put in place in early 2024 to prohibit trawlers netting the tiny fish, following concerns that sandeel stocks were becoming too low.",
      "Judges at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) based in The Hague ruled there is no legal obligation to reverse the closure order after the EU claimed the move was \"discriminatory and disproportionate\", and could threaten the future of commercial sandeel fishing in Denmark.",
      "The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which manages Bempton Cliffs in East Yorkshire, was one of several conservation organisations that called for the measure to remain in place and gave evidence in the court hearing.",
      "Beccy Speight, the RSPB's chief executive, said: \"We are absolutely delighted the panel has found the ecological case for the closure of industrial sandeel fishing is sound.\"",
      "\"Safeguarding sandeel stocks is a key part of the jigsaw that will help set our puffins, kittiwakes and the wider marine environment on the path to recovery.\"",
      "The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) welcomed the court's decision and said it had found \"the UK successfully demonstrated that the measures taken to close English and Scottish waters were based on the best available science\".",
      "Sandeels comprise a number of species of small fish and are caught commercially for use in animal feed and in oil production.",
      "Danish fishing organisations had argued that the North Sea ban was \"unnecessary\" and claimed sandeel stocks were plentiful, disputing the scientific evidence.",
      "Speaking before the court ruling Esben Sverdrup-Jensen, from the Danish Pelagic Producers' Association, said the ban had a \"massive impact\" on the industry.",
      "\"It means we have lost about half of the fishing grounds that we have traditionally fished on for decades,\" he said.",
      "Mr Sverdrup-Jensen disputed the claim that sandeel stocks were under threat.",
      "\"Sandeel is probably the best managed fishery in the world,\" he added.",
      "The ruling means a sandeel fishing ban also remains in place in the Scottish areas of the North Sea and this has been welcomed by the Scottish government, which has continuing concerns about the seabird population.",
      "Scotland's Rural Affairs Secretary, Mairi Gougeon, said: \"Protecting our marine ecosystem is vital to Scotland's environment, and to the people and communities who rely on it.",
      "\"The ruling reaffirms the appropriateness of the actions we took last year to do just that.\"",
      "The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling, which runs to nearly 300 pages, also stated the ban in English waters breached the post-Brexit trade deal because it was \"disproportionate\".",
      "In a statement, the European Commission said it welcomed the ruling as it \"provides clarity\" on fishing rights.",
      "It said: \"The UK is required to immediately comply with the final ruling and shall inform the EU within 30 days of the [compliance] measures it will take\".",
      "A Defra spokesperson said it would \"bring the UK into compliance\" on this issue but the ruling did not mean the UK is legally obliged to reverse the closure of English waters.",

    "summary": "In a blow to the government's clean energy ambitions, a company cancels a huge windfarm off Yorkshire.",
    "story": [
      "In a significant blow to the government's clean energy ambitions the Danish energy company Orsted has cancelled plans for a huge windfarm off the coast of East Yorkshire.",
      "The Hornsea 4 project would have become one of the biggest offshore wind farms in the world with a potential capacity of 2.4GW \u2013 enough to power more than a million homes.",
      "Orsted said the project no longer made economic sense, despite signing a 15-year contract with the UK government guaranteeing to sell power at an agreed price.",
      "The UK's offshore wind sector has faced soaring costs in recent years, as the government has acknowledged.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it recognised \"the effect that globally high inflation and supply chain constraints are having on industry across Europe.\"",
      "But this is the second developer to pull out of a major offshore project.",
      "The Swedish company Vattenfall halted development of a 1.4GW wind farm off the coast of Norfolk in July 2023, again due to rising costs.",
      "Thay project was sold to the German energy company RWE, which has said it plans to see the project through.",
      "However, the difficulties offshore developers are facing raise significant questions about the viability of the government's clean power by 2030 target \u2013 one of the Labour government's five central \"missions\".",
      "Just over half of the country's power currently comes from wind, solar, nuclear and biomass \u2013 organic matter.  The government wants to raise that to 95% by 2030 \u2013 so in just five years' time.",
      "In order to meet that target the UK will need to triple offshore wind capacity and double the amount of solar and onshore wind power on the system, according to estimates by Aurora Energy.",
      "It will also need a significant upgrade to the electricity grid with 620 miles of new power lines as well as substations and other equipment.",
      "Green energy plan needs 600 miles of power lines - report",
      "Battle lines drawn over 'monstrous' pylons and solar farm 'wastelands'",
      "Many local communities are pushing back at the prospect of major new energy infrastructure near their homes.",
      "Some industry experts - as well as the Conservative and Reform parties \u2013 say the 2030 target is not achievable.",
      "Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, has long argued building out this infrastructure in the timescale would be near impossible.",
      "\"In failing to meet a very short-term target, it is going to maximise the costs of trying,\" he has warned.",
      "Chris Stark, the head of the government's Clean Power 2030 mission, has conceded the target will be \u2013 as he put it - \"bloody hard\", but that with a \"Herculean effort\" it can be met.",
      "Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, accepts the plan it is ambitious and controversial but is adamant that it is essential to: \"cut bills, tackle the climate crisis and give us energy security.\"",
      "The government has said it plans to work with Orsted to get Hornsea 4 \"back on track\" and said it believed the clean power mission was still achievable.",
      "\"We have a strong pipeline of projects to deliver clean power by 2030 and our mission-led approach ensures we can steer our way through global pressures and individual commercial decisions to reach our targets,\" a spokesperson said.",

    "summary": "Sir David says his new film Ocean is one of the most important of his career.",
    "story": [
      "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.",
      "He believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.",
      "Sir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"",
      "The ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.",
      "The blue carpet was rolled out for the premiere the Royal Festival Hall in London.",
      "In attendance was the King, told Sir David he \"can't believe\" his 99th birthday was on Thursday.",
      "The pair posed for photos before they entered the auditorium for the screening.",
      "A host of celebrities also attended, including singer Geri Halliwell-Horner, astronaut Tim Peake, singer James Blunt and model Cara Delevingne.",
      "Earlier, Prince William attended a matinee in a \"private capacity\", along with hundreds of children from schools across the country.",
      "Toby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.",
      "The film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.",
      "Sir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"",
      "Since then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.",
      "Ocean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.",
      "The new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. They are often seeking a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.",
      "\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.",
      "The process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.",
      "Sir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".",
      "Sir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.",
      "It is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.",
      "Just one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"",
      "But in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.",
      "One of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"",
      "Despite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"",
      "Sir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.",
      "He believes that could be transformational.",
      "\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"",
      "A healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.",
      "\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.",
      "As he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory.",

    "story": [
      "When the UK became the first major economy in the world to commit to reducing its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, there was so little disagreement among MPs it was simply 'nodded through' without a vote.",
      "Six years on, the political climate is very different, the consensus at Westminster has shattered and reaching net zero is fast becoming a political dividing line.",
      "Labour has committed itself to an extra deadline: reaching clean power by 2030.",
      "The Greens and Liberal Democrats want to hit net zero faster, the Conservatives are slamming the brakes on their policy and, for the first time, there is now a mainstream party, Reform UK, openly questioning the need to reach net zero at all.",
      "Even a former Labour prime minister, Sir Tony Blair, has said that existing global approaches to tackling climate change aren't working (although it was later clarified that his institute supports the government's targets).",
      "So what's happened?",
      "Labour defends net-zero policies after Blair criticism",
      "Blair says current net zero policies 'doomed to fail'",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "In 2019, when the target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 was set, public concern about climate change was very visible.",
      "Thousands of people had joined Extinction Rebellion marches and the then-teenage activist Greta Thunberg was so influential she was invited to address MPs in Parliament.",
      "Luke Tryl, pollster for More in Common, says he has not found a significant drop in concern about climate change or support for net zero, even if we're not seeing people on the streets.",
      "What has changed, he says, is the conversation around it which, after the rising cost of living and the war in Ukraine, has switched to \"how does this reflect on people's pockets and does it make people think the country is safer as a result?\"",
      "He also says the debate has become \"more polarised between left and right\" with Labour and Lib Dem voters seeing it as a \"top three\" issue, while Reform voters are more opposed to net zero but less motivated by it: only one in 10 people vote Nigel Farage's party because of net zero, Tryl's research suggests.",
      "He also says that politicians are more divided than everyone else.",
      "\"The fracturing of the consensus has been far more profound at what we'd call 'elite level' rather than at public level,\" he says.",
      "Undoubtedly, part of the rise in the conversation about climate targets has been driven by the rise of Reform, which has made what it calls \"net stupid zero\" one of its major campaign issues.",
      "Deputy leader Richard Tice says his party - which has just won a by-election and made major gains in local elections - has forced the issue onto the political agenda.",
      "\"On the doors, people are talking about immigration but the next thing they talk about is the price of everything, the bills, the cost of living. When you drill into it, the message is getting across that the increase in the cost of living is significantly due to the increase in energy costs.",
      "\"The awareness of the stupidity of this has transformed in the last six months, because of the destruction of jobs and bills. People are waking up all over the place.\"",
      "For the Green Party of England and Wales Co-Leader, Adrian Ramsay, the fracturing of consensus is \"distressing\" and he blames party politics.",
      "\"There are parts of the political spectrum that are determined to turn this into a political football but I think reasonable people within all parties need to resist.\"",
      "He says people do need to feel they are included in climate measures and believes there is a \"sensible climate majority\" within Parliament, whose job it is to make the right policies to bring people along with them.",
      "\"Of course it has to be done in a way that brings people with us and there is a risk that there's too much onus put on individuals so when it comes to things like public transport, for instance....the greener option needs to be the cheaper option.\"",
      "There are also those that think the UK is starting to import the more partisan politics on the issue from the US.",
      "Pippa Heylings, the Liberal Democrats' net zero spokesperson, says she thinks part of the pushback is being driven by \"big oil and gas\" who, she says, have been \"emboldened by Donald Trump\".",
      "Another is that the easy things have already been done and \"we're now getting to the things that will touch on people's lives\".",
      "Her party's policy is currently to reach net zero by 2045 although she says they are looking at it to make sure it is still \"do-able\" after the previous Conservative administration shifted the government's timeline.",
      "The most marked political shift has come from the Conservatives, who have moved from setting the 2050 target, enthusiastically embracing green goals set by Boris Johnson, to a slowing of some targets under Rishi Sunak and, finally, abandoning 2050 under Kemi Badenoch.",
      "She has described the 2050 plans as \"impossible\" and said that what Keir Starmer needed to do was to \"scrap what [Energy Secretary] Ed Miliband is planning which is actually going to bankrupt the country\".",
      "\"It's not workable. Conservatives are working on new plans so that we can tackle climate change and look after our environment, without bankrupting the UK.\"",
      "Green-minded Tories have said they thought the decision to ditch the target was premature but they hope their party will recommit to decarbonisation.",
      "Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network, said: \"On the centre-right there have been growing concerns around the cost of the transition and the shift to a more statist, interventionist approach to decarbonising.\"",
      "He says he wants to see a more \"market-led\" solution.",
      "While much of the Labour Party does seem to be on board with the leadership's position, there are some in the broader Labour movement who have issued warning shots that suggest their support for net zero is conditional.",
      "Some trade unions have become increasingly vocal about the need to ensure that there is a plan to protect jobs in any transition to green energy.",
      "As the union Unite put it: \"If they fail to do this, then Labour cannot expect workers to support their net zero plan.\"",
      "While the net zero by 2050 target is currently set in law, Labour's \"clean power by 2030\" push is self-imposed, leading to regular rumours that it could be watered down.",
      "Government sources are adamant the party is committed to it, and they point to investments that have already been made.",
      "Other Labour sources, who back the targets, say they believe the prime minister is invested in it and that it is intrinsically linked to the government's growth agenda.",
      "They also warn that any watering down of targets would shake confidence in foreign investment.",
      "Former Labour advisor John McTernan believes that keeping the clean power commitment is also key to the government's political survival beyond the next election.",
      "\"Labour has to be solid on it because it's a manifesto commitment and because it is a point of distinction with the parties on the right.",

    "summary": "In a letters to MPs, four major banks have set out the extent of the disruption caused in February's outage.",
    "story": [
      "About 1.2m people in the UK were affected by banking outages that happened on what was pay day for many earlier this year.",
      "The details have emerged in letters from Lloyds, TSB, Nationwide and HSBC to Dame Meg Hillier, the chair of the Commons Treasury Committee, which is looking into the incident that occurred on Friday, 28 February.",
      "HSBC also revealed that customers had to wait two hours on average that day to reach its online customer service team. Its standard target wait time is five minutes.",
      "In their correspondence, the banks said they had paid compensation to affected customers and also outlined what they were doing to try to prevent similar problems in the future.",
      "Pay day problems",
      "Lloyds Banking Group customers faced the biggest impact from the February outages.",
      "Ron van Kemenade, the bank's group chief operating officer, said around 700,000 people who are customers of Lloyds, Halifax, Bank of Scotland and MBNA were affected as they couldn't log into their accounts on a first attempt.",
      "However Mr van Kemenade argued it did not amount to an outage, as there were five million successful logins during the period of disruption.",
      "Nonetheless, the bank said it was improving its log-in infrastructure and monitoring systems following the incident.",
      "The letters from the banks revealed about 250,000 TSB customers, 196,255 from Nationwide and 60,000 from HSBC also faced disruption on that morning.",
      "The banks have paid out over \u00a3114,000 in compensation to customers so far, with Nationwide (\u00a384,341) paying the most.",
      "All the banks said there was no evidence of an increase in fraudulent activity during the disruption, and said there was also no indication that outages were more prevalent at some times - such as pay days - than at other periods.",
      "Fine and failing infrastructure",
      "The pay day outage was far from the only IT problem the banking sector has experienced.",
      "In March, it emerged that nine major banks and building societies operating in the UK accumulated at least 803 hours - the equivalent of 33 days - of tech outages in the past two years.",
      "The Treasury Committee - which has been investigating the impact of banking IT failures - compelled Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Nationwide, Santander, NatWest, Danske Bank, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank to provide the data.",
      "The report also said Barclays could now face compensation payments of \u00a312.5m following an outage there that affected customers on pay day in January.",
      "Experts including Patrick Burgess of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, and Shilpa Doreswamy, a director with GFT, a company committed to the digital transformation of the financial sector, have stated that the recent outages reveal the problems banks have with ageing infrastructure and failing IT systems.",
      "Ms Doreswamy told the BBC on Thursday that payday outages were \"not just a case of unfortunate timing\" but also predictable, preventable events.",
      "\"They've highlighted the need for banks to invest in IT modernisation to prevent the eroding of customer trust,\" she said.",
      "Not acting to reduce the possibility of downtime or frustration for customers - particularly during high-demand periods - could potentially see banks risk their reputation and losing customers, Ms Doreswamy added.",
      "\"When customers can't access their wages, pay bills or run their businesses, the impact is not just financial, it becomes deeply personal.\"",

    "story": [
      "Wikipedia is taking legal action against new Online Safety Act regulations it says could threaten the safety of its volunteer editors and their ability to keep harmful content off the site.",
      "The Wikimedia Foundation - the non-profit which supports the online encyclopaedia - is seeking a judicial review of rules which could mean Wikipedia is subjected to the toughest duties required of websites under the act.",
      "Lead counsel Phil Bradley-Schmieg said it was \"unfortunate that we must now defend the privacy and safety of Wikipedia's volunteer editors from flawed legislation\".",
      "The government told the BBC it was committed to implementing the act but could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.",
      "It's thought this is the first judicial review to be brought against the new online safety laws - albeit a narrow part of them - but experts say it may not be the last.",
      "\"The Online Safety Act is vast in scope and incredibly complex,\" Ben Packer, a partner at law firm Linklaters, told the BBC.",
      "The law would inevitably have impacts on UK citizens' freedom of expression and other human rights, so as more of it comes into force \"we can expect that more challenges may be forthcoming\", he told the BBC.",
      "These will add to the array of challenges the act already faces, from claims its burdensome rules are forcing harmless small websites to close - to those who argue the law and its enforcement are too weak and not up to the job.",
      "Why is Wikipedia unhappy?",
      "The OSA requires the regulator, Ofcom, to categorise platforms according to a number of factors, including how many users they have and what features they offer.",
      "Those designated \"Category 1\" - the highest level - will face additional duties to keep users safe.",
      "In very simple terms, sites are most likely to be classed as Category 1 if they allow millions of UK users to interact and share content with each other, and have systems that recommend content.",
      "These rules were originally designed to target the services where UK users were most likely to encounter harmful content - but Wikipedia is concerned they are so vaguely defined there is \"a significant risk\" it will be included in Category 1.",
      "If that happened, the consequences for the army of volunteers who write and edit articles could be serious and would reach beyond the UK, the Foundation argues.",
      "It has singled out additional duties which could, in effect, require the site to verify the identities of its volunteers - something it fears could expose them to data breaches, stalking, vexatious lawsuits or even imprisonment by authoritarian regimes.",
      "\"We would be forced to collect data about our contributors, and that would compromise their privacy and safety, and what that means is that people would feel less safe as contributors\", Rebecca MacKinnon the Wikimedia Foundation's vice president of global advocacy told the BBC",
      "\"We've seen in other parts of the world, when people do not feel safe contributing to Wikipedia, then they shy away from controversial topics that may be challenging to to people who are powerful, and that reduces the quality and the usefulness of the encyclopaedia\".",
      "'Outlier' services",
      "The Wikimedia Foundation stresses it is not trying to challenge the OSA in general, or the idea that there should be Category 1 services subject to additional duties.",
      "Instead, it is challenging parts of the so-called \"Categorisation Regulations\" that set out how the regulator Ofcom will decide which sites will have to follow the most stringent duties.",
      "It argues, as currently defined, they risk not only inappropriately catching sites such as Wikipedia but also missing some platforms which should be abiding by tougher rules.",
      "\"The Regulations do not just risk overregulating low risk \"outlier\" services, like Wikipedia,\" Phil Bradley-Schmieg wrote in a blog post.",

    "story": [
      "Apple is asking an appeals court to pause a US district judge's recent ruling in a case which could determine the future of its highly lucrative App Store.",
      "Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found last week the tech giant wilfully violated an order she had previously made in a case filed by Fortnite-maker Epic Games.",
      "That order - handed down in 2021 - demanded Apple refrain from anti-competitive conduct and pricing and allow outside payment options in the App Store.",
      "Last week she determined Apple was flouting that demand - a finding Apple has now called \"extraordinary.\"",
      "The iPhone maker has alleged in a court filing that her order unlawfully prevents the company from controlling \"core aspects of its business operations.\"",
      "\"A federal court cannot force Apple to permanently give away free access to its products and services, including intellectual property,\" the company's lawyers wrote.",
      "Case origins",
      "Both of Judge Gonzalez Rogers' judgements stem from an antitrust case filed by Epic Games.",
      "In 2020, Epic accused the iPhone-maker of possessing an illegal monopoly with its App Store, which collected commissions of between 15% and 30% on in-app purchases.",
      "The judge rejected Epic's monopoly claims, but found Apple was stopping developers from giving users alternative payment options in violation of California competition rules.",
      "She ordered Apple to make changes that would help developers steer customers to cheaper payment options outside of the Apple ecosystem.",
      "Last year, Epic accused Apple of failing to comply by creating a new set of fees for developers instead.",
      "In a contempt order last week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple continued to interfere with competition, saying that internal company documents showed Apple deliberately violated her 2021 injunction.",
      "'Substantial sums'",
      "On Wednesday, Apple requested an appeals court take action, including by lifting a ban that stops it from charging developers fees on purchases made outside the App Store.",
      "The company wrote that such restrictions \"will cost Apple substantial sums annually\" and are based on conduct that has not been found unlawful.",
      "\"Rather, they were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance with an earlier state-law Injunction that is itself invalid,\" Apple wrote.",
      "In response, Epic Games said Judge Gonzalez Rogers' contempt order last week was already benefitting consumers.",
      "\"Apple has faced a surge of genuine competition as developers have updated their apps with better payment methods, better deals, and better consumer choice,\" Epic wrote in a post on the social media platform X.",
      "The company criticized Apple's motion as \"a last ditch effort to block competition and extract massive junk fees at the expense of consumers and developers.\"",
      "Epic says it is on track with plans to bring Fortnite back to iPhones and iPads.",
      "Apple removed Fortnite from its App Store in 2020 after Epic unveiled an in-app payment system into the game.",
      "The move led to the current court battle between the two companies.",
      "Apple did not directly addresses Judge Gonzalez Rogers' stunning rebuke of company executives in its court filing.",
      "In her most recent order, she said CEO Tim Cook ignored executive Phillip Schiller's urging to have Apple comply with her injunction, and allowed then-Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri to convince him not to.",
      "\"Cook chose poorly,\" she wrote.",
      "The company documents she reviewed reveal \"that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option\", she wrote.",
      "Judge Gonzalez Rogers said she would refer the matter to the US Attorney for Northern District of California to investigate if a criminal contempt proceeding against Apple is appropriate.",

      "While some experts argue the unique use of AI is just another step into the future, others say it could become a slippery slope for using the technology in legal cases.",
      "His family used voice recordings, videos and pictures of Mr Pelkey, who was 37 when he was killed, to recreate him in a video using AI, his sister Stacey Wales told the BBC.",
      "Ms Wales said she wrote the words that the AI version read in court based on how forgiving she knew her brother to be.",
      "\"To Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me, it is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,\" said the AI version of Mr Pelkey in court. \"In another life, we probably could have been friends.\"",
      "\"I believe in forgiveness, and a God who forgives. I always have and I still do,\" the AI verison of Mr Pelkey - wearing a grey baseball cap - continues.",
      "The technology was used at his killer's sentencing - Horcasitas already had been found guilty by a jury - some four years after Horcasitas shot Mr Pelkey at a red light in Arizona.",

      "\"I loved that AI, thank you for that. As angry as you are, as justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness,\" Judge Lang said. \"I feel that that was genuine.\"",
      "Paul Grimm, a retired federal judge and Duke Law School professor, told the BBC he was not surprised to see AI used in the Horcasitas sentencing.",
      "Arizona courts, he notes, already have started using AI in other ways. When the state's Supreme Court issues a ruling, for example, it has an AI system that makes those rulings digestible for people.",
      "And Mr Grimm said because it was used without a jury present, just for a judge to decide sentencing, the technology was allowed.",
      "\"We'll be leaning [AI] on a case-by-case basis, but the technology is irresistible,\" he said.",
      "But some experts like Derek Leben, a business ethics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, are concerned about the use of AI and the precedent this case sets.",
      "While Mr Leben does not question this family's intention or actions, he worries not all uses of AI will be consistent with a victim's wishes.",
      "\"If we have other people doing this moving forward, are we always going to get fidelity to what the person, the victim in this case, would've wanted?\" Mr Leben asked.",
      "For Ms Wales, however, this gave her brother the final word.",
      "\"We approached this with ethics and morals because this is a powerful tool. Just like a hammer can be used to break a window or rip down a wall, it can also be used as a tool to build a house and that's how we used this technology,\" she said."

      "Nothing has convinced Sabine Zetteler of the value of using AI.",
      "\"I read a really great phrase recently that said something along the lines of 'why would I bother to read something someone couldn't be bothered to write' and that is such a powerful statement and one that aligns absolutely with my views.\"",
      "Ms Zetteler runs her own London-based communications agency, with around 10 staff, some full-time some part-time.",
      "\"What's the point of sending something we didn't write, reading a newspaper written by bots, listening to a song created by AI, or me making a bit more money by sacking my administrator who has four kids?",
      "\"Where's the joy, love or aspirational betterment even just for me as a founder in that? It means nothing to me,\" she says.",
      "Ms Zetteler is among those resisting the AI invasion, which really got going with the launch of ChatGPT at the end of 2022.",
      "Since then the service, and its many rivals have become wildly popular. ChatGPT is racking up over five billion visits a month, according to software firm Semrush.",
      "But training AI systems like ChatGPT requires huge amounts of energy and, once trained, keeping them running is also energy intensive.",
      "While it's difficult to quantify the electricity used by AI, a report by Goldman Sachs estimated that a ChatGPT query uses nearly 10 times as much electricity as a Google search query.",
      "That makes some people uncomfortable.",
      "For Florence Achery, owner of Yoga Retreats & More, the environmental impact is one reason why she vows to stay away from AI.",
      "\"My initial reaction was that AI is soulless and is a contradiction with my business, which is all about human connection,\" says Achery, based in London.",
      "\"However, I found out that the environmental impact was awful with all the energy consumption required to run the data centres. I don't think that people are aware of that.\"",
      "While Ms Zetteler admits she respects AI for all the social good it can achieve, she says she's concerned about the wider impact on society.",
      "\"I'm happy that AI exists for blind people if they can have articles translated by AI and anything that is truly beneficial. But in general, I don't think it will benefit us long-term.\"",
      "Is she worried it might have a knock-on effect on her business, especially if rival companies are using AI?",
      "\"Like everything, I could save money by sending our agency to Milan on EasyJet flights rather than the train.",
      "\"Already my profit margins look unsuccessful if that's how you measure success, but how about if you measure success by how much you're contributing to society and how well you sleep?\"",
      "Sierra Hansen, who lives in Seattle and works in public affairs, also refuses to use AI. For her, she's concerned that the use of AI is harming our ability to problem solve.",
      "\"Our brain is the thing that helps organise what our days look like, not going to AI Copilot and asking it to tell it how to manage my schedule.",
      "\"Our job as a human is to apply critical thinking skills, and if you are feeding simple tasks into ChatGPT then you're not solving on your own. It's doing the thinking for you. If I want to listen to music, I don't need AI to create the perfect punk rock album for me.\"",
      "But not everyone has the luxury of opting out of AI.",
      "Jackie Adams (not her real name), who works in digital marketing, resisted AI initially on environmental grounds, and because she thought using it was lazy.",
      "\"I heard about the energy needed to power data centres and the amount of land they take up, and it didn't sit right with me. I didn't understand why we needed it,\" she says.",
      "However, about a year ago her three colleagues at the marketing firm she works for started adopting AI, for tasks such as copywriting and idea generation.",
      "Six months ago Ms Adams had to follow them, after being told she had to cut her budget.",
      "\"Then it was out my control,\" she says. She feels that continuing to resist would have hurt her career.",
      "\"I started playing with it a bit more after reading job descriptions asking for AI experience. I recently realised that if I don't implement it into my ways of working, I'm going to get left behind.\"",
      "Now, she says, she doesn't view tapping into AI as laziness anymore.",
      "\"It can elevate my work and make some things better,\" adding that she uses it to refine copywriting work and for editing photos.",
      "The moment to opt out of AI has already passed, says James Brusseau, a philosophy professor specialising in AI ethics at Pace University in New York.",
      "\"If you want to know why a decision is made, we will need humans. If we don't care about that, then we will probably use AI,\" he says.",
      "\"So, we will have human judges for criminal cases, and human doctors to make decisions about who should get the transplant. But, weather forecasting will be gone soon, and anesthesiology too,\" says Prof Brusseau.",
      "Ms Adam has accepted using AI at work, but she still feels despondent about AI's growing influence.",
      "\"Even when you do a Google search it includes an AI overview, while some emails have a topline summary, So now it almost feels like we have no control. How do I turn all that off? It's snowballing.\"",

      "In her case, it was her husband when one of them was on a work trip.",
      "Following his death in 2017, Skype took on another role for Erica, who spoke to the BBC anonymously.",
      "\"I was clearing out his files to decommission his work computer,\" she told BBC News.",

      "In a dramatic overnight operation, India said it launched missile and air strikes on  nine sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, targeting what it called militant positions based on \"credible intelligence\".",
      "The strikes, lasting just 25 minutes between 01:05 and 01:30 India time (19:35 and 20:00 GMT on Tuesday), sent shockwaves through the region, with residents jolted awake by thunderous explosions.",
      "Pakistan said only six locations were hit and claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and a drone - a claim India has not confirmed.",
      "Islamabad said 26 people were killed and 46 injured in Indian air strikes and shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, India's army reported that 10 civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.",

      "What we know about the air strikes",
      "This sharp escalation comes after last month's deadly militant attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, pushing tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals to dangerous new heights. India says it has clear evidence linking Pakistan-based terrorists and external actors to the attack - a claim Pakistan flatly denies. Islamabad has also pointed out that India has not offered any evidence to support its claim.",
      "Does this attack mark a new escalation?",
      "In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the LoC.",
      "In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.",
      "Experts say the retaliation for the Pahalgam attack stands out for its broader scope, targeting the infrastructure of three major Pakistan-based militant groups simultaneously.",
      "India says it struck nine militant targets across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, hitting deep into key hubs of Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen.",
      "Among the closest targets were two camps in Sialkot, just 6-18km from the border, according to an Indian spokesperson.",
      "The deepest hit, says India, was a Jaish-e-Mohammed headquarters in Bahawalpur, 100km inside Pakistan. A LeT camp in Muzaffarabad, 30km from the LoC and capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was linked to recent attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, the spokesperson said.",
      "Pakistan says six locations have been hit, but denies allegations of there being terror camps.",
      "\"What's striking this time is the expansion of India's targets beyond past patterns. Previously, strikes like Balakot focused on Pakistan-administered Kashmir across the Line of Control - a militarised boundary,\" Srinath Raghavan, a Delhi-based historian, told the BBC.",
      "\"This time, India has hit into Pakistan's Punjab, across the International Border, targeting terrorist infrastructure, headquarters, and known locations in Bahawalpur and Muridke linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. They've also struck Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen assets. This suggests a broader, more geographically expansive response, signalling that multiple groups are now in India's crosshairs - and sending a wider message,\" he says.",
      "The India-Pakistan International Border is the officially recognised boundary separating the two countries, stretching from Gujarat to Jammu.",
      "Ajay Bisaria, a former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, told the BBC that what India did was a \"Balakot plus response meant to establish deterrence, targeting known terrorist hubs, but accompanied by a strong de-escalatory message\".",
      "\"These strikes were more precise, targeted and more visible than in the past. Therefore, [they are] less deniable by Pakistan,\" Mr Bisaria says.",
      "Indian sources say the strikes were aimed at \"re-establishing deterrence\".",
      "\"The Indian government thinks that the deterrence established in 2019 has worn thin and needs to be re-established,\" says Prof Raghavan.",
      "\"This seems to mirror Israel's doctrine that deterrence requires periodic, repeated strikes. But if we assume that hitting back alone will deter terrorism, we risk giving Pakistan every incentive to retaliate - and that can quickly spiral out of control.\"",
      "Could this spiral into a broader conflict?",
      "The majority of experts agree that a retaliation from Pakistan is inevitable - and diplomacy will come into play.",
      "\"Pakistan's response is sure to come. The challenge would be to manage the next level of escalation. This is where crisis diplomacy will matter,\" says Mr Bisaria.",
      "\"Pakistan will be getting advice to exercise restraint. But the key will be the diplomacy after the Pakistani response to ensure that both countries don't rapidly climb the ladder of escalation.\"",
      "India and Pakistan are in crisis again - here's how they de-escalated in the past",
      "India and Pakistan are in crisis again - here's how they de-escalated in the past",
      "Pakistan-based experts like Ejaz Hussain, a Lahore-based political and military analyst, say Indian surgical strikes targeting locations such as Muridke and Bahawalpur were \"largely anticipated given the prevailing tensions\".",
      "Dr Hussain believes retaliatory strikes are likely.",
      "\"Given the Pakistani military's media rhetoric and stated resolve to settle the scores, retaliatory action, possibly in the form of surgical strikes across the border, appears likely in the coming days,\" he told the BBC.",
      "But Dr Hussain worries that surgical strikes on both sides could \"escalate into a limited conventional war\".",
      "Christopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US believes given the scale of India's strikes, \"visible damage at key sites\", and reported casualties, Pakistan is highly likely to retaliate.",
      "\"Doing otherwise essentially would give India permission to strike Pakistan whenever Delhi feels aggrieved and would run contrary to the Pakistan military's commitment to retaliating with 'quid pro quo plus',\" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia, told the BBC.",
      "\"Given India's stated targets of groups and facilities associated with terrorism and militancy in India, I think it is likely - but far from certain - that Pakistan will confine itself to attacks on Indian military targets,\" he said.",
      "Despite the rising tensions, some experts still hold out hope for de-escalation.",
      "\"There is a decent chance we escape this crisis with just one round of reciprocal standoff strikes and a period of heightened firing along the Line of Control,\" says Mr Clary.",
      "However, the risk of further escalation remains high, making this the \"most dangerous\" India-Pakistan crisis since 2002 - and even more perilous than the 2016 and 2019 standoffs, he adds.",
      "Is Pakistani retaliation now inevitable?",
      "Experts in Pakistan note that despite a lack of war hysteria leading up to India's strike, the situation could quickly shift.",
      "\"We have a deeply fractured political society, with the country's most popular leader behind bars. Imran Khan's imprisonment triggered a strong anti-military public backlash,\" says Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst and a former correspondent of Jane's Defence Weekly.",
      "\"Today, the Pakistani public is far less eager to support the military compared to 2016 or 2019 - the usual wave of war hysteria is noticeably absent. But if public opinion shifts in central Punjab where anti-India feelings are more prevalent, we could see increased civilian pressure on the military to take action. And the military will regain popularity because of this conflict.\"",
      "Dr Hussain echoes a similar sentiment.",
      "\"I believe the current standoff with India presents an opportunity for the Pakistani military to regain public support, particularly from the urban middle classes who have recently criticised it for perceived political interference,\" he says.",
      "\"The military's active defence posture is already being amplified through mainstream and social media, with some outlets claiming that six or seven Indian jets were shot down.",
      "\"Although these claims warrant independent verification, they serve to bolster the military's image among segments of the public that conventionally rally around national defence narratives in times of external threat.\"",
      "Can India and Pakistan step back from the brink?",
      "India is once again walking a fine line between escalation and restraint.",
      "Shortly after the attack in Pahalgam, India swiftly retaliated by closing the main border crossing, suspending a water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals. Troops on both sides have exchanged small-arms fire, and India barred all Pakistani aircraft from its airspace, mirroring Pakistan's earlier move. In response, Pakistan suspended a 1972 peace treaty and took its own retaliatory measures.",
      "This mirrors India's actions after the 2019 Pulwama attack, when it swiftly revoked Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, imposed heavy tariffs and suspended key trade and transport links.",
      "The crisis had escalated when India launched air strikes on Balakot, followed by retaliatory Pakistani air raids and the capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, further heightening tensions. However, diplomatic channels eventually led to a de-escalation, with Pakistan releasing the pilot in a goodwill gesture.",
      "\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience,\" Mr Bisaria told me last week."

      "\"Not even in my wildest imagination did I think this would happen,\" said Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David, describing the day he found out that he had been appointed a cardinal.",
      "He was speaking to the BBC at his cathedral in Caloocan, on the outskirts of the Philippine capital Manila. He was leaving the next day for Rome to join the conclave, one of three cardinals from the country who will take part in choosing the next pope.",
      "\"Normally you would expect archbishops to become cardinals, but I am only a humble bishop of a little diocese where the majority of the people are slum dwellers, urban poor, you know.",
      "\"But I thought just maybe, for Pope Francis, it mattered that we had more cardinals who are really grounded there.\"",
      "Cardinal David has only been in the job for five months, after his surprise elevation last December. But in some ways he personifies the late pontiff's legacy in his country.",
      "Pope Francis had set himself the goal of bringing a Catholic church he believed had lost its common touch, back closer to the people.",

      "Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
      "'Grandpa Francis': A nation remembers the Pope who braved a typhoon for them",
      "The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia, nearly 80% of its 100 million people, and the third-largest in the world.",
      "It's one reason why Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle is believed to be a papabile, or frontrunner to replace Pope Francis \u2013 Tagle was also talked of as a contender in the last papal conclave 12 years ago.",
      "The country is considered a bright spot for the Roman Catholic church, where faith is strong, its rituals woven into the fabric of society.",
      "Yet the church is facing headwinds there. Its doctrines on divorce and family planning are being challenged by politicians, and newer charismatic churches are winning converts.",
      "Pope Francis helped restore morale in the Philippines church, though he did not offer answers to these challenges beyond being more welcoming of diversity and urging the clergy to be more responsive to the needs of the poor.",
      "But those on the activist wing of the church did feel encouraged by his support.",
      "For Cardinal David that support was critical when he faced his greatest test, during the war on drugs declared by former President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016.",
      "He took me to see a plaque he had erected in front of his cathedral in memory of Kian Delos Santos, a 17 year-old boy from his diocese who was gunned down by police in August 2017.",
      "Kian was just one of many thousands who died in Duterte's campaign \u2013 estimates range from 6,300 to 30,000. What made his case different from most was that the usual police justification, that he was armed and had resisted arrest, was contradicted by eyewitnesses and security camera videos.",
      "The police officers had murdered him as he pleaded for his life. Three officers were eventually convicted of the murder, a rare instance of accountability in the drug war.",
      "The cardinal is still visibly affected by the hundreds of killings that happened in his diocese \u2013 a cluster of low-income neighbourhoods typical of the areas targeted by the police in their notorious tokhang, or \"knock and plead\" raids, against alleged drug dealers and users.",
      "\"It was just too much seeing dead bodies left and right,\" Cardinal David says.",
      "\"And you know, when I would ask people what they thought, you know, why these people were targeted. They said they're drug users. I said, so what? So what? Who told you that just because people use drugs, they deserve to die?\"",
      "He began offering sanctuary to those who feared they were on police hit lists, and then drug-rehabilitation programmes, in the hope this might protect them.",
      "He also did something the church as a whole did not do for several months: he openly criticised the drug war as illegal and immoral.",
      "As a result, he received many death threats. President Duterte accused him of taking drugs, and talked about decapitating him. The government also filed sedition charges against him, though these were eventually dropped.",
      "In those difficult years Cardinal David found he had a powerful backer, in Rome.",
      "On a visit to the city in 2019 Pope Francis had taken him aside to give him a special blessing, saying he knew what was happening in his diocese and urging him to stay safe.",
      "When they met again in 2023, and he reminded the Pope that he was still alive, he says the pontiff laughed and told him: \"You have not been called to martyrdom yet!\"",
      "The role of the Roman Catholic church in the Philippines has changed over its 500-year history in the archipelago.",
      "It was closely associated with the Spanish conquest, Spanish friars acting as de facto colonial administrators and the church becoming a big landowner. When the US replaced Spain as the colonial ruler in 1898, enforcing a separation of church and state, the political influence of the Catholic clergy waned.",
      "But the church retained the allegiance of most of the population; even today, after inroads made by charismatic protestant churches, nearly 80% of Filipinos identify as Roman Catholic.",
      "Since independence in 1946 the church has had an uneasy relationship with power. Its deep roots and establishment status have made it an influential player, wooed by political factions but also needing their support to protect its interests.",
      "Attitudes began changing in the 1970s and 80s, the time when a young Pablo David and many other senior church figures today were studying to enter the priesthood.",
      "This was the era of \"liberation theology\", which came out of Latin America and argued that it was the duty of the clergy to fight against the pervasive poverty and injustice all around them.",
      "When then-President Marcos, father of the current president of the Philippines, declared martial law in 1972 and began jailing and killing his critics, some priests even went underground to join the armed resistance.",
      "But the church hierarchy continued what it called \"critical collaboration\" with the Marcos dictatorship.",
      "That changed dramatically in February 1986, when the then-Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Jaime Sin, called on people to come out on the streets and oppose Marcos, sparking the famous \"people power\" uprising which deposed the president.",
      "Cardinal Sin would reprise that role in 2001 when he helped overthrow another beleaguered president, Joseph Estrada.",
      "After that, though, church leaders were accused of cosying up to Estrada's successor, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, partly to gain her support in opposing growing political and social pressure to expand access to family planning and legalise divorce.",
      "And they were reluctant to condemn President Duterte's drug war because, despite the appalling human cost, it remained popular with the Filipino public, at least away from the poorer areas where the killings took place.",
      "Nearly 40 years after its pivotal role in overthrowing the Marcos regime, the church's influence once again seems to be waning, as it did a century ago.",
      "For instance, the Church's fervent opposition could not prevent the Philippines Congress from passing the Reproductive Health Law of 2012 that made family planning easily accessible.",
      "This is despite the fact that many Filipino Catholics remain conservative on issues like gender and divorce, says Jayeel Cornelio, a sociologist who has written extensively on Catholicism in the Philippines.",
      "The church's defeat over family planning, he says, is indicative of its diminished sway over national politics.",
      "\"The Catholic church was practically sidelined during the Duterte presidency. When Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos ran for president in 2022, many Catholic leaders and institutions expressed their dissent and even endorsed the opposition. But Marcos still won.\"",
      "Many Filipinos welcome this, including, it seems, Cardinal David.",
      "\"It is not the business of the church to govern, neither is it the business of government to run a church\", he said.",
      "\"But we can complement one another - I cannot say we will be apolitical. So long as we stick to our role as a moral and spiritual leader, we can give guidance, even about political and economic matters.\"",
      "Even that more limited view of the church's proper role, though, has run into opposition.",
      "Thirteen years after overcoming ecclesiastical objections to the Reproductive Health Bill, the Philippines Congress is now trying to get a bill passed which would legalise divorce, something else the church disagrees with.",
      "\"I do not expect them to change their official doctrine, but in my job as a lawmaker, I try to address the problems that Filipinos face, and I don't want them to meddle in my work. It is against our constitution to legislate in favour of any religion,\" says Geraldine Roman, the first transgender member of Congress in the Philippines.",
      "A practicing Catholic, she credits Pope Francis with creating a more welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ people with his \"who am I to judge\" statement.",
      "\"Nobody misgenders me in my church now,\" she says.",
      "But she objects to the Catholic church lobbying against the divorce bill, which she argues will free thousands of Filipino women trapped in abusive marriages.",
      "\"The church is free to try to indoctrinate Catholics into sticking it out in their marriages. But in the end, it is the decision of the couple, and not even the church can meddle in that decision.\"",
      "Other challenges include a congregation which is increasingly disengaged. While the number of Roman Catholics has fallen only slightly in the past three decades, the number attending mass at least once a week has dropped by half, to just over one third of those surveyed recently.",
      "Then there are the various scandals associated with the Catholic church, especially the sexual abuse of minors, which critics say Pope Francis, while he did tackle the issue, did not do enough to address.",
      "Cardinal David recalled how President Duterte \"loved to wave\" a book called \"Altar of Secrets\", an expose of alleged scandals in the Filipino church, and how he would say, \"oh, those hypocrites. Don't listen to them. They don't practice what they what they preach. They are abusers. I must say some people swallowed it hook, line and sinker. So I am not surprised that our moral credibility has been challenged.\"",
      "But, he adds, defensiveness is not the way the Church can win back its credibility.",

      "Sorting is the first task for this new link in the long chain from crime to justice in Syria. A \"mixed mass grave\" means that corpses were thrown one on top of another.",
      "The chances are, these bones belong to some of the hundreds of thousands believed to have been killed by the regimes of the ousted president Bashar al-Assad and his father, Hafez, who together ruled Syria for more than five decades.",
      "If so, says Dr al-Hourani, they were among the more recent victims: they died no more than a year ago.",
      "Dr al-Hourani is a forensic odontologist: teeth can tell you so much more about a body, he says, at least when it comes to identifying who the person was.",
      "But with a femur the lab workers in the basement of this squat grey office building in Damascus can begin the task: they can learn the height, the sex, the age, what sort of job they had; they might also be able to see whether the victim was tortured.",
      "The gold standard in identification is of course DNA analysis. But, he says, there is just one DNA testing centre in Syria. Many were destroyed during the country's civil war. And \"because of sanctions, a lot of the precursor chemicals that we need for the tests are currently not available\".",
      "They've also been informed that \"parts of the instruments could be used for aviation and so for military purposes\". In other words, they could be deemed \"dual use\", and so proscribed by many Western countries from export to Syria.",
      "Add to that, the cost: $250 (\u00a3187) for a single test. And, says Dr al-Hourani, \"in a mixed mass grave, you have to do about 20 tests to gather all the parts of one body\". The lab relies entirely on funding from the International Committee of the Red Cross.",

He had persuaded Abu Ali to join us, to bear witness to what Mouaz calls \"the worst crimes of the 21st Century\".",
      "Abu Ali transported lorry loads of corpses to multiple sites for more than 10 years. At this location, he came, on average, twice a week for roughly two years at the start of the demonstrations and then the war, between 2011 and 2013.",
      "The routine was always the same. He'd head to a military or security installation. \"I had a 16m (52ft) trailer. It wasn't always filled to the brim. But I'd have, I guess, an average of 150 to 200 bodies in each load.\"",
      "Of his cargo, he says he is convinced they were civilians. Their bodies were \"mangled and tortured\". The only identification he could see were numbers written on the cadaver or stuck to the chest or forehead. The numbers identified where they had died.",
      "There were a lot, he said, from \"215\" - a notorious military intelligence detention centre in Damascus known as \"Branch 215\". It is a place we will re-visit in this story.",
      "Abu Ali's trailer did not have a hydraulic lift to tip and dump his load. When he backed up to a trench, soldiers would pull the bodies into the hole one after another. Then a front-loader tractor would \"flatten them out, compress them in, fill in the grave.\"",
      "Three men with weathered faces from a neighbouring village have arrived. They corroborate the story of the regular visits by military lorries to this remote spot.",

      "\"They broke his arms and beat his back,\" says his mother. \"He spent three days unconscious in hospital.\"",
      "Mohammed went AWOL again. \"I reported him missing,\" says Malak. \"But I was hiding him.\"",
      "In May 2012, 19-year-old's Mohammed luck ran out. He was caught along with a group of friends. They were shot. Malak says there was no formal notification. But she has always assumed he was killed.",
      "Six months later, Mohammed's younger brother Maher was dragged from school by officers. It was Maher's second arrest. He'd gone to the protests in 2011, aged 14. That had led to his first arrest. When he was let out of detention, a month later, he was in his underwear, covered, says his mother, in cigarette burns, wounds and lice. \"He was terrified.\"",
      "Malak thinks Maher was disappeared from school in 2012 because the authorities had found that she had been hiding his older brother. Now, for the first time in 13 years, Malak returns to that school, desperate to get any clue about what happened to Maher.",
      "The new headteacher produces a couple of battered red ledgers. Malak traces the rows of names with her finger, and then finds her son's name. December 2012, the record flatly states: Maher has been excluded from school because he has failed to turn up for lessons for two weeks.",
      "There is no explanation that it is the state which has disappeared him. There is something else, though: a folder with Maher's school records has been found. Its cover is adorned with a photograph of a wise Bashar al-Assad, gazing thoughtfully into the distance. Malak picks up a pen from the headteacher's desk and scribbles over the photo. Six months ago, that gesture could have been lethal.",
      "For years, the only scraps Malak had to cling to were two men who say they saw Maher in \"Branch 215\" - that same military detention centre which produced so many corpses for Abu Ali to transport.",
      "One of the witnesses told Malak that her boy had told him something about his parents that, his mother says, only he could have known. It was definitely him. \"He asked this man to tell me he was doing fine.\" Malak heaves and leaks tears, stuffs a tattered tissue into the corners of her eyes.",
      "For Malak, like so many Syrians, the fall of Assad was not just a day of joy, but of hope. \"I thought there was a 90% chance Maher would walk out of prison. I was waiting for him.\"",

      "Moving back to Ivory Coast in 2022 after more than two decades in global finance, Thiam had immediately been seen as a potential contender to succeed current head of state Alassane Ouattara who, at 83, is now in the final year of his third term of office.",
      "A scion of a traditional noble family and a great nephew of the country's revered founding President, F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, he had impressed as a top government official and minister in the 1990s, overseeing infrastructure development and radical economic reforms.",
      "A military coup then pushed Thiam to seek a fresh career abroad, which culminated in high-profile stints as chief executive of UK insurance giant Prudential and then the banking group Credit Suisse.",
      "But returning home at last, three years ago, he embarked on a steady advance towards the next Ivorian presidential election.",
      "After the death in 2023 of former President Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9, long-serving leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI), Thiam was perfectly positioned to take his place and then on 17 April this year he was chosen as the party's candidate for the upcoming presidential race.",
      "That was no guarantee of victory, and especially if - as seems quite plausible Ouattara opts to run for a fourth term, backed by all the assets and advantages of incumbency and a track record of four successive years of annual economic growth above 6%.",
      "However, Thiam stood out as the prime alternative.",
      "As an opponent of the ruling Rally of Houphou\u00ebtists for Democracy and Peace (RHDP), he offered Ivorian voters the chance to change their government.",
      "Yet with his centrist politics and solid technocratic credentials, his candidacy offered reassuring competence and the prospect of continuing the impressive economic progress that Ouattara has piloted since 2011.",
      "Now that potential trajectory is blocked. If the court decision stands - and Ivorian law offers no option of appeal for this particular issue - Thiam will be out of October's contest.",
      "It is a race from which past court convictions have already excluded three other prominent opposition figures - former President Laurent Gbagbo, former Prime Minister Guillaume Soro and a former minister, Charles Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9 - all central actors in the political crises and civil conflicts that brutally paralysed the progress of Ivory Coast between 1999 and 2011.",
      "The prospect now is that Ouattara or any chosen RHDP successor candidate will approach the election without facing any heavyweight political challenge.",
      "That can only deepen Ivorians' already widespread popular disillusionment with the country's political establishment.",
      "This is against the wider context of a West Africa where the radical anti-politics rhetoric of the soldiers who have seized power in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger already finds a sympathetic audience among many disenchanted young people.",
      "That really matters in societies where, typically, three-quarters of the population is under 35.",
      "Amidst this crisis for West African democracy, there have been some moments of encouragement.",
      "In Liberia in 2023 and in Senegal and Ghana last year, incumbent governments were voted out, in free and fair elections whose results were accepted by all contestants without argument.",
      "The Senegalese result, in particular, owed much to the massive enthusiastic mobilisation of young people.",
      "Many hoped that Ivory Coast could offer a further positive example of democratic choice and the offer of change, and an example that might be all the more influential because the country is a prosperous regional powerhouse.",
      "It is the economic engine of the CFA franc single currency bloc and besides the cocoa industry, it is also a key hub for business services and finance and a leading political voice in the regional grouping, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas).",
      "What happens in Ivory Coast really matters and is widely noticed, across West Africa and indeed, also right across francophone Africa more generally.",
      "Ouattara is one of the continent's most prominent statesmen, commanding broad respect internationally too.",
      "And yet now the run-up to the country's crucial next presidential election has become ensnared in a return version of the identity politics that so soured the bitter disputes and instability of the 1990s and 2000s.",
      "Back then, the governments of first B\u00e9di\u00e9 and then Gbagbo used the contentious \"ivoirit\u00e9\", meaning \"Ivorian-ness\" law to shut Ouattara out of standing for the presidency on the grounds that his family allegedly had foreign origins.",
      "It was only in 2007 that the government scrapped the ban on his candidacy and only in 2016 - when he was already in office - that a new constitution at last ended the requirement that the stated parents of presidential candidates be native-born Ivorians.",
      "The poisonous mobilisation of identity issues had been a major contributing factor to the civil wars, street violence and northern separatist partition that brutally scarred Ivory Coast for more than a decade, up to 2011, at a cost of thousands of lives.",
      "Today the country feels far from such large-scale conflict.",
      "There is no popular appetite for a return to confrontation and politicians are staying well away from the incendiary rhetoric of the past.",
      "But the Thiam saga shows how identity issues, even in a more legalistic form and in this hopefully more peaceful era, can still weigh heavily.",
      "Ivory Coast only permits dual nationality under certain limited conditions.",
      "So in its 22 April ruling, an Abidjan court declared that, under the terms of a little-used post-independence law, Thiam had automatically lost his Ivorian citizenship almost four decades ago when he acquired French nationality - after several years' study in Paris.",
      "Although he officially surrendered that this February, and thus automatically recovered his original citizenship, this was too late for inclusion on this year's register of eligible voters or candidates.",
      "In vain, his lawyers had argued that, through his father, Thiam had French nationality from birth - which, if accepted, would exempt him from the dual nationality ban.",
      "Seeking to highlight the absurdity and inconsistencies of the situation, he argued that, logically, the country should now hand back its prized 2024 Africa Cup of Nations football title because many of the players also have French nationality.",
      "\"If we apply the law the way [that] they just applied it to me, we have to give the cup back to Nigeria - because half of the team was not Ivorian,\" he told the BBC.",
      "And Thursday could bring yet another setback in a scheduled court hearing where a judge may now rule that Thiam cannot, as a non-national, lead the PDCI.",
      "The past two weeks have seen continuing political and legal debate over this whole saga, with the Thiam camp hoping that a combination of popular pressure and discreet political negotiation will lead to a compromise that lets him back into the presidential race, perhaps along with the other excluded contenders.",
      "And Ouattara, should he chose not to run, might want to safeguard his impressive track record and secure his international reputation by intervening with some kind of deal that allows Thiam to run.",
      "With months to go before the polls, there is still time for that. But no-one is counting on it.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxg6x2vv4o",
    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 22:45:28 GMT",
    "summary": "It was the opposition leader's home state that delivered Labor its win, with the red wave taking out his own seat.",
    "story": [
      "For the past three years, when peers of Australia's former Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton were grilled over his divisive persona, they'd often profess his celebrity status in the north.",
      "\"Peter is one of us\u2026 He's very popular in Queensland,\" said the leader of the Nationals, the Liberal's coalition partner, earlier this year.",
      "But on election night, it was Dutton's home state that delivered Labor its election win, with the red landslide ousting the veteran MP from his own seat of Dickson.",
      "While votes are still being counted, Labor could pick up as many electorates in Queensland as it did across every other state and territory combined.",
      "And that's thanks, in no small part, to a new bloc of young voters and women who are disillusioned with the Coalition, and attribute the party's emphatic loss to the \"Dutton effect\".",
      "As 65-year-old coalition voter Sue, who didn't share her last name, bluntly puts it: \"This is where [Dutton's] from\u2026 People know him and they don't like him.\"",
      "Losing the heartland",
      "The Moreton Bay region, about an hour north of Brisbane, is supposed to be Dutton heartland. Before Australia's federal election on 3 May, all three seats here were Liberal-held - though only by small leads, with Dutton's electorate of Dickson having the narrowest in the state.",
      "Dutton's family have deep roots here, with his dairy farming great-grandparents having settled in the area in the 1860s.",
      "When he first entered parliament 24 years ago, the region was made up of urban pockets and industrial estates surrounded by swathes of semi-rural land. Not quite metropolitan or rural, is how the former police officer described it in his maiden speech as MP.",
      "Now Brisbane is one of the fastest growing cities in Australia, and these outer northern suburbs are one of the main places it is squeezing people in. Residential development has exploded, and more  families, priced out of locations closer to the city, have moved in to Moreton Bay.",
      "Full of the \"quiet Australians\" Dutton said would deliver him the election, outer-suburban neighbourhoods like these were at the heart of the Coalition's strategy.",
      "The average household in Moreton Bay earns less than both the state and national average, with many of them relying on the health, trade and hospitality sectors for work. The Coalition hoped promises to cut fuel expenses, improve housing affordability and back small businesses would woo voters concerned about the cost of living.",
      "Many Moreton Bay residents, like campaign volunteer Kenneth King, also felt Dutton's links to the area would give them a boost.",
      "\"I've known Peter Dutton for a lot of years,\" the Dickson local told the BBC on polling day. \"He's always been someone of high character, serious about effective policies and a lot of empathy for ordinary Australians.\"",
      "\"He's very well respected in the community\u2026 People know him.\"",
      "But there's a difference between being well known and well liked, says Aleysha, a swing voter in the neighbouring electorate of Petrie, who declined to give her surname.",
      "\"I don't know whether he appeals to the everyday person,\" the 26-year-old nurse says. \"He doesn't put himself in the people's shoes.\"",
      "Her vote over the years has gone to a range of parties from right across the political spectrum \u2013 except the Greens, she adds with a quick laugh.",
      "\"I don't sit with any party. Being a Christian, it's whatever party aligns closest to my values,\" she says, adding that the future of her two young children is the other major consideration.",
      "This election, that meant her vote went to Coalition incumbent Luke Howarth, who she knows personally from her church.",
      "But while she's praying for a miracle, with the final votes still being counted, she's not surprised to find Howarth may be on his way out.",
      "She says Labor ran very visible campaigns in the area, but tells the BBC that it was driving past the image of Howarth and his leader on billboards which stuck in her mind.",
      "\"Unfortunately I think that's what did it,\" she says.",
      "\"Peter Dutton's face behind him was a huge turnoff - for me personally too.\"",
      "Sue, who lives in the same electorate and is generally a conservative voter, says this election she was torn at the ballot box.",
      "\"I had a huge hesitation over it,\" she says. \"I don't like Albanese; I think he's like, weak.",
      "\"[But] Dutton's an unattractive personality... He thinks he's presenting himself as strong, but he presents himself as a bit of a bully.\"",
      "\"Way back when, he seemed like a really good local member, but as he climbed the ladder, I don't know, something changed.\"",
      "Ultimately Sue also voted for Howarth - and she's similarly convinced Dutton lost him the seat.",
      "\"I spoke to a few friends\u2026 some did change their votes because of Peter Dutton,\" she says. \"People, rightly or wrongly, aligned Dutton with Trump. And that's very negative for just about any sane person.\"",
      "Many of the constituents the BBC spoke to stressed they did not want American style politics here.",
      "He wanted to be Australia's PM. But a 'Trump effect' thwarted Peter Dutton",
      "Peter Dutton: The ex-cop who took Australia's opposition to the brink",
      "Drew Cutler grew up in the seat of Longman, which shares borders with both Dickson and Petrie - and though he no longer lives in the area, the 28-year-old was so invested in the outcome he came back to campaign for Labor.",
      "Won by Coalition MP Terry Young on a margin of 3% last election, it is now too close to call.",
      "Mr Cutler, a former Labor party staffer, believes Labor ran very strong local campaigns. But he also thinks Dutton's policy flip-flopping and the aura of instability that projected was potent.",
      "That included announcing, and then walking back, public service job cuts and plans to end work-from-home arrangements, as well as a fluctuating stance on electric vehicle taxes.",
      "Such optics were especially damaging, Mr Cutler argues, when contrasted with the image of strong, decisive leadership Dutton tries to convey.",
      "\"I almost think the Australian people would have respected him more if he stuck to it\u2026 and said, 'This is what I'm putting forward - if you don't like it, don't vote for it',\" Mr Cutler tells the BBC.",
      "Australia PM Albanese makes stunning comeback with landslide win",
      "Back in Dickson, Rick - a retiree and fresh Liberal Party member - said on election night that he also felt confusion played a role in the party's defeat, particularly among young people.",
      "\"I think people couldn't understand Dutton's policies,\" he said.",
      "But 30-year-old April, who didn't provide her last name, says it is Dutton who didn't understand.",
      "She can't remember a time when he wasn't in power in Dickson, and feels that over time he has lost touch with his own constituents and the country more broadly.",
      "For her, the last straw was his instrumental role in the defeat of the Voice to Parliament referendum, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them.",
      "\"I think he has caused a lot of harm to a lot of minority groups across the scale,\" she says.",
      "For others in the electorate though, the last straw was watching Dutton fly to a fundraiser in Sydney as the area in and around Dickson was hit by Cyclone Alfred in February.",
      "April didn't feel like Labor Party's offering was strong either, especially on climate action, so she decided to campaign for Ellie Smith, the so-called 'teal' independent running in the seat.",
      "Disappointment - borderline embarrassment - that Dutton was from her local area had crystallised into determination: \"I felt like it was a duty in a way\u2026 our responsibility to get him out.\"",
      "Ultimately, the Coalition lost at least six seats to Labor in Queensland \u2013 all bar one in Brisbane. And while they are a few votes ahead in Longman as the count continues, they could still lose that too.",
      "Wildcard Queensland",
      "Queensland has long been a bit of a political wildcard, and often finds itself in the \"spotlight\" at federal elections, says Frank Mols.",
      "The University of Queensland politics lecturer points out the state helped deliver Kevin Rudd's historic election win in 2007 and Scott Morrison's \"miracle\" victory in 2019. Last election, as a record number of people across the nation voted for candidates outside the two major parties, Queensland surprised the nation by giving the Greens three seats - up from none.",
      "There are a couple of factors that make the state more \"volatile\" and likely to deliver upsets, Dr Mols says.",
      "Firstly, it is the only state or territory, except for the island of Tasmania, where more than half of the population live outside the capital city of Brisbane.",
      "\"We talk about Queensland always being two elections, one in the south-east corner, and then the rest - and they often get very different patterns.\"",
      "There's also more political fragmentation in the state, Dr Mols says, which combined with Australia's preferential voting system can make political equations here tighter, and trends harder to predict.",
      "But he \u2013 like many of the voters the BBC spoke to \u2013 largely puts last weekend's surprise for the Coalition down to Dutton and his broadly-criticised campaign performance.",
      "While there's a tendency to attribute success or failure to policy issues, more often its really about voters' emotional response to candidates and leaders, Dr Mols says.",
      "\"If you do the barbecue test, is Dutton a person you would walk up to? Is he somebody you would warm to or gravitate towards?",
      "\"You can wonder: was Peter Dutton, in hindsight, the Labor Party's best asset?\"",
      "But Dutton may have had the opposite effect for the Greens Party, which has lost at least two of the three seats it gained in Brisbane in 2022. Their party leader, Adam Bandt, also appears to have been defeated in Melbourne, an electorate he'd held for 15 years.",
      "\"Perhaps in desperation, [Dutton] was gravitating towards culture war issues, sort of echoing Trumpian themes, if you like, and that has been punished,\" Dr Mols says. \"But also the Greens\u2026 who were perhaps seen as being at the other end of that shouting match, have not done well.\"",
      "Dr Mols also believes that desperation to keep Dutton out may have seen some former Greens voters prioritise Labor this time - though he points out more centrist Teal independents appear to have bucked that trend.",
      "In any case, he doesn't see the result in Queensland as a groundswell of love for Labor. The state was still the only jurisdiction in Australia where there were more first preference votes for the Coalition than Labor.",
      "\"There has to be enough of a swing towards a party, but it's often that preferencing that actually tilts it over the line,\" he says.",
      "\"This is more of a Liberal loss.\"",
      "For many Coalition voters, that loss is deeply felt. Rick describes it as a \"real rout\".",
      "But among others, like Aleysha, there is an inexplicable element of mirth.",
      "\"I think it's quite funny, that he slipped as much as he did,\" she says. \"And I can't tell you why.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2de9d8dky0o",
    "published": "Tue, 06 May 2025 23:46:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Pope Francis's efforts to shake up the workings of the Church should be built on by the next pope, according to some - but his critics are less convinced",
    "story": [
      "The Vatican's Santa Marta guesthouse has 128 rooms. From 7 May, it will be filled with cardinals participating in the conclave to elect the next Pope. But one room in the guesthouse is still sealed with a red ribbon, as it has been since its occupant died there on Easter Monday.",
      "That suite will only be reopened when the new pope is chosen. The ribbon remains a tangible reminder of the man whose shoes the cardinals are looking to fill \u2013 but Pope Francis' presence looms large over this conclave in many profound ways.",
      "He spent 12 years in the role and appointed around 80% of the cardinals who will select his successor. He also looked to radically shake up the workings of the Catholic Church, moving its centre of gravity away from its hierarchy at the Vatican in the direction of the rank-and-file faithful all over the world, and focused on the poor and marginalised.",
      "My conversations with cardinals and those assessing the needs of the Church in the days leading to this papal election almost always end up looking at what is required through the prism of what Pope Francis did in the role.",
      "While in recent days there appears to have been a growing coalescence around the idea that Francis' work should be built on, some of his critics remain far from convinced. So might there be enough of them to sway the vote as the Church attempts to reconcile the different outlooks and realities it faces around the globe?",
      "A most diverse conclave",
      "During the two weeks that followed the Pope's death, the cardinals met almost daily at the Vatican for pre-conclave gatherings known as general congregations.",
      "While the conclave in the Sistine Chapel is limited to cardinals who haven't yet reached the age of 80 (133 will participate in this one), these preliminary meetings are open to all 252 cardinals. Each attendee was given up to five minutes to air their views, though we know that some took longer.",
      "It was during such a meeting ahead of the last conclave of 2013, in a speech lasting less than four minutes, that Pope Francis - then known as Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina - made an impact, talking of a need to connect with those in the far reaches of the Catholic world.",
      "As Pope, he made a conscious drive to appoint cardinals from such places. It is why this is the most diverse conclave there has ever been. For the first time Cape Verde, Haiti, South Sudan, Tonga, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea and Rwanda will be represented.",
      "That diversity has already made its mark: the pre-conclave meetings are said to have brought to the fore just how different the needs of the Church appear to be depending on where in the world they are viewed.",
      "In Europe, for example, a primary consideration for some might be finding ways to reinvigorate and make relevant the mission of the Church in the face of shrinking congregations, whereas elsewhere - in African or Asian countries - concerns may revolve around social issues, poverty and conflict resolution.",
      "A prospective pope is likely to be one who has at least shown recognition of those very different realities.",
      "Spiritual leader, statesman, global influencer",
      "The official titles that the new pope will inherit gives a sense of the breadth of the role: Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Sovereign of the State of Vatican City among them.",
      "While some relate to the deeply spiritual, the last of those titles suggests the need for a statesman too, given that the pope is leader of a country, albeit the world's smallest.",
      "\"Unlike your average state, the agenda of the Vatican is driven to an extent by where the pope reigning at the time puts their emphasis,\" says Chris Trott, British ambassador to the Holy See. \"On the face of it a very tiny state, [but it is] one that punches many, many times above its weight.",
      "\"And Pope Francis had 50 million followers on Twitter, so [it is] a very, very small state and an incredible global influencer.\"",
      "Pope Francis chose to amplify this part of the role, becoming a powerful global spokesman on behalf of those on the margins, including the poor and victims of war.",
      "He also tried to play the role of peacemaker, though not everyone thought he was successful in that regard, in relation to China and Russia in particular.",
      "According to Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the most senior Catholic figure in England and Wales, this expansion of the role is one reason so many even outside the faith are invested in the outcome of the conclave.",
      "\"There is a sense that the Pope in the person of Pope Francis became a figure who addressed everybody in the world\u2026 religious people and even those who do not have a religious affiliation,\" he says.",
      "\"I'm more and more aware that it's not just Catholics who are interested in this.\"",
      "Confusion around Pope Francis' vision",
      "For many voting cardinals, it is primarily issues within the Catholic Church that are under the spotlight, which brings about the question of the type of pope they want as a manager, and someone who runs the Church's administrative body and its ministries.",
      "While Pope Francis worked on improving the way the Church deals with the huge issues of sexual abuse and of financial corruption, it is his successor who will have to ensure that reforms are evenly applied across the Catholic world.",
      "Even supporters of Pope Francis' efforts to make changes to the way the Church relates to its rank-and-file believers, and the way he built bridges with those outside the faith, were sometimes left confused about how exactly he envisioned things should work.",
      "Pope Francis changed the tone on social issues through comments he made, talking openly about subjects ranging from climate change to financial transparency within the Vatican. But throughout his papacy, some were unclear about what he meant or how it would be applied.",
      "One mission he had was to take some of the power and decision-making away from the Vatican hierarchy and into the hands of rank-and-file Catholics.",
      "Over nearly four years, at great effort, he commissioned what was, in effect, a poll of many of the world's Catholics to find out what mattered to them. Lay people were invited to participate in the most recent bishop's conference where the results of the survey were discussed.",
      "The biggest issues raised related to greater roles for women in the running of the church and welcoming LGBT+ Catholics. But the meeting ended in some confusion, with little in the form of tangible steps forward and little clarity as to how lay people will help steer the future direction of the Church.",
      "So, there is a general keenness for greater clarity from the new pope.",
      "An ugly divide: supporters and detractors",
      "Throughout his pontificate, some vocal traditionalists opposed what they saw as Pope Francis straying from Church teaching and long-standing tradition.",
      "In the pre-conclave meetings of cardinals, a number of those over the age of 80 (who because of their age would not be involved in voting) took the opportunity to play their part.",
      "Most contributions remained secret, but one that was reported was that of 83-year-old Italian cardinal, Beniamino Stella. He criticised Pope Francis for \"imposing his own ideas\" by attempting to move Church governance away from the clergy.",
      "And yet during the homily, or religious speech, at Pope Francis' funeral, what appeared to resonate with the public in attendance \u2013 judging by the volume of the applause \u2013 was talk of the themes Francis chose to champion: the dignity of migrants, an end to war, and the environment.",
      "This applause would have been heard loud and clear by the rows of cardinals.",
      "In some senses, Pope Francis did have clarity in focusing on the Church being relevant to people in their daily lives and, indeed, their struggles. He was clear about connecting with the world outside the faith too.",
      "\"There is a sense that in the voice of the pope, there's a voice of something that is needed,\" says Cardinal Nichols. \"For some people it's a moral compass, for some people it's the sense of being accepted, for some people it's the insistence that we must look at things from the point of view of the poorest.",
      "\"That's a voice that has fallen silent and our task is to find someone who can carry that forward.\"",
      "From the death of Pope Francis to the moment cardinals checked into the Santa Marta guesthouse and its overflow residences, there appeared to be a trend towards a desire for continuity of what Pope Francis had achieved.",
      "Though perhaps that vision of continuity is one that could bring along more of his sceptics, in a way that was pragmatic. The word \"unity\" has been talked of a lot, after a period where the divides between supporters and detractors of the Pope's vision could sometimes become ugly.",
      "But in the end, when they step into the Sistine Chapel, the holiest of voting chambers, for all the pragmatism they may have taken into consideration before they cast their ballot, they will be urged to let God and the Holy Spirit guide them.",

    "story": [
      "In an exclusive and remarkably candid interview - the first since he left office - Joe Biden discusses what he really thinks of his successor's first 100 days, plus his fears for the future if the Atlantic Alliance collapses",
      "It is hard to believe that the man I greet in the Delaware hotel where he launched his political career more than half a century ago was the \"leader of the free world\" little over 100 days ago.",
      "Joe Biden is still surrounded by all the trappings of power \u2013 the black SUVs, the security guys with curly earpieces, the sniffer dogs sent ahead to sweep the room for explosives. And yet he has spent the last three months watching much of what he believes in being swept away by his successor.",
      "Donald Trump has deployed the name Biden again and again - it is his political weapon of choice. One recent analysis showed that Trump said or wrote the name Biden at least 580 times in those first 100 days in office. Having claimed that rises in share prices were \"Trump's stock market\" at work, he later blamed sharp falls in share prices on \"Biden's stock market\".",
      "Until this week, President Biden himself (former presidents keep their titles after they leave office) has largely observed the convention that former presidents do not criticise their successors at the start of their time in office. But from the moment we shake hands it is clear that he is determined to have his say too.",
      "In a dark blue suit, the former president arrives smiling and relaxed but with the determined air of a man on a mission. It's his first interview since leaving the White House, and he seems most angry about Donald Trump's treatment of America's allies - in particular Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky.",

      "Five key takeaways from the interview",
      "Political Thinking with Nick Robinson: Listen to the full interview on BBC Sounds, or watch on BBC iPlayer or on YouTube",
      "\"I found it beneath America, the way that took place,\" he says of the explosive Oval Office row between Trump and Zelensky in February. \"And the way we talk about now that, 'it's the Gulf of America', 'maybe we're going to have to take back Panama', 'maybe we need to acquire Greenland, 'maybe Canada should be a [51st state].' What the hell's going on here?",
      "\"What President ever talks like that? That's not who we are. We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity - not about confiscation.\"",
      "After just over 100 action-packed days of Trump there was no shortage of targets for President Biden to choose from.",
      "But his main concern appears to be on the international stage, rather than the domestic one: that is, the threat he believes now faces the alliance between the United States and Europe which, as he puts it, secured peace, freedom and democracy for eight decades.",
      "\"Grave concerns\" about the Atlantic Alliance",
      "Just before our interview, which took place days before the 80th anniversary of VE Day, Biden took a large gold coin out of his pocket and pressed it into my hand. It was a souvenir of last year's D-Day commemoration. Biden believes that the speech he delivered on that beach in Normandy is one of his most important. In it, he declared that the men who fought and died \"knew \u2013 beyond any doubt \u2013 that there are things worth fighting and dying for\".",
      "I ask him whether he feels that message about sacrifice is in danger of being forgotten in America. Not by the people, he replies but, yes, by the leadership. It is, he says, a \"grave concern\" that the Atlantic Alliance is seen to be dying.",
      "\"I think it would change the modern history of the world if that occurs,\" he argues.",
      "\"We're the only nation in a position to have the capacity to bring people together, [to] lead the world. Otherwise you're going to have China and the former Soviet Union, Russia, stepping up.\"",
      "Now more than ever before that Alliance is being questioned. One leading former NATO figure told the BBC this week that the VE Day celebrations felt more like a funeral. President Trump has complained that the United States is being \"ripped off\" by her allies, Vice President JD Vance has said that  America is \"bailing out\" Europe whilst Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has insisted that Europe is \"free-loading\".",
      "Biden calls the pledge all members of Nato - the Atlantic Alliance - make \"to defend each and every inch of Nato territory with the full force of our collective power\" a \"sacred obligation\".",
      "\"I fear that our allies around the world are going to begin to doubt whether we're going to stay where we've always been for the last 80 years,\" Biden says.",
      "Under his presidency, both Finland and Sweden joined Nato - something he thinks made the alliance stronger.  \"We did all that - and in four years we've got a guy who wants to walk away from it all.",
      "\"I'm worried that Europe is going to lose confidence in the certainty of America, and the leadership of America in the world, to deal with not only Nato, but other matters that are of consequence.\"",
      "Biden, the \"addled old man\"?",
      "I meet President Biden in the place he has called home since he was a boy, the city of Wilmington in Delaware. It is an hour and a half Amtrak train ride from Washington DC, a journey he has been making for 50 years since becoming a Senator at the age of just 30. He has spent more years in government than any other president.",
      "He was 82 when he left the Oval Office. His age has invited no end of scrutiny - an \"at times addled old man\" is how the journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson describe him in their book, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.",
      "His calamitous live TV debate performance last June prompted further questions, as Biden stumbled over his words, lost his thread mid-sentence and boasted, somewhat bafflingly, that \"We finally beat Medicare!\". He withdrew from the election campaign soon after.",
      "Today, Biden is still warm and charismatic, with the folksy charm that made him an election winner but he is a much slower, quieter and more hesitant version of the leader he was once. Meeting with him in person, I found it hard to imagine he could have served for another four years in the White House, taking him closer to the age of 90.",
      "I ask Biden if he's now had to think again about his decisions last year. He pulled out of the presidential race just 107 days before election day, leaving Kamala Harris limited time to put together her own campaign.",
      "\"I don't think it would have mattered,\" he says. \"We left at a time when we had a good candidate, she was fully funded.",
      "\"What we had set out to do, no-one thought we could do,\" he continues. \"And we had become so successful in our agenda, it was hard to say, 'No, I'm going to stop now'... It was a hard decision.\"",
      "One he regrets? Surely withdrawing earlier could have given someone else a greater chance?",
      "\"No, I think it was the right decision.\" He pauses. \"I think that\u2026 Well, it was just a difficult decision.\"",
      "Trump is \"not behaving like a Republican president\"",
      "Biden says he went into politics to fight injustice and to this day has lost none of his appetite for the fight. Last year at the D-Day celebrations he warned: \"We're living in a time when democracy is more at risk across the world than at any point since the end of World War Two.\"",
      "Today, he expands on this: \"Look at the number of European leaders and European countries that are wondering, Well what do I do now? What's the best route for me to take? Can I rely on the United States? Are they going to be there?\"",
      "\"Instead of democracy expanding around the world, [it's] receding. Democracy - every generation has to fight for it.\"",
      "Speaking in Chicago recently, Biden declared that \"nobody's king\" in America. I asked him if he thinks President Trump is behaving more like a monarch than a constitutionally limited president.",
      "He chooses his reply carefully. \"He's not behaving like a Republican president,\" he says.",
      "Though later in our interview, Biden admits he's less worried about the future of US democracy than he used to be, \"because I think the Republican Party is waking up to what Trump is about\".",
      "\"Anybody who thinks Putin's going to stop is foolish\"",
      "President Biden relished his role as the leading figure in Nato, deploying normally top secret intelligence to tell a sceptical world back in 2022 that Vladimir Putin was about to launch a full scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Since taking office President Trump has charted a different course, telling Ukraine that it must consider giving up territory to Russia if it wants the war to end.",
      "\"It is modern day appeasement,\" Biden says of Trump's approach.",
      "Putin, he says, sees Ukraine as \"part of Mother Russia. He believes he has historical rights to Ukraine... He can't stand the fact that [\u2026] the Soviet Union has collapsed. And anybody who thinks he's going to stop is just foolish.\"",
      "He fears that Trump's approach might signal to other European countries that it's time to give in to Russia.",
      "Yet Biden has faced accusations against him concerning the Ukraine War. Some in Kyiv and her allies, as well as some in the UK, claim that he gave President Zelensky just enough support to resist invasion but not enough to defeat Russia, perhaps out of fear that Putin would consider using nuclear weapons if cornered.",
      "When Putin was asked point blank on TV this week whether he would use nuclear weapons to win the war, he declared that he hoped that they would \"not be necessary,\" adding that he had the means to bring the war to what he called his \"logical conclusion\".",
      "I point out to Biden that it has been argued that he didn't have the courage to go all the way to give Ukraine the weapons it needed - to let Ukraine win.",
      "\"We gave them [Ukraine] everything they needed to provide for their independence,\" Biden argues. \"And we were prepared to respond more aggressively if in fact Putin moved again.\"",
      "He says he was keen to avoid the prospect of \"World War Three, with nuclear powers,\" adding: \"And we did avoid it.",
      "\"What would Putin do if things got really tough for him?\" he continues. \"Threaten the use of tactical nuclear weapons. This is not a game or roulette.\"",
      "Americans used to be steadfast in their support for Israel. Those days are gone",
      "Sir John Curtice: The map that shows Reform's triumph was much more than a protest vote",
      "What Trump really wants from Canada",
      "Biden's belief in the Atlantic Alliance - as the last living President born during World War Two - is clearly undiminished.",
      "When he first arrived in the Oval Office, Biden hung a portrait of America's wartime leader Franklin D. Roosevelt on the wall. He was born two and a half years before the defeat of the Nazis, into the world FDR helped to create - a world of American global leadership and solidarity. But the United States voted to reject Biden's policies and values and instead to endorse Donald Trump's call to put America First.",
      "The world is changing from what people like Joe Biden have taken for granted.",
      "\"Every generation has to fight to maintain democracy, every one,\" Biden says. \"Every one's going to be challenged.",
      "\"We've done it well for the last 80 years. And I'm worried there's the loss of understanding of the consequences of that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.",
      "The Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named \"Operation Sindoor\" - were part of a \"commitment\" to hold \"accountable\" those responsible for the 22 April attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead.",
      "But Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in that attack, described the strikes as \"unprovoked\", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the \"heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished\".",
      "Sharif on Wednesday said the Pahalgam attack \"wasn't related\" to Pakistan, and that his country was \"accused for the wrong\" reasons.",

      "Follow the latest updates",
      "Why India and Pakistan fight over Kashmir",
      "BBC reports from Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir",
      "Pakistan's military said at least 31 people were killed and 57 injured in the strikes on Tuesday night. India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.",
      "Pakistan's military says it shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims.",
      "Late on Wednesday, Sharif said the air force made its defence - which was a \"reply from our side to them\".",
      "Where did India hit?",
      "Delhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.",
      "It said these sites were \"terrorist infrastructure\" - places where attacks were \"planned and directed\".",
      "It emphasised that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities, saying its \"actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature\".",
      "In the initial aftermath of the attacks, Pakistan said three different areas were hit: Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Bahawalpur in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, later said six locations had been hit.",
      "Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told GeoTV in the early hours of Wednesday that the strikes hit civilian areas, adding that India's claim of \"targeting terrorist camps\" was false.",
      "Why did India launch the attack?",
      "The strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours over the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam.",
      "The 22 April attack by a group of militants saw 26 people killed, with survivors saying the militants were singling out Hindu men.",
      "It was the worst attack on civilians in the region in two decades, and the first major attack on civilians since India revoked Article 370, which gave Kashmir semi-autonomous status, in 2019.",
      "Following the decision, the region saw protests but also witnessed militancy wane and a huge increase in the number of tourists.",
      "The killings have sparked widespread anger in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the country would hunt the suspects \"till the ends of the Earth\" and that those who planned and carried it out \"will be punished beyond their imagination\".",
      "However, India initially did not name any group it believed was behind the attack in Pahalgam.",
      "But Indian police alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.",
      "On 7 May, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group carried out the attack.",
      "In the two weeks since, both sides had taken tit-for-tat measures against each other - including expelling diplomats, suspending visas and closing border crossings.",
      "But many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.",
      "Why is Kashmir a flashpoint between India and Pakistan?",
      "Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.",
      "The countries have fought two wars over it.",
      "But more recently, it has been attacks by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.",
      "In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.",
      "In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.",
      "Neither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. Attempts have been made by various nations and diplomats around the world to prevent this.",
      "UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres quickly called for \"maximum restraint\" - a sentiment echoed by the European Union and numerous countries, including Bangladesh.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged \"dialogue\" and \"de-escalation\".",
      "US President Donald Trump - who was one of the first to respond - told reporters at the White House that he hoped the fighting \"ends very quickly\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, said he was keeping a close eye on developments."

      "Eighty miles from Moscow, a park echoes to the sound of explosions and gunfire.",
      "As plumes of thick grey smoke rise into the air, the Red Army storms across a bridge and battles for control of a tiny island. More Soviet soldiers are arriving by boat from across a lake.",
      "Once on the island they tear down a swastika and replace it with the hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union. Victory.",
      "A large crowd is watching from the safety of the shore. What they're witnessing is an historical re-enactment of one of the final battles for Berlin in 1945. It led to the capitulation of Nazi Germany and what Moscow still refers to as The Great Victory.",
      "The battle for Berlin, unfolding in front of me in the town of Dubna, is one of many events in Russia for the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in World War Two.",
      "The anniversary is receiving enormous attention in a country where the national idea is built very much around the notion of Russia as victor and victim.",
      "\"I'm here because my grandfather fought in this war,\" one of the spectators, Katya, tells me.",
      "\"He went missing near Berlin. Much later we found out he'd been killed in January 1945.\"",
      "Eighty years on Katya's son is fighting in Ukraine.",
      "\"My son is in a war now. He's in the 'special military operation',\" she tells me.  \"He volunteered. I tried to talk him out of it. But he hasn't listened to anyone since he was a kid.",
      "'I'm my own tsar,' he told me. 'Go fight, then, if you're a tsar,' I replied. He and his friend went together. His friend was killed.\"",
      "Katya's family history is a story of different generations fighting on the front line.",
      "But in very different circumstances.",
      "In 1941, Hitler's Germany invaded the Soviet Union to try to conquer the world's largest country and secure world domination. Soviet soldiers (Katya's grandfather among them) fought to liberate their country from the Nazis. Victory for Moscow came at an enormous human cost: more than 27 million Soviet citizens were killed in what is known here as the Great Fatherland or Great Patriotic War.",
      "But in 2022 it was Russia that launched a large-scale invasion - of its neighbour. What the Kremlin still calls a \"special military operation\" was widely seen as an attempt to force Ukraine back into Russia's geo-political orbit. In March 2022, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution condemning Russia's \"aggression.\"",
      "And yet the Russian authorities portray the war in Ukraine as a continuation of World War Two. The official narrative here creates a parallel reality, in which Russia once again is fighting Nazism and fascism, in Ukraine and across Europe. Russia, the country which invaded Ukraine, presents itself as the victim of external aggression.",
      "\"Historically and sociologically, victory in the Great Patriotic War was always a cornerstone of Russian united consciousness,\" Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov explains, \"because there is no glue for the nation: only this event. It was always so, from Brezhnev's time until now.",
      "\"But what's happening now is something special. Now the Great Patriotic War is presented as just the first step in our permanent war with the West, against 'Eurofascism.' The Special Military Operation as the continuation of the Great Patriotic War: this is something new.\"",
      "In Russia, television plays a key role in spreading the official message that Europe couldn't be trusted then and cannot be trusted now. Recently, on Russian TV, I saw a documentary entitled \"Europe Against Russia. Hitler's Crusaders\". It was about how European countries had collaborated with the Nazis during World War Two.",
      "No mention of the 1939 non-aggression pact between Hitler and Stalin: under its secret protocol Germany and the USSR had carved up spheres of influence in eastern Europe.",
      "Last month a Russian TV presenter launched a tirade against German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a staunch supporter of military support to Ukraine. The talk show host called Germany's leader \"a Nazi scumbag\" for comments about Russia. Addressing the Chancellor directly, the anchor said that Russians \"hold you and your comrades responsible for the killing of 27 million Soviet citizens.\"",
      "Iconography underpins the ideology. In the town of Khimki, near Moscow, a recently unveiled monument depicts a Red Army soldier side by side with a Russian who is fighting in Ukraine. Framed photos of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine have been placed below the two fighter figures.",
      "An inscription reads: \"By preserving the past we defend the future!\"",
      "Wars past and present: brought together in bronze.",
      "In the run up to Victory Day, Russia has been awash with reminders of The Great Victory. Last month a Soyuz rocket decorated to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome.",
      "Back down on earth, at a maternity hospital in the Siberian city of Kemerovo, newborn babies are being dressed in miniature Red Army caps and capes.",
      "On its Telegram channel, the hospital explained that battle clothes for babies served \"as a reminder of links between the generations, the courage of the defenders of the Fatherland and of how even the tiniest Russian citizen is part of a big history.\"",
      "In Moscow, the Russian word for 'Victory' - 'Pobeda' \u2013 is everywhere: on giant billboards, on posters in shop windows, even stuck to the side of road-sweepers. Underground, special \"victory trains\" on the Moscow Metro have been decked out with World War Two imagery and the words: \"Be proud!\" and \"Remember!\"",
      "Tanks have been rolling down Moscow's main street, Tverskaya, at rehearsals for the big 9 May parade on Red Square. In Soviet times, after 1945, military parades on Victory Day were rare. Under Vladimir Putin they have become a key element of what is now Russia's most sacred national holiday - a day not only for remembering the victims of World War Two, but for showcasing Russian military power and to unite the people around the idea of Russia as an unbeatable nation.",
      "The USSR was, indeed, victorious in the Great Patriotic War. But eighty years on, and despite confident pronouncements by Russian officials, victory eludes Moscow in Ukraine. The Kremlin's \"special military operation\" was only expected to last a few days, a few weeks maximum. After more than three years of war \u2013 and huge casualties on both sides - it's still unclear how and when the fighting will end.",
      "The Kremlin says 29 world leaders, including China's Xi Jinping, will be attending the Victory Day parade. According to Moscow, Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be visiting Russia for the commemorations. Ensuring security for the military parade and guests on Red Square will already have been a top priority for the Kremlin. Even more so after two consecutive nights of Ukrainian drone attacks targeting Moscow.",
      "Back in Dubna, German resistance has crumbled and the Red Army is in full control. The re-enactment is over.",
      "Some of the spectators here believe the official portrayal of Russia as a besieged fortress threatened by the West.",

      "When I talk to 98-year-old Fyodor Melnikov, he doesn't get into politics. The military show has sparked painful memories for him. Fyodor's brother was killed in the Great Patriotic War.",
      "\"War is a terrifying thing,\" Fyodor tells me. \"People should be allowed to live freely. Let them work, let them live their lives, let them die naturally.\"",

      "Pitt, 44, whose lawyers denied the allegations, was arrested Friday on nine counts, including first-degree sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, attempted assault and strangulation. The indictment cites four incidents between April 2020 and August 2021 at Pitt's home in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.",
      "Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez's office declined to comment Wednesday beyond the allegations listed in the indictment.",
      "Pitt's lawyer, Jason Goldman, said he already had exonerating evidence and expected the case to be dismissed.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we live in a world where somebody like Mr. Pitt \u2014 an accomplished professional who would never so much as contemplate these crimes \u2014 can be arrested on the uncorroborated word of an unreliable individual,\" Goldman said in a text message to The Associated Press.",
      "He added, \"In reality, this baseless claim is suspiciously raised some four or five years after the alleged incident, from a time when the two parties were in a completely consensual relationship.\"",

    "summary": "Jury selection has started in music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex-trafficking trial. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial in New York City this month. Jury selection began Monday, and opening statements are scheduled to follow on May 12.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs will be tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"Freak Offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"Freak Off.\" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",
      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

      "It was Harris' first time at the benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. In an interview with Vogue published ahead of the blue carpet event, Harris emphasized the importance of art and how it intertwines with politics.",
      "\"Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,\" Harris told Vogue. \"Artistic expression \u2014 whether it's dance, music, visual arts or fashion \u2014 has a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go.\"",

Harris attended with her husband, Doug Emhoff, Vogue said.",

And in 1977, Ronald Reagan attended the Met Gala between his terms as governor of California and president of the United States.",

      "Police in Brazil said on Sunday that two people have been arrested in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Saturday's event drew some 2 million fans to Copacabana Beach.",
      "Rio de Janeiro's state police said they had worked with the Justice Ministry to disrupt an attack allegedly planned by a group that was spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community. Police said the group sought to radicalize and recruit teenagers to carry out attacks using Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives.",
      "\"The plan was treated as a 'collective challenge' with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media,\" the police said.",
      "Authorities said they arrested two people in connection with the planned attack \u2014 the alleged leader of the group on illegal weapons possession charges in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a teenager on child pornography charges in Rio.",
      "The concert was the biggest show of Gaga's career.",
      "\"Tonight, we're making history,\" Lady Gage told a screaming crowd. \"Thank you for making history with me.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Lady Gaga told CBS News the team learned of the alleged threats through media reports.",
      "\"Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,\" the spokesperson said. \"Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.\"",
      "The Mother Monster, as she is known, kicked off the show just after 10 p.m. local time with her 2011 song \"Bloody Mary.\" Cries of joy rose from the tightly packed fans who sang and danced shoulder to shoulder on the vast stretch of sand.",
      "Concert organizers said 2.1 million people attended the show, which was funded by the city of Rio in an effort to revitalize the economy. In a recent report, Rio's City Hall said the show should bring in at least 600 million reais, or roughly $106 million.",
      "For Gaga, the performance was also an opportunity to promote her upcoming \"Mayhem Ball\" tour, featuring songs from her latest record MAYHEM. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 when it was released in early March and includes new hits like \"Abracadabra.\"",
      "Lady Gaga also performed a number of older classics at her free show Saturday, including \"Poker Face\" and \"Alejandro,\" switching between an array of dresses including one with the colors of the Brazilian flag.",
      "Some fans \u2014 many of them young \u2014 arrived on the beach at the crack of dawn to secure a good spot, armed with snacks and drinks. They spent the day under a blazing sun, while others perched in trees, determined to get a panoramic view.",
      "\"Today is the best day of my life,\" said Manoela Dobes, a 27-year-old designer who was wearing a dress plastered with a photograph from when she met Lady Gaga in the United States in 2019. \"It's surreal to be here.\"",
      "Madonna also turned Copacabana Beach into a massive dance floor last year.",
      "The large-scale performances are part of an effort led by City Hall to boost economic activity after Carnival and New Year's Eve festivities and the upcoming month-long Saint John's Day celebrations in June.",
      "\"It brings activity to the city during what was previously considered the low season \u2014 filling hotels and increasing spending in bars, restaurants, and retail, generating jobs and income for the population,\" said Osmar Lima, the city's secretary of economic development, in a statement released by Rio City Hall's tourism department last month.",
      "Similar concerts are scheduled to take place every year in May at least until 2028.",
      "Lady Gaga arrived in Rio in the early hours of Tuesday. The city has been alive with Gaga-mania since, as it geared up to welcome the pop star for her first show in the country since 2012. Rio's metro employees danced to Lady Gaga's 2008 hit song \"LoveGame\" and gave instructions for Saturday in a video. A free exhibition celebrating her career sold out.",
      "While the vast majority of attendees were from Rio, the event also attracted Brazilians from across the country and international visitors.",
      "More than 500,000 tourists poured into the city in the days leading up to the show, more than double the initial forecast, according to data from the local bus station and Tom Jobim airport, Rio's City Hall said in a statement on Friday.",
      "Ingrid Serrano, a 30-year-old engineer, traveled from Colombia to Brazil to attend the show.",
      "\"I've been a 100% fan of Lady Gaga my whole life,\" said Serrano, who was wearing a T-shirt featuring Lady Gaga's outlandish costumes over the years.",
      "For her, the mega-star represents \"total freedom of expression \u2014 being who one wants without shame.\"",
      "Rio officials have a history of organizing huge concerts on Copacabana Beach. Madonna's show drew an estimated 1.6 million fans last year, while 4 million people flooded onto the beach for a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart in 1994. According to Guinness World Records, that was the biggest free rock concert in history.",
      "To ensure fans could hear the songs, sixteen sound towers were spread along the beach.",
      "Rio state's security plan included 3,300 members of the military, 1,500 police officers and 400 firefighters.",

The dress code of the 2025 Met Gala \u2014 typically related to the exhibit's theme \u2014 is \"Tailored for You,\" calling for a focus on suiting and menswear, according to the Met.

      "2024 Met Gala theme: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\"",
      "In 2024, the Met Gala explored the themes of rebirth and renewal through nature and the passage of time. Referencing the 1962 J.G. Ballard short story \"The Garden of Time\" celebrities, entrepreneurs, athletes and designers wore floral gowns and referenced nature's everlasting forms.",
      "Bad Bunny wore Margiela and Jennifer Lopez wore a Schiaparelli design. Both co-chaired the event with Wintour, who wore a Loewe custom floor-length jacket adorned in feathers that formed tulip bouquets. But Zendaya, another gala co-chair, stole the night by walking the carpet twice. She first wore Maison Margiela Artisanal by John Galliano before changing quickly and closing out the most public part of the night, the strut into the event at the steps of the Met, in a 1996 black gown from John Galliano's Givenchy era, which she paired with a flower bouquet Alexander McQueen head piece designed by Philip Treacy.",
      "2023 Met Gala theme: \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\"",
      "The Met Gala honored the late designer Karl Lagerfeld in 2023 with a night of references to his style and his immense influence in the fashion world. Some wore Lagerfeld's designs for Chanel, Fendi, Balmain and Chlo\u00e9, while others twisted his unique way of dressing, which combined black, white and leather for his daily wear, and later in life inspired the creative behind his eponymous label. There were also plenty of cat odes at the gala, a tribute to Lagerfeld's beloved feline friend Choupette,",
      "2022 Met Gala theme: \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\"",
      "The second installment of a two-part exhibition on fashion in the United States, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\" celebrated two centuries of American identity through fashion's eyes. \"Gilded Glamour\" graced the gala's red carpet and American history references were prevalent.",
      "The most recognized garment belonged to Marilyn Monroe. The nude, form-fitting number shined on the style icon while she serenaded then-president John F. Kennedy for his birthday in 1962. Kim Kardashian wore the dress after entering a deal with the Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum to bring the garment out of its display. The uproar was immediate, as some alleged possible damage to the dress. Ripley's was forced to respond\u00a0denying the heated claims.",
      "2021 Met Gala theme: \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\"",
      "The first of two parts, \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\" wove together identities of the ever-changing U.S. through time, exploring the emotions behind the country's evolving culture. Instagram sponsored the event and brought to the carpet executives turned celebrities, including author, viral influencer and director of fashion partnerships at Instagram Evan Chen, and the social app's chief Adam Mosseri.",
      "After a pause for the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, social hesitance was still evident and masks were incorporated into some of the night's designs. Of note, Billie Eilish wore an Oscar De La Renta dress for a cause, calling for the storied house to end its ties to fur.",
      "2019 Met Gala theme: \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\"",
      "Guests brought their imagination to the pink carpet for the 2019 \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" gala rendition. Gender-bending was evident\u00a0and many looks turned heads, like Jared Leto's interpretation of Alessandro Michele's world of Gucci. Lady Gaga's iconic Brandon Maxwell looks told a story of style with each step the singer took outside of the Met. Framed around Susan Sontag's 1964 essay \"Notes on 'Camp,'\" the gala brought to life the whimsical and effervescent nature of fashion.",
      "2018 Met Gala theme: \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\"",
      "The 2018 Met Gala theme drew inspiration from Catholicism. \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" explored religious iconography and the influence of medieval art in fashion. Guests brought to life looks that referenced papal garments and displayed biblical artifacts like crosses, angel wings and halos. The theme's ties to the history of Christ were not well received by some critics who thought fashion should stay out of the church.",
      "2017 Met Gala theme: \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art of the In-Between\"",
      "The 2017 event paid tribute to Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo and her Comme des Gar\u00e7ons avant-garde designs that play with the body's shape and form. Duality, a motif for the exhibit, highlighted almost four decades of her work. Guests brought to the event pops of red from Kawakubo's palette, intricate embellishments and sheer fabrics. Caroline Kennedy and Rihanna embraced more fantastical designs, pairing shape-shifting silhouettes with florals, inducing more authenticity to a much-subdued theme interpretation.",
      "2016 Met Gala theme: \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\"",
      "The influence of technology in fashion turned the 2016 Met Gala into a spectacular display of metallics and cutting-edge designs. Many of the garnmets appeared too intricate and precise to be man-made, an ode to the artisans all over the world who piece together exquisite Haute Couture creations by pouring thousands of hours into each work. CBS News spent the day with supermodel and entrepreneur Karlie Kloss, who wore a sleek white Brandon Maxwell number that referenced classic men's tailoring paired with Ala\u00efa-esque angular cuts.",
      "2015 Met Gala theme \"China: Through the Looking Glass\"",
      "While the 2015 Met exhibit scoped a wide history of artifacts and influence from Asian art, the gala came down to just one word: Rihanna. Dawning a sunny yellow cape that cascaded down the steps of the Met, the singer and fashion icon elevated the meaning of attending fashion's biggest night. The couture garment designed by China's Guo Pei took two years to make, Rihanna told Vanity Fair. The look quickly comes to mind around the world when the first Monday in May is discussed.",
      "2014 Met Gala theme: \"Charles James: Beyond Fashion\"",
      "The Costume Institute has been celebrating those behind fashion since its inception, and in 1973 it began hosting the gala within the museum itself, Vogue recounts. Fashion authority Diana Vreeland brought to life \"The World of Balenciaga\" after exiting Vogue as editor-in-chief, and her tribute to Spanish designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga left a blueprint for other designer-centered celebrations that followed.",
      "In 2014, couturier Charles James' work went on display at the Met and guests embraced brilliant gowns with his grandiose touch. James' tailored and structural approach to the female form, mixed with modern fabrics, brought elegance and regalia to the occasion.",
      "2013 Met Gala theme: \"Punk: Chaos to Couture\"",
      "Anti-establishment influence inked its way into the Met's\u00a0history in 2013.\u00a0Started in the 1970's, the punk movement gave guests a reason to wear garments embellished with the spirit of teen disobedience and air of grungy D.I.Y. personal style. Madonna honored the era with fishnets, metal studs and silver chains adorning a Givenchy mini plaid blazer by Riccardo Tisci. Rebellion was also apparent in the hairstyles exhibited, most notably by singer Miley Cyrus, a fashion fanatic, whose short, spiked look paired perfectly with her risque fishnet Marc Jacobs gown.",
      "What was the first Met Gala theme?",
      "The Costume Institute started holding benefits in 1948, but it was Vreeland who brought themed galas to the next level as a Met consultant with \"The World of Balenciaga\" in 1973, according to Vogue.",
      "Full list of past Met Gala themes over the years",
      "Inspecting the art of the world's most famous designers and houses, declaring the impact of global cultures and movements, and defining the prevalence of certain style icons, the Met Gala has explored many themes throughout The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute history.

    "story": [
      "\"Oh, Mary!\" may be Broadway's most unlikely offering this season, a wildly over-the-top, not-at-all historically accurate look at first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, written by and starring Cole Escola.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"For God's sake, Mary! How would it look for the first lady of the United States to be flitting about a stage right now in the ruins of war?\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"How would it look? Sensational!!\"",
      "It's a broad comedy about Mary's secret passion of becoming a cabaret star. Meanwhile, her husband, Abe, is just wrapping up the Civil War, and is more concerned with keeping the country together.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"No! It's inappropriate! We're at war!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"With who?\"Abraham Lincoln: \"The south!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"Of what?\"",
      "It's not a revival, it has no movie stars (\"Well, speak for yourself, Mo!\"), and it's a smash hit, breaking box office records.",
      "What does that say? \"Inflation is high,\" Escola laughed.",
      "Escola came up with the idea in 2009: \"I sent an email to myself that said, 'What if Abraham Lincoln's assassination wasn't such a bad thing for Mary Todd?' You know, like, Mary's starting over. Like, 'Now I'm single. I can date.' You know?\"",
      "But this fever dream Mary remained just a dream for years. \"I loved this idea so much, I didn't want it to get on paper and for it to disappoint me \u2013 to disappoint me, not just the audience, but, like, me,\" Escola said. \"There are certain ideas that you're just like, 'Oh, I don't wanna plant this seed, because what if it's an ugly flower?'\"",
      "Escola eventually wrote the play. \"Oh, Mary!\" opened to rapturous reviews downtown, quickly moved uptown to Broadway, and just this week earned five Tony nominations, including two for 38-year-old Escola (for best play and best actor).",
      "It's all a long way from rural Oregon, where Escola was raised. The family had little money, with a Vietnam veteran father, Escola says, who suffered from mental illness. \"When I was maybe five years old, my father chased us out of the home with a shotgun. He was having some sort of alcoholic manic break and thought that there were people after him. And so, he chased my mother and my brother and I out of the trailer, and then we moved out and didn't come back.\"",
      "The family moved in with Escola's grandmother. \"Then, her and I shared a bedroom, and I remember that's when she taught me to read. And she was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's so she would repeat stories a lot. But I loved them. I loved her stories. I realize now, when she would tell these stories, we were, like, meeting in the middle of her memory. Like, she was living out the fantasy of her childhood, and I was also living out my fantasy of being a young girl on a farm in Alberta.\"",
      "I asked, \"And you didn't mind that she was repeating the stories?\"",
      "\"No, no,\" Escola replied. \"Because she would remember certain details in a new telling or, like, leave something out, and then I got to be, like, you know, 'And you were wearing a dress, right, Gramma?'\"",
      "\"And is it right that she gave you a Barbie when you were five?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She gave me my first Barbie. just completely took me at face value when I was doing something that wasn't what boys were supposed to do.\"",
      "Her understanding proved prescient. Escola now uses they/them pronouns. Asked to explain, Escola said, \"I have always felt not male, not female. And you know, it's funny, because recently I saw photos of me on Instagram. The comments were like, 'What is that? Like, that's not a man.' 'Well, it sure as hell ain't a woman, either.' And I was like, 'Exactly.' Like, you do get it.\"",
      "Likewise, Escola's comedic identity has never been in doubt.",
      "I asked, \"Comedically, have you always done your own thing?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"So, there was never a time where you thought, 'I need to be more like this person to make people respond to me'?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Escola. \"It would be like trying to speak German when I don't actually know any German. It has to make me laugh in order for it to even have a chance of making someone else laugh.\"",
      "Escola began performing in community theater back in Oregon, and eventually scraped together the money to make it to New York (\"It was New York or bust!\"), at first attending college and living at the 92nd Street Y. It was a short stint of only nine months. \"I had to drop out because they wouldn't let me take out any more loans. I guess I was so poor that they were like, 'You'll never be able to pay this back.'",
      "\"I felt like there was something wrong with me that I couldn't afford to go to school. That's the thing that makes me the most angry about being poor, just this innate sense that it's like a moral failing or an innate thing that's broken in you.\"",
      "Escola eventually did make it back to New York to stay, gaining a fan base with online videos, such as \"Mom Commercial\" (2015):",
      "\u2026 and then on TV, playing a range of deranged, yet delightful characters in shows like \"At Home with Amy Sedaris.\"",
      "And then along came Mary.",
      "I said, \"You don't come to see the show and go, 'Oh, there were layers and layers of development people that were saying, No, you've gotta tweak it for this audience and do this for that audience.'\"",
      "\"No,\" Escola said. \"There is something special about the fact that I wrote this for me and my friends, and for my audience that I've had in downtown venues and stuff. And the fact that it's successful is, I don't know, it makes it that much sweeter. It really does.\"",

      "Maybe it was stubbornness, or pride, but Alex was determined to make his own way. He convinced his soon-to-be-wife Connie to help him build a wood kiln on an old tobacco farm.",
      "I asked, \"Did she have the same passion for it that you did?\"",
      "\"No. She didn't have a passion for clay,\" Alex said.",
      "\"But she had a passion for you, so she kept going?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She stuck around,\" he laughed.",
      "And without anyone knowing who he really was, his business boomed. He could barely keep up with the demand. He realized, \"If we're gonna play in this world, something's gotta change. Like, we cannot keep doing it like we did.\"",
      "So, he decided to mechanize, at least partially. The pottery was still his, only he thought better, especially the colors.\u00a0 He was excited. \"And we sent out a postcard of these new pots that look, you know, they were plain, they had colors on them,\" he said. \"And nobody showed up. So overnight, we lost almost every single one of our customers. Like, they had thought we had lost our minds.\"",
      "And yet, he still refused to fall back on the Matisse name, and it turned out that belief in himself paid off.",
      "Today, he has legions of fans who call themselves \"Potheads.\" They buy, share and trade East Fork dinnerware online. On the secondary market, some of his early pieces can go for thousands of dollars.",
      "And so, with East Fork firmly established, about 18 months ago Alex decided it was time to use his own name. He, along with his sister and brother, poured over hundreds of works by their great-grandfather to find the ones that could be pottery perfect.",
      "\"We wanted something like the Blue Nude series that was instantly recognizable,\" Alex said. \"But then, I wanted some that spoke to me a little more personally.\"",
      "Decals were made of the chosen works, faithful to their great-grandfather's exacting details. Each one is carefully applied by hand, and inspected by hand over and over again.",
      "He says he doesn't wonder what his great-grandfather would think of his new collection. \"Oh, geez. No.\" Alex said, \"Because he was very serious. He was so focused on his work. Like, that's what he cared about.\"",
      "Henri Matisse once famously said, \"Creativity takes courage.\" His great-grandson Alex Matisse would certainly agree with that. His only caveat is that sometimes courage is all in the timing.",
      "\"There's not a heaviness to it,\" he said. \"It's just another layer. It's just another interesting part of my history, my family's history. And it feels great to celebrate it and share it.\"",

      "Prasad replaces Dr. Peter Marks, who served as the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA and played a key role in launching Operation Warp Speed \u2014 the Trump administration's effort to speed up the development of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The center has been operating with an acting director since Marks left the FDA in March.",
      "\"Dr. Prasad brings the kind of scientific rigor, independence, and transparency we need at CBER \u2014 a significant step forward,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary posted on X on Tuesday.",
      "Prasad has long criticized the FDA for granting emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccine boosters, saying last year that Marks was \"either incompetent or corrupt to authorize a booster without clinical, randomized data.\"",
      "After Marks was forced out by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Prasad called Marks \"one of the most dangerous, pro-pharma regulators of the 21st century\" and a \"mediocre academic\" before joining the government.",

Officials have floated the possibility of requiring new randomized trials before approving future updates to COVID shots.",
      "A week ago, Prasad said he backed the idea of new randomized clinical trials before approving COVID shot updates, calling it \"absurd\" that the U.S. was still offering COVID vaccinations to young children and warning that strain changes could result in changes to efficacy and safety.",

      "New requests for investigations of firefighter injuries and workplace health hazards had already stopped being accepted. A CDC plan to help Texas schools curb the spread of measles infections was also scrapped due to the layoffs.",

      "The main difference with Friday's layoff notices was the date they take effect: workers are being put on leave until an official separation from service on July 2, instead of in June.",
      "The layoffs also stopped work at the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. This NIOSH division had been the government body tasked with vetting safety equipment like N95 masks and breathing devices used by emergency workers.",
      "The laboratory's respirator approval program had been in the middle of processing around 100 applications for personal protective equipment, one laid-off official said.",

    "summary": "There were at least 111 cases of measles reported in the last week of March, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
    "story": [
      "Weekly measles cases have set a new record, according to figures published Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, topping the peak of an outbreak in 2019 that ranked as the worst since the 1990s.",
      "The number of cases that had their symptoms start during the week of March 30 has grown to 111, according to the agency's latest update. Authorities backdate newly reported measles cases based on when their rash began, to account for delays in reporting and diagnosis.",
      "That tops the 102 cases reported for the week of March 23, 2019, at the height of that year's wave. By the end of 2019, measles cases that year added up to the largest annual tally since endemic spread of the virus was declared eliminated in 2000.",
      "This year, the majority of cases are from an ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states, which is now larger than any other single outbreak since the virus was eliminated. Between\u00a0Texas\u00a0and\u00a0New Mexico, at least 750 of the measles cases reported this year have been linked to that outbreak. Cases in\u00a0Oklahoma\u00a0and other states have also been linked to the outbreak.",
      "There have been 11 other local outbreaks of measles within the U.S. this year, up from 10 last week.",
      "While the pace of new cases looks to have declined in Texas, officials caution it is too soon to say whether the outbreak is truly ending.",
      "\"We look at the trends over time and we'd want to see several weeks of decline. New cases sometimes get reported to public health up to a week after someone was tested, especially if the test was done at a commercial lab,\" Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Anton said authorities are also watching to see if travel from the Easter holiday weekend last month will result in an increase.",
      "\"Cases from travel that weekend would likely start to be reported in the next week or two,\" Anton said.",
      "This year's tally of cases is likely an undercount, officials and experts have said, citing anecdotes of unreported infections. The unusually high severity of this year's wave also suggests many mild cases of spread are going undiagnosed.",
      "For example, authorities in Canada have confirmed more than 1,000 measles cases so far this year, after record outbreaks there. The U.S. has tallied at least 935 this year, according to the CDC.",
      "In Canada, 7% of cases have resulted in hospitalizations, less than the 13% of cases that have resulted in hospitalizations in the U.S. Three Americans have also died from measles so far this year, compared to none in Canada.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, which could lower the burden of his sweeping tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "The president said in remarks from the Oval Office that the two countries are \"affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle.\"",
      "The president said in remarks from the Oval Office that the two countries are \"affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle of international trade.\" The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term and comes as the president has used tariffs \u2014 and the threat of the levies \u2014 as leverage to bring other countries to the table to negotiate trade deals with his administration.",
      "Mr. Trump said the details of the agreement are still being finalized and expects it to be finished in the coming weeks. But he said it includes \"billions of dollars\" of increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, including for American agricultural products like beef and ethanol.",
      "Britain will also \"reduce or eliminate\" non-tariff barriers that Mr. Trump said discriminate against U.S. products, and fast-track American imports through U.K. customs, the president announced.",
      "He called the agreement a \"great deal for both our countries\" and said it is opening up access to Britain for U.S. products.",
      "\"It's going to be something very special for the U.K. and special for the United States,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Delivering brief remarks by speakerphone, Starmer said the framework will boost trade between the U.S. and the U.K., protect and create jobs and open market access. Starmer called it a \"historic day\" that is a \"real tribute to the history that we have of working so closely together.\"",
      "The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports, which was unveiled by the president last month as part of his \"Liberation Day\" announcement, remains in place. But under the plan, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates, according to the White House.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the deal will raise $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. as a result of the 10% tariff on imports from the U.K. As part of the agreement, Rolls Royce engines will not be subject to tariffs, and a British airline will buy $10 billion in Boeing planes, the commerce secretary said.",
      "Mr. Trump had teased the announcement Wednesday, writing on social media that he would unveil a \"major trade deal\" with a \"big, highly respected country,\" which he did not identify at the time. On Thursday morning, the president posted on Truth Social that it \"should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\"",
      "\"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,\" he added. \"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!\"",
      "A social media post from Mr. Trump said the framework will raise $5 billion in new export opportunities for American farmers, ranchers and producers, and strengthen national security for both the U.S. and the U.K.",
      "\"This deal shows that if you respect America, and bring serious proposals to the table, America is OPEN FOR BUSINESS,\" the post said, teasing that there are \"many more to come.\"",
      "Starmer's office said the prime minister would give an \"update\" about U.S. trade talks later in the day.",
      "\"As you know, talks with the U.S. have been ongoing and you'll hear more from me about that later today,\" Starmer said at a defense conference in London.",
      "Mr. Trump placed a 10% tax on imports from Britain, as well as 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum on the premise that doing so would foster more factory jobs domestically.",
      "A major goal of British negotiators has been to reduce or lift the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel. The U.S. is the largest destination for British cars, accounting for more than a quarter of U.K. auto exports in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "Britain has also sought tariff exemptions for pharmaceuticals, while the U.S. wants greater access to the British market for agriculture products. Starmer's government has said it won't lower U.K. food standards to allow in chlorine-rinsed American chicken or hormone-treated beef.",
      "If a deal is announced, the British government will see it as a vindication of Starmer's emollient approach to Mr. Trump, which has avoided direct confrontation or criticism. Unlike the European Union, Britain didn't announce retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Mr. Trump's import taxes.",
      "A trade deal with the United Kingdom would be symbolically important and a relief for British exporters. But an agreement would do little to address Mr. Trump's core concern about persistent trade deficits that prompted him to impose import taxes on countries around the world.",
      "The U.S. ran a $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the U.K. last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods that the U.S. imported from the U.K. last year accounted for just 2% of all goods imported into the country.",
      "The U.S. is much more important to the U.K. economy. It was Britain's biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain's exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods.",
      "Mr. Trump has shown a desire to strike a trade agreement with the U.K. since it voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. Yet as recently as Tuesday, Mr. Trump showed no awareness of the possible terms of the deal when asked about its possibility.",
      "\"They're offering us concessions?\" Mr. Trump remarked to reporters. \"I hope so. ... They do want to make a deal very badly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said that his leverage in talks would be U.S. consumers, but he appeared to suggest that the U.K. would also start buying more American-made goods.",
      "\"I think that the United Kingdom, like every other country, they want to ... go shopping in the United States of America,\" he said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week that the administration is moving forward with \"all deliberate speed\" to reach agreements with 17 trading partners. He said he anticipates \"agreements in principle,\" and after they're reached, the administration \"will paper them over\" in the coming months.",
      "Mr. Trump said during his Oval Office remarks that there are \"numerous deals\" in the works. Bessent is set to travel to Switzerland on Thursday for a trip that will include a meeting with Chinese officials. The president said he is open to speaking with Chinese President Xi Jinping after the meeting.",
      "A trade deal with the U.S. is one of several that Starmer's government is seeking to reach. On Tuesday, Britain and India announced a trade after three years of negotiations. The U.K. is also trying to lift some of the barriers to trade with the European Union imposed when Britain left the bloc in 2020.",

      "President Trump on Thursday criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for holding interest rates steady at the Fed's May 7 meeting, calling him a \"fool\" for acting \"too late\" in cutting the central bank's benchmark rate.",
      "Mr. Trump's post on his Truth Social app is the latest in a string of criticisms he's launched at Powell for holding rates steady this year. Meanwhile, the Bank of England on Thursday cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% amid concerns over the potential shock to global growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration.",
      "The Federal Reserve's last rate cut was made in December 2024, when the central bank lowered the rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, where it still stands.",
      "In a press conference yesterday, Powell articulated the Fed's reasoning for holding steady, including that economic data \u2014 for now \u2014 shows that the U.S. is in relatively good shape. The Fed chair also noted that its policymakers want to hold off on making any moves until the effects of Mr. Trump's economic policies become clearer, such as the impact of his broad tariffs on inflation and economic growth.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday inaccurately claimed there is \"virtually NO INFLATION.\" Inflation rose 2.4% on an annual basis in March, which reflects a cooler pace than in the prior months yet is still above the Fed's stated goal of reaching a 2% annual pace.",

A broad range of enterprises have announced price hikes due to tariffs, while experts warn of potential pandemic-like\u00a0supply shortages to come as early as summer.",
      "Where do negotiations stand?",
      "While the Trump administration has floated a few different timelines for deals to be announced, it has not specified any dates or countries.",
      "\"I'd be surprised if we don't have more than 80% or 90% of those wrapped up by the end of the end of the year. And that may be much sooner,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers on Tuesday, referring to countries with which the U.S. has trade deficits.",
      "Some experts, however, believe negotiations will take longer.",
      "Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics believes that countries with whom the Trump administration is negotiating will have it in their interest to move slowly in their trade discussions. That's because of the longterm implications these deals will have, the former South Korean trade minister told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Negotiations will likely drag past May into June, according to Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, although some countries might be motivated to act quickly.",
      "\"Everyone facing negotiations has been told to submit letters with their 'best offers,'\" Bremmer said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, \"and smaller countries that desperately want/need deals are complying.\"",
      "Who is the U.S. negotiating with?",
      "Bessent told the House committee Tuesday that the U.S. has 18 \"important trading relationships\" and is currently negotiating with 17 to reach deals. \"Many of our trading partners have approached us with very good offers and we are in the process of renegotiating those,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration in recent weeks has discussed trade and tariffs with Canada, Italy, India, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "It's unclear which deals will be announced first, but Clayton Allen, who covers politics and policy in Washington for Eurasia Group, said to look for deals with Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and India \u2014 countries that have been engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S. the longest.",
      "Eurasia predicts a deal with Japan could come in mid-June.",
      "China absent from negotiations for now",
      "What Bessent did make clear to Congress on Tuesday is that the U.S. has not yet entered into active trade talks with China.\u00a0 President Trump in April said that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid tariff tensions, but\u00a0China denied\u00a0any talks between Beijing and Washington had taken place.",
      "The Treasury secretary, however, is set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend while conducting trade talks in Switzerland, the Trump administration\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday.",
      "A\u00a0post\u00a0from the Chinese Embassy on X confirmed the meeting. \"Based on full consideration of global expectations, China's interests, and the appeals of the U.S. business community and consumers, #China has decided to agree to engage with the #US side,\" the posts reads. \"As China's lead on China-U.S. economic and trade affairs, Vice Premier He Lifeng will hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during his visit to #Switzerland from May 9 to 12.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the embassy said in a statement Wednesday that the U.S. has reached out to China \"through various channels\" and that the talks are being held \"at the request of the U.S. side.\" The spokesperson added that China \"firmly\u2002oppose[s]\u2002the U.S. abuse of tariffs.\"",
      "In a press briefing on Thursday, Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong reiterated this stance, saying the U.S.\u00a0\"needs to show sincerity to talk and be prepared to rectify its wrongdoing and cancel unilateral tariffs,\" according to\u00a0Bloomberg.",
      "What could trade agreements look like?",
      "While it's hard to predict what any potential tariff deals might include, Yeo, who has helped orchestrate several bilateral and mulitlateral trade negotiations in the past, said such agreements would likely be nonbinding \"gentlemen's agreements\" or memorandums of understanding.",
      "In other words, the U.S. could come to an agreement with a trading partner only to renege later on by issuing additional tariffs.",
      "\"The framework deal is only as good as the nice piece of paper that you write it down on,\" said Eurasia's Allen. \"Trade deals are very, very complex animals, and you're going to get probably top line agreement on some key issues of concern with a promise to come back and negotiate other things,\" he said.",
      "Asked by Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce about the format of the deals, Bessent on Tuesday said, \"I expect that we can see a substantial reduction in the tariffs that we are being charged, as well as nontariff barriers, currency manipulation and the subsidies of both labor and capital investment.\"",
      "More details on tariffs may be coming soon. During an Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that his team would spell out specific tariff rates for each country \u2014 although he clarified that number could be adjusted in the future.",
      "\"It's going to be a very fair number, it'll be a low number,\" the President said. \"We're not looking to hurt countries, we want to help countries. We want to be friendly with countries.\"",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is again leaving its benchmark interest rate at 4.25% to 4.5%, citing rising economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged, resisting pressure from President Trump to lower U.S. borrowing costs as policy makers assess the economic impact of his trade policies.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since the central bank last moved to lower short-term rates in December.",
      "The federal funds rate \u2014 the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 helps determine what businesses and consumers pay in interest on loans and credit card debt.",
      "What does the Fed say about the economy?",
      "The Fed, which has a dual mandate to keep inflation low while maintaining a healthy job market, on Wednesday signaled that economic risks are on the rise.",
      "Concerns that Mr. Trump's tariffs could spur both higher inflation and unemployment were highlighted by Fed chair Jerome Powell in a press conference to talk about the central bank's decision. But Powell noted that while consumer and business sentiment has sharply dropped, the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs haven't yet materialized in hard economic data.",
      "\"We've judged that the risk to higher inflation and unemployment has risen\" since March, when the Fed last met, Powell said. But, he added, \"We can't say which way this will shake out.\"",
      "Because of the uncertainty of the economy's path under the Trump administration's trade policies, the central bank wants to take a wait-and-see approach, Powell added. At the benchmark rate's current level, the Fed has the flexibility to cut rates if unemployment rises, or hike rates if inflation reignites due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, he noted.",
      "At the same time, Powell noted there are concerns that the Fed could face a situation where its dual mandate is in tension, which could occur if inflation and unemployment simultaneously spike. In that scenario, the central bank would need to focus on which side of the mandate is the farthest from the Fed's goal, and prioritize taming that part of the economy, he added.",
      "\"This would be a complicated and challenging judgment we would have to make,\" Powell said. \"If the two goals are in tension \u2014 if unemployment is moving up in an uncomfortable way, and so is inflation \u2014 we would look at how far they are\" from the Fed's targets, and focus first on the economic issue that's under greater stress, he added.",
      "Wall Street interpreted Powell's comments as signaling an increased risk that the U.S. economy could slide into stagflation, or a combination of slower economic growth and higher inflation.",
      "\"The Fed still sees the economy on solid footing, but acknowledges upside risk to both sides of their mandate \u2014 unemployment and inflation \u2014 because of tariffs,\" Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in an email. \"With stagflation risks rising, the Fed's communications will emphasize patience until there is enough clarity in the data.\"",
      "What the Fed decision means",
      "The Fed's to hold interest rates steady comes amid pressure from Mr. Trump to cut interest rates, with the president\u00a0writing\u00a0on social media last month that the central bank has been \"TOO LATE AND WRONG\" for holding off on further reductions.",
      "The latest Fed statement offers no clues on when it might consider easing monetary policy, according to Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"We continue to expect that, with tariffs likely to generate a modest slowdown in GDP growth to around 1.5%, the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged for all of this year,\" he said in a report.",
      "Economists are forecasting that Mr. Trump's tariffs will boost inflation later this year. That could provide the Fed with the impetus to cut rates, although inflation\u00a0cooled in March.",
      "Given more subdued inflation and a buoyant job market, most economists had\u00a0projected\u00a0that the Fed would maintain interest rates at today's meeting, despite some headwinds such as eroding\u00a0consumer confidence\u00a0and a sharp decline in\u00a0first-quarter\u00a0U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"For the time being the Fed remains in a holding pattern as it waits for uncertainty to clear,\" said Ashish Shah, CIO of public investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email after the Fed's announcement.",
      "Shah added, \"Recent better-than-feared jobs data has supported the Fed's on-hold stance, and the onus is on the labor market to weaken sufficiently to bring a resumption of its easing cycle.\"",

      "President Trump slammed Gavin Newsom on Tuesday just hours after the California governor asked for collaboration on a massive film tax credit.",

      "His request came after the president announced over the weekend that he would impose 100% tariffs on all films produced outside the U.S. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the nation's movie industry was \"DYING a very fast death.\"",
      "The film industry has taken multiple hits in recent years, notably the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the Hollywood strikes in 2023. Production has failed to return to pre-pandemic levels since\u00a0experiencing a 22% drop in the first quarter of 2025 from 2024 levels.",
      "Last year, Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass proposed an increase in California's annual film tax credit\u00a0from $330 million to $750 million.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke about Newsom and many other topics when questioned by reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday. A day earlier, during a meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others to announce that the NFL draft would be held in Washington in 2027, the president also talked about Newsom and Hollywood.",
      "He said the American film industry has been \"decimated\" by other countries and the \"grossly incompetent\" Newsom, which he said caused the film industry to \"abandon\" the U.S. But he vowed that \"we'll get it back.\" He said he'll be meeting with some film industry executives to \"make sure they're happy with\" the prospective tariffs.",
      "The president referred to the California High-Speed Rail\u00a0project, which would run between San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
      "\"A little train going from San Francisco to Los Angeles that's being run by Gavin Newscum, the governor of California. Ever heard of Gavin Newscum?\" Mr. Trump said. \"That train is the worst cost overrun thing I've ever seen. ... It's hundreds of billions for a stupid project that should've never been built.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did have some brief but kind words for Newsom in the midst of his barrage.",
      "\"And Gavin, you know, I always like Gavin, had a good relationship with him,\" he said.",
      "He also touched on the January wild fires, claiming that he gave water to California.",
      "\"I just got him a lot of water. I sent in people to open up that water, because he refused to do it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If they would have had that water and if they would have done what I said to do, they wouldn't have had the fires in Los Angeles, those fires would have been put out very quickly,\"",
      "The president visited Los Angeles in late-January with the first lady, weeks after two massive fires devastated opposite ends of Los Angeles County. He was greeted by Newsom when he landed at the airport.",
      "\"I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the side of it, we flew over it in a helicopter. We flew to a few of the areas, and it is devastation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comments ended with a challenge for the Golden State's governor.",
      "\"I'd love him to run for president on the other side. I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone, well, that and the fires and a lot of other things pretty much put him out of the race,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Top advisers have sent President Trump a plan to create a government-run investment fund, a request the president made earlier this year \u2014 but the White House has rejected parts of the proposal, CBS News has learned.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to jointly develop a proposal for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund by early May.",
      "It has been submitted, multiple sources told CBS News on Wednesday. However, the White House had concerns about the approach taken by Treasury, one of the sources said.",
      "Details on the mechanics of the fund continue to be debated, and no announcement is imminent, one source said.",
      "\"In accordance with President Trump's executive order, the Treasury and Commerce Departments have formulated plans for a Sovereign Wealth Fund, but no final decisions have yet been made,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The Administration remains committed to using every tool available to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard America's national and economic security.\"",

      "Mr. Trump has not determined how proceeds from the sovereign wealth fund would be spent, sources said. In the past, he has suggested the fund could own a stake in TikTok, the popular social media platform that faces a U.S. ban unless China-based parent company ByteDance divests from it.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-maha-food-box-replace-csfp-low-income-seniors/",
    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 17:31:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has a new plan to get \"healthy\" food to low-income seniors, but an anti-hunger advocate fears many will miss out.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposed budget for next year could include big changes for a small food aid program that helps low-income senior citizens supplement their diets. Under the plan, funding for the program \u2014 called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) \u2014 would be cut, and seniors instead would receive what the Trump administration is calling \"MAHA food boxes\" filled with products sourced directly from farmers.",
      "The food boxes \u2014 whose name stems from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to \"Make America Healthy Again\" \u2014 could eventually also be rolled out to either \"supplant or complement current USDA programs,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The agency didn't disclose what other government programs could integrate use of the MAHA food boxes.",
      "The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, more commonly known as food stamps. The agency also oversees other food aid programs such as Women, Infants and Children, which is aimed at pregnant women and kids, as well as the National School Lunch program.",
      "\"Unlike the current approach using food banks, which provide those in need with shelf-stable foods that are high in sodium and other harmful ingredients, MAHA boxes would be filled with commodities sourced from domestic farmers and given directly to American households,\" the Trump budget proposal notes.",
      "The CSFP helps about 730,000 low-income seniors annually through its $389 million budget, according to the USDA. By comparison, the food-stamp program spent about $100 billion last year to provide assistance to 41 million Americans, according to the USDA.",
      "\"We have no details\"",
      "The CSFP is essential for low-income seniors who are struggling to put food on the table, said George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program, a nonprofit\u00a0in Philadelphia. He expressed concern about the Trump administration's plans to replace the CSFP with food boxes, noting the logistical complexity of getting perishable food from farmers directly to older Americans.",
      "Another question is whether the foods included in the food boxes would meet the needs of seniors who often need shelf-stable foods because many struggle to get to the store, Matysik said.",
      "\"What we do know is that the program that we currently have is working, and seniors have come to rely on us,\" he said. \"We have no details [about logistics of the MAHA food boxes], and this has been a continued challenge that we've had with this administration, where decisions are sort of made overnight.\"",
      "Share Food Program relies on $4.5 million in CSFP funding to provide 32-pound food boxes to more than 7,000 seniors in the Philadelphia region who earn less than roughly $23,000 per year. Matysik disagreed with the Trump administration's claims that the program provides unhealthy foods to seniors, noting the boxes typically contain products such as canned vegetables, lean proteins and pastas.",
      "\"For seniors, a lot of times it can be hard to make it out to the grocery store \u2014 it can be hard to get those core items that folks need,\" he added. \"What we do at Share Food Program is take it directly to the doorstep of about 4,500 seniors, so not only are we providing that nutrition, but we're making it easy on the seniors.\"",
      "The Trump budget proposal represents a wish list for the current administration, and it isn't certain that funding for the CSFP would be cut.",
      "But the plan comes amid a larger push by the Trump administration to reduce spending on similar programs, such as a decision in March to cut two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks and instead have them source food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "The Kennedy effect",
      "The MAHA food boxes would provide a twofold benefit, the USDA said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"MAHA boxes would be more wholesome foods, and similar to the Farmers to Families Food Box, fresh foods,\" the agency said. It added that \"the most obvious\" benefit would be \"the removal of administrative middlemen from the distribution of food.\"",
      "The Farmers to Families Food Box, a pandemic food program that ran from May 2020 to May 2021, relied on more than 200 contractors to deliver millions of boxes to needy families, according to a 2021 analysis from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The study found that the 21 biggest contractors were collectively awarded $3 billion to deliver the boxes.",
      "MAHA, meanwhile, is part of a push by Kennedy to promote natural foods and alternative medicines. As head of HHS, he's pressing the food industry to stop using\u00a0synthetic food dyes\u00a0and has pledged to remove processed foods from school lunches.",
      "The USDA has signaled its openness to the MAHA platform, with Secretary Brooke Rollins saying she plans to approve a plan from Arkansas to ban the use of food stamps for purchasing sodas and candy. Anti-hunger advocates have said such restrictions can be stigmatizing for low-income Americans.",
      "In the meantime, Matysik said he's worried about the future of the CSFP program and the seniors who rely on it.",
      "\"Our seniors in particular are already hurting,\" he said. \"We're hearing about cuts to the SNAP program. We're seeing about cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. We're really worried about our senior citizens in this funding environment from our federal government right now.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 14:13:49 -0400",
    "summary": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren is urging other Democrats not to support a bipartisan crypto regulation bill, as Democrats warn about President Trump's ties to crypto.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are rebelling against a crypto regulation bill, putting the first-of-its-kind legislation in jeopardy ahead of a possible key vote on it later this week.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance.",
      "The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins.",
      "Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday \"we need to start moving forward.\" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes.",
      "Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said the stablecoin bill advanced out of the committee with the caveat that improvements would be made before it was brought up for a floor vote. But Republicans moved ahead without addressing Democrats' concerns on provisions involving anti-money laundering, national security and consumer protections, Gallego said.",
      "\"I think the purpose of that was really to put Democrats in a bad position and try to force us to vote for it,\" Gallego told MeidasTouch in an interview posted Wednesday.",
      "\"You can't try to f*** us and then say, hey, deal with it,\" Gallego added. \"That's just not going to work, especially when you still need our votes.\"",
      "A few Republican senators \u2014 Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Josh Hawley of Missouri and John Kennedy of Louisiana \u2014 have also indicated that they could vote against the bill for various other reasons.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures.",
      "\"Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,\" it says.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, \"Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption.\"",
      "The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets.",
      "\"Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,\" Merkley said in a statement. \"This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately.\"",
      "The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act.",
      "On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's \"serious risks\" to the U.S. economy.",
      "The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole.",
      "The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth \u2014 or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024.",
      "In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's \"assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.\"",
      "\"Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,\" she said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News last week, World Liberty said the Abu Dhabi deal represents the \"single largest-ever investment in a crypto company\" and sets a \"historic precedent.\" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, is seeking records and documents about Mr. Trump's crypto ventures from Fight Fight Fight LLC, the company that launched Mr. Trump's meme coin, and World Liberty Financial.",
      "The senator sent letters to both companies on Tuesday requesting the records, including communications between both companies, the Trump Organization, the president, his administration and foreign governments.",

The Transportation Security Administration said it will no longer accept IDs that don't comply with Real ID requirements.",

      "If you still need to update your ID, you're not alone.\u00a0CBS News data shows that dozens of states are behind on compliance. You can still travel without a Real ID, but will need to bring another acceptable form of identification, as outlined by the TSA.",
      "Here's what you need to know as the Real ID requirements takes effect on Wednesday.",
      "What is a Real ID?",
      "The Real ID is a federally compliant license, learner permit or nondriver ID card issued by state driver's license agencies. You can tell if a state-issued license or ID card is a Real ID if it has a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "The symbol might look slightly different depending on the state from where it's issued: California, for example, puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",

      "Americans will need to show Real IDs to access certain federal facilities \u2014 including TSA checkpoints \u2014 enter nuclear power plants and board commercial aircraft, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).",
      "Am I required to get a Real ID?",
      "Real or Enhanced IDs are only required for those over 18 without a valid U.S. passport who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification.",
      "That's said, Real IDs are considered a more secure form of identification than a classic driver's license.",
      "The requirement for Real IDs was established by Congress in 2005, following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the Federal Government \"set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses,\" according to the Department of Homeland Security.",

      "How much does a Real ID cost?",
      "Prices vary by state. In\u00a0New York, for example, there is no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the normal transactional cost you pay for a standard license, ID or renewal. Pennsylvania, however, charges a \"one-time $30 Real ID fee\" on top of standard renewal fees. New York charges an additional $30 fee for Enhanced IDs.",
      "It's best to check your state's Real ID guidelines for an accurate estimate of how much you'll pay. The same goes for Enhanced IDs.",

      "Each state has a driver's licensing agency that issues Real IDs. To find out how to apply where you live, visit the DHS website and click on your state of residence for specific instructions. DHS recommends that you visit your state's driver's licensing agency website to find out exactly what documentation you'll need to brings in order to obtain a Real ID.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 06:59:25 -0400",
    "summary": "The IRS, hit by the Trump administration's federal workforce cuts, has lost 31% of its auditors through March, government watchdog finds.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's plan to trim the IRS workforce has resulted in almost one-third of its tax auditors leaving the agency through March, according to a report from the U.S. Treasury Department's watchdog.",
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has sought to trim the federal workforce through a combination of layoffs and so-called deferred resignation. Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla,\u00a0said\u00a0on the electric vehicle maker's April 22 earnings call that DOGE's efforts \"in addressing waste and fraud\" will \"get the country back on track.\"",
      "The IRS has been a focus of DOGE's cost-cutting efforts, with plans to trim as much as 40% of its workforce this year. Through March, those efforts have resulted in the tax agency losing about 11% of its workforce, the May 2 report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found.",
      "But revenue agents \u2014 the IRS workers who perform audits \u2014 have seen a much bigger hit, with 31% of those workers, or about 3,600 auditors, taking either the deferred resignation plan or getting fired in the first three months of 2025, the report found. Losing a large share of auditors could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, given that these agents typically handle cases involving wealthy taxpayers or corporations, experts say.",
      "\"You lose the very staff trained to keep high-end taxpayers and corporate tax payers in compliance,\" noted Emily DiVito, senior adviser on economic policy at the left-leaning Groundwork Collaborative and a former policy adviser at the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS.",
      "She added, \"You can see some behavioral effects when taxpayers, especially those that really don't want to pay their bills, come to accept there is very little risk to not paying at all, or even filing.\"",
      "Reached for comment, a Treasury spokeswoman said, \"The Biden Administration grew the IRS from 79,431 to 102,309 personnel. Under new leadership, approximately the same number of employees have left the IRS, with a vast majority leaving voluntarily through the Deferred Resignation Program. The roll back of wasteful Biden-era hiring surges, and consolidation of critical support functions are vital to improve both efficiency and quality of service. The Secretary is committed to ensuring that efficiency is realized while providing the collections, privacy, and customer service the American people deserve.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately return a request for comment about the TIGTA report.",
      "While the TIGTA report didn't explain why auditor departures outpaced that of overall cuts at the IRS, the tax agency had made an effort under the Biden administration to hire more auditors in order to beef up revenue collection. In February 2024, the IRS had said it expected to collect hundreds of billions in additional taxes after using funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to hire more auditors.",
      "Because the DOGE cuts have focused on firing so-called \"probationary workers,\" or junior federal employees who typically have less than a year or two on the job, there may have been more newly hired auditors who were impacted by the reductions, DeVito said.",
      "Reducing federal revenue?",
      "Auditing wealthy Americans and corporations can be lucrative for the federal government. In fiscal year 2023, auditors recommended an additional $32 billion in tax assessments, the TIGTA report said.",
      "And every $1 spent on auditing the top 0.1% of earners can return about $26 in tax revenue, according to an analysis from Better IRS, an advocacy group for free tax filing.",
      "The cuts to the IRS' auditing force raises questions about the effectiveness of DOGE's efforts, given that the tax agency is responsible for collecting the bulk of the nation's revenue, DeVito added.",
      "The combination of individual and corporate income taxes provides about 60 cents for every $1 in federal revenue, with the remaining 40 cents coming from payroll taxes and fees, such as paying admission to national parks, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "DOGE's cost-cutting efforts may end up costing almost as much as they've saved, according to an analysis last month from the nonpartisan research group the Partnership for Public Service.",
      "DOGE claims to have saved $165 billion, but the Partnership for Public Service estimates that the savings have come at a cost of $135 billion due to paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity. That figure also excludes the impact of multiple lawsuits filed against DOGE's actions, as well as lost tax revenue due to IRS cuts, the group said.",
      "The IRS could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an\u00a0estimate\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "\"The argument from DOGE is to save money \u2014 that if we don't have as big of a federal workforce, then we are saving the government money,\" DeVito said. But given the potential to lose out on tax revenue, the IRS reduction \"simply doesn't make sense,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The Kamler family, owner of Fairfield, New Jersey-based Kent International, has been in the bicycle business for four generations.",
      "\"When I joined the company in 1972, we had six employees, including both my parents and myself,\" former Kent International CEO Arnold Kamler told CBS News. \"And as of a few months ago we had over 200 employees.\"",
      "Arnold took over Kent International from his father. Now his son, Scott Kamler, is CEO. They sell about two million bikes per year in the U.S. and they're one of Walmart's biggest suppliers. But President Trump's plan for tariffs is throwing a wrench into their American dream.",
      "About 90% of Kent bikes are imported from China. The rest are assembled in the U.S. at their factory in South Carolina with parts from Asia. Kent had been paying 25% tariffs on bikes and bike parts coming from China since the first Trump administration. But under the tariffs implemented by Mr. Trump last month, a recent shipment that was delayed and arrived during the new tariff period forced the company to pay a combined 181.47% in import duties and tariffs.",
      "During the one-month period from March 20 to April 20, Kent Bikes paid $3.1 million in tariffs alone.",
      "Under the new tariffs, a bicycle wheel imported from China that would have previously cost between $10 and $12 increased to about $30, according to Arnold.",
      "He says that makes him feel \"really bad\" and \"angry.\"",
      "\"China is not paying these tariffs,\" Arnold said. \"We have an account with U.S. customs where they automatically deduct once a month, the import duty, from our account. And so, it's not only import duty, but these tariffs are deducted.\"",
      "The company cancelled its new orders from China for April, and it doesn't have any plans to place new orders in May.",
      "Even if tariffs against China are reduced by the Trump administration, there are dozens of other countries facing new tariffs. So trying to find other foreign vendors seems futile.",
      "\"We had already shifted some of our business, almost half our business, to several of the countries on that list,\" Kamler   said. \"And we're getting out of China and now we're still getting slammed. It's just completely unfair.\"",
      "Arnold indicates that fully manufacturing and assembling their bikes in the U.S. is not financially tenable from a cost-perspective.",
      "\"I can't even calculate that high,\" Kamler   said about what he thinks a bike would cost to produce here. \"I'll just tell you one quick story. There was a company that came to us a couple years ago. They wanted to make handlebars for us. Now we used to make our own handlebar for about a dollar-and- a-half, and we saved some money by buying it from Asia. And this company took three months to give me the quotation for a simple BMX handlebar. And the price came back at $12. I said, '$12? It's about 80 cents of steel. How could you be?' 'Well, there's a lot of work.' And I said, 'OK, thank you, you can lose my number.' So, you can take that (as) kind of (an) example\u2026I mean, a $100-bicycle here would be a $1,000 if all the parts were made here right now.\"",

      "\"The world has been coming to the U.S., and China has been the missing piece,\" Bessent said on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 06 May 2025 19:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Many investments Mr. Trump claims credit for predate his return to office or are based on vague future pledges. Here's a fact check of his claims.",
    "story": [
      "After President Trump was pressed on rising consumer prices and slowing economic growth, he defended his tariff policies by claiming they had spurred record investment in the United States.",
      "\"I think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview on\u00a0NBC's Meet the Press that aired Sunday. \"If you look at other presidents, there's never been anything like that.\"",
      "He has also repeatedly claimed that he secured more investment in his first two months than President Biden did in four years.",
      "Neither claim is supported by evidence, CBS News Confirmed found. While companies have announced hundreds of billions of dollars in planned investments since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the White House has not provided data showing the total approaches $9 trillion.",
      "Additionally, a CBS News review found that some investments highlighted by the White House were announced before Mr. Trump's reelection. The comparison to the Biden administration is also misleading: the president is citing future investments pledges, while contrasting them with a narrower list of projects that were in the works or completed by the end of his predecessor's term.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the claims.",
      "Some investments Trump claims credit for were announced under Biden",
      "The White House on April 29 said Mr. Trump had secured $5 trillion of U.S. investment in his first 100 days, and published a partial list titled \"The Trump Effect\" \u2014 which it said demonstrated \"his America First economic policies have sparked trillions of dollars in new investment.\"",
      "That list totals closer to $2 trillion from private companies, and around $5 trillion if commitments from foreign countries are included. The basis for the president's $9 trillion claim is unclear and the administration has not explained the discrepancy.",
      "A closer look at the White House list also shows some of the investments had been announced before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The list initially included a $4.1 billion commitment from Novelis, a Georgia-based aluminum company, to build a plant in southern Alabama. But construction for that project began in October 2022 and the $4.1 billion total investment was detailed in the company's February 2024 financial report. CBS News asked the White House on May 5 why the project was included; the administration did not answer the question, but by midday May 6 the project had been removed from the website.",
      "The Trump administration also claimed credit for a $1.5 billion pledge by Corning to invest in its solar products facility in Michigan. A company spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that $900 million of this funding was announced months before Mr. Trump assumed office. On April 29, Corning announced an additional $600 million investment, bringing the total to $1.5 billion.",
      "Likewise, the White House listed Johnson & Johnson's commitment to spend $55 billion over the next four years, but a company spokesperson confirmed that total includes a $2 billion investment \u2014 announced last October \u2014 in a facility in Wilson, North Carolina.",
      "The list also includes the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative announced by Open AI and Japan-based Softbank on Jan. 21, which had been in development for at least a year before Mr. Trump's inauguration. The companies said $100 billion would be deployed \"immediately,\" but offered few specifics on how or where the money would be spent.",
      "Comparing to investments under Biden",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he attracted more investment in two months than Biden did in four years, suggesting he brought in trillions in a matter of weeks while casting doubt that the former president secured even $1 trillion during his term.",
      "But there's no clear evidence to support his claim. A White House spokesperson said the president was referring to a December 2024 report from the Biden White House, which said the private sector committed at least $1 trillion to clean energy and manufacturing projects during Biden's term.",
      "However, Biden's list of investments highlighted \"a selection of private-sector investments in 21st century industries\" including green energy, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, based on project announcements in specific locations or factories under construction. The data on Biden's \"Investing in America\" spreadsheet also showed projects that closely resemble some on Mr. Trump's list.",
      "By comparison, the Trump administration's list includes broader, less specific investment pledges across a variety of industries \u2014 many without clear timelines or locations.",
      "For example, Mr. Trump's list highlights Apple's recent $500 billion pledge to U.S. manufacturing and training. However, as previously reported by The Washington Post, Apple also announced a $430 billion investment early in Biden's term, including a North Carolina engineering hub that was paused in 2024, and the Biden administration's report does not include any Apple investments in its tally.",
      "However, experts caution that announcements about planned investments don't guarantee action.",
      "\"Companies often will make announcements to essentially curry favor with an incoming administration to show how committed they are to the United States,\" said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S. \"It's not unusual whether it was President Trump or President Biden or President Obama.\"",
      "Presidents from both parties have claimed credit for projects started under their predecessors. For instance, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced investments during Mr. Trump's first term, some of which contributed to the construction of manufacturing facilities highlighted by the Biden White House investment report.",
      "During his term, Biden signed major pieces of legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which included $24 billion in tax credits to attract private investors in hopes of driving domestic manufacturing commitments.",
      "Such incentives may continue to fuel further projects during Mr. Trump's term, according to Nigro, provided they remain in place \u2014 but the long-term impact of federal policy, including under both Biden and Mr. Trump, may take years to assess.",
      "\"It's very hard to attach these new investments that have been announced as being tied directly to policies of the Trump administration. It's frankly just too early,\" Nigro said.",

      "The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its May 7 meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch. The group pegs the likelihood at 97% that the Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the same level that it's been at since December, when the central bank made its most recent reduction.",
      "The Fed's meeting comes at a time when the U.S. economy is sending mixed signals, with GDP unexpectedly falling into negative territory in the first quarter, while job growth topped forecasts in April. At the same time, Wall Street economists are hiking their recession risk\u00a0for the U.S. economy due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have hit imports from China with a 145% import duty \u2014 costs that are largely passed onto American consumers in the form of higher prices.",

      "\"Criticism from President Trump will not trigger a Fed policy response \u2014 neither an early cut without evidence of labor market deterioration, nor a stubborn refusal to cut once the labor market does soften, provided long-term inflation expectations remain anchored,\" noted Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius in a May 6 research note.",
      "When is the Fed expected to cut rates?",
      "Consumers eager for relief on borrowing costs are likely going to face a wait, according to economists.",
      "Following the May 7 meeting, the Fed will next meet on June 18, with economists currently expecting the central bank to also hold steady then, according to CME FedWatch. Its polling finds a 70% likelihood that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.5% at that meeting.",
      "However, it's more likely the Fed could slash rates at its July 30 meeting, with the probability of a rate cut sitting currently at 80%, FedWatch notes.",
      "But some economists expect the central bank to hold off even longer.",
      "\"We think the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates next year, as tariff-induced inflation begins to fade and the labor market shows more troubling signs,\" noted Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Ryan Sweet, who says he believes the first cut will occur in December.",
      "Why does Trump want a rate cut now?",
      "Mr. Trump argues that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social that there is \"NO INFLATION\" and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gas has dropped to $1.98 a gallon.",
      "But those claims are not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gas and oil prices have declined \u2014 gas costs are down 10% from a year ago \u2014 continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken. Still, AAA says gas prices nationwide average $3.18 a gallon.",
      "What does the Fed's decision mean for your money?",
      "Borrowers who are looking for relief on loan and credit card rates will have a wait ahead of them, experts say.",
      "\"There's just so much uncertainty in the economy now,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in an email. \"No one quite knows what the next few months will look like, but what does seem clear is that Americans are going to have wait at least a little longer for the Fed to cut rates.\"",
      "Schulz predicts that credit card rates could tick higher in the next few months, as well as auto loan rates.",
      "\"Banks are nervous about all of the uncertainty in the economy and what it means for consumers,\" he noted. \"When that happens, banks try to minimize risk as much as possible, and one of the ways they do that is to raise interest rates on credit cards.\"",
      "Because of that, consumers should focus on shopping around for the best rates they can find, as well as considering transferring existing high-interest credit card debt to 0% balance transfer cards, Schulz added.",

Experts warn that the sharp decline in trade activity could lead to COVID-19 pandemic-like shortages of products, including goods assembled in the U.S. or elsewhere that use materials or inputs from China.",
      "Many American retailers rushed to build up their inventories ahead of President Trump's sweeping levies, leading to a recent\u00a0spike in imports. Imports have since slowed, with a number of retailers foregoing orders on apparel, baby goods and other items that would typically be headed toward U.S. ports.",

      "Toys, games and sports equipment: More than $30 billion in toys, games and sports equipment sold in the U.S. is imported from China. That accounts for just over 73% of the country's total imports in the category. The trade war could spell shortages in children's toys come Christmastime, experts, as well as President Trump, have warned.",

      "Cutlery:\u00a0Dinner utensils manufactured in China could also start becoming scarce. The U.S. imports $3.1 billion in cutlery and metal tools from the country.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 16:36:13 -0400",
    "summary": "The Social Security Administration said it will now seek to recoup less money from beneficiaries. Advocates say the revised policy is still burdensome.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration is retreating from a recent policy change on the agency recovering overpayments that sparked concerns it could cause financial hardship for tens of thousands of beneficiaries.",
      "In an April 25 \"emergency message\" to Social Security employees, the agency said it is reducing its overpayment clawback rate to 50% from 100%. The change comes after SSA on March 27 started recovering erroneous overpayments to Social Security recipients by\u00a0taking 100%\u00a0of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up sharply from the prior rate of 10%.",
      "The agency didn't explain its reason for the change, nor immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The 100% clawback policy was directed by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to\u00a0cut costs\u00a0at the agency. Dudek said in a March 7 press release that the change was needed to \"properly safeguard taxpayer funds.\"",
      "The agency's move to recover overpayments has long been a pain point for thousands of beneficiaries who are overpaid each year, with many people unaware they had received a bigger benefit than they were entitled to until receiving notices from the Social Security Administration.",
      "The agency's inspector general found that 73,000 overpayments in 2022 were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations, rather than the fault of the beneficiary.",
      "\"SSA's automated systems could not compute benefit payments due in certain situations, and the Agency did not provide employees with a comprehensive tool to use when they had to manually calculate them. Without adequate automation tools, employees can make errors,\" the inspector general said in a report.",
      "Severe clawbacks cause hardship",
      "Last year, the Biden administration\u00a0capped the clawback rate\u00a0at 10% after reports that some seniors and disabled beneficiaries had been forced into financial hardship, including homelessness, due to the prior 100% clawback rate. But that 10% rate was only effective for about a year, with the the agency returning it to a 100% rate in March.",
      "Those most at risk from the government's stepped-up effort to recover overpayments are the roughly one-third of Social Security recipients who rely on their monthly benefit check for at least 75% of their income. Some seniors have told CBS News they were left\u00a0too financially strapped\u00a0to afford rent, food and other basics.",
      "Many of the overpayments involve disabled workers who receive payments through the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, whose recipients receive an average of $1,538 per month, said Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.",
      "One SSA\u00a0report found that SSDI has a higher rate of overpayments than the overall Social Security program because disabled recipients sometimes fail to report work income, which can occur if they're not aware they need to disclose extra earnings to the agency. Social Security\u00a0reduces benefits for disabled recipients who earn more than $1,620 a month.",
      "\"While walking back the clawback of overpayments from 100% to 50% is a step in the right direction, taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden to many workers with disabilities who receive SSDI,\" Adcock told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"A fifth of all SSDI beneficiaries rely on their benefits for almost all of their income. That means some SSDI recipients are still going to have trouble paying for rent, food, utilities and prescriptions\" with the 50% clawback rate.",
      "The Social Security Administration docked the the benefits of about 670,000 recipients by 10% for overpayment last year, according to KFF.",

    "story": [
      "Rennie Glasgow, who has served 15 years at the Social Security Administration, is seeing something new on the job: dead people.",
      "They're not really dead, of course. In four instances over the past few weeks, he told KFF Health News, his Schenectady, New York, office has seen people come in for whom \"there is no information on the record, just that they are dead.\" So employees have to \"resurrect\" them \u2014 affirm that they're living, so they can receive their benefits.",
      "Revivals were \"sporadic\" before, and there's been an uptick in such cases across upstate New York, said Glasgow. He is also an official with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represented 42,000 Social Security employees just before the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Martin O'Malley, who led the Social Security Administration toward the end of the Biden administration, said in an interview that he had heard similar stories during a recent town hall in Racine, Wisconsin. \"In that room of 200 people, two people raised their hands and said they each had a friend who was wrongly marked as deceased when they're very much alive,\" he said.",
      "It's more than just an inconvenience, because other institutions rely on Social Security numbers to do business, Glasgow said. Being declared dead \"impacts their bank account. This impacts their insurance. This impacts their ability to work. This impacts their ability to get anything done in society.\"",
      "\"They are terminating people's financial lives,\" O'Malley said.",
      "Though it's just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead.",
      "Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times, thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to \"self-deport.\"",
      "Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. \"Why don't you just do due diligence to make sure what you're doing in the first place is correct?\" he said.",
      "The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration's crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program's future.",
      "But KFF Health News' interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities.",
      "Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece's difficulties with Social Security's disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece's address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer \u2014 whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record \u2014 believes they could be zero.",
      "Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece's bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment.",
      "Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore.",
      "The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece's disability payments, \"then she will be homeless,\" Seda recalled telling an agency employee. \"I don't know if I'm going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.\"",
      "Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency's efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, \"it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,\" the committee recently told the agency's inspector general.",
      "While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they're owed, she said.",
      "For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according to a January survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance.",
      "Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that's nearly unprecedented in their experience.",
      "Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members' March payments were several days late. \"For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,\" she said. \"The delayed payment is not something I've heard in the last 20 years.\"",
      "When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Mr. Trump's \"resounding mandate\" to make government more efficient.",
      "\"He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,\" Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions.",
      "Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general's office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News.",
      "A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security \u2014 which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 \u2014 had nearly doubled in March compared with last year.",
      "Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it's getting worse as experienced employees have been let go.",
      "\"We're seeing more mistakes being made,\" said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years' experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. \"We're seeing more things get dropped.\"",
      "What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn't show.",
      "She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem \u2014 only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said.",
      "Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm's policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored \u2014 the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there.",
      "\"To be told they've never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Researchers and lawyers say they have a suspicion about what's behind the problems at Social Security: the Elon Musk-led effort to revamp the agency.",
      "Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O'Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. \"As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,\" he predicted in an April hearing held by House Democrats. \"It's going to mean that if you go to a field office, you're going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.\"",
      "The departures have hit the agency's regional payment centers hard. These centers help process and adjudicate some cases. It's the type of behind-the-scenes work in which \"the problems surface first,\" Romig said. But if the staff doesn't have enough time, \"those things languish.\"",
      "Languishing can mean, in some cases, getting dropped by important programs like Medicare. Social Security often automatically deducts premiums, or otherwise administers payments, for the health program.",
      "Lately, Melanie Lambert, a senior advocate at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, has seen an increasing number of cases in which the agency determines beneficiaries owe money to Medicare. The cash is sent to the payment centers, she said. And the checks \"just sit there.\"",
      "Beneficiaries lose Medicare, and \"those terminations also tend to happen sooner than they should, based on Social Security's own rules,\" putting people into a bureaucratic maze, Lambert said.",
      "Employees' technology is more often on the fritz. \"There's issues every single day with our system. Every day, at a certain time, our system would go down automatically,\" said Glasgow, of Social Security's Schenectady office. Those problems began in mid-March, he said.",
      "The new problems leave Glasgow suspecting the worst. \"It's more work for less bodies, which will eventually hype up the inefficiency of our job and make us, make the agency, look as though it's underperforming, and then a closer step to the privatization of the agency,\" he said.",

    "summary": "President Trump said in remarks from the Oval Office that the two countries are \"affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, which could lower the burden of his sweeping tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "The president said in remarks from the Oval Office that the two countries are \"affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle.\"",
      "The president said in remarks from the Oval Office that the two countries are \"affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle of international trade.\" The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term and comes as the president has used tariffs \u2014 and the threat of the levies \u2014 as leverage to bring other countries to the table to negotiate trade deals with his administration.",
      "Mr. Trump said the details of the agreement are still being finalized and expects it to be finished in the coming weeks. But he said it includes \"billions of dollars\" of increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, including for American agricultural products like beef and ethanol.",
      "Britain will also \"reduce or eliminate\" non-tariff barriers that Mr. Trump said discriminate against U.S. products, and fast-track American imports through U.K. customs, the president announced.",
      "He called the agreement a \"great deal for both our countries\" and said it is opening up access to Britain for U.S. products.",
      "\"It's going to be something very special for the U.K. and special for the United States,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Delivering brief remarks by speakerphone, Starmer said the framework will boost trade between the U.S. and the U.K., protect and create jobs and open market access. Starmer called it a \"historic day\" that is a \"real tribute to the history that we have of working so closely together.\"",
      "The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports, which was unveiled by the president last month as part of his \"Liberation Day\" announcement, remains in place. But under the plan, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates, according to the White House.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the deal will raise $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. as a result of the 10% tariff on imports from the U.K. As part of the agreement, Rolls Royce engines will not be subject to tariffs, and a British airline will buy $10 billion in Boeing planes, the commerce secretary said.",
      "Mr. Trump had teased the announcement Wednesday, writing on social media that he would unveil a \"major trade deal\" with a \"big, highly respected country,\" which he did not identify at the time. On Thursday morning, the president posted on Truth Social that it \"should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\"",
      "\"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,\" he added. \"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!\"",
      "A social media post from Mr. Trump said the framework will raise $5 billion in new export opportunities for American farmers, ranchers and producers, and strengthen national security for both the U.S. and the U.K.",
      "\"This deal shows that if you respect America, and bring serious proposals to the table, America is OPEN FOR BUSINESS,\" the post said, teasing that there are \"many more to come.\"",
      "Starmer's office said the prime minister would give an \"update\" about U.S. trade talks later in the day.",
      "\"As you know, talks with the U.S. have been ongoing and you'll hear more from me about that later today,\" Starmer said at a defense conference in London.",
      "Mr. Trump placed a 10% tax on imports from Britain, as well as 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum on the premise that doing so would foster more factory jobs domestically.",
      "A major goal of British negotiators has been to reduce or lift the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel. The U.S. is the largest destination for British cars, accounting for more than a quarter of U.K. auto exports in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "Britain has also sought tariff exemptions for pharmaceuticals, while the U.S. wants greater access to the British market for agriculture products. Starmer's government has said it won't lower U.K. food standards to allow in chlorine-rinsed American chicken or hormone-treated beef.",
      "If a deal is announced, the British government will see it as a vindication of Starmer's emollient approach to Mr. Trump, which has avoided direct confrontation or criticism. Unlike the European Union, Britain didn't announce retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Mr. Trump's import taxes.",
      "A trade deal with the United Kingdom would be symbolically important and a relief for British exporters. But an agreement would do little to address Mr. Trump's core concern about persistent trade deficits that prompted him to impose import taxes on countries around the world.",
      "The U.S. ran a $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the U.K. last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods that the U.S. imported from the U.K. last year accounted for just 2% of all goods imported into the country.",
      "The U.S. is much more important to the U.K. economy. It was Britain's biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain's exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods.",
      "Mr. Trump has shown a desire to strike a trade agreement with the U.K. since it voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. Yet as recently as Tuesday, Mr. Trump showed no awareness of the possible terms of the deal when asked about its possibility.",
      "\"They're offering us concessions?\" Mr. Trump remarked to reporters. \"I hope so. ... They do want to make a deal very badly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said that his leverage in talks would be U.S. consumers, but he appeared to suggest that the U.K. would also start buying more American-made goods.",
      "\"I think that the United Kingdom, like every other country, they want to ... go shopping in the United States of America,\" he said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week that the administration is moving forward with \"all deliberate speed\" to reach agreements with 17 trading partners. He said he anticipates \"agreements in principle,\" and after they're reached, the administration \"will paper them over\" in the coming months.",
      "Mr. Trump said during his Oval Office remarks that there are \"numerous deals\" in the works. Bessent is set to travel to Switzerland on Thursday for a trip that will include a meeting with Chinese officials. The president said he is open to speaking with Chinese President Xi Jinping after the meeting.",
      "A trade deal with the U.S. is one of several that Starmer's government is seeking to reach. On Tuesday, Britain and India announced a trade after three years of negotiations. The U.K. is also trying to lift some of the barriers to trade with the European Union imposed when Britain left the bloc in 2020.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marjorie-taylor-greene-renaming-gulf-of-mexico-gulf-of-america-house-vote/",
    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 12:15:59 -0400",
    "summary": "The bill would codify the name change, though it would carry no authority outside the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday passed a bill to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the \"Gulf of America,\" which would codify an executive order signed by President Trump on his first day in office.",
      "In a 211 to 206 vote, all but one Republican supporting the measure, which was introduced by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia in January and instructs federal agencies to update all documents and maps to reflect the name change within six months of enactment. It now goes to the Senate.",
      "Even if the name change is codified into U.S. law, however, other countries would be under no obligation to refer to the Gulf of Mexico by the new name. If it isn't codified, a future president could reverse Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "Greene lauded the measure ahead of the vote Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most important things that we can do this Congress,\" while claiming that Democrats are catering to Mexican cartels by opposing the name change.",
      "\"This is such an important thing to do for the American people,\" Greene said. \"The American people deserve pride in their country and they deserve pride in the waters that we own, that we protect with our military and our coastguard.\"",
      "Democrats have called the effort a waste of taxpayer dollars and said Congress should be spending its time on more serious issues. GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska was the sole Republican to oppose the measure.",
      "Bacon has publicly disagreed with his Republican colleagues, telling CNN earlier this week that the effort to rename the body of water \"seems juvenile.\"",
      "\"We're the United States of America,\" he said. \"We're not Kaiser Wilhelm's Germany or Napoleon's France. I just \u2014 we're better than this. It just sounds like a sophomore thing to do.\"",
      "The vote came as House Republicans clash over slashing Medicaid and other social safety net programs to pay for Mr. Trump's tax, border security and energy agenda.",
      "\"Instead of debating that very important and destructive legislation, they are speaking up today about this deeply unserious bill to rename a body of water,\" Rep. Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, said ahead of the vote Thursday. \"A Congress that more and more appears to just be a joke, is now advancing a bill that literally started off as a joke.\"",
      "An estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that it would cost less than $500,000 over five years to update federal documents and maps. But during a House Rules Committee meeting Monday to advance the measure, Democrats noted that schools, libraries and municipalities would bear the costs of updating textbooks, signs and other materials.",
      "\"If a school district can't afford to purchase an entirely new map, you know what? A sticker would do,\" said Rep. Michelle Fischbach, a Minnesota Republican, on Monday. \"Just put that over the top and put 'Gulf of America.' I mean, there are a lot of simple ways to deal with this.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the White House has dug in on the name change, restricting Associated Press reporters' access to events over the news organization's decision to refer to the Gulf by its original name, while also acknowledging the \"Gulf of America\" name. The Associated Press sued over the restrictions and a federal judge ruled that the White House restore its access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other spaces and events when they are open to other reporters.",
      "Whether the Senate will take up the measure remains unclear. Unlike the House, the bill would require support from a number of Democrats to move forward in the upper chamber. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CBS News ahead of the House vote that he hasn't \"thought that far ahead.\"",
      "\"We've got a lot of other stuff we've got directly in front of us at the moment,\" Thune added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-casey-means-surgeon-general-nominee/",
    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 10:25:32 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said his new pick for surgeon general, Dr. Casey Means, has \"impeccable\" credentials, after the White House withdrew his earlier nominee.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump will nominate Dr. Casey Means, an ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and prominent advocate for his agenda, to serve as the U.S. surgeon general, the president announced Wednesday.",
      "Means replaces Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, whose nomination was withdrawn\u00a0by the White House a day before she was scheduled to appear at a Senate confirmation hearing.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that Means \"has impeccable \"MAHA\" credentials\" \u2014 referring to the acronym for \"Make America Healthy Again,\" a slogan used by Kennedy.",
      "\"Her academic achievements, together with her life's work, are absolutely outstanding,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"Dr. Casey Means has the potential to be one of the finest Surgeon Generals in United States History.\"",
      "The surgeon general oversees 6,000 members of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, and helps set the national agenda on public health. The nominee must be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Who is Casey Means?",
      "Means was close to Kennedy during the campaign, along with her brother, Calley Means, who played a key role in orchestrating Kennedy's endorsement of Mr. Trump, according to some of Kennedy allies who played a role in the transition.",
      "Casey Means has\u00a0written about\u00a0how, after attending Stanford Medical School and training to become a surgeon, she opted to leave \"traditional medicine\" to devote her life to \"tackling the root cause of why Americans are sick.\"",
      "She co-founded Levels, a health app that can connect to glucose monitors, and has built a large following online for writing about health and wellness.",
      "Both Means siblings soared to prominence in recent years after viral interviews decrying the influence of the food and drug industry. Their views align with Kennedy's claims that unhealthy food and lifestyle choices underpin a vast swath of Americans' health conditions.",
      "\"Not only is our life expectancy declining, but our health during those years of life is poorer than ever due to preventable chronic diseases. Maybe we need to re-think our approach,\" she wrote in her newsletter. \"...This is the devil's bargain that drives our economy: we have a set of food, chemical, and agriculture industries that profit trillions per year from people consuming and using as much cheap, additive, chemical-filled food and products as possible, and we have a $4.5 trillion healthcare system that profits off of the resultant diseases that emerge.\"",
      "The two siblings authored the bestseller \"Good Energy\" after their mother died of pancreatic cancer, saying that she had been \"simply prescribed pills and not set on a path of curiosity about how these conditions are connected and how the root cause can be reversed.\"",
      "An interview the two did with Tucker Carlson \u2014 ranked by Apple as the most-shared podcast episode of 2024 \u2014 was titled \"The Truth About Ozempic, the Pill, and How Big Pharma Keeps You Sick.\"",
      "\"She's qualified. She's energetic. She's been a good communicator, which is the role of surgeon general. She seems to have good ethical moorings. And she reflects this new thinking about where HHS should be. I think it's a bold pick,\" Dr. Robert Malone, another close ally of Kennedy, told CBS News.",
      "Casey and Calley Means have also earned skepticism from some of Kennedy's anti-vaccine base, who have grown frustrated with what they fear has been Kennedy's drifting attention away from what they hoped would be a ban of several vaccines and towards a crackdown on unhealthy foods and additives like synthetic food dyes.",
      "\"The nutritional agenda is a core part of MAHA. It may not be their core part of MAHA. But there's no doubt that it's a central part of the overall mission,\" he said.",
      "Malone acknowledged the perception among some of Kennedy's base that Means had not been \"sufficiently vocal, early enough, in rejecting the mRNA vaccine products,\" as he had been.",
      "Malone himself rose to prominence criticizing the shots while painting himself as the inventor of mRNA vaccines, a claim that other scientists rejected as misinformation. He was with Kennedy and Mr. Trump in Florida on election night.",
      "Means has said she backs Kennedy \"relentlessly pushing for vaccine safety\" and said she thought it was \"criminal\" to require vaccinations. She has also claimed \"the current extreme and growing vaccine schedule\" could be \"causing health declines in vulnerable children. This needs to be investigated,\" she wrote on her website last year.",
      "Calley Means now serves as a special government employee, advising Kennedy and backing state bills promoting his agenda.",
      "Casey Means was initially favored as one contender for the surgeon general pick, some of Kennedy's allies said, but was passed over for Dr. Nesheiwat. Some of Kennedy's allies said they believed Nesheiwat's appearances on Fox News and ties to former national security adviser Mike Waltz, who is married to Nesheiwat's sister Julia, played a role in the president's decision.",
      "Nesheiwat's nomination was withdrawn Wednesday amid concerns about how she portrayed her credentials. For example, as\u00a0CBS News previously reported, she has publicly listed an M.D. from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine, but she actually got her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration may soon start deporting migrants to Libya, expanding its mass deportation campaign to the troubled North African country, two U.S. officials told CBS News Tuesday.",
      "The deportations, expected to be operated by the U.S. military, could start as early as this week, the officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal government plans.",
      "Libya is one of several far-flung nations the U.S. government has been asking to accept deportations of migrants from third countries, CBS News reported earlier this week.",
      "The possibility of U.S. deportations to Libya, reported earlier Tuesday by Reuters, is a stunning proposition given the deep political and social turmoil the North African country finds itself in, as well as its human rights record.",
      "Since a civil war erupted in 2011, Libya has been plagued by armed conflict and political tumult. The country, itself a corridor for desperate migrants hoping to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, is divided into two factions. The western part of the country is overseen by a United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, while the east is controlled by a strongman.",
      "The State Department has a Level 4 travel advisory for Libya, warning Americans not to travel there because of \"crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict.\"",
      "Libya has also gained infamy over its treatment of migrants seeking to reach Europe, with both advocates and U.S. officials finding that detainees in the North African country face brutal conditions, due process violations and even torture in immigration detention centers.",
      "It's unclear who exactly would be deported to Libya under the plans being considered by the Trump administration and whether they would be detained by authorities there upon arrival.",
      "After CBS News and other news outlets reported on the planned deportations, the rival governing factions in Libya both denied brokering a deportation agreement with the U.S.",
      "On Wednesday, a group of advocates filed an emergency motion in the federal district court in Massachusetts seeking to block any deportations to Libya. The advocates said a group of migrant detainees from Mexico and Asia were potentially at risk of being deported to Libya, without an opportunity to contest their deportation or a notification to their lawyers.",
      "Federal judge Brian Murphy said that if the reports were true and the administration moved forward with the deportations to Libya, it would \"clearly violate\" a ruling he issued in April prohibiting the government from deporting migrants to third countries, without notifying their lawyers and allowing them to contest their deportation.",
      "As part of its aggressive efforts to deter migrants from entering or staying in the U.S. illegally, the Trump administration has mounted an intense diplomatic campaign to forge deportations agreements that allow the U.S. to send migrants to countries that are not their own.",
      "It has already persuaded several Latin America countries to accept third country nationals, sending Asian and African migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, as well as a group of Venezuelan men accused of gang membership to El Salvador, which transferred them to a notorious mega prison.",
      "But the Trump administration has also sought to broker deportation agreements with countries in other continents, including Africa and Europe.",
      "The other countries U.S. officials have approached for potential third country deportation arrangements include Angola, Benin, Eswatini, Moldova and Rwanda, according to internal U.S. government documents and officials.",
      "It's unclear whether any of those countries will finalize agreements with the U.S. After CBS News identified Angola as one of the countries the U.S. had approached, its embassy in Washington said the West African country would not accept deportees from third countries.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration appears to have invoked the state secrets privilege to withhold information in the case involving the mistaken removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador and any efforts by the Trump administration to return him to the United States.",
      "The administration's assertion of the privilege was revealed in an order from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, which asked lawyers for Abrego Garcia and the Justice Department to file additional legal papers about the administration's \"invocations of privilege, principally the state secrets and deliberative process privileges.\"",
      "Xinis gave the two sides until Monday to submit the filings \"addressing the legal and factual bases for the invocation of those privileges,\" including a request from Abrego Garcia's lawyers for the court to conduct a review of \"the withheld documents.\" The judge also set a hearing for May 16 at the courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland.",
      "The Justice Department had indicated last month that it would invoke certain privileges to protect information regarding Abrego Garcia's removal from the U.S., citing in a filing the attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege and certain executive privileges.",
      "Administration lawyers had said that a request for documents from Abrego Garcia's legal team about the terms of any arrangement regarding the government's use of El Salvador's notorious prison to house deportees from the U.S. \"calls for the immediate production of classified documents, as well as documents that defendants may elect to assert are subject to the protections of attorney-client privilege and the state secrets privilege.\"",
      "Xinis told a lawyer with the administration during a hearing last month that if they do assert privileges, they must provide justifications for each claim, and she will make a determination as to whether they can stand.",
      "The Trump administration has invoked the state secrets privilege before, in a case involving the deportations of Venezuelan migrants to the Salvadoran prison, called the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "In Abrego Garcia's case, Xinis had ordered the Trump administration to turn over documents to his lawyers and allowed them to conduct depositions with certain administration officials. Some of the records were initially due last month, but Xinis agreed to push back her deadlines after the Trump administration filed information with the court under seal. One day earlier, Xinis had accused the administration of showing a \"willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\"",
      "Under the judge's latest order, the Trump administration had until Monday to answer and respond to outstanding discovery requests and provide information about their invocation of privileges. Depositions of four Homeland Security and State Department officials are to be completed by Friday, according to the order.",
      "Xinis allowed the expedited discovery process to begin last month after Abrego Garcia's legal team accused the Trump administration of failing to follow her order to facilitate his return to the U.S. The Supreme Court had agreed that the administration had to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "President Trump and other top administration officials have repeatedly said it is up to El Salvador whether to release Abrego Garcia, who had been held at CECOT. As of April 21, he was being held at\u00a0a lower-security facility\u00a0in Santa Ana, according to a declaration from a State Department official.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who was born in El Salvador, entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 and has been living in Maryland since then. He was granted a withholding of removal, a legal status, in 2019 that prevented the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador because of a risk of persecution by local gangs.",
      "But Abrego Garcia was among the hundreds of migrants sent by the Trump administration to CECOT in March.",
      "A federal immigration official acknowledged that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the administration has since declined to return him to the U.S. Instead, top administration officials have claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant. His lawyers, however, argue that Abrego Garcia is not a member of MS-13 or any other gang, and has never been charged or convicted of any crimes in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country.",

    "story": [
      "The federal government published more than 60,000 pages of records on Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's assassination late Wednesday \u2014 the second tranche of documents to be released on the 1968 slaying.",
      "The releases were ordered by President Trump in January, with backing from the senator's son, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has claimed for years that his father's convicted killer Sirhan Sirhan might be innocent.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the documents \"have been sitting in various storage facilities across the federal government for decades and had never been digitized or accessible to the public before.\" They were digitized by ODNI \u2014 which is led by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard \u2014 and posted on the National Archives website.",
      "\"Today's release is an important step toward maximum transparency, finding the truth, and sharing the truth,\" Gabbard said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "Mr. Trump has also ordered the release of documents on President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1968 killing. Some John F. Kennedy files were released in March, but the King documents have not been released.",
      "What's in the RFK files \u2014 and will we learn anything new?",
      "ODNI said the documents posted Wednesday include \"never-before-seen details about the FBI's investigation into the assassination of RFK \u2014 including the discussion of potential leads by various FBI offices, internal FBI memos detailing the progress of the case, and more.\"",
      "The records also include recordings of Los Angeles police interviews with Sirhan and eyewitnesses to the 1968 assassination, according to ODNI.",
      "But it's unclear whether the files will reveal new information about Robert F. Kennedy's killing.",
      "The senator's 1968 assassination was primarily investigated and prosecuted by authorities in Los Angeles. Documents from the local investigation \u2014 along with many records from a separate FBI probe \u2014 have been publicly available in California's state archives since the late 1980s. ODNI said some of the records that were published Wednesday had previously been handed over to the Los Angeles Police Department.",
      "What did last month's RFK files say?",
      "The government released a trove of 10,000 records on Robert F. Kennedy last month. A CBS News review found the documents included handwritten notes from Sirhan \u2014 including ones in which Sirhan wrote \"RFK must be disposed of like his brother was\" \u2014 as well as FBI memos on Sirhan, crime scene and autopsy photos, witness interviews and other materials.",
      "A few of those records make reference to common conspiracy theories about the assassination, including mentions of witnesses seeing a woman in a polka-dot dress or somebody shouting \"we shot him.\" Other witnesses said they didn't see anybody matching that description.",
      "Many of the details in those files were already publicly known.",
      "Who killed RFK \u2014 and what has RFK Jr. said?",
      "Sirhan was convicted of killing Robert F. Kennedy \u2014 then a Democratic presidential primary candidate \u2014 at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. He was arrested shortly after the shooting and he was 24 years old at the time. Sirhan has admitted to killing the senator at various points, sometimes claiming it was due to the senator's support for Israel, though at other times, Sirhan has said he is innocent or said he couldn't remember the incident.",
      "Sirhan has been incarcerated in California for decades, and multiple requests for parole have been unsuccessful. The state's parole board endorsed his 2021 bid for parole, but California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom rejected the request.",
      "The case has drawn public fascination for decades, with some observers\u00a0claiming Sirhan didn't fire the fatal shots or acted as part of a wider conspiracy. They often cite conflicting eyewitness testimonies or the alleged presence of extra bullets \u2014 though many others have backed the view that Sirhan acted alone.",
      "One of the skeptics is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was 14 years old when his father was assassinated. He has argued Sirhan wasn't responsible for the killing, and met with him in prison before backing his 2021 request for parole.",
      "However, other members of the Kennedy family have\u00a0staunchly opposed\u00a0Sirhan's release from prison.",

A day earlier, during a meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others to announce that the NFL draft would be held in Washington in 2027, the president also talked about Newsom and Hollywood.",
      "He said the American film industry has been \"decimated\" by other countries and the \"grossly incompetent\" Newsom, which he said caused the film industry to \"abandon\" the U.S. But he vowed that \"we'll get it back.\" He said he'll be meeting with some film industry executives to \"make sure they're happy with\" the prospective tariffs.",

      "\"I just got him a lot of water. I sent in people to open up that water, because he refused to do it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If they would have had that water and if they would have done what I said to do, they wouldn't have had the fires in Los Angeles, those fires would have been put out very quickly,\"",
      "The president visited Los Angeles in late-January with the first lady, weeks after two massive fires devastated opposite ends of Los Angeles County. He was greeted by Newsom when he landed at the airport.",
      "\"I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the side of it, we flew over it in a helicopter. We flew to a few of the areas, and it is devastation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comments ended with a challenge for the Golden State's governor.",
      "\"I'd love him to run for president on the other side. I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone, well, that and the fires and a lot of other things pretty much put him out of the race,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has a new plan to get \"healthy\" food to low-income seniors, but an anti-hunger advocate fears many will miss out.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposed budget for next year could include big changes for a small food aid program that helps low-income senior citizens supplement their diets. Under the plan, funding for the program \u2014 called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) \u2014 would be cut, and seniors instead would receive what the Trump administration is calling \"MAHA food boxes\" filled with products sourced directly from farmers.",
      "The food boxes \u2014 whose name stems from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to \"Make America Healthy Again\" \u2014 could eventually also be rolled out to either \"supplant or complement current USDA programs,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The agency didn't disclose what other government programs could integrate use of the MAHA food boxes.",
      "The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, more commonly known as food stamps. The agency also oversees other food aid programs such as Women, Infants and Children, which is aimed at pregnant women and kids, as well as the National School Lunch program.",
      "\"Unlike the current approach using food banks, which provide those in need with shelf-stable foods that are high in sodium and other harmful ingredients, MAHA boxes would be filled with commodities sourced from domestic farmers and given directly to American households,\" the Trump budget proposal notes.",
      "The CSFP helps about 730,000 low-income seniors annually through its $389 million budget, according to the USDA. By comparison, the food-stamp program spent about $100 billion last year to provide assistance to 41 million Americans, according to the USDA.",
      "\"We have no details\"",
      "The CSFP is essential for low-income seniors who are struggling to put food on the table, said George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program, a nonprofit\u00a0in Philadelphia. He expressed concern about the Trump administration's plans to replace the CSFP with food boxes, noting the logistical complexity of getting perishable food from farmers directly to older Americans.",
      "Another question is whether the foods included in the food boxes would meet the needs of seniors who often need shelf-stable foods because many struggle to get to the store, Matysik said.",
      "\"What we do know is that the program that we currently have is working, and seniors have come to rely on us,\" he said. \"We have no details [about logistics of the MAHA food boxes], and this has been a continued challenge that we've had with this administration, where decisions are sort of made overnight.\"",
      "Share Food Program relies on $4.5 million in CSFP funding to provide 32-pound food boxes to more than 7,000 seniors in the Philadelphia region who earn less than roughly $23,000 per year. Matysik disagreed with the Trump administration's claims that the program provides unhealthy foods to seniors, noting the boxes typically contain products such as canned vegetables, lean proteins and pastas.",
      "\"For seniors, a lot of times it can be hard to make it out to the grocery store \u2014 it can be hard to get those core items that folks need,\" he added. \"What we do at Share Food Program is take it directly to the doorstep of about 4,500 seniors, so not only are we providing that nutrition, but we're making it easy on the seniors.\"",
      "The Trump budget proposal represents a wish list for the current administration, and it isn't certain that funding for the CSFP would be cut.",
      "But the plan comes amid a larger push by the Trump administration to reduce spending on similar programs, such as a decision in March to cut two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks and instead have them source food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "The Kennedy effect",
      "The MAHA food boxes would provide a twofold benefit, the USDA said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"MAHA boxes would be more wholesome foods, and similar to the Farmers to Families Food Box, fresh foods,\" the agency said. It added that \"the most obvious\" benefit would be \"the removal of administrative middlemen from the distribution of food.\"",
      "The Farmers to Families Food Box, a pandemic food program that ran from May 2020 to May 2021, relied on more than 200 contractors to deliver millions of boxes to needy families, according to a 2021 analysis from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The study found that the 21 biggest contractors were collectively awarded $3 billion to deliver the boxes.",
      "MAHA, meanwhile, is part of a push by Kennedy to promote natural foods and alternative medicines. As head of HHS, he's pressing the food industry to stop using\u00a0synthetic food dyes\u00a0and has pledged to remove processed foods from school lunches.",
      "The USDA has signaled its openness to the MAHA platform, with Secretary Brooke Rollins saying she plans to approve a plan from Arkansas to ban the use of food stamps for purchasing sodas and candy. Anti-hunger advocates have said such restrictions can be stigmatizing for low-income Americans.",
      "In the meantime, Matysik said he's worried about the future of the CSFP program and the seniors who rely on it.",
      "\"Our seniors in particular are already hurting,\" he said. \"We're hearing about cuts to the SNAP program. We're seeing about cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. We're really worried about our senior citizens in this funding environment from our federal government right now.\"",

      "AmeriCorps is the federal agency that helps support and launch national service projects and volunteerism.\u00a0 It began in the 1960s as an offshoot of the Peace Corps and evolved in the decades since as a critical provider of funding and support to build new infrastructure in needy areas, assist with disaster relief, offer services to senior citizens, rural and inner-city health programs and education services in low socio-economic communities and cities.",
      "Some of the organizations that have had their funding abruptly stripped by the Trump administration said the termination of grant money has caused \"damage and chaos\" and have \"upended\" the lives of participants who have been contributing to community assistance projects.",

      "In Detroit, grant money for Americorps \"urban safety\" projects was also cancelled.\tThe projects, which were coordinated with the assistance of Wayne State University included the boarding-up of vacant homes and clearing of vacant lots to improve public safety and reduce crime threats.",
      "In a statement, Ramona Washington, the director of Wayne State University's Urban Safety Program, said the termination of $1.3 million in funding \"halted vital outreach and community support efforts carried out by WSU faculty, staff, students, and AmeriCorps members.\"",
      "\"Our students, who serve as AmeriCorps members, have helped lead community-engaged research and service-learning initiatives that improve urban public safety and public health. Without this support, the progress we've made in building safer, healthier neighborhoods is at serious risk,\" Washington said.",

      "The cuts also include money for a Boys and Girls Club program in West Palm Beach, Florida, which is home to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, according to the list obtained by CBS News from a source familiar with the cuts.",
      "The High Rocks Educational Corporation in Lewisburg, West Virginia also lost AmeriCorps funding. An organization spokeswoman told CBS News the cuts could have a dramatic impact on its ability to help young people opportunities in the state and could exacerbate the declining youth population in the Mountain State.",
      "The organization was also vital in helping Greenbrier County respond to and recover from the calamitous flooding in White Sulpher Springs in 2016.\tThe list obtained by CBS News showed High Rocks was receiving a $1.4 million dollar grant through an AmeriCorps program. West Virginia has some of the neediest communities and highest per capita usage of AmeriCorps programs and funds, according to multiple sources.",
      "There have been at least two lawsuits filed over the terminations. A handful of impacted organizations and nonprofits have filed a federal civil lawsuit in Maryland seeking a court order to halt the dismantling of AmeriCorps.",
      "One of the organizations that filed the suit, the Red Cloud Indian School in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, said it had received funding for 26 years to help respond to a \"critical teacher shortage\" in one of the nation's poorest regions. CBS News has learned the program was receiving a $395,621 grant.",
      "In the civil lawsuit, some of the grant recipients argue, \"These sweeping actions have forced the early dismissal of participants, halted ongoing projects at organizations across the country, and jeopardized critical support for communities nationwide, with particularly severe impacts on rural areas where AmeriCorps programs have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support.\"",
      "Nearly two dozen state attorneys general, including Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, have also filed a separate federal lawsuit to avert the cutting of AmeriCorps.",

      "Top House Democrats on Wednesday are asking Attorney General Pam Bondi to spare a civil rights-era office that has frequently been referred to as the \"peacemakers program.\"",
      "An internal Justice Department memo reviewed by CBS News last month said President Trump's appointees are considering closing the Community Relations Service, which was created as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The mission of the office is to be \"America's peacemaker,\" tasked with \"preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, conflicts, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony.\"",
      "In a letter sent Wednesday to Bondi and the Justice Department, more than two dozen House Democrats wrote, \"We strongly urge you to abandon any plans of dissolving the work of the Community Relations Service.\"",
      "The letter, which included Rep. Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Education Committee, said the Community Relations Service combats violence and city unrest. The letter says the office's \"work also kept places of worship safe after a series of high-profile attacks in recent years.\"",
      "Though created during the mid-20th century, the Community Relations Service was expanded under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act in 2008.",
      "The Community Relations Service does not investigate or prosecute crimes and has no law enforcement authority, and according to the Justice Department, its services are both confidential and free of charge to communities that accept or request them. In 2021, the agency said of its mission that it sought to help realize Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"inspiring dream of a vibrant, all-embracing nation unified in justice, peace, and reconciliation.\"",
      "The House Democrats who are pressing Bondi to spare the office from reductions wrote, \"We are aware that during the previous Trump Administration there was a similar effort to abandon the valuable work of the Community Relations Service by recommending its elimination in budget proposals and reducing staffing.\"",
      "The Justice Department confirmed receipt of the letter but declined to comment further.",
      "The Community Relations Service worked to ease rising racial tensions after the 1997 fatal police shooting of a Chinese-American man in Rohnert Park, California, in Akron, Ohio in 2022 after the shooting of a Black man by police and deploying twice to Minneapolis during the trial of Derek Chauvin after the killing of George Floyd in 2020 in Minnesota.",
      "\"We would find and stop brush fires, before they became forest fires,\" said Ron Wakabayashi, a former regional director of the Community Relations Service. Wakabayashi told CBS News last month he fears the nation will be at greater risk of unrest, boycotts and lawsuits without the agency's Community Relations Service deployed regionally across the U.S..",

    "summary": "A federal appellate panel will hear arguments on where and whether Mohsen Mahdawi and Rumesya Ozturk should be detained as cases challenging their confinements proceed.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appellate panel on Tuesday considered high-profile cases involving two international students who were detained by federal immigration officials and now face removal from the U.S. after they made statements that were critical of Israel.",
      "The panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit heard arguments in emergency appeals from the Trump administration after two federal judges issued separate decisions in favor of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, and Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student at Columbia University, last month.",
      "Administration officials are asking the 2nd Circuit to pause the lower court orders issued in Ozturk and Mahdawi's cases while their challenges to their respective detentions move forward. In Ozturk's case, U.S. District Judge William Sessions issued an order for Ozturk, who is being detained at a facility in Louisiana, to be transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in Vermont and set a bail hearing for her to attend in person on May 9.",
      "U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered Mahdawi's release from immigration custody while the challenge to his detention proceeds.",
      "Appeals court Judges Barrington Parker, Susan Carney and Alison Nathan weighed the administration's request for a stay of the two orders, and said following arguments that they will take the matters under advisement.",
      "The cases are still in their early stages, and the lower court judges, Sessions and Crawford, are still weighing Ozturk and Mahdawi's respective habeas corpus challenges to their confinement. But a key issue in the two cases is untangling the removal proceedings playing out in immigration court from the challenges to their detentions that were filed in federal court, and what is required in each of those cases.",
      "Ozturk, a Ph.D. student at Tufts, was arrested by federal immigration officials near her Somerville, Massachusetts, apartment on March 25, after the Trump administration revoked her student visa. She was not notified of the revocation before her arrest, according to court records.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in March that at least 300 students studying at American universities have had their visas rescinded after they were accused of expressing support for Palestinians or participating in campus protests.",
      "Ozturk co-authored an opinion piece in the Tufts' student newspaper that criticized the school for its dismissal of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate as a \"sincere effort to hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\" The op-ed\u00a0did not mention Hamas.",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, Esha Bhandari, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Ozturk, said her client has been \"held behind bars for six weeks while her health deteriorates for writing an op-ed.\" All she is asking for is for the temporary transfer order to be completed as court proceedings play out in Vermont, Bhandari said.",
      "\"The executive branch made a specific decision to detain Ms. Ozturk because of her speech,\" she said.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in part that the district court in Vermont does not have jurisdiction over Ozturk's habeas petition because it was not filed where she is confined \u2014 Louisiana \u2014 and did not name her immediate custodian as a defendant \u2014 the warden at the detention center.",
      "But Bhandari argued that the executive branch effectively suspended the writ of habeas corpus on its own by refusing to specify to Ozturk's lawyers who had custody of her, which would have allowed them to name that person as the defendant in Ozturk's challenge to her detention.",
      "Bhandari called the government's position \"breathtaking.\"",
      "According to court filings, a memorandum from a senior official with the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs said Ozturk's visa was revoked based on a request from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, which determined that she \"had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization.'\"",
      "After she was arrested, Ozturk was transported to Methuen, Massachusetts, and transported to Lebanon, New Hampshire, followed by St. Albans, Vermont, where she was kept overnight. On the morning of March 26, in Burlington, Vermont, Ozturk was put on a plane and flown to Louisiana, where she is currently in custody at an immigration facility in Basile.",
      "Ozturk's lawyers filed a petition challenging her arrest and detention as a violation of the First and Fifth Amendments in federal district court in Massachusetts. But the case was transferred to Sessions' court in Vermont after it was determined that Ozturk was detained in that state at the time the petition was filed.",
      "The Justice Department sought to dismiss Ozturk's petition while her lawyers asked Sessions to order her to be released or transferred to Vermont while her claims are adjudicated.",
      "Sessions last month ruled that Ozturk's arrest and detention raised \"significant constitutional concerns\" and said she must be transferred to ICE custody in Vermont by May 1. He also set a bail hearing for May 9, with Ozturk appearing in person, and will consider the merits of her habeas petition on May 22.",
      "The 2nd Circuit temporarily paused Sessions' order late last month while it considers the Trump administration's request for emergency relief.",
      "Mahdawi, who is to graduate from Columbia this month with a bachelor's degree in philosophy, was detained by immigration agents in Vermont last month during what he was told was his citizenship interview.",
      "He was born in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and he has held a green card for the last 10 years and co-founded his university's Palestinian Student Union, alongside Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, Columbia Ph.D. student and U.S. resident detained by the government. Mahdawi's attorneys said he took a \"step back\" from the high-profile protests at the school before students began occupying university buildings.",
      "Khalil, a Palestinian born in Syria, was a vocal member of last year's protests at Columbia. He was arrested by ICE in March. He is also challenging his removal and detention, though an immigration judge allowed the government to proceed with its effort to deport Khalil.",
      "In an interview with CBS News the day before his arrest, Mahdawi called the interview a \"honey trap\" that allowed federal immigration officials to detain him while he went in to pursue U.S. citizenship.",
      "Mahdawi's attorneys secured a court order that blocked the Trump administration from deporting him or moving him outside of Vermont. Then, last week, Crawford released Mahdawi from federal detention as his immigration proceedings continue and again barred the government from removing him from the state or country.",
      "A U.S. attorney arguing against Mahdawi's release said that keeping him in detention would be a \"constitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process\" and argued in court filings that Mahdawi's \"presence and activities\" in the U.S. \"have serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" if he remains here.",
      "But Naz Ahmad, who argued on Mahdawi's behalf before the 2nd Circuit, told the judges that the government's detention of her client was \"retaliatory\" and had not only chilled his speech, but also others. He is challenging his detention as a violation of the First and First Amendments.",
      "If the 2nd Circuit grants the Justice Department's request for the stay in Mahdawi's case, it would allow immigration authorities to re-detain him. But two of the judges on the panel seemed to question how the government is harmed by the lower court's decision ordering Mahdawi's release.",
      "Barrington asked Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, whether an \"adverse\" decision constitutes irreparable harm to the government. Irreparable harm is one of four factors courts analyze when considering whether to grant a stay of a lower court order.",
      "Ensign mentioned operational costs to the government that would arise from Mahdawi having to participate in immigration proceedings, which are being held separately in Louisiana, from Vermont.",
      "One of the judges noted that in both Mahdawi and Ozturk's cases, the district court judges have indicated a \"strong desire\" to move quickly when considering the challenges to their allegedly unlawful detentions.",
      "The Trump administration has been cracking down on U.S. universities and their students who were involved in pro-Palestinian protests waged after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, which triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order in January that ordered his administration to use \"all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.\" The White House said that these efforts would include deporting alleged \"Hamas sympathizers\" and revoking student visas.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to comply with a lower court order that requires it to transfer Tufts Ph.D. student Rumeysa Ozturk from a detention facility in Louisiana to Vermont.",
      "The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit rejected a bid for emergency relief sought by the Trump administration in Ozturk's challenge to her detention. The decision came after the 2nd Circuit panel heard arguments Tuesday on the Justice Department's request for it to pause a district court's order that required Ozturk to be\u00a0transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody\u00a0in Vermont.",
      "Ozturk is currently detained at an immigration facility in Basile, Louisiana. A bail hearing in her challenge to her confinement is set to take place at the federal district court in Vermont on Friday. The judges on the 2nd Circuit said the Trump administration has one week \u2014 until May 14 \u2014 to comply with the district court's transfer order.",
      "\"Permitting Ozturk's transfer will provide her ready access to legal and medical services, address concerns about the conditions of her confinement, and expedite resolution of this matter \u2014 all of which are required, as the court below noted, to proceed expeditiously,\" Judges Barrington Parker, Susan Carney and Alison Nathan said in their unanimous opinion. \"At stake, too, is Ozturk's ability to participate meaningfully in her habeas proceedings.\"",
      "In response to the decision, Esha Bhandari, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on behalf of Ozturk during Tuesday's proceedings, said she and her client are grateful for the court's decision.",
      "\"No one should be arrested and locked up for their political views,\" she said in a statement. \"Every day that Rumeysa Ozturk remains in detention is a day too long.\"",
      "Ozturk, a 30-year-old doctoral candidate at Tufts, was taken into custody by plainclothes ICE agents near her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, on March 25 after the Trump administration revoked her student visa. She was not notified of the revocation beforehand, according to court documents.",
      "As justification for her arrest and detention, the Department of Homeland Security and ICE have said that Ozturk \"had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization,'\" court filings show.",
      "In 2024, Ozturk had co-authored an opinion piece in the Tufts' student newspaper that criticized the school for its dismissal of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate as a \"sincere effort to hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\" The op-ed\u00a0did not mention Hamas.",
      "Ozturk is one of hundreds of students studying at American universities who have had their visas rescinded after they were accused of expressing support for Palestinians or participating in campus protests.",

But the case was transferred to the U.S. district court in Vermont after it was determined that Ozturk was detained in that state at the time the petition was filed.",
      "The Justice Department sought to dismiss Ozturk's petition, claiming the district court in Vermont lacks jurisdiction since Ozturk is confined in Louisiana. But Ozturk's lawyers asked U.S. District Judge William Sessions to order her to be released or transferred to Vermont while her claims are adjudicated. Sessions last month ruled that Ozturk had to be transferred to ICE custody in Vermont by May 1. He also set a bail hearing for May 9, with Ozturk appearing in person, and will consider the merits of her habeas petition on May 22.",
      "The 2nd Circuit then temporarily halted Sessions' order while it considered the Trump administration's emergency appeal.",
      "The judges said that Ozturk's constitutional challenge to her detention can move forward, even amid a potential challenge to deportation from the U.S., which would arise after an order of removal has been entered by an immigration judge and affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals.",
      "\"She asserts that the government arrested and detained her to prevent speech with which it disagrees. Such an act would be a violation of the Constitution \u2014 quite separate from the removal procedures followed by the immigration courts,\" they wrote.",
      "The panel noted that Ozturk is not seeking to disrupt removal proceedings and said she can attend any hearings before an immigration judge remotely from Vermont.",
      "The judges also highlighted the timeline of the government's actions moving Ozturk from Massachusetts, where she was arrested, to Louisiana. A federal district judge in Massachusetts had blocked the government from moving Ozturk outside of the state without first providing advance notice, and issued that directive without an hour of the petition challenging her detention being filed.",
      "\"Although not technically non-compliant, despite this order, the government moved Ozturk from Vermont to Louisiana the next morning,\" the 2nd Circuit panel said.",
      "The appeals court considered Ozturk's case alongside that of another international student,\u00a0Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student at Columbia University. Mahdawi, a green card holder who was born in the West Bank, was detained by immigration agents in Vermont last month during what he was told was a citizenship interview.",
      "But U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford\u00a0ordered Mahdawi's release from immigration custody while a challenge to his detention proceeds. The Trump administration appealed that decision and asked the 2nd Circuit to pause the ruling, which would allow immigration authorities to re-detain him.",

      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp will not seek the GOP nomination in next year's Georgia Senate race, a key contest for control of Congress' upper chamber as Republicans look to unseat vulnerable Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff.",
      "In a post on X, Kemp said, \"Being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for me and my family.\"",
      "He added that he spoke with Senate GOP leadership and President Trump and \"expressed my commitment to work alongside them to ensure we have a strong Republican nominee who can win next November.\"",
      "Kemp was a top recruiting target for Senate Republicans. The Senate race in Georgia is one of next year's most closely watched contests, and retaining the seat could prove essential to Democrats' efforts to regain control of the upper chamber where Republicans currently hold a 53-47 edge.",
      "Prior to Monday's announcement, Kemp informed GOP leaders \u2014 including Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee \u2014 that he was not going to run for the seat, citing reservations from his family, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "But a senior Republican operative tells CBS Kemp is still mulling his future in the party and may have higher aspirations than statewide office.",
      "Kemp led Ossoff 49%-46% in a hypothetical Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll of the 2026 Senate race taken last month, within the 3.1-point margin of error.",
      "Elections in Georgia \u2014 once a consistently red state \u2014 are perennially close. Ossoff won his Senate seat by under two points in a 2021 runoff against GOP Sen. David Perdue, driven by strong performance in the Atlanta suburbs and among Black voters \u2014 helping to cinch the Democrats' narrow Senate majority. And Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock was reelected by fewer than three points in 2022, beating Trump-backed ex-football star Herschel Walker.",
      "Kemp's plans for the Senate race were closely watched due to his popularity in the state. The term-limited governor defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams by just 1.4 points in 2018, but improved his margin to 7.5 points in a 2022 rematch against Abrams. Kemp also easily staved off a Trump-backed primary challenge by Perdue in 2022, beating him by over 50 points.",
      "Kemp and Mr. Trump have a rocky relationship, dating back to the governor's refusal to help the president overturn his narrow 2020 election loss in Georgia. Mr. Trump endorsed Perdue's primary election, calling Kemp the \"WORST Governor in the Country on Election Integrity.\" Kemp later endorsed Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, and Mr. Trump won back Georgia.",
      "With Kemp out of the race, it's unclear who will seek to run against Ossoff.",
      "Mr. Trump said in 2023 he would \"fight like hell\" for Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene if she runs for Senate. The firebrand lawmaker said earlier this year she's \"considering all possibilities\" when asked if she will run for statewide office in 2026.",
      "Candidates other than Kemp could face a tougher path: In last month's Journal-Constitution poll, Ossoff led Greene 54%-37%.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are rebelling against a crypto regulation bill, putting the first-of-its-kind legislation in jeopardy ahead of a possible key vote on it later this week.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance.",
      "The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins.",
      "Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday \"we need to start moving forward.\" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes.",
      "Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said the stablecoin bill advanced out of the committee with the caveat that improvements would be made before it was brought up for a floor vote. But Republicans moved ahead without addressing Democrats' concerns on provisions involving anti-money laundering, national security and consumer protections, Gallego said.",
      "\"I think the purpose of that was really to put Democrats in a bad position and try to force us to vote for it,\" Gallego told MeidasTouch in an interview posted Wednesday.",
      "\"You can't try to f*** us and then say, hey, deal with it,\" Gallego added. \"That's just not going to work, especially when you still need our votes.\"",
      "A few Republican senators \u2014 Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Josh Hawley of Missouri and John Kennedy of Louisiana \u2014 have also indicated that they could vote against the bill for various other reasons.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures.",
      "\"Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,\" it says.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, \"Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption.\"",
      "The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets.",
      "\"Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,\" Merkley said in a statement. \"This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately.\"",
      "The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act.",
      "On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's \"serious risks\" to the U.S. economy.",
      "The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole.",
      "The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth \u2014 or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024.",
      "In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's \"assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.\"",
      "\"Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens detained in the Southern District of New York under President Trump's proclamation invoking the wartime Alien Enemies Act. Another judge in Colorado issued a similar order later in the day.",
      "In New York, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said in a 22-page decision that the president's March proclamation ordering the summary removal of Venezuelan migrants exceeded the scope of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that the Trump administration has relied on to deport noncitizens that his administration claims are part of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act gives the president the power to detain and deport migrants when there is a declared war between the U.S. and a foreign nation, or when there is an \"invasion\" or \"predatory inclusion\" against the U.S. by a foreign nation or government.",
      "But Hellerstein, appointed by President Bill Clinton, said that the Trump administration failed to demonstrate the existence of a war, invasion or predatory incursion. Because of that, the Alien Enemies Act \"was not validly invoked by the presidential proclamation,\" he wrote.",
      "The judge said noncitizens in his judicial district can still be removed under the Immigration and Nationality Act.",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on behalf of the plaintiffs, said in a statement that the district court \"joined several others in correctly recognizing the president cannot simply declare that there's been an invasion and then invoke a wartime authority during peacetime to send individuals to a Gulag-type prison in El Salvador without even giving them due process.\"",
      "Hellerstein was the second federal judge to bar Trump administration officials from using the proclamation invoking the 1798 law to remove certain Venezuelan migrants at risk of deportation. U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, ruled last week that Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is unlawful and blocked administration officials from using the law and the president's proclamation to detain, transfer or remove Venezuelan migrants who either live or are detained in southern Texas.",
      "Later Tuesday, a third judge, Charlotte Sweeney, blocked the administration from detaining or removing migrants in Colorado who are subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act. In her\u00a0decision, Sweeney rejected the Trump administration's claim that federal courts have no role in determining whether the preconditions for using the law are satisfied, saying it \"staggers.\"",
      "\"It is wrong as a matter of law and attempts to read an entire provision out of the Constitution,\" she wrote.",
      "Sweeney, appointed by President Joe Biden, found that the plaintiffs in the case before her were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is unlawful.",
      "Challenges to Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act have been filed throughout the country in response to a Supreme Court decision last month that allowed removals under the law. But the high court said that Venezuelan migrants covered by the declaration are entitled to notice and the opportunity to challenge their confinement and removal under the Alien Enemies Act through habeas corpus proceedings brought in the district where they are being detained.",
      "The two-century-old law has only been employed previously during three periods of declared wars. But in March, Mr. Trump issued a proclamation claiming that the gang Tren de Aragua \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\" Mr. Trump's proclamation said that all Venezuelan citizens who are at least 14 years old and in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to apprehension and removal as \"alien enemies.\"",
      "The declaration claimed that the gang is undertaking \"hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare\" against the U.S. directly and at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's regime. But an April assessment from the National Intelligence Council obtained by the Freedom of the Press Foundation through a public records request found that \"while Venezuela's permissive environment enables TDA to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States.\"",
      "The declassified assessment said that most of the intelligence community \"judges that intelligence indicating that regime leaders are directing or enabling TDA migration to the United States is not credible.\"",
      "The case before Hellerstein was brought by two plaintiffs \u2014 identified in filings as G.F.F. and J.G.O. \u2014 who were initially detained at the Orange County Jail in New York and were transferred to an immigration facility in Texas to be deported to El Salvador. But they were removed from a plane in response to temporary orders issued by a federal district judge in Washington, D.C., as part of a challenge to Mr. Trump's efforts to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act. That case ultimately landed before the Supreme Court.",
      "The two plaintiffs were returned to the jail, where they remain confined and \"under threat of imminent removal,\" according to Hellerstein's opinion. The migrants brought a challenge under habeas corpus in early April in the Southern District of New York on behalf of themselves and other noncitizens in the region at risk of deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, and Hellerstein agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from removing them from the U.S. under the president's proclamation unless they received a notice in English and Spanish and a hearing.",
      "His temporary order was to remain in place while he considered the Venezuelan migrants request for a preliminary injunction, which he granted Tuesday after finding that absent such relief, they would be deported to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT. Hellerstein said that once there, \"they would endure abuse and inhumane treatment with no recourse to bring them back.\"",
      "In his opinion, Hellerstein first called the notice provided by immigration officers to those subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act a \"fleeting affair\" and a \"bare bones form letter.\"",
      "\"Petitioners have not been given notice of what they allegedly did to join TdA, when they joined, and what they did in the United States, or anywhere else, to share or further the illicit objectives of the TdA,\" Hellerstein wrote. \"Without such proof, petitioners are subject to removal by the executive's dictate alone, in contravention of the AEA and the constitutional requirements of due process.\"",
      "The judge said that the procedures used by the Trump administration have already led to the wrongful removal of at least two migrants to CECOT. One of those migrants is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who the Trump administration admitted was mistakenly removed to El Salvador as a result of an \"administrative error.\" A federal judge, U.S. appeals court and the Supreme Court have said the U.S. has to facilitate his release from Salvadoran custody, but the Trump administration has claimed it's up to El Salvador to return him.",
      "Hellerstein also said that the grounds for Mr. Trump's proclamation \u2014 that Tren de Aragua has engaged in either a war, invasion or predatory incursion of the U.S. \u2014 \"do not exist.\"",
      "\"There is nothing in the AEA that justifies a finding that refugees migrating from Venezuela, or TdA gangsters who infiltrate the migrants, are engaged in an 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote. \"They do not seek to occupy territory, to oust American jurisdiction from any territory, or to ravage territory. TdA may well be engaged in narcotics trafficking, but that is a criminal matter, not an invasion or predatory incursion.\"",
      "The Trump administration can appeal the decision.",

      "In former President Joe Biden's first interview since leaving office, he slammed President Trump's foreign policy, describing Mr. Trump's actions toward\u00a0Russia as \"modern-day appeasement\" and saying \"what the hell's going on here?\" about what he called Mr. Trump's \"confiscation\" policy regarding Greenland, Canada, the Panama Canal and renaming the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "\"What the hell's going on here? What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are,\" Biden told CBS News partner network BBC News. \"We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity, not about confiscation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump met Tuesday with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose Liberal Party's victory in the April elections appeared to be influenced by Mr. Trump's stance. At Tuesday's Oval Office meeting, Carney said Canada \"won't be for sale, ever,\" while Mr. Trump mused, \"never say never.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken to referring to Canada as the 51st state, although he said in an interview last week that \"I don't see\" using military force in Canada.",
      "But, he said in an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that \"something could happen with Greenland, I'll be honest,\" adding that \"we need that for national and international security.\"",
      "Even before Mr. Trump took office in January, he talked about acquiring the Panama Canal and Greenland, and he has ramped up his rhetoric on Greenland in recent weeks, declining to rule out military force. Greenland is a semi-autonomous state in the Kingdom of Denmark, although there is a U.S. military base, Mr. Trump's comments have not been well received\u00a0there.",
      "Biden spoke to BBC News ahead of the 80th anniversary of V-E Day, or the day that the Nazis surrendered in Europe. While in office, Biden had pledged support to help Ukraine after the Russian invasion, even linking World War II and Ukraine.",
      "But Mr. Trump has taken a different approach toward Russia in the conflict, and has blasted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as being ungrateful while also signing a deal\u00a0with Ukraine for minerals.",
      "Biden called the Trump administration's policy \"modern-day appeasement\" to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"Listen to what Putin said when he talked about going from Kyiv into Ukraine, and why he can't stand the fact that the Russian dictatorship that he runs, that the Soviet Union has collapsed, and anybody thinks he's going to stop is this foolish,\" Biden said.",
      "Biden continued that he \"found it sort of beneath America the way that took place,\" as well as Mr. Trump's actions renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Mr. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office to rename the Gulf, and has since blocked Associated Press\u00a0reporters from covering certain Oval Office events for refusing to comply with that order.",
      "Mr. Trump has long been suspicious of the alliance with Europe\u00a0formed after World War II, saying in March that\u00a0the continent has been \"very, very bad for us.\"",
      "Biden said forming NATO is \"one of the smartest things we did,\" and called it a \"grave concern\" that the alliance could be ending.",
      "\"I think it would change the modern history of the world that occurs,\" Biden said. \"Look, we are not the essential nation, but we're the only nation in a position to have the capacity to bring people together, to lead the world, and otherwise you're going to have China and the former Soviet Union, Russia stepping out.\"",
      "In response to Biden's comments, White House spokesman Steven Cheung posted on social media that Biden is a \"complete disgrace to this country and the office he occupied.\"",
      "Democrats have fumed and struggled to reorganize themselves after Mr. Trump's victory, with much of the fury going toward Biden for staying in the 2024 race for too long. But Biden said Wednesday that he didn't think it made a difference, adding that \"we left at a time when we had a good candidate.\"",
      "\"Things moved so quickly that it made it difficult to walk away to get and it was a, it was a hard decision,\" Biden said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday that the Trump administration believes Russia is \"asking for too much\" in its initial offer on a deal to end its war with Ukraine.",
      "During remarks at the Munich Leaders Meeting, the vice president underscored the importance of direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, and said that the U.S. is interested in a \"long-term settlement\" that would bring a stop to the military confrontation launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin three years ago.",
      "\"Certainly the first peace offer that the Russians put on the table, our reaction to it was you're asking for too much,\" Vance said. \"But this is how negotiations unfold.\"",
      "He continued: \"I wouldn't say that the Russians are uninterested in bringing this thing to a resolution. What I would say is right now, the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict. We think they're asking for too much.\"",
      "The U.S. and Ukraine said in March that Kyiv was ready to accept a 30-day ceasefire with Russia, an agreement that was reached after a delegation of Trump administration officials held several hours of negotiations with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. But Vance said that the Russians decided that such a pause was \"not in our strategic interest.\"",
      "\"We've tried to move beyond the obsession with the 30-day ceasefire and more on the what would the long-term settlement look like? And we've tried to consistently advance the ball,\" the vice president said.",
      "Vance said that Mr. Trump is willing to walk away from the negotiations if there is no progress between Ukraine and Russia, but said the two sides need to begin engaging with one another.",
      "\"We would like both the Russians and the Ukrainians to actually agree on some basic guidelines for sitting down and talking to one another,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Republicans, on the hunt for spending cuts, are eying a special kind of Medicaid tax that nearly every state uses to boost funding for hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers.",
    "story": [
      "On the eastern plains of Colorado, in a county of less than 6,000 people, Lincoln Health runs the only hospital within a 75-minute drive. The facility struggles financially, given its small size and the area's tiny population.",
      "But for over a decade, the Hugo, Colorado-based health system has remained afloat partially thanks to a surprising source: special taxes on the state's hospitals.",
      "The taxes Lincoln pays help cover the state's Medicaid costs and \u2014 because the federal government matches a portion of what states spend on Medicaid \u2014 enable Colorado to claim more federal money. That generally leads to more dollars for the hospital. The tax proceeds also have helped Colorado expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover 400,000 more low-income adults, significantly reducing the number of people showing up at hospital doors without insurance.",
      "Last year, Lincoln paid $500,000 in provider taxes but netted more than $3.6 million extra from Medicaid, accounting for about 15% of its budget, said Lincoln CEO Kevin Stansbury.",
      "\"These dollars allow me to care for patients who are enrolled in Medicaid and to break even rather than lose money,\" he said. \"Without them, it would significantly impact our ability to survive.\"",
      "Every state except Alaska uses at least one provider tax to boost its federal Medicaid dollars.",
      "But Republicans who control Congress are looking for potential cuts in the nearly $900 billion Medicaid program to help fund an extension of President Trump's tax cuts \u2014 and have sought to portray provider taxes as malicious, sometimes even deriding them as \"money laundering.\" Lawmakers say they may curtail or eliminate provider taxes as part of legislation to enact Mr. Trump's domestic agenda.",
      "\"It's infuriating,\" Stansbury said.",
      "Medicaid and the closely related Children's Health Insurance Program together cover roughly 79 million low-income and disabled people and are jointly financed by states and the federal government.",
      "Federal dollars match state payments with no limit. While the split varies based on a state's per capita income, the federal match ranges from 50% to 77% for children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities, who make up most of the enrollment.",
      "States started using provider taxes in the 1980s to help pay their share and gain additional Medicaid funds from the federal government.",
      "Brian Blase, a former Trump health policy adviser who leads the conservative Paragon Health Institute, sees provider taxes as one of the highest forms of waste in Medicaid. States and their hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers aren't held accountable for how the tax money is used, reducing incentives for states to control Medicaid spending, he said.",
      "\"This has been a feature of the program for four decades, and it is a feature that is getting worse,\" Blase said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimates eliminating provider taxes would save the federal government more than $600 billion over a decade.",
      "Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.), who chairs the House committee that oversees Medicaid, has said provider taxes are on the menu for potential cuts.",
      "Other changes Republicans are considering to cut federal Medicaid spending include requiring adult enrollees to prove they're working as a condition of eligibility, as well as ending higher payments for adults enrolled as part of the Affordable Care Act's expansion of the program.",
      "Since 2014, more than 20 million nondisabled adults in 40 states and Washington, D.C., have gained coverage under the expansion.",
      "House Republicans have set a Memorial Day deadline to come to an agreement on spending cuts, which would help pay for extending about $4 trillion in tax cuts passed during Mr. Trump's first administration and set to expire at the end of this year.",
      "The Government Accountability Office and the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, a congressional advisory board, have raised concerns about the provider taxes, which effectively saddle federal taxpayers with state expenses. Republican and Democrat presidents have criticized or proposed curtailing the use of Medicaid provider taxes \u2014 including Mr. Trump in his first term, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden while serving as vice president.",
      "But opposition from hospitals, nursing homes, and states snuffed out any move to limit or end the arrangements.",
      "Colorado and other states often use the money to maintain or increase payments to providers, which are often paid less by Medicaid than by Medicare, the federal program primarily for people 65 or older, or private insurers.",
      "States have added provider taxes to help generate federal money to cope with economic downturns and budget constraints.",
      "Hospitals in Idaho last year began paying an additional provider tax to increase pay to hospitals and home- and community-based providers. The tax came as Idaho's Republican-controlled legislature sought to add many conditions that threatened to end the state's Medicaid expansion \u2014 which would also eliminate a key source of increased federal funding.",
      "Brian Whitlock, president and CEO of the Idaho Hospital Association, said funding from the hospital tax helps boost Medicaid payments to about 80% of Medicare's rates instead of 60%.",
      "\"We still lose money on every Medicare and Medicaid patient,\" he said. \"The state recognizes that this money helps offset the losses we take under Medicaid reimbursement.\"",
      "While hospitals and nursing homes have been the main beneficiaries of provider tax proceeds, ambulance services have also paid and benefited from Medicaid taxes. States increasingly have also approved Medicaid taxes on private insurers that operate their Medicaid programs to gain more federal funds.",
      "California's Medicaid managed care tax began in 2009 and is expected to generate nearly $9 billion in net revenue for the 2024-25 fiscal period \u2014 or about 5% of the state's Medicaid budget, according to the California Legislative Analyst's Office.",
      "In recent years, California has extended full Medicaid coverage to immigrants lacking permanent legal status. Federal law prohibits federal Medicaid dollars from being used to cover people in the country without authorization, but states can use their own money.",
      "At a presentation to congressional staffers in April, Blase cited California's strategy as an example of provider tax abuse and claimed the state is effectively laundering federal funds to cover people living in the country illegally.",
      "In practice, the tax has been a kind of fiscal pressure valve generally offsetting state spending. A ballot measure that passed in November now requires that much of the money from California's tax specifically be used to increase Medicaid reimbursement to doctors, hospitals, and other providers.",
      "Hospital officials and state Medicaid leaders argue the term \"money laundering\" is an inaccurate way to describe provider taxes, since they are allowed by federal law. But Blase said calling the levies a \"tax\" is misleading, pointing out that most businesses don't typically advocate to pay one.",
      "Jamie Whitney, chief legal officer for Texas-based Adelanto HealthCare Ventures, a consulting firm, said that provider taxes are a politically neutral way to help states pay for Medicaid and that curtailing their use would harm them all. \"This is not a red-state, blue-state issue,\" she said.",
      "Colorado is one of more than a dozen states that have funded an ACA Medicaid expansion using provider tax money. Others include Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia.",
      "Colorado implemented its Medicaid provider tax effort in 2009. In the 2024 fiscal year, about $5 billion of the state's $15 billion Medicaid program was funded by provider taxes, according to the state.",
      "The money helps the state pay higher Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals, which reduces their need to charge higher rates to private insurers, said Kim Bimestefer, executive director of the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which oversees Medicaid.",
      "Some of the extra payments are dependent on hospitals meeting certain quality and patient-safety metrics, such as reducing readmission rates after patients are discharged \u2014 a requirement state officials say improves care for everyone.",
      "The provider taxes also fund a program allowing working residents with disabilities to buy into Medicaid coverage even if their income is as high as 300% of the federal poverty level, or $46,950 for an individual. About 20,000 people are enrolled in the program.",
      "Among them is Alison Sbrana, 31, of Fort Collins, Colorado, who has a type of chronic fatigue syndrome and relies on Medicaid to cover long-term home care.",
      "\"It would be devastating if the benefit went away,\" said Sbrana, who works as a researcher and activist for those with the same disorder. \"I would be forced to stop working to keep my income low enough to qualify.\"",
      "The state's provider taxes also pay for a $60 million fund to support rural hospitals, helping them add telehealth services, recruit surgeons, and hire paramedics, according to a state report.",
      "Konnie Martin, CEO of San Luis Valley Health, a two-hospital system based in Alamosa, Colorado, said her nonprofit paid $5.4 million in provider taxes last year and gained about $15 million in benefits from higher Medicaid payments and the rural grants.",
      "She said the money helps her hospital maintain obstetrical services, so residents don't have to drive 120 miles to the nearest maternity hospital. Without the birthing center, the entire region would suffer, she said.",

    "summary": "Many investments Mr. Trump claims credit for predate his return to office or are based on vague future pledges. Here's a fact check of his claims.",
    "story": [
      "After President Trump was pressed on rising consumer prices and slowing economic growth, he defended his tariff policies by claiming they had spurred record investment in the United States.",
      "\"I think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview on\u00a0NBC's Meet the Press that aired Sunday. \"If you look at other presidents, there's never been anything like that.\"",
      "He has also repeatedly claimed that he secured more investment in his first two months than President Biden did in four years.",
      "Neither claim is supported by evidence, CBS News Confirmed found. While companies have announced hundreds of billions of dollars in planned investments since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the White House has not provided data showing the total approaches $9 trillion.",
      "Additionally, a CBS News review found that some investments highlighted by the White House were announced before Mr. Trump's reelection. The comparison to the Biden administration is also misleading: the president is citing future investments pledges, while contrasting them with a narrower list of projects that were in the works or completed by the end of his predecessor's term.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the claims.",
      "Some investments Trump claims credit for were announced under Biden",
      "The White House on April 29 said Mr. Trump had secured $5 trillion of U.S. investment in his first 100 days, and published a partial list titled \"The Trump Effect\" \u2014 which it said demonstrated \"his America First economic policies have sparked trillions of dollars in new investment.\"",
      "That list totals closer to $2 trillion from private companies, and around $5 trillion if commitments from foreign countries are included. The basis for the president's $9 trillion claim is unclear and the administration has not explained the discrepancy.",
      "A closer look at the White House list also shows some of the investments had been announced before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The list initially included a $4.1 billion commitment from Novelis, a Georgia-based aluminum company, to build a plant in southern Alabama. But construction for that project began in October 2022 and the $4.1 billion total investment was detailed in the company's February 2024 financial report. CBS News asked the White House on May 5 why the project was included; the administration did not answer the question, but by midday May 6 the project had been removed from the website.",
      "The Trump administration also claimed credit for a $1.5 billion pledge by Corning to invest in its solar products facility in Michigan. A company spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that $900 million of this funding was announced months before Mr. Trump assumed office. On April 29, Corning announced an additional $600 million investment, bringing the total to $1.5 billion.",
      "Likewise, the White House listed Johnson & Johnson's commitment to spend $55 billion over the next four years, but a company spokesperson confirmed that total includes a $2 billion investment \u2014 announced last October \u2014 in a facility in Wilson, North Carolina.",
      "The list also includes the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative announced by Open AI and Japan-based Softbank on Jan. 21, which had been in development for at least a year before Mr. Trump's inauguration. The companies said $100 billion would be deployed \"immediately,\" but offered few specifics on how or where the money would be spent.",
      "Comparing to investments under Biden",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he attracted more investment in two months than Biden did in four years, suggesting he brought in trillions in a matter of weeks while casting doubt that the former president secured even $1 trillion during his term.",
      "But there's no clear evidence to support his claim. A White House spokesperson said the president was referring to a December 2024 report from the Biden White House, which said the private sector committed at least $1 trillion to clean energy and manufacturing projects during Biden's term.",
      "However, Biden's list of investments highlighted \"a selection of private-sector investments in 21st century industries\" including green energy, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, based on project announcements in specific locations or factories under construction. The data on Biden's \"Investing in America\" spreadsheet also showed projects that closely resemble some on Mr. Trump's list.",
      "By comparison, the Trump administration's list includes broader, less specific investment pledges across a variety of industries \u2014 many without clear timelines or locations.",
      "For example, Mr. Trump's list highlights Apple's recent $500 billion pledge to U.S. manufacturing and training. However, as previously reported by The Washington Post, Apple also announced a $430 billion investment early in Biden's term, including a North Carolina engineering hub that was paused in 2024, and the Biden administration's report does not include any Apple investments in its tally.",
      "However, experts caution that announcements about planned investments don't guarantee action.",
      "\"Companies often will make announcements to essentially curry favor with an incoming administration to show how committed they are to the United States,\" said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S. \"It's not unusual whether it was President Trump or President Biden or President Obama.\"",
      "Presidents from both parties have claimed credit for projects started under their predecessors. For instance, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced investments during Mr. Trump's first term, some of which contributed to the construction of manufacturing facilities highlighted by the Biden White House investment report.",
      "During his term, Biden signed major pieces of legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which included $24 billion in tax credits to attract private investors in hopes of driving domestic manufacturing commitments.",
      "Such incentives may continue to fuel further projects during Mr. Trump's term, according to Nigro, provided they remain in place \u2014 but the long-term impact of federal policy, including under both Biden and Mr. Trump, may take years to assess.",
      "\"It's very hard to attach these new investments that have been announced as being tied directly to policies of the Trump administration. It's frankly just too early,\" Nigro said.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has mounted an intense diplomatic campaign to convince distant countries to accept migrants who are not their own.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has approached far-flung countries to aid its mass deportation effort, asking nations like Angola and Equatorial Guinea to accept migrants who are not their citizens, according to internal federal government documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "The talks are part of an intense diplomatic campaign by the Trump administration to convince as many nations as possible \u2014 including those with controversial human rights records \u2014 to receive deportees from the U.S., such as migrants whose home countries won't take them back.",
      "The administration has already brokered agreements with several Latin American countries willing to accept migrants who are not their own. In February, the U.S. deported hundreds of African and Asian migrants to Costa Rica and Panama. In March, the Trump administration sent nearly 300 Venezuelans accused of being gang members to El Salvador, which imprisoned them at an infamous mega-prison.",
      "Guatemala has also agreed to take in third country deportees from the U.S. The Mexican government, under a deal that preceded Mr. Trump's second term, has been receiving migrants from other Latin American countries, like Venezuela, caught crossing the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "But behind the scenes, the Trump administration has been negotiating with countries outside of the Western Hemisphere to send migrants thousands of miles away, across the Atlantic Ocean, to places in Africa and Europe.",
      "The Eastern Hemisphere countries that the Trump administration has identified as places that could potentially accept deportations of third country nationals include Angola, Benin, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Libya, Moldova and Rwanda, according to the internal government documents and officials. The U.S. has yet to announce any formal deals with these nations.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported on the internal talks with some of these countries in April. The negotiations with Angola and Equatorial Guinea have not been previously reported.",
      "It's unclear who exactly would be sent to the third countries if any deportation arrangements are finalized. But one of the ideas under consideration, the internal government documents show, would be for the U.S. to use the agreements to deport suspected members of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang Mr. Trump has made into a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "How deportees would be treated by governments that are not their own is also an open question. As part of its arrangement with El Salvador, for example, the U.S. agreed to give the Salvadoran government millions of dollars to detain Venezuelans deemed to be Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security referred questions about the deportation negotiations, and how the potential agreements would work, to the Department of State, which did not immediately comment on CBS News' reporting.",
      "The embassies of Benin, Eswatini, Libya, Moldova and Rwanda did not respond to requests for comment. A representative for the embassy of Equatorial Guinea said the \"Embassy is not aware of any such conversations going on between the two governments.\"",
      "On Monday, after CBS News published its story, a spokesperson for the Angolan Embassy in the U.S. said, \"Angola has stated that it is not accepting deported individuals of other nationalities.\"",
      "In recent years, Western countries bedeviled by migration crises and the accompanying political backlash have sought to forge diplomatic agreements that allow them to re-route migrants and asylum-seekers to third countries.",
      "The first Trump administration convinced El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to sign \"safe third country\" deals that allowed the U.S. to divert migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border to those countries; though only one of the deals was implemented before they were scrapped by the Biden administration.",
      "In 2022, the United Kingdom brokered a \"safe third country\" deal with Rwanda, but it was ultimately discontinued amid intense controversy and legal challenges. Under another arrangement, Albania agreed to host migrants in Italian custody, though that effort has been partially blocked by judges.",
      "Andrew Selee, the president of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based research group, said there are many legal, political and humanitarian questions about the agreements the Trump administration is considering, including whether the U.S. will try to ensure deportees are not mistreated in the receiving countries.",
      "A court ruling from April prohibited the Trump administration from sending deportees to a third country without informing them of the destination and allowing them to be screened for any concerns they have about being harmed there.",
      "But Selee said the deportation deals, even if they're limited in scope or held up in court, are principally designed to deter migrants from entering or staying in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"It sends a message that will scare off people from coming unauthorized to the U.S.,\" Selee said. \"And it allows them to say that they can deport people from any nationality somewhere.\"",
      "Standing alongside Mr. Trump during a White House cabinet meeting, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the Trump administration was \"actively searching for other countries to take people from third countries.\"",
      "\"We are working with other countries to say, 'we want to send you some of the most despicable human beings to your countries,'\" Rubio said. \"'Would you do that, as a favor to us? And the further away from America, the better.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Over a dozen states sued the Trump administration Monday for laying off thousands of Health and Human Services staffers, urging a court to reverse job cuts that they argue brought work at large swaths of the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-led health agency to a \"sudden halt.\"",
      "The lawsuit \u2014\u00a0filed in Rhode Island federal court by New York, California, 17 other states and Washington, D.C. \u2014 claims the Trump administration has sought to \"dismantle\" HHS through layoffs that disproportionately hit \"disfavored work and programs,\" like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "HHS is aiming to cut its headcount by 20,000 \u2014 or nearly 25% \u2014 through a combination of layoffs, buyouts and early retirement offers, the department announced in March, framing it as a \"dramatic restructuring\" aimed at making HHS more efficient and cutting redundant or unnecessary services. The cuts are part of a wider initiative by the Trump administration, led by billionaire Elon Musk, to slash the size of the federal government.",
      "Since then, thousands of HHS staff have gotten layoff notices. The cuts have hit large agencies like the FDA and CDC, along with departments that handle mental health, federal poverty guidelines and other services, CBS News has previously reported. Deep cuts are also slated for the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Monday's lawsuit, which names Kennedy and other HHS leaders as defendants, argues these job cuts have \"systematically deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job.\"",
      "The layoffs have allegedly cut off the states from data and made it harder to access grants for everything from worker safety to the Head Start preschool program, the lawsuit argues. The suit also says the agency has shuttered key disease\u00a0testing labs, forcing them to \"find new partners to handle their most difficult testing needs that had previously been handled by the CDC.\"",
      "The states are asking a federal judge to halt Kennedy's directive to reorganize and cut the HHS, arguing the moves exceed HHS's legal authority and violate the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine by slashing programs authorized by Congress.",
      "The suit also takes aim at Kennedy's views, citing his vaccine skepticism and \"history of advocating for the evisceration of the Department's statutorily mandated work promoting public health.\" It also pointed to Kennedy's acknowledgement that 20% of job cuts at the HHS may need to be reversed due to \"mistakes.\"",
      "An HHS spokesperson said in response to the lawsuit, \"HHS remains confident that the process will withstand legal scrutiny.\"",
      "\"We are following the law, period. Nothing has been rushed and multiple rounds of discussions between divisions and HHS occurred before the announcement. Every step taken has been deliberate, collaborative, and consistent with federal personnel policy and civil service protections,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson also defended changes to the agency, saying they \"are designed to strengthen the agency's capacity to serve the American public, not weaken it.\"",
      "Monday's suit is the latest legal action against the Trump administration's cost-cutting drive. Almost two dozen states sued HHS last month for cutting public health grants, and labor unions have sued the government over cuts to other agencies.",

      "\"Flew missions into different parts of Laos, and I flew in American military operative, translate for them, talk to troops on the ground and relayed it to the American troops,\" Wong said. \"I was traveling with so they could relay it back to the base or the headquarter and call for support.\"",
      "Wong served for 10 years, until the bitter end was inevitable. He knew it was no longer safe for him to stay.",
      "\"They called us traitors, so they don't like us,\" he said. \"It was so chaotic that we really didn't have time to think much about it other than how to survive.\"",

      "Frigid, and foreign, Wong was often met with a cold shoulder. He says his biggest barriers at first were language and culture.",
      "\"Initially, we were faced with some resentment from the community as well, thinking that we were here taking away services,\" he said.",

    "summary": "In recent weeks, Social Security has been plagued by problems related to technology, system errors, and even the marking of living people as dead.",
    "story": [
      "Rennie Glasgow, who has served 15 years at the Social Security Administration, is seeing something new on the job: dead people.",
      "They're not really dead, of course. In four instances over the past few weeks, he told KFF Health News, his Schenectady, New York, office has seen people come in for whom \"there is no information on the record, just that they are dead.\" So employees have to \"resurrect\" them \u2014 affirm that they're living, so they can receive their benefits.",
      "Revivals were \"sporadic\" before, and there's been an uptick in such cases across upstate New York, said Glasgow. He is also an official with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represented 42,000 Social Security employees just before the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Martin O'Malley, who led the Social Security Administration toward the end of the Biden administration, said in an interview that he had heard similar stories during a recent town hall in Racine, Wisconsin. \"In that room of 200 people, two people raised their hands and said they each had a friend who was wrongly marked as deceased when they're very much alive,\" he said.",
      "It's more than just an inconvenience, because other institutions rely on Social Security numbers to do business, Glasgow said. Being declared dead \"impacts their bank account. This impacts their insurance. This impacts their ability to work. This impacts their ability to get anything done in society.\"",
      "\"They are terminating people's financial lives,\" O'Malley said.",
      "Though it's just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead.",
      "Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times, thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to \"self-deport.\"",
      "Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. \"Why don't you just do due diligence to make sure what you're doing in the first place is correct?\" he said.",
      "The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration's crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program's future.",
      "But KFF Health News' interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities.",
      "Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece's difficulties with Social Security's disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece's address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer \u2014 whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record \u2014 believes they could be zero.",
      "Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece's bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment.",
      "Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore.",
      "The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece's disability payments, \"then she will be homeless,\" Seda recalled telling an agency employee. \"I don't know if I'm going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.\"",
      "Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency's efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, \"it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,\" the committee recently told the agency's inspector general.",
      "While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they're owed, she said.",
      "For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according to a January survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance.",
      "Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that's nearly unprecedented in their experience.",
      "Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members' March payments were several days late. \"For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,\" she said. \"The delayed payment is not something I've heard in the last 20 years.\"",
      "When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Mr. Trump's \"resounding mandate\" to make government more efficient.",
      "\"He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,\" Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions.",
      "Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general's office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News.",
      "A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security \u2014 which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 \u2014 had nearly doubled in March compared with last year.",
      "Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it's getting worse as experienced employees have been let go.",
      "\"We're seeing more mistakes being made,\" said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years' experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. \"We're seeing more things get dropped.\"",
      "What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn't show.",
      "She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem \u2014 only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said.",
      "Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm's policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored \u2014 the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there.",
      "\"To be told they've never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Researchers and lawyers say they have a suspicion about what's behind the problems at Social Security: the Elon Musk-led effort to revamp the agency.",
      "Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O'Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. \"As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,\" he predicted in an April hearing held by House Democrats. \"It's going to mean that if you go to a field office, you're going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.\"",
      "The departures have hit the agency's regional payment centers hard. These centers help process and adjudicate some cases. It's the type of behind-the-scenes work in which \"the problems surface first,\" Romig said. But if the staff doesn't have enough time, \"those things languish.\"",
      "Languishing can mean, in some cases, getting dropped by important programs like Medicare. Social Security often automatically deducts premiums, or otherwise administers payments, for the health program.",
      "Lately, Melanie Lambert, a senior advocate at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, has seen an increasing number of cases in which the agency determines beneficiaries owe money to Medicare. The cash is sent to the payment centers, she said. And the checks \"just sit there.\"",
      "Beneficiaries lose Medicare, and \"those terminations also tend to happen sooner than they should, based on Social Security's own rules,\" putting people into a bureaucratic maze, Lambert said.",
      "Employees' technology is more often on the fritz. \"There's issues every single day with our system. Every day, at a certain time, our system would go down automatically,\" said Glasgow, of Social Security's Schenectady office. Those problems began in mid-March, he said.",

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 The strange reproductive habits of a large, carnivorous New Zealand snail were once shrouded in mystery. Now, footage of the snail laying an egg from its neck has been captured for the first time, the country's conservation agency said Wednesday.",
      "What looks like a tiny hen's egg is seen emerging from an opening below the head of the Powelliphanta augusta snail, a threatened species endemic to New Zealand.",
      "The video was taken at a facility on the South Island's West Coast, where conservation rangers attempting to save the species from extinction have cared for a population of the snails in chilled containers for nearly two decades.",
      "The conditions in the containers mimic the alpine weather in their only former habitat - a remote mountain they were named for, on the West Coast of the South Island, that has been engulfed by mining.",
      "Lisa Flanagan from the Department of Conservation, who has worked with the creatures for 12 years, said the species still holds surprises.",
      "\"It's remarkable that in all the time we've spent caring for the snails, this is the first time we've seen one lay an egg,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Like other snails, Powelliphanta augusta are hermaphrodites, which explains how the creatures can reproduce when encased in a hard shell. The invertebrate uses a genital pore on the right side of its body, just below the head, to simultaneously exchange sperm with another snail, which is stored until each creates an egg.",
      "Each snail takes eight years to reach sexual maturity, after which it lays about five eggs a year. The egg can take more than a year to hatch.",
      "\"Some of our captive snails are between 25 and 30 years old,\" said Flanagan. \"They're polar opposites to the pest garden snail we introduced to New Zealand, which is like a weed, with thousands of offspring each year and a short life.\"",
      "The dozens of species and subspecies of Powelliphanta snails are only found in New Zealand, mostly in rugged forest and grassland settings where they're threatened by habitat loss.",
      "They're carnivores that slurp up earthworms like noodles and are some of the world's largest snails with oversized, distinctive shells in a range of rich earth colors and swirling patterns.",
      "The Powelliphanta augusta was the center of public uproar and legal proceedings in the early 2000s, when an energy company's plans to mine for coal threatened to destroy the snails' habitat.",
      "Some 4,000 were removed from the site and relocated, while 2,000 more were housed in chilled storage in the West Coast town of Hokitika to ensure the preservation of the species, which is slow to breed and doesn't adapt well to new habitats.",
      "In 2011, some 800 of the snails accidentally died in a Department of Conservation refrigerator with faulty temperature control.",
      "But the species' slow survival continues: In March this year, there were nearly 1,900 snails and nearly 2,200 eggs in captivity, the conservation agency said.",

    "story": [
      "Just weeks ago, scientists warned that a \"city killer\" asteroid had a small chance of hitting Earth. While that prediction was thankfully\u00a0revised, the planet may have to worry about another object plummeting down from the heavens \u2014 a 1970s spacecraft called Kosmos 482.",
      "The Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus a half century ago is expected to plunge uncontrolled back to Earth within hours. The Aerospace Corporation's re-entry prediction map\u00a0currently forecasts the object to come down at 03:37 UTC on Saturday,\u00a0\u00a0or 10:37 PM ET.",
      "It's too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek, a lecturer at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph, if it remains intact.",
      "\"While not without risk, we should not be too worried,\" Langbroek said in an email.",
      "Given its orbit, the spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, Langbroek wrote in a\u00a0blog post. That represents a vast area, including the United States, South America, Africa, Australia, and most of Europe and Asia south of the Arctic Circle. Still, most of the Earth is covered by water so the risk to humans remains low.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\"",
      "Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard & Smithsonian, told NPR that the spacecraft is making its \"final death plunge.\"",
      "\"I expect it'll have the usual one-in-several-thousand chance of hitting someone,\" McDowell wrote last month. \"No need for major concern, but you wouldn't want it bashing you on the head.\"",
      "Kosmos 482 launched in 1972",
      "The Soviet Union launched Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth's orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \"it'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\"",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, \"chances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,\" Langbroek said.",
      "Space debris could impact planes",
      "Space junk crashing back back to Earth could be a growing problem for aircraft, researchers warned in a\u00a0recent study.",
      "The study's authors said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights.",
      "The study found that high-density regions close to major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled rocket reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern U.S. or around major cities in Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was\u00a0published in Scientific Reports.",
      "Space junk has hit Earth recently",
      "Space debris has crashed back into Earth in recent months.",
      "In February, debris from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that blasted off in the United States entered the Earth's atmosphere over Poland. Two chunks from an unidentified object \u2014 both measuring about 5 feet by 3 feet \u2014 were later found on the ground. Police said it was possible the objects came from the SpaceX rocket.",
      "Last New Year's Eve, fragments of metal, believed to be from a rocket, crashed into a village in Kenya.",
      "In March 2024, NASA faced a lawsuit\u00a0from a family whose Florida home was hit by a piece of falling metal.",
      "The month before that, the European Space Agency said a satellite \u2014 weighing as much as an adult male rhinoceros \u2014 made an\u00a0uncontrolled return to Earth, reentering the atmosphere over the north Pacific Ocean between Alaska and Hawaii. Most of the satellite burned up as it reentered Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Stijn Lemmens, senior space debris mitigation analyst at the European Space Agency, told the BBC that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently,\" happening weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones.

He says a total of $200 billion will go toward causes that will help save and improve lives around the world.",
      "\"By deciding to spend all this money in the next 20 years, we can get a lot more done,\" Gates said in an interview taped last week, days before he announced the initiative. He's confident the money will save \"tens of millions of lives.\"",
      "A change of plans",
      "It's a decision Gates did not take lightly, explaining in a letter posted online Thursday that he was inspired by a famous quote from Andrew Carnegie's 1889 essay \"The Gospel of Wealth,\" which argued \"the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\"",
      "Gates said his net worth, which is currently $108 billion, will drop 99% over the next two decades.",
      "\"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people,\" Gates wrote.",

      "The Gates Foundation, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, has already spent $100 billion to help cut the global childhood mortality rate by investing in medical innovations. Gates said he's seen firsthand how impactful the distribution of vaccines for illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia can be. That's why he's determined to \"double down.\"",

      "\"So we should be going from 5 million children dying a year over the next five years to 4 million. And now with these cuts, if they're not reversed, we will go to over 6 million dying. So, instead of going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he's been in touch with President Trump and had a \"great discussion\" about some of his foundation's initiatives, including HIV prevention and polio, over dinner at Mar-a-Lago in December.",

      "More children will die due to aid cuts by Trump administration, Gates says",
      "As the U.S. and other European countries cut foreign aid budgets, health experts have voiced concerns about the implications for global health. In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March, marking a significant drop since 1990. Gates expects deaths could rise again, and it's something he wants to address.",
      "\"I will say, despite the challenges we have right now, which are huge and surprising, I'm very optimistic about the progress we can make over the next 20 years,\" Gates said. \"The next five, there will be setbacks because of these cutbacks, but we will get \u2013 and so the number 5 million might go up for a bit, which shouldn't happen. It's terrible. But, over time, we will get that number down even below 3 million.\"",
      "Gates urges U.S. leaders to consider the difference that maintaining foreign aid \u2014 roughly 1% of last year's federal budget\u00a0\u2014 can make.",
      "\"For 1%, if you can save lives for 1,000 times less than we save lives here, and if that creates stability in those countries, so they're thriving countries that will participate in the global economy,\" Gates explained. \"And we don't have to intervene with our military or anything, and the strategic relationship with them, where they see that we have helped them advance, and that that money is why you will be able to see a future pandemic early and stop it from spreading like COVID did all the way to the United States.\"",
      "Gates hopes the U.S. will follow his lead in helping some of the world's poorest nations, and said he will always advocate for governments to help.",

      "Some of these topics came up during a three-hour dinner\u00a0between Gates and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in December. Gates said they had a \"great discussion\" about polio and\u00a0 innovations in HIV prevention and working together to get an \"HIV cure sooner.\"",

Buffett, who is now 94 and announced this month he'll be\u00a0stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, made lifetime pledges two decades ago to five charities \u2014 including the Gates Foundation \u2014 that will continue until his death. At the time, it was the\u00a0largest philanthropic pledge in history.",
      "\"I should make sure that it's well spent. Warren Buffett's generosity, that's always \u2014 I have felt a huge responsibility to make sure his generosity is highly impactful. And now this is the last stage of all that,\" Gates added.",
      "What Gates hopes the world says about him in 100 years",
      "When asked what he hopes the world says about him 100 years from now, Gates said he has \"no interest\" in creating a lasting name for himself.",
      "\"If I cared about that, maybe I'd make the foundation a foundation that lasts forever. And other people choose to do that,\" Gates said. \"That's fine. I don't think that's the way to have the most impact. Most of the things I work on will no longer be problems.\"",
      "He hopes people a century from now will be puzzled by some of the diseases he's working to eradicate, like tuberculosis, measles and malaria.",
      "\"I think we will treat all children's lives as having value, because the world will be rich enough and the innovation of tools to let you do that will be so strong, you know, the childhood death number should be very small and not different between different countries,\" Gates said.",
      "AI is a \"very empowering tool\" for future generations",
      "Another tool that Gates believes could help: artificial intelligence.",
      "\"In a certain sense, it's going to be so novel that none of us are ready for it. But some of the aspects of it are incredibly positive,\" said Gates, who said he's seen firsthand how AI-powered teaching assistant Khanmigo, built by the nonprofit Khan Academy, is being used by math teachers in New Jersey.",
      "While AI can help foster curiosity and be a \"very empowering tool,\" Gates said kids will continue to forge their own paths based on their unique interests.",
      "\"Kids will choose what they're interested in. They don't all have to be AI scientists,\" he said.",
      "While some may voice concerns over AI being a motivation killer, Gates argues the opposite. It could give you more freedom and time to spend on things you're passionate about.",
      "\"Well, that's called the 'embarrassment of riches' problem, that you won't have to work the long hours that you work today. You won't have a shortage of doctors and huge waiting lists,\" said Gates, adding that he hopes AI will help support countries, like Africa, that are facing doctor shortages.",
      "\"Society will get to decide: how do you spend time? And how quickly that comes, you would get pretty broad disagreement, but, in general, that's where we're headed. And so \u2014 we will have more freedom. It's a lot better than things going backwards,\" he added.",

      "AI-generated accounts impersonating people with Down syndrome are spreading across social media, according to an analysis by CBS News Confirmed. Many of these artificial intelligence-backed profiles are gaining followers faster than real disability advocates \u2014 and they're making money from it.",
      "These fake accounts use feel-good messages, dance to trending songs, and thank their followers for supporting their journeys.",
      "One video is captioned, \"Be proud of yourself and your differences!\"",
      "\"So grateful I never gave up on my dream,\" reads another post.",
      "But the people featured in these accounts aren't real.",
      "CBS News Confirmed identified more than 30 accounts impersonating people with Down syndrome across Instagram, YouTube and TikTok. Some used deepfakes or AI faceswaps. Others mimicked real disability advocates' language and repackaged it to pass as authentic. Only a few accounts disclosed the use of AI.",
      "AI for clicks and cash",
      "Down syndrome communities have built strong followings on social media, using well-known hashtags like #DownSyndrome and #DownSyndromeAwareness to connect and share their stories. Imposters exploit those same tags to appear alongside real advocates.",
      "Many of the imposter accounts identified by CBS News posted videos on TikTok and Instagram using flirty or emotional captions to grab attention.",
      "\"A girl with Down syndrome can also go clubbing to flirt!\" text superimposed on one post reads.",
      "Other accounts shared videos responding to fabricated criticism in order to boost engagement and go viral.",

CBS News reached out to the account's owner, who went by the name \"Sara\" and said, \"Yeah, I make good money from it.\"",
      "Another well-known account, with more than 100,000 followers, claimed to raise money for the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS), one of the nation's leading advocacy groups. But the videos it shared featured a face that looked blurry and distorted, with telltale signs of AI. An NDSS spokesperson told CBS News they did not know this person and did not ask them to raise funds for the group. The account was later taken down.",
      "AI impersonators stealing others' stories is \"not right\"",
      "For people with Down syndrome, these fake accounts can feel like a new level of discrimination \u2014 one where their lived experiences are copied, exaggerated and monetized.",
      "\"It's not right to steal our stories just to get attention online,\" said Alex Bolden, who works for NDSS.",
      "Bolden, who has Down syndrome himself, told CBS News he's spent years working to build his 24,000 followers on Instagram \u2014 a number some impersonators have achieved in just a few months.",
      "\"Those are our stories. I work so hard to advocate and share my journey online and I can't believe people would try to take that away from me,\" he said.",
      "\"It's a disturbing trend,\" Michelle Sagan, who leads communications at NDSS, told CBS News. \"I've seen my friends' faces used in AI posts more than once.\"",
      "Approximately 5,700 people are born with Down syndrome every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "At their annual advocacy conference held in Washington, D.C., last week, multiple advocates agreed that only individuals with Down syndrome should be the ones to tell their stories.",
      "\"While there are many reasons why these fake accounts are wrong, the principle here is that individuals with Down syndrome are the only people who should be speaking about what it's like to have Down syndrome,\" NDSS President & CEO Kandi Pickard told CBS News.",
      "She said these influencers are not only impersonating someone's identity, but also exploiting a community that's already fighting to be heard.",
      "\"There is still so much work to be done to ensure that individuals with Down syndrome are included and respected in society,\" Pickard said.",
      "How have Meta, TikTok and YouTube responded?",

      "Each platform found that the accounts pointed out by CBS News had violated their policies, and removed or banned them after our inquiries. But many others still exist.",
      "Stopping the spread of AI-generated accounts is a moving target, as even when an account is taken down, another one can quickly appear. And, unlike real creators, these fake influencers don't need rest or time off. They generate new content instantly, flooding feeds and pushing real people on social platforms deeper into the margins.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia in January and instructs federal agencies to update all documents and maps to reflect the name change within six months of enactment. It now goes to the Senate.",
      "Even if the name change is codified into U.S. law, however, other countries would be under no obligation to refer to the Gulf of Mexico by the new name. If it isn't codified, a future president could reverse Mr. Trump's executive order.",

      "\"This is such an important thing to do for the American people,\" Greene said. \"The American people deserve pride in their country and they deserve pride in the waters that we own, that we protect with our military and our coastguard.\"",
      "Democrats have called the effort a waste of taxpayer dollars and said Congress should be spending its time on more serious issues. GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska was the sole Republican to oppose the measure.",

    "story": [
      "An inmate put to death last month in South Carolina's second firing squad execution was conscious and likely in extreme pain for up to a minute after the bullets missed their target and failed to quickly stop his heart, according to a pathologist hired by the inmate's attorneys.",
      "An autopsy photo of Mikal Mahdi's torso showed only two distinct wounds from the three prison employees who volunteered for the firing squad and had live ammunition in the April 11 execution, according to the pathologist's report. It was filed Thursday with a letter to the state Supreme Court titled \"notice of botched execution.\"",
      "Prison workers suggested to the pathologist who performed the autopsy that two bullets entered his body at the same spot.",
      "\"The shooters missed the intended target area and the evidence indicates that he was struck by only two bullets, not the prescribed three. Consequently, the nature of the internal injuries from the gunshot wounds resulted in a more prolonged death process,\" said Dr. Jonathan Arden, a pathologist hired by attorneys for condemned inmates.",
      "Arden said that likely meant Mahdi took 30 to 60 seconds to lose consciousness \u2014 two to four times longer than the 15 seconds that experts including Arden and ones hired by the state predicted for a properly conducted firing squad execution.",
      "During that time Mahdi would have suffered excruciating pain as his lungs tried to expand and move into a broken sternum and ribs, as well as from \"air hunger\" as the damaged lungs struggled and failed to bring in needed oxygen, Arden said.",
      "Witnesses to the execution heard Mahdi cry out as the shots were fired, groan again some 45 seconds later and let out one last low moan just before he appeared to draw his final breath at about 75 seconds.",
      "Mahdi, 42, was executed after admitting he killed Orangeburg Public Safety officer James Myers in 2004, shooting him at least eight times before burning his body. Myers' wife found him in the couple's Calhoun County shed, which had been the backdrop to their wedding 15 months earlier.",
      "Prison officials have given no indication that there were problems with Mahdi's execution. A shield law keeps many details private, including the training and methods used by the firing squad. A spokeswoman on Thursday said they were working to respond to the filing.",
      "The official autopsy did not include X-rays to allow the results to be independently verified; only one photo was taken of Mahdi's body, and no close-ups of the wounds; and his clothing was not examined to determine where the target was placed and how it aligned with the damage the bullets caused to his shirt, Arden said in a report summarizing his findings.",
      "\"I noticed where the target was placed on Mikal's torso, and I remember thinking to myself, 'I'm certainly not an expert in human anatomy, but it appears to me that target looks low,'\" said David Weiss, an attorney for Mahdi who was also a witness at his death.",
      "In the official autopsy report, pathologist Dr. Bradley Marcus wrote that the reason there were only two wounds is that one could have been caused by two bullets entering the body at the same spot. Marcus said he spoke to an unnamed prison official who reported that when the three volunteer firing squad members practice, sometimes their targets end up with just one or two holes from three live rounds.",
      "Arden called that virtually unheard of in his 40 years of examining dead bodies and said Marcus told him in a conversation that the possibility was remote.",
      "The autopsy found damage in only one of the four chambers of Mahdi's heart \u2014 the right ventricle. There was extensive damage to his liver and pancreas as the bullets continued down.",
      "\"The entrance wounds were at the lowest area of the chest, just above the border with the abdomen, which is an area not largely overlying the heart,\" Arden wrote.",
      "In their conversation Marcus also said the severe amount of liver damage was not anticipated and he \"expected the entrance wounds to be higher on the chest,\" Arden wrote in his report.",
      "In contrast, the autopsy on Brad Sigmon, the first man killed by firing squad in the state, showed three distinct bullet wounds and his heart was obliterated, Arden said. He added that the autopsy report in that case included X-rays, adequate photos and a cursory examination of his clothes.",
      "Without X-rays or other internal scans to follow the path of the bullets through Mahdi's body, no additional light could be shed on the two-bullets-through-one-hole claim, Arden said.",
      "Bradley declined to talk about his autopsy when reached by phone Thursday morning.",
      "Weiss said he was stunned that so little was done in the autopsy even after the pathologist saw only two holes in his chest. The apparent errors in how the execution was carried out are a major problem, he asserted.",
      "\"His heart was missed, and in all likelihood only two out of three shots were fired,\" Weiss said. \"And I think that raises incredibly difficult questions about the type of training and oversight that is going into this process.\"",
      "\"It was obvious to me as a lay person upon reading his autopsy report that something went wrong here. We should want to figure out what it was that went wrong when you've got state government carrying out the most serious, most grave possible type of function,\" Weiss said.",
      "Mahdi's body was cremated, preventing a second autopsy, Weiss said.",
      "South Carolina allows condemned inmates to choose whether to die by lethal injection, electric chair or firing squad. Sigmon's execution was the first by firing squad in 15 years anywhere in the U.S., and the fourth since 1976, with all of the others happening in Utah. The method had deep and violent roots around the world but was presented by South Carolina corrections officials as the most humane of the available options. In addition to known problems securing legitimate lethal injection drugs, autopsies have shown that lethal injection causes a rush of fluid into the lungs, and burns have been found on bodies after electrocutions.",
      "Three South Carolina inmates in the past year have chosen lethal injection, but the past two opted for the firing squad, saying they feared the other methods \u2014 autopsies have shown that lethal injection causes a rush of fluid into the lungs, and burns have been found on bodies after electrocutions.",
      "Twenty-six people remain on South Carolina's death row. Stephen Stanko, who has two death sentences for murders in Horry County and Georgetown County, has run out of appeals and likely will be scheduled to die in June.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 11:41:00 -0400",
    "summary": "34 million people live in one of these major U.S. cities that's sinking, new research shows. See if your area is on the list \u2014\u00a0and how quickly the land is moving.",
    "story": [
      "New York, Dallas, Seattle and 25 other major U.S. cities are sinking, threatening the structural integrity of buildings, roads, dams and other forms of infrastructure, new research found. The study's authors say it represents a looming threat to the infrastructure of these cities, which combined are home to some 34 million people.",
      "The study by Virginia Tech researchers, published in the journal Nature Cities on Thursday, used satellite-based radar measurements to visualize movement of the land underneath the nation's most populated cities, which they say is largely due to groundwater extraction.",
      "In all 28 of the cities they analyzed, at least 20% of urban areas are sinking, the researchers said. In 25 of the cities, they found at least 65% of the area is sinking, and more than 29,000 buildings are located in \"high and very high damage risk areas, indicating a greater likelihood of infrastructure damage.\"",
      "The cities with the most widespread sinking \u2014 impacting about 98% of their individual areas \u2014 are Chicago, Dallas, Columbus, Detroit, Fort Worth, Denver, New York, Indianapolis, Houston and Charlotte.",
      "Leonard Ohenhen, lead author of the study, said in a press release that when land shifts downward, even slightly, it can significantly compromise the structural integrity of buildings, roads, bridges and dams.",
      "\"A lot of small changes will build up over time, magnifying weak spots with urban systems and heighten flood risks,\" Ohenhen said.",
      "Manoochehr Shirzaei, an associate professor who works at Virginia Tech's Earth Observation and Innovation Lab, explained that the \"infrastructure can be silently compromised over time, with damage only becoming evident when it is severe or potentially catastrophic.\"",
      "\"This risk is often exacerbated in rapidly expanding urban centers,\" Shirzaei said.",
      "A major reason for this is groundwater extraction, they found, as rapidly growing cities demand more freshwater that must be drawn from aquifers. If that water is taken out faster than it can be replenished, the aquifer can crumble.",
      "Further compromising cities' structural integrity is the damage from extreme weather, amplified by climate change, which wasn't included in the study but nonetheless poses a threat. Experts have previously told CBS News that U.S. roads are not built to withstand rising global temperatures and excessive precipitation, which can cause them to buckle and collapse. The early April storms in the Midwest and South that killed at least two dozen people and caused widespread damage were made 14 times more likely due to higher temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, according to another study published this week.",
      "Repeated events such as these can degrade building materials and damage structures, further exacerbating the toll of the weakening ground below.",
      "Shel Winkley, a weather and climate engagement specialist with Climate Central and author of the April storms study, said their research shows \"It's really a moment for us to understand what this means not only now but for the future.\"",
      "Here are the cities analyzed in the study.",
      "Houston, Fort Worth and Dallas",
      "Researchers found that several cities in Texas, which they noted as the fastest-growing state, \"exhibit the highest measured subsidence rates among all cities,\" with an average sinking rate exceeding 4 millimeters every year.",
      "Houston was the fastest-sinking city out of those studied, with 42% of its land area subsiding faster than 5 mm per year and 12% subsiding faster than 10 mm per year, researchers found.",
      "However, the study says, \"it is essential to highlight that vertical land deformation often varies spatially within cities,\" and noted that some cities can experience \"hotspots\" with otherwise overall average land movement.",
      "\"From an urban risk perspective, the cities with the greatest spatial variability may experience the greatest hazard to urban infrastructure,\" the study says.",
      "New York City",
      "At least 10% of New York City is sinking, researchers found, but greater subsidence of more than 5mm per year has been found in LaGuardia Airport, one of the city's three major airports. LaGuardia recently underwent an $8 billion renovation and was named the best airport in the U.S. by Forbes Travel Guide in 2024.",
      "\"New York City alone accounts for 26% of the total subsiding population,\" the study says, \"with the other seven cities making up 5-8% of the population residing on subsiding land.\"",
      "San Francisco",
      "On the West Coast, vertical land motion \u2014 a term for how much the ground is sinking \u2014 may be at least partially influenced by tectonic activities, researchers found. Like other coastal cities included in the study, such as Los Angeles, San Diego and Jacksonville, San Francisco is also impacted by sea level rise. Much of the city was found to have at least a medium risk to its infrastructure damage due to sinking.",
      "\"Whereas natural processes influence urban land subsidence in the United States, most of the sinking land results from human-driven activities, with 80% of the subsidence associated with groundwater withdrawals.",
      "Chicago",
      "Chicago has an area-weighted vertical land movement of more than 2 millimeters per year, the researchers found. At least 10% of the city's area is sinking at a rate exceeding 3 mm per year.",
      "Other major cities",
      "Cities that are sinking between 1 and 2 millimeters every year include: Columbus, Ohio; Seattle; Detroit; Denver; Charlotte, North Carolina; Oklahoma City; Indianpolis; Washington, D.C., San Antonio, Texas; San Diego; Nashville, Tennessee; Los Angeles; and Las Vegas.",
      "Cities that are sinking at less than 1 mm per year, based on area-weighted vertical land movement, include: Portland, Oregon; Phoenix, Arizona; El Paso, Texas; Austin, Texas; Philadelphia and Boston.",
      "Three other cities \u2014 Memphis, Tennessee; San Jose, California; and Jacksonville, Florida \u2014 had a slightly positive vertical land movement, indicating a gain in elevation, the researchers found.",

    "summary": "The President's criticism comes a day after the Federal chair said the time isn't yet right for a rate cut.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for holding interest rates steady at the Fed's May 7 meeting, calling him a \"fool\" for acting \"too late\" in cutting the central bank's benchmark rate.",
      "Mr. Trump's post on his Truth Social app is the latest in a string of criticisms he's launched at Powell for holding rates steady this year. Meanwhile, the Bank of England on Thursday cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% amid concerns over the potential shock to global growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration.",
      "The Federal Reserve's last rate cut was made in December 2024, when the central bank lowered the rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, where it still stands.",
      "In a press conference yesterday, Powell articulated the Fed's reasoning for holding steady, including that economic data \u2014 for now \u2014 shows that the U.S. is in relatively good shape. The Fed chair also noted that its policymakers want to hold off on making any moves until the effects of Mr. Trump's economic policies become clearer, such as the impact of his broad tariffs on inflation and economic growth.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday inaccurately claimed there is \"virtually NO INFLATION.\" Inflation rose 2.4% on an annual basis in March, which reflects a cooler pace than in the prior months yet is still above the Fed's stated goal of reaching a 2% annual pace.",
      "\"Oil and Energy way down, almost all costs (groceries and 'eggs') down, virtually NO INFLATION, Tariff Money Pouring Into the U.S. \u2014 THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF 'TOO LATE!' ENJOY!,\" Mr. Trump wrote in his Thursday post.",
      "Powell has sought to stress the Federal Reserve's independence, noting in December that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials.",
      "The Fed's independence allows it to pursue its dual mandate \u2014 to keep inflation low and the labor market at full employment \u2014 without pressure from elected officials, economists say. Nations with central banks that move interest rates at the whim of politicians tend to have inflation spikes and other economic troubles, experts have noted.\u00a0\u00a0\"There's virtual unanimity among economists that monetary independence from political interference, that the Fed or any central bank be able to do the job that it needs to do, is really important,\" Austan Goolsbee, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank president, said in an April interview with CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's repeated pressure on Powell to lower rates could have the opposite effect, noted Will Denyer of investment advisory firm Gavekal Research.",
      "The Fed \"must avoid any appearance of bowing to Trump's pressure for rate cuts, which would further undermine shaky confidence in U.S. policymaking and the U.S. dollar,\" he wrote in a May 6 research note. \"The risk is that Trump has created an environment that forces Powell to move very cautiously going forward. By calling Powell 'Mr. Too Late,' the President may have created a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"",

The May 7 deadline for Americans to switch to the\u00a0federally compliant\u00a0identification comes after more than 20 years of being delayed. Real IDs will also be required to enter certain federal facilities.",
      "Despite the new security requirement, it was business as usual at many airports on Wednesday, with some airport websites reporting wait times at security checkpoints of just a few minutes.",
      "Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport's website, for example, showed wait times ranging from 5 to 16 minutes.",
      "At Chicago's O'Hare airport, wait times were actually lower than usual. Jim Spriggs, TSA's federal security director for Illinois, said 90% of O'Hare travelers were prepared for the Real ID deadline.",
      "\"Everything is normal operations,\" Acting TSA Director Adam Stahl told CBS News on Wednesday. \"We're of course enforcing the law while mitigating impacts to wait times.\"",

      "The TSA has extra staff\u00a0on hand at airports Wednesday to help travelers and explain the differences between acceptable forms of ID. Officers are using a secondary process to confirm the identity of travelers without a Real ID, passport or other compliant form of identification.",
      "Still, officials advised travelers to arrive at least three hours before a domestic flight, especially if they don't have a Real ID. People without Real IDs can still fly, although they may face extra security hurdles.",
      "The agency said it's seeing about 81% Real ID-compliance at airports. According to a\u00a0CBS News analysis\u00a0from April, at least 17 states were less than 50% compliant with the law.",
      "Those without Real ID can still apply",
      "While the ID cards are required for domestic air travel as of Wednesday, officials have emphasized that May 7 is not the last day Americans can get a Real ID.",
      "\"This is the beginning, or hopefully the mid-part, the continuation of enrollment,\" Stahl told CBS News. \"So if any individuals don't have their real ID, they can continue to enroll and get a real ID in the coming weeks and months.\"",
      "State government offices that issue driver's licenses and state IDs have seen a significant increase in demand for Real ID, with some extending their office hours to meet the spike in applications.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump will nominate Dr. Casey Means, an ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and prominent advocate for his agenda, to serve as the U.S. surgeon general, the president announced Wednesday.",
      "Means replaces Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, whose nomination was withdrawn\u00a0by the White House a day before she was scheduled to appear at a Senate confirmation hearing.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that Means \"has impeccable \"MAHA\" credentials\" \u2014 referring to the acronym for \"Make America Healthy Again,\" a slogan used by Kennedy.",
      "\"Her academic achievements, together with her life's work, are absolutely outstanding,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"Dr. Casey Means has the potential to be one of the finest Surgeon Generals in United States History.\"",
      "The surgeon general oversees 6,000 members of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, and helps set the national agenda on public health. The nominee must be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Who is Casey Means?",
      "Means was close to Kennedy during the campaign, along with her brother, Calley Means, who played a key role in orchestrating Kennedy's endorsement of Mr. Trump, according to some of Kennedy allies who played a role in the transition.",
      "Casey Means has\u00a0written about\u00a0how, after attending Stanford Medical School and training to become a surgeon, she opted to leave \"traditional medicine\" to devote her life to \"tackling the root cause of why Americans are sick.\"",
      "She co-founded Levels, a health app that can connect to glucose monitors, and has built a large following online for writing about health and wellness.",
      "Both Means siblings soared to prominence in recent years after viral interviews decrying the influence of the food and drug industry. Their views align with Kennedy's claims that unhealthy food and lifestyle choices underpin a vast swath of Americans' health conditions.",
      "\"Not only is our life expectancy declining, but our health during those years of life is poorer than ever due to preventable chronic diseases. Maybe we need to re-think our approach,\" she wrote in her newsletter. \"...This is the devil's bargain that drives our economy: we have a set of food, chemical, and agriculture industries that profit trillions per year from people consuming and using as much cheap, additive, chemical-filled food and products as possible, and we have a $4.5 trillion healthcare system that profits off of the resultant diseases that emerge.\"",
      "The two siblings authored the bestseller \"Good Energy\" after their mother died of pancreatic cancer, saying that she had been \"simply prescribed pills and not set on a path of curiosity about how these conditions are connected and how the root cause can be reversed.\"",

      "\"She's qualified. She's energetic. She's been a good communicator, which is the role of surgeon general. She seems to have good ethical moorings. And she reflects this new thinking about where HHS should be. I think it's a bold pick,\" Dr. Robert Malone, another close ally of Kennedy, told CBS News.",
      "Casey and Calley Means have also earned skepticism from some of Kennedy's anti-vaccine base, who have grown frustrated with what they fear has been Kennedy's drifting attention away from what they hoped would be a ban of several vaccines and towards a crackdown on unhealthy foods and additives like synthetic food dyes.",
      "\"The nutritional agenda is a core part of MAHA. It may not be their core part of MAHA. But there's no doubt that it's a central part of the overall mission,\" he said.",
      "Malone acknowledged the perception among some of Kennedy's base that Means had not been \"sufficiently vocal, early enough, in rejecting the mRNA vaccine products,\" as he had been.",
      "Malone himself rose to prominence criticizing the shots while painting himself as the inventor of mRNA vaccines, a claim that other scientists rejected as misinformation. He was with Kennedy and Mr. Trump in Florida on election night.",
      "Means has said she backs Kennedy \"relentlessly pushing for vaccine safety\" and said she thought it was \"criminal\" to require vaccinations. She has also claimed \"the current extreme and growing vaccine schedule\" could be \"causing health declines in vulnerable children. This needs to be investigated,\" she wrote on her website last year.",
      "Calley Means now serves as a special government employee, advising Kennedy and backing state bills promoting his agenda.",
      "Casey Means was initially favored as one contender for the surgeon general pick, some of Kennedy's allies said, but was passed over for Dr. Nesheiwat. Some of Kennedy's allies said they believed Nesheiwat's appearances on Fox News and ties to former national security adviser Mike Waltz, who is married to Nesheiwat's sister Julia, played a role in the president's decision.",

    "story": [
      "Melinda French Gates entered some of the most powerful circles while leading the foundation she co-founded with her ex-husband, Bill Gates, who announced on Thursday that it will close \"permanently\" at the end of 2045.",
      "French Gates, who studied computer science and worked at Microsoft, the company Gates created, exited the Gates Foundation last year to pursue philanthropy and investment through her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, which she started in 2015. The foundation changed its name from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation after her departure, which she previously described an \"evolution\" rather than a sudden move.",
      "French Gates offered written responses to The Associated Press' questions about the foundation's 25th anniversary and its decision to close in 20 years. She said the former couple had always intended to spend down their resources.",
      "\"Ultimately, though,\" she wrote, \"the timeline was Bill's decision to make with the board of trustees.\" Bill Gates says he will give away virtually all of his wealth over the next 20 years through the foundation, telling \"CBS Mornings\" that he hopes to live long enough to see some of the positive ways it has helped communities.",
      "The foundation has focused on tackling global challenges, including poverty, disease and inequity.",
      "The following responses from French Gates have been edited for length.",
      "Q: What do you hope the foundation's legacy will be?",
      "A: To me, the greatest measure of success would be if long after the foundation closed, someone, somewhere, was living a life that looked different because we existed. We talked a lot there about unlocking virtuous cycles. I like to think that right now, the foundation's work is contributing to a child getting a vaccine or a woman opening her first bank account \u2014 and that decades from now, their families and communities are going to continue to look different, because of what that child and that woman unlocked for the people around them.",
      "Q: What specific areas did you influence at the foundation?",
      "A: I was excited for us to launch the\u00a0Giving Pledge\u00a0because I believe that the most responsible thing to do with great wealth is give it away \u2014 and that you have an obligation to society to give it away as effectively as possible. I think it's important for people in that position to set norms around giving generously and to learn as much as possible from each other about how to be effective in their philanthropy.",
      "(As for gender), for too long, global health and development efforts treated women and girls as secondary \u2014 if they were considered at all. Data wasn't collected on their experiences. Their specific health needs were often ignored.",
      "There were so many questions that needed to be asked: What is the cost of all the unpaid labor women do at home? Will mobile banking make a difference if women don't have equal access to cellphones? Why are so many infectious diseases especially dangerous for women?",
      "We opened a gender equality division, but not just that \u2014 we made gender equality a priority across all of our work. And we put a lot of resources into expanding access to contraception, starting with a big commitment we made in 2012.",
      "Q: Why did you invest in opening more offices in other countries?",
      "A: When you're doing this kind of work, it doesn't take long to see that solutions that seem great on paper may not work in reality. We funded community toilets in India that people \u2014 especially women \u2014wouldn't use because they were dangerous to go to at night. We funded vaccines in Vietnam that had to be kept cold, but came in packaging that didn't fit into the small refrigerators most people had there. We funded a simple pump to help East African farmers irrigate their land, but women \u2014 who account for half of all smallholder farmers \u2014 wouldn't buy it, because they didn't want to be seen swaying their hips in the way the pump required.",
      "There are many ways to learn about the cultural norms and logistical issues that determine whether a solution is feasible \u2014 and they all boil down to engaging people with local knowledge and lived experience, and trusting what they tell you.",
      "Q: Some foundation goals \u2014 like eradicating polio and controlling malaria \u2014 depend on the generosity of other countries and donors. How can you accomplish those goals given recent cuts to international aid?",
      "A: It's easy for people to forget \u2014 or maybe they didn't ever know \u2014 how hopeless the situation seemed around the year 2000, when malaria, tuberculosis and HIV were totally out of control. Since then, efforts funded, in large part, by development aid have saved more than 65 million lives from those diseases alone.",
      "No doubt the work has just gotten a lot harder, but we never thought it was going to be easy. And we still have the key ingredients of success. The pipeline of innovations has never been stronger. More lower-income countries are taking a leading role. As some donors announce cuts, others are stepping up.",

The animal \"lifted her about a foot off the ground with its horns,\" the park said at the time. Also in 2024, an Idaho man allegedly kicked a bison and was attacked by the animal.

      "Bill Gates wants to share all of his good fortune \u2014 literally.",
      "The billionaire businessman and philanthropist revealed exclusively to \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday that he will give away virtually all of his wealth over the next 20 years through the Gates Foundation. He says a total of $200 billion will go toward causes that will help save and improve lives around the world.",
      "\"By deciding to spend all this money in the next 20 years, we can get a lot more done,\" Gates said in an interview taped last week, days before he announced the initiative. He's confident the money will save \"tens of millions of lives.\"",
      "A change of plans",
      "It's a decision Gates did not take lightly, explaining in a letter posted online Thursday that he was inspired by a famous quote from Andrew Carnegie's 1889 essay \"The Gospel of Wealth,\" which argued \"the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\"",
      "Gates said his net worth, which is currently $108 billion, will drop 99% over the next two decades.",
      "\"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people,\" Gates wrote.",
      "So, he changed his plans. The Gates Foundation, which was originally supposed to shutter decades after his and ex-wife Melinda French Gates' deaths, will now close in 2045.",
      "The Gates Foundation, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, has already spent $100 billion to help cut the global childhood mortality rate by investing in medical innovations. Gates said he's seen firsthand how impactful the distribution of vaccines for illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia can be. That's why he's determined to \"double down.\"",
      "He has three main goals: stopping the deaths of mothers and children from preventable causes, eradicating deadly infectious diseases, and putting more countries on a path to prosperity \u2014 with a focus on improving education.",
      "Gates says more children could die due to Trump administration aid cuts",
      "But he's concerned progress could be stalled as the U.S. and European countries scale back on foreign aid and reduce humanitarian funding.",
      "In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March. Without substantial government assistance, Gates says that number will rise.",
      "\"So we should be going from 5 million children dying a year over the next five years to 4 million. And now with these cuts, if they're not reversed, we will go to over 6 million dying. So, instead of going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he's been in touch with President Trump and had a \"great discussion\" about some of his foundation's initiatives, including HIV prevention and polio, over dinner at Mar-a-Lago in December.",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said. \"And I'm hoping, both with the president or the Congress, to get them to restore some of those aid activities.\"",
      "On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to start the country's withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March, the Trump administration revealed plans to shrink the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 a major overhaul that impacted thousands of employees. Part of his plans to slash federal spending also included the suspension of U.S. foreign aid assistance, essentially gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",

      "The Gates Foundation isn't large enough to replace U.S. foreign aid. In fiscal 2024 alone, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, according to the Pew Research Center, which cited ForeignAssistance.gov. The U.S. federal government spent four times more on global health than the Gates foundation, Gates said.",
      "\"You always want more money going into these things where you're saving lives for a few thousand dollars.

Bush \u2014 like his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief launched in 2003 \u2014 which he says should be maintained.",

      "\"And after that, there will be other very wealthy people who can understand what the problems are, what's still left over,\" Gates said.",
      "\"And, in a way, it's wild that somebody can have as much money as I do,\" he added.",
      "More children will die due to aid cuts by Trump administration, Gates says",
      "As the U.S. and other European countries cut foreign aid budgets, health experts have voiced concerns about the implications for global health. In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March, marking a significant drop since 1990. Gates expects deaths could rise again, and it's something he wants to address.",
      "\"I will say, despite the challenges we have right now, which are huge and surprising, I'm very optimistic about the progress we can make over the next 20 years,\" Gates said. \"The next five, there will be setbacks because of these cutbacks, but we will get \u2013 and so the number 5 million might go up for a bit, which shouldn't happen. It's terrible. But, over time, we will get that number down even below 3 million.\"",
      "Gates urges U.S. leaders to consider the difference that maintaining foreign aid \u2014 roughly 1% of last year's federal budget\u00a0\u2014 can make.",
      "\"For 1%, if you can save lives for 1,000 times less than we save lives here, and if that creates stability in those countries, so they're thriving countries that will participate in the global economy,\" Gates explained. \"And we don't have to intervene with our military or anything, and the strategic relationship with them, where they see that we have helped them advance, and that that money is why you will be able to see a future pandemic early and stop it from spreading like COVID did all the way to the United States.\"",
      "Gates hopes the U.S. will follow his lead in helping some of the world's poorest nations, and said he will always advocate for governments to help.",
      "\"We never ask for more than 1% to go to helping the poorest. And I think cutting \u2014 when you're well below that 1%, cutting that I think \u2013 doesn't reflect the values I think we should stand for,\" said Gates, adding that the U.S. shouldn't cut money for vaccines or HIV medicines.",
      "Some of these topics came up during a three-hour dinner\u00a0between Gates and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in December. Gates said they had a \"great discussion\" about polio and\u00a0 innovations in HIV prevention and working together to get an \"HIV cure sooner.\"",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said.",

      "Gates fears foreign aid cuts could lead to even more childhood deaths due to a lack of vaccines and HIV medicines that prevent mothers from infecting their babies.",
      "\"Instead of [deaths] going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "The \"last chapter\" of Gates' career",
      "Gates is marking many significant milestones this year \u2014 the Gates Foundation turning 25 years old, Microsoft turning 50 and Gates himself turning 70.",
      "\"I'm stunned that I'm 70, because, when I was young, and I thought, hey, those old people don't\u2026 they're not very up to date on what's changing, what's important. And so here I am,\" said Gates, admitting that his \"Microsoft days were very intense.\"",
      "These days, he's spending his spare time playing pickleball and tennis, and reading. He also travels regularly to Africa and India as part of his work with the Gates Foundation, overseeing some of the programs he's partnered with to improve health and development.",
      "\"I get to travel and see the impact. And I'm not working. In my 20s, all I did was work,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he doesn't \"feel like a 70-year-old,\" but he wishes he had \"even more time.\"",
      "Toward the end of a letter he posted online Thursday explaining his decision to give away virtually all his wealth, Gates said he's beginning the \"last chapter\" of his career.",
      "\"And I hope I'm lucky enough that during the 20 years that we spend all of these resources that I will be able to both help guide it somewhat and see the work and make sure that others are going to step in to pick up whatever doesn't get done during these next 20 years,\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Part of Gates' motivation stems from the generosity of his good friend Warren Buffett, who has donated billions to the Gates Foundation over the past 19 years. Buffett, who is now 94 and announced this month he'll be\u00a0stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, made lifetime pledges two decades ago to five charities \u2014 including the Gates Foundation \u2014 that will continue until his death. At the time, it was the\u00a0largest philanthropic pledge in history.",
      "\"I should make sure that it's well spent. Warren Buffett's generosity, that's always \u2014 I have felt a huge responsibility to make sure his generosity is highly impactful. And now this is the last stage of all that,\" Gates added.",
      "What Gates hopes the world says about him in 100 years",
      "When asked what he hopes the world says about him 100 years from now, Gates said he has \"no interest\" in creating a lasting name for himself.",
      "\"If I cared about that, maybe I'd make the foundation a foundation that lasts forever. And other people choose to do that,\" Gates said. \"That's fine. I don't think that's the way to have the most impact. Most of the things I work on will no longer be problems.\"",
      "He hopes people a century from now will be puzzled by some of the diseases he's working to eradicate, like tuberculosis, measles and malaria.",
      "\"I think we will treat all children's lives as having value, because the world will be rich enough and the innovation of tools to let you do that will be so strong, you know, the childhood death number should be very small and not different between different countries,\" Gates said.",
      "AI is a \"very empowering tool\" for future generations",
      "Another tool that Gates believes could help: artificial intelligence.",
      "\"In a certain sense, it's going to be so novel that none of us are ready for it. But some of the aspects of it are incredibly positive,\" said Gates, who said he's seen firsthand how AI-powered teaching assistant Khanmigo, built by the nonprofit Khan Academy, is being used by math teachers in New Jersey.",
      "While AI can help foster curiosity and be a \"very empowering tool,\" Gates said kids will continue to forge their own paths based on their unique interests.",
      "\"Kids will choose what they're interested in. They don't all have to be AI scientists,\" he said.",
      "While some may voice concerns over AI being a motivation killer, Gates argues the opposite. It could give you more freedom and time to spend on things you're passionate about.",
      "\"Well, that's called the 'embarrassment of riches' problem, that you won't have to work the long hours that you work today. You won't have a shortage of doctors and huge waiting lists,\" said Gates, adding that he hopes AI will help support countries, like Africa, that are facing doctor shortages.",
      "\"Society will get to decide: how do you spend time? And how quickly that comes, you would get pretty broad disagreement, but, in general, that's where we're headed. And so \u2014 we will have more freedom. It's a lot better than things going backwards,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "White smoke has emerged from the chimney above the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican, signaling that a new pope has been chosen with a decisive vote by the cardinal electors gathered for the papal conclave. Soon, the crowd in St. Peter's Square and people around the globe will hear the traditional proclamation, \"Habemus papam\" \u2014 Latin for \"We have a pope\" \u2014 and learn who has been chosen as the 267th pontiff to lead the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.",
      "Tens of thousands of people gathered in the late afternoon sunshine in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican erupted in a cheer as the smoke was seen pouring from the chimney.",
      "When will we know who the new pope is?",
      "It has historically taken a little time for the Vatican to announce the name of the new pope after the\u00a0white smoke is seen above the Sistine Chapel.",
      "In 2013, when Pope Francis was elected, it took around an hour for his identity to be made public.",
      "After a pope is elected by the cardinal electors, he is asked whether he accepts the results of the vote and what name he chooses to go by as pontiff. Once he formally accepts the role and chooses his name, cardinals then express their homage and obedience to the new leader of the Catholic Church, and he is fitted with his papal robes.",
      "Traditionally, an announcement is then made from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica. Then the new pontiff steps out onto the balcony and makes his first public appearance to deliver a blessing.",
      "The cardinals responsible for choosing a new pope typically select someone from among their own ranks, although it isn't required. This time around, Vatican-watchers have focused on about a dozen cardinals viewed as potential frontrunners. But the closed-door decision-making can go in surprising ways as the cardinal electors wrestle with the challenges facing the church and different visions for its future.",
      "How does the duration of the 2025 conclave compare to past conclaves?",
      "The conclave to choose a successor to Pope Francis began on Wednesday afternoon, local time. The 133 cardinal electors taking part in the process prayed together and took a vow of secrecy before the doors closed and the first round of votes were cast. As night fell, black smoke rose from the Sistine Chapel's chimney, indicating they had not yet agreed on a choice.",
      "On Thursday morning, the cardinals resumed the process for Day 2\u00a0and, yet again, before lunch time in Rome, black smoke signaled no decisive outcome from the morning's round of two votes.",
      "In recent history, conclaves have tended to only last a couple of days.",
      "Some past conclaves, however, dragged on much longer. The longest one ever, in the 13th century, took almost three years to choose Pope Gregory X.",
      "The shortest conclave on record, in 1503, took just 10 hours to choose Pope Pius III.",
      "How long was the conclave that elected Pope Francis?",
      "The conclave that elected Pope Francis began on March 12, 2013, and he was announced as pope the next day, after five ballots.",

      "Dozens of world leaders invited by President Vladimir Putin have gathered in Moscow for the events, and the fact that our CBS News team was allowed in to witness it all shows how much things have changed in just 100 days. U.S. relations with Russia under President Trump have thawed, and American media have been invited in to see the grand spectacle of the Victory Day commemorations.",
      "Thursday brought a dress rehearsal for the main event, a lavish military parade set to take place on May 9, the day on which Russia celebrates its historic victory over the Nazis. Due to the time difference between Russia and the Western European nations where the German surrender was cemented, the U.S. and its European allies mark the Victory in Europe on May 8 every year \u2014 the day on which Adolf Hitler's forces capitulated to the Allies in 1945, ending World War II on the continent.",
      "Putin's guest of honor this year, China's President Xi Jinping, was already in town on Thursday. He's the most powerful of several world leaders who have come to show that, despite international sanctions and widespread condemnation of Putin's so-called \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, the Russian leader does have friends.",
      "According to China's\u00a0state-run media, the two leaders took advantage of Xi's visit to sign more than 20 \"bilateral cooperation documents,\" covering issues including \"global strategic stability, maintaining the authority of international law\" and biosecurity. The two countries have emphasized their deepening ties for several years, with the Kremlin declaring in 2022 that Russia and China would strive to create a\u00a0new \"democratic world order.\"",

    "summary": "Bill Gates\u200b announced\u200b on Thursday that the Gates Foundation will close \"permanently\" at the end of 2045.",
    "story": [
      "Melinda French Gates entered some of the most powerful circles while leading the foundation she co-founded with her ex-husband, Bill Gates, who announced on Thursday that it will close \"permanently\" at the end of 2045.",
      "French Gates, who studied computer science and worked at Microsoft, the company Gates created, exited the Gates Foundation last year to pursue philanthropy and investment through her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, which she started in 2015. The foundation changed its name from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation after her departure, which she previously described an \"evolution\" rather than a sudden move.",
      "French Gates offered written responses to The Associated Press' questions about the foundation's 25th anniversary and its decision to close in 20 years. She said the former couple had always intended to spend down their resources.",
      "\"Ultimately, though,\" she wrote, \"the timeline was Bill's decision to make with the board of trustees.\" Bill Gates says he will give away virtually all of his wealth over the next 20 years through the foundation, telling \"CBS Mornings\" that he hopes to live long enough to see some of the positive ways it has helped communities.",
      "The foundation has focused on tackling global challenges, including poverty, disease and inequity.",
      "The following responses from French Gates have been edited for length.",
      "Q: What do you hope the foundation's legacy will be?",
      "A: To me, the greatest measure of success would be if long after the foundation closed, someone, somewhere, was living a life that looked different because we existed. We talked a lot there about unlocking virtuous cycles. I like to think that right now, the foundation's work is contributing to a child getting a vaccine or a woman opening her first bank account \u2014 and that decades from now, their families and communities are going to continue to look different, because of what that child and that woman unlocked for the people around them.",
      "Q: What specific areas did you influence at the foundation?",
      "A: I was excited for us to launch the\u00a0Giving Pledge\u00a0because I believe that the most responsible thing to do with great wealth is give it away \u2014 and that you have an obligation to society to give it away as effectively as possible. I think it's important for people in that position to set norms around giving generously and to learn as much as possible from each other about how to be effective in their philanthropy.",
      "(As for gender), for too long, global health and development efforts treated women and girls as secondary \u2014 if they were considered at all. Data wasn't collected on their experiences. Their specific health needs were often ignored.",
      "There were so many questions that needed to be asked: What is the cost of all the unpaid labor women do at home? Will mobile banking make a difference if women don't have equal access to cellphones? Why are so many infectious diseases especially dangerous for women?",
      "We opened a gender equality division, but not just that \u2014 we made gender equality a priority across all of our work. And we put a lot of resources into expanding access to contraception, starting with a big commitment we made in 2012.",
      "Q: Why did you invest in opening more offices in other countries?",
      "A: When you're doing this kind of work, it doesn't take long to see that solutions that seem great on paper may not work in reality. We funded community toilets in India that people \u2014 especially women \u2014wouldn't use because they were dangerous to go to at night. We funded vaccines in Vietnam that had to be kept cold, but came in packaging that didn't fit into the small refrigerators most people had there. We funded a simple pump to help East African farmers irrigate their land, but women \u2014 who account for half of all smallholder farmers \u2014 wouldn't buy it, because they didn't want to be seen swaying their hips in the way the pump required.",
      "There are many ways to learn about the cultural norms and logistical issues that determine whether a solution is feasible \u2014 and they all boil down to engaging people with local knowledge and lived experience, and trusting what they tell you.",
      "Q: Some foundation goals \u2014 like eradicating polio and controlling malaria \u2014 depend on the generosity of other countries and donors. How can you accomplish those goals given recent cuts to international aid?",
      "A: It's easy for people to forget \u2014 or maybe they didn't ever know \u2014 how hopeless the situation seemed around the year 2000, when malaria, tuberculosis and HIV were totally out of control. Since then, efforts funded, in large part, by development aid have saved more than 65 million lives from those diseases alone.",
      "No doubt the work has just gotten a lot harder, but we never thought it was going to be easy. And we still have the key ingredients of success. The pipeline of innovations has never been stronger. More lower-income countries are taking a leading role. As some donors announce cuts, others are stepping up.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/conclave-pope-smoke-black-white-history/",
    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 10:08:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's how the conclave creates black and white smoke and why the Catholic Church began using them to signal whether a new pope has been elected.",
    "story": [
      "Black smoke rising from the Sistine Chapel chimney on Wednesday and again Thursday morning indicated that a new pope had not yet been chosen to replace Pope Francis.",
      "Using smoke to communicate to the public whether a new pope has been elected is somewhat a recent tradition for the Catholic Church. Cardinal electors in the conclave, which originates from a Latin word meaning \"with key,\" are locked away with no contact to the outside world. So they use one of the oldest methods of long-distance communication: smoke signals.",
      "What black and white smoke means",
      "After the cardinals' votes are counted, the paper ballots are burned in a stove in the Sistine Chapel. Black smoke emerging from the chimney means the world's 1.4 billion Catholics don't yet have a new pope. White smoke means the cardinals have chosen a new leader of the church.",
      "Why the Vatican uses smoke to announce a pope",
      "Smoke signals have been used for communication for millennia, Clare Johnson, professor of Liturgical Studies and Sacramental Theology at Australian Catholic University wrote in an article published in\u00a0The Conversation. They have been used as a warning, a call to gather or to transmit news \u2014 and many Indigenous peoples use sophisticated techniques to indicate specific messages.",
      "\"These techniques can include changing the location of the fire (such as halfway up or at the top of a hill), adjusting the colour of smoke (using different types of foliage or damp/dry foliage) and the interruption or diversion of the smoke column at different intervals to produce particular patterns of smoke,\" Johnson wrote.",
      "Cardinals of the conclave have been burning ballots since at least 1417, according to the professor, but it wasn't until the 18th century that the Sistine Chapel had its first chimney installed. After that, smoke at certain times meant a new pope had not been elected and the absence of smoke indicated that the was a new pope, according to Johnson.",
      "The first time white smoke was the indicator that a new pope was elected was in 1914. The previous pope, Pius X, had mandated in 1904 that all papers related to the election, not just the ballots, be burned, \"thus producing a great deal more white smoke for the final ballot and making it truly visible,\" historian Frederic J. Baumgartner wrote in his book, \"Behind Locked Doors: A History of the Papal Elections.\"",
      "Johnson also noted, \"A stereotypical association of the colour of the smoke \u2014 white (positive) and black (negative) \u2014 lies behind the use of the two contrasting smoke colours.\"",
      "How the conclave creates black and white smoke",
      "Over the years, the conclave has used different methods to create black and white smoke.",
      "After some confusion in past conclaves, including in 1958, when smoke first appeared white and then became darker, the conclave began using chemicals to get the proper color.",
      "In 2013, former Vatican spokesperson Federico Lombardi\u00a0revealed that the cardinals added cartridges containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene \u2014 a component of coal tar \u2014 and sulfur to the burned ballots to create black smoke. And if a new pope has been elected, potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin would be added to produce white smoke.",
      "Has a pope ever been elected on the first ballot?",
      "It is possible for a pope to be elected on the first ballot, but a pope hasn't received the two-third majority on the first ballot in recent elections.",
      "The shortest conclave on record was in 1503, when it took the cardinals only 10 hours to choose Pope Pius III as the new pontiff. The late Pope Francis was elected in two days with five ballots and the two popes before him had been elected in two or three days.",
      "The longest conclave on record dragged on for nearly three years. Pope Gregory X was finally elected in September of 1271 after about 1,000 days.",

      "Just weeks ago, scientists warned that a \"city killer\" asteroid had a small chance of hitting Earth. While that prediction was thankfully\u00a0revised, the planet may have to worry about another object plummeting down from the heavens \u2014 a 1970s spacecraft called Kosmos 482.",
      "The Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus a half century ago is expected to plunge uncontrolled back to Earth within hours. The Aerospace Corporation's re-entry prediction map\u00a0currently forecasts the object to come down at 03:37 UTC on Saturday,\u00a0\u00a0or 10:37 PM ET.",
      "It's too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek, a lecturer at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph, if it remains intact.",
      "\"While not without risk, we should not be too worried,\" Langbroek said in an email.",
      "Given its orbit, the spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, Langbroek wrote in a\u00a0blog post. That represents a vast area, including the United States, South America, Africa, Australia, and most of Europe and Asia south of the Arctic Circle. Still, most of the Earth is covered by water so the risk to humans remains low.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\"",
      "Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard & Smithsonian, told NPR that the spacecraft is making its \"final death plunge.\"",
      "\"I expect it'll have the usual one-in-several-thousand chance of hitting someone,\" McDowell wrote last month. \"No need for major concern, but you wouldn't want it bashing you on the head.\"",
      "Kosmos 482 launched in 1972",
      "The Soviet Union launched Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth's orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \"it'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\"",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, \"chances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,\" Langbroek said.",
      "Space debris could impact planes",
      "Space junk crashing back back to Earth could be a growing problem for aircraft, researchers warned in a\u00a0recent study.",
      "The study's authors said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights.",
      "The study found that high-density regions close to major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled rocket reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern U.S. or around major cities in Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was\u00a0published in Scientific Reports.",

      "Britain says the deal will cut\u00a0tariffs\u00a0on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, adding that the agreement sets a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles that can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff.",
      "News of a potential deal inflated investor confidence Thursday, with markets making gains in early trading. Following the trade deal announcement, the S&P 500 soared 55 points, or 1%, to 5,686 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 408 points, or 1% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.3%.",
      "The overtures with the U.K. could be the first of other trade agreements, with Mr. Trump and his team in negotiation mode with foreign leaders from Canada, Italy, India, Japan and other trading partners since announcing his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on April 2.",
      "A trade deal with China is another potential agreement on the horizon. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is traveling to Switzerland this weekend, where he will meet with a Chinese trade delegation.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed levies of as high as 145% on Chinese imports, leading the country to fire back with 125% tariffs on American goods.",
      "For businesses, consumers and investors, progress on the trade front can't come soon enough amid ongoing uncertainty on where the U.S. economy is headed. A 10% baseline tariff on most imported goods has been in effect since April 5, while so-called reciprocal tariffs against other countries \u2014 with the exception of China \u2014 are paused until July.",
      "Where do negotiations stand?",
      "The announcement Thursday of a deal with the U.K. marks what could be the first of other trade agreements, with Mr. Trump and his team in negotiation mode with foreign leaders from Canada,\u00a0Italy, India, Japan and other trading partners since announcing his\u00a0\"Liberation Day\" tariffs\u00a0on April 2.",
      "Mr. Trump has not specified when agreements with other countries would be announced, but said that more deals are to follow.",
      "\"We have many meetings planned today and tomorrow,\" the President said Thursday during the announcement from the Oval Office. \"And every country wants to be making deals.\"",
      "While testifying on Capitol Hill earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed the timeline for trade deals: \"I'd be surprised if we don't have more than 80% or 90% of those wrapped up by the end of the end of the year. And that may be much sooner,\" he said, referring to countries with which the U.S. has trade deficits.",
      "Some experts, however, believe negotiations will take longer.",
      "Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics believes that countries with whom the Trump administration is negotiating will have it in their interest to move slowly in their trade discussions. That's because of the longterm implications these deals will have, the former South Korean trade minister told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Negotiations will likely drag past May into June, according to Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, although some countries might be motivated to act quickly.",
      "\"Everyone facing negotiations has been told to submit letters with their 'best offers,'\" Bremmer said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, \"and smaller countries that desperately want/need deals are complying.\"",
      "Who is the U.S. negotiating with?",
      "Bessent told the House committee Tuesday that the U.S. has 18 \"important trading relationships\" and is currently negotiating with 17 to reach deals. \"Many of our trading partners have approached us with very good offers and we are in the process of renegotiating those,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration in recent weeks has discussed trade and tariffs with Canada, Italy, India and Japan.",
      "It's unclear which deals will be announced first, but Clayton Allen, who covers politics and policy in Washington for Eurasia Group, said to look for deals with Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and India \u2014 countries that have been engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S. the longest.",
      "Eurasia predicts a deal with Japan could come in mid-June.",
      "China absent from negotiations for now",
      "What Bessent did make clear to Congress on Tuesday is that the U.S. has not yet entered into active trade talks with China.\u00a0 President Trump in April said that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid tariff tensions, but\u00a0China denied\u00a0any talks between Beijing and Washington had taken place.",
      "The Treasury secretary, however, is set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend while conducting trade talks in Switzerland, the Trump administration\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday.",
      "A\u00a0post\u00a0from the Chinese Embassy on X confirmed the meeting. \"Based on full consideration of global expectations, China's interests, and the appeals of the U.S. business community and consumers, #China has decided to agree to engage with the #US side,\" the posts reads. \"As China's lead on China-U.S. economic and trade affairs, Vice Premier He Lifeng will hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during his visit to #Switzerland from May 9 to 12.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the embassy said in a statement Wednesday that the U.S. has reached out to China \"through various channels\" and that the talks are being held \"at the request of the U.S. side.\" The spokesperson added that China \"firmly\u2002oppose[s]\u2002the U.S. abuse of tariffs.\"",
      "In a press briefing on Thursday, Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong reiterated this stance, saying the U.S. \"needs to show sincerity to talk and be prepared to rectify its wrongdoing and cancel unilateral tariffs,\" according to\u00a0Bloomberg.",
      "What could trade agreements look like?",
      "While it's hard to predict what any potential tariff deals might include, Yeo, who has helped orchestrate several bilateral and mulitlateral trade negotiations in the past, said such agreements would likely be nonbinding \"gentlemen's agreements\" or memorandums of understanding.",
      "In other words, the U.S. could come to an agreement with a trading partner only to renege later on by issuing additional tariffs.",
      "\"The framework deal is only as good as the nice piece of paper that you write it down on,\" said Eurasia's Allen. \"Trade deals are very, very complex animals, and you're going to get probably top line agreement on some key issues of concern with a promise to come back and negotiate other things,\" he said.",
      "Asked by Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce about the format of the deals, Bessent on Tuesday said, \"I expect that we can see a substantial reduction in the tariffs that we are being charged, as well as nontariff barriers, currency manipulation and the subsidies of both labor and capital investment.\"",
      "More details on tariffs may be coming soon. During an Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that his team would spell out specific tariff rates for each country \u2014 although he clarified that number could be adjusted in the future.",
      "\"It's going to be a very fair number, it'll be a low number,\" the President said. \"We're not looking to hurt countries, we want to help countries. We want to be friendly with countries.\"",

    "story": [
      "The most senior members of the Catholic Church have begun the process of\u00a0choosing a successor\u00a0to the late Pope Francis. The cardinal electors gathered inside the Vatican's Sistine Chapel on Wednesday for the start of the secretive, centuries-old ritual known as the conclave to pick a new pontiff.",
      "Behind closed doors in the chapel, they will hold as many rounds of voting as prove necessary to select the 267th leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the process and how long it might take.",
      "When does the 2025 papal conclave start?",
      "The conclave\u00a0began on Wednesday \u2014 16 days after Pope Francis' death. The conclave continued Thursday after no pope was chosen in the first rounds of voting.",
      "It's one of the oldest methods of electing a head of state that's still in use today, and its basic protocols have barely changed for 800 years.",
      "In order to become a pope, a candidate need only be Catholic and male. However, for centuries, popes have only been chosen from among the Catholic cardinals, the church's most senior officials.",
      "The conclave takes place in the Sistine Chapel, behind sealed doors. Along with all Vatican staff involved in the process, the cardinal electors take an oath of secrecy, and the chapel is swept for listening devices.",
      "To be elected pope, a candidate must garner two-thirds of the votes plus one. If the first round isn't conclusive, voting continues into a second day.",
      "The 133 cardinal electors participating this time held their first round of voting Wednesday evening, local time, and did not agree on a new pope.",
      "From the second day onward, there are two rounds of voting each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.",
      "If there is no two-thirds majority after three days of voting, the process is paused for a day to allow time for the cardinals to pray and discuss their options.",
      "How long have conclaves taken to choose new popes in the past?",
      "There is no time limit set for how long a conclave can take. The cardinal electors continue to vote until a two-third-plus-one majority is achieved.",
      "The shortest conclave on record was in 1503, when it took the cardinals only 10 hours to choose Pope Pius III as the new pontiff.",
      "The longest conclave on record took nearly three years.",
      "The election of a successor to Pope Clement IV in 1268 dragged on for so long \u2014 about 1,000 days \u2014 that locals in the town of Viterbo, where it was held, locked the cardinals in the room where they had gathered until they reached a decision.",
      "That is where the name still used for the process of selecting a new pope \u2014 \"conclave,\" which translates to \"under lock and key\" \u2014 came from.",
      "After that marathon conclave, Pope Gregory X was finally elected in September of 1271.",
      "How long is the 2025 papal conclave expected to last?",
      "There is no way to predict how long a conclave will take, but guidance can perhaps be taken from recent history.",
      "The last three popes have been elected in two or three days.",
      "In 2013, Pope Francis was elected after five ballots held over two days. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI was elected after four ballots. In 1978, Pope John Paul II was elected over two days after eight ballots.",
      "Vatican watcher John Allen, the editor of the Catholic news outlet Crux, believes this conclave may well follow that pattern, and we could expect a new pope to be named by the end of the week.",
      "Why does the papal conclave use white smoke?",
      "After each round of voting, the paper ballots are burned. If a pope has not been elected, black smoke rises from the chimney above the chapel. If a pope has been elected, white smoke rises.",
      "Initially, only black smoke was part of the conclave tradition, rising from the chimney as a result of ballots being burned after an unsuccessful round of voting.",
      "White smoke was first used in 1914, when Cardinals decided the light colored smoke should announce the selection of a new pope, Georgtown University reported.",
      "Now, to ensure the result of each ballot is clear, chemicals are burned alongside the ballots in each round to color the smoke black or white.",

    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014 Pakistani authorities accused India on Thursday of a \"serious provocation\" as the nuclear-armed neighbors' forces clashed in the disputed Kashmir region weeks after a terror attack on Indian tourists sparked a sudden cross-border crisis. India's Ministry of Defense, in a statement released later Thursday, said its drone strike was a response to Pakistani forces firing drones and missiles at Indian military installations overnight.",
      "Pakistani officials said India launched an attack with at least 13 drones early Thursday morning, all but one of which they said were shot down by the country's own military. A military spokesman said one civilian was killed and several troops wounded in the strikes.",
      "India said it was responding to Pakistani attacks overnight that killed 16 people, including three women and five children.",
      "\"India has undertaken yet another blatant military act of aggression against Pakistan by sending Harop drones at multiple locations,\" Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani Army spokesman, said at a press briefing on Thursday, adding that the Indian attack, \"continues, and the armed forces are on high degree of alert and neutralizing them as we speak.\"",
      "Chaudhry called the drone attack a \"serious, serious provocation\" by India.",
      "Chaudhry said Pakistan's armed forces managed to \"neutralize\" 12 drones at various locations, including Lahore, Gujrawala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi, and one near Karachi.",
      "\"One drone, however, managed to engage a military target near Lahore partially,\" Chaudhry said, adding that it had killed one civilian and wounded four Pakistani soldiers.",
      "In its statement, India's Ministry of Defense said the country had made it clear on Wednesday that it had not targeted Pakistani military sites with its missile strike, calling the attack proportionate.",
      "But it said Thursday that Pakistan, overnight, had \"attempted to engage a number of military targets in Northern and Western India,\" listing 15 separate locations, \"using drones and missiles.\"",
      "The Defense Ministry said the drones and missiles \"were neutralized,\" and that debris \"is now being recovered from a number of locations that prove the Pakistani attacks.\"",
      "In response, \"Indian Armed Forces targeted Air Defense Radars and systems at a number of locations in Pakistan,\" the ministry's statement said, describing its reaction as being \"in the same domain with same intensity as Pakistan.\"",
      "The ongoing clashes come a day after India hit nine locations inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir with missiles. Pakistan said at least 26 people were killed in that Tuesday night missile attack, which it labeled an \"act of war,\" and that five others died in ongoing cross-border military clashes along the Line of Control that divides Indian and Pakistani-administered portions of Kashmir.",
      "The U.S. State Department issued a new alert on Thursday, ordering all personnel at the consulate in Lahore to shelter in place \"due to reports of drone explosions, downed drones, and possible airspace incursions in and near Lahore.\"",
      "\"The Consulate has also received initial reports that authorities may be evacuating some areas adjacent to Lahore's main airport,\" said the alert, which was shared on the State Department's website and on social media. \"U.S. citizens who find themselves in an area of active conflict should leave if they can do so safely.\"",
      "India's Tuesday night missile attack killed over 100 terrorists in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, India's Defense Minister Rajnath Singh told politicians in a meeting on Thursday morning, according to a report by India's NDTV. Singh told political opposition leaders the Indian military's \"Operation Sindoor,\" in response to the April terror attack, was continuing.",
      "CBS News' Sami Yousafzai in Islamabad said Pakistan's state-run media showed video Thursday of what it said was debris from downed Indian drones, including in major cities. One of the drones was reportedly intercepted and crashed down on a street lined with food vendors in the densely populated city of Rawalpindi, not far from the General Headquarters of the Pakistani Army.",
      "\"It looked like a big bird came down on top of us,\" Ramadan Muhamad, a local shopkeeper who witnessed the apparent shoot-down, told CBS News on the phone. \"There was no explosion, but there was a flash of light when it hit. After the crash, army and security forces quickly arrived and cordoned off the area. Even now, I can't get to my shop.\"",
      "\"War in any form is ugly for humanity,\" Ramadan said. \"A conflict between Pakistan and India is not an ordinary war \u2014 God forbid, it could turn into a humanitarian disaster because both countries possess nuclear weapons.

      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 The strange reproductive habits of a large, carnivorous New Zealand snail were once shrouded in mystery. Now, footage of the snail laying an egg from its neck has been captured for the first time, the country's conservation agency said Wednesday.",
      "What looks like a tiny hen's egg is seen emerging from an opening below the head of the Powelliphanta augusta snail, a threatened species endemic to New Zealand.",
      "The video was taken at a facility on the South Island's West Coast, where conservation rangers attempting to save the species from extinction have cared for a population of the snails in chilled containers for nearly two decades.",
      "The conditions in the containers mimic the alpine weather in their only former habitat - a remote mountain they were named for, on the West Coast of the South Island, that has been engulfed by mining.",
      "Lisa Flanagan from the Department of Conservation, who has worked with the creatures for 12 years, said the species still holds surprises.",
      "\"It's remarkable that in all the time we've spent caring for the snails, this is the first time we've seen one lay an egg,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Like other snails, Powelliphanta augusta are hermaphrodites, which explains how the creatures can reproduce when encased in a hard shell. The invertebrate uses a genital pore on the right side of its body, just below the head, to simultaneously exchange sperm with another snail, which is stored until each creates an egg.",
      "Each snail takes eight years to reach sexual maturity, after which it lays about five eggs a year. The egg can take more than a year to hatch.",
      "\"Some of our captive snails are between 25 and 30 years old,\" said Flanagan. \"They're polar opposites to the pest garden snail we introduced to New Zealand, which is like a weed, with thousands of offspring each year and a short life.\"",
      "The dozens of species and subspecies of Powelliphanta snails are only found in New Zealand, mostly in rugged forest and grassland settings where they're threatened by habitat loss.",
      "They're carnivores that slurp up earthworms like noodles and are some of the world's largest snails with oversized, distinctive shells in a range of rich earth colors and swirling patterns.",
      "The Powelliphanta augusta was the center of public uproar and legal proceedings in the early 2000s, when an energy company's plans to mine for coal threatened to destroy the snails' habitat.",
      "Some 4,000 were removed from the site and relocated, while 2,000 more were housed in chilled storage in the West Coast town of Hokitika to ensure the preservation of the species, which is slow to breed and doesn't adapt well to new habitats.",
      "In 2011, some 800 of the snails accidentally died in a Department of Conservation refrigerator with faulty temperature control.",
      "But the species' slow survival continues: In March this year, there were nearly 1,900 snails and nearly 2,200 eggs in captivity, the conservation agency said.",

After the first round of voting, black smoke was seen rising from the Sistine Chapel as night fell in Rome, indicating they have not yet agreed on a choice for the next pontiff.",

      "Re said the cardinals should pray for \"a pope who knows how best to awaken the consciences of all and the moral and spiritual energies in today's society, characterized by great technological progress but which tends to forget God. Today's world expects much from the church regarding the safeguarding of those fundamental human and spiritual values without which human coexistence will not be better nor bring good to future generations.\"",
      "After a gathering in the Apostolic Palace, the most diverse group of electors ever, from at least 70 different countries, walked in procession from the palace's Pauline Chapel into the adjoining Sistine Chapel, where the conclave will be held.",
      "The\u00a0process to select a new pope\u00a0is shrouded in secrecy, and the cardinal electors filed up one by one to take an oath inside the chapel just before the conclave got underway, vowing to preserve that secrecy.",
      "\"In a particular way, we promise and swear to observe with the greatest fidelity and with all persons, clerical or lay, secrecy regarding everything that in any way relates to the election of the Roman Pontiff and regarding what occurs in the place of the election, directly or indirectly related to the results of the voting,\" the cardinals swore, in Latin. \"We promise and swear not to break this secret in any way, either during or after the election of the new pontiff, unless explicit authorization is granted by the same pontiff.\"",
      "The cardinal electors are forced to give up their digital devices during the conclave.",
      "Dozens of less senior Vatican staff and clergy who will play some part in the conclave had already taken a similar vow of secrecy.",

The chapel's doors were then locked from the inside.",

      "SECRETS OF LONGEVITY FROM THE WORLD'S 'BLUE ZONES'",
      "The researchers see this method as more comprehensive than current health assessments, which typically focus on individual diseases rather than overall wellness, according to the report\u2019s first author, Dr. Shabnam Salimi, a physician-scientist and acting instructor in the Department of Anesthesiology & Pain Medicine at UW.",
      "Researchers have developed a new \"body clock\" tool that calculates people\u2019s biological age \u2014 and could even predict the risk of disability or death. (iStock)",
      "Using data from large longevity studies, the Health Octo Tool was found to predict disability, geriatric syndrome (a group of common health conditions in older adults), Short Physical Performance Battery (a clinical tool that assesses lower extremity function in older adults) and mortality with 90% accuracy or greater, the study reported.",
      "\"An aging-based framework offers a new path to discover biomarkers and therapeutics that target organ-specific or whole-body aging, rather than individual diseases,\" Salimi said in the release.",

      "The tool focuses on \"health entropy,\" which encompasses the amount of molecular and cellular damage the body has sustained over time.",
      "That has a direct impact on the function of a person\u2019s organs and overall body systems, which can be used to determine how fast they are aging, the researchers noted.",
      "\"Aging is a truly analog and non-digital process.\"",
      "The tool starts by assigning a \"body organ disease number,\" ranging from 1 to 14, based on whether the patient has experienced any diseases affecting the heart, lungs, brain or other specific organ systems.",
      "\"Our findings demonstrated that organ systems age at different rates, prompting us to develop a Bodily System-Specific Age metric to reflect the aging rate of each organ system and the Bodily-Specific Clock to represent each organ system\u2019s intrinsic biological age,\" Salimi said.",

      "One takeaway from the research was that some seemingly minor conditions, such as untreated hypertension early in life, could have a significant impact on aging in later years, according to Salimi. This indicates that treating these conditions sooner could slow down biological aging.",

      "The industrialization of credential theft",
      "In 2024, cybersecurity researchers at Fortinet observed a staggering surge in stolen login data being traded on the dark web. Over 1.7 billion credentials were harvested not from old breaches but through active infections on users\u2019 devices.",
      "At the heart of this epidemic is a class of malware called infostealers, which are programs designed specifically to extract sensitive information like usernames, passwords, browser cookies, email logins, crypto wallets and session tokens. Unlike large-scale data breaches that target centralized databases, infostealers operate on individual machines. They don\u2019t break into a company\u2019s servers; they compromise the end user, often without the victim ever noticing.",
      "These logs are then aggregated and sold by initial access brokers, intermediaries who sell compromised credentials and access tokens to other cybercriminal groups, including ransomware operators. The market has matured to the point where access to a corporate VPN, an admin dashboard or even a personal bank account can be purchased at scale, with verified functionality and region-specific pricing.",
      "Fortinet\u2019s 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report identified a 500% increase in credential logs from infostealer infections over the past year. Among the most widespread and dangerous infostealers identified in the report are RedLine, Vidar and Raccoon.",

      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How infostealers work",
      "Infostealers are typically distributed through phishing emails, malicious browser extensions, fake software installers or cracked applications. Once installed on a device, they scan browser databases, autofill records, saved passwords and local files for any credential-related data. Many also look for digital wallets, FTP credentials and cloud service logins.",
      "Crucially, many infostealers also exfiltrate session tokens and authentication cookies, meaning that even users who rely on multifactor authentication are not entirely safe. With a stolen session token, an attacker can bypass multifactor authentication entirely and assume control of the session without ever needing to log in manually.",
      "Once collected, the data is uploaded to a command and control server. From there, it's either used directly by attackers or bundled into logs and sold on forums. These logs can include everything from the victim\u2019s IP address and geolocation to their browser fingerprint and full credential list, giving attackers everything they need to carry out further exploitation or impersonation.",

      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are five effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Our No. 1 pick has a\u00a0built-in\u00a0Data Breach Scanner that lets you check if your information has been exposed in known breaches.\u00a0Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The display sits at just an inch thick but packs a punch with 5K resolution (5,120 x 2,880 pixels) at 60 Hz, delivering up to 16 inches of virtual depth and 8-bit color. The result? Real-time 3D visuals that look and feel like they\u2019re actually present in the room.",
      "But what really sets this display apart is its ability to create a shared 3D experience. Unlike traditional VR or AR setups that require each participant to wear a headset, the Looking Glass 27 can project up to 100 unique perspectives across a 53-degree viewing cone. This means a team can gather around a single screen and see the same digital object from different angles, just as they would with a real-world prototype or artifact.",

Content creation starts on a computer running Unity, but the finished product can be deployed on an iPad, which also powers the display and serves as its interface. This approach reduces system costs by about 35% compared to previous models and makes deployment far more flexible. The display also supports Blender, Unreal Engine, WebXR and Looking Glass\u2019 own Studio and Bridge tools, making it compatible with a wide range of 3D workflows.",
      "The display is designed for versatility. It can sit on a desk or be mounted on a wall, and it\u2019s available in both portrait and landscape configurations (though you\u2019ll need to pick one when ordering). The software ecosystem allows for quick creation of 3D apps using Unity templates, and content can be managed just like any other iOS application, streamlining updates and deployment.",

Imagine medical students exploring a virtual anatomy lesson together or design teams collaborating on a 3D prototype without the hassle of headsets.

This includes cards with \"INDEF\" (indefinite) expiration dates, despite past confusion and software glitches.",
      "However, travelers have reported occasional issues at some airports, where TSA's system may misread the \"INDEF\" date as expired. In those cases, TSA officers may ask for another acceptable form of ID, such as a REAL ID-compliant driver's license or a passport. If you have no other ID, a supervisor may review your document and allow you to proceed, but expect possible delays.",

      "What happens if you don't have a REAL ID yet?",
      "If you show up at the airport today with a standard driver's license that isn't REAL ID compliant, and you don't have a passport or other approved ID, you could face delays, extra screening or even be denied entry at the security checkpoint. TSA is urging travelers to check their IDs before heading to the airport.",
      "However, if you have a valid Global Entry card, you do not need to obtain a REAL ID-compliant driver's license to fly domestically after May 7, 2025. The Global Entry card is a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Trusted Traveler card that meets federal identification standards and is explicitly accepted by TSA as an alternative to a REAL ID. This means you can use your Global Entry card at TSA checkpoints to verify your identity when flying within the United States. Other DHS Trusted Traveler cards, like NEXUS, SENTRI and FAST, are also accepted as alternatives.",
      "Important:\u00a0Although the Global Entry card is officially accepted, some travelers have reported occasional confusion among TSA agents. To avoid delays, consider carrying an additional form of ID, such as a U.S. passport or passport card.",

      "How safe are these trucks?",
      "The safety of autonomous trucks is a primary concern.\u00a0Aurora's 2025 Driverless Safety Report outlines five key principles to ensure safe operation: proficiency, fail-safety, continuous improvement, resilience and trustworthiness. The company uses high-resolution cameras, radar and lidar to understand the environment, with their FirstLight lidar detecting objects from over 1,470 feet away, offering nearly nine seconds of reaction time at highway speeds.",
      "Aurora's fail-safe system includes multiple redundancies, while the company's approach to continuous improvement involves regular software updates and incident reviews. They've driven over 2.6 million miles autonomously, hauling over 9,500 commercial freight loads with a nearly 100% on-time rate and no major safety incidents.",
      "Safety case and validation",
      "Aurora's safety approach is evaluated through a \"safety case\" method, commonly used in aviation and nuclear industries.

      "\"Simulations and supervised testing aren't enough,\" OOIDA states.\u00a0\"Phantom braking and unpredictable road conditions make autonomous trucks a risky proposition. Until there's mandatory, transparent oversight, these safety claims are premature.\"",
      "OOIDA also criticizes the lack of robust federal regulation, pointing to voluntary data programs like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) AV TEST as inadequate.",

He also noted that \"Teamsters are professional drivers who safely handle all conditions with miles driven in the real world.\"",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a\u00a0Second Amended Standing General Order 2021-01 requiring manufacturers and operators of vehicles with automated driving systems (ADS) or level 2 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to report crashes to the agency.",
      "This order mandates the reporting of specific crash-related information when ADS or level 2 ADAS is engaged or was recently in use, enabling NHTSA to monitor potential safety defects in these vehicles and ensure compliance with safety standards. The goal is to proactively address safety concerns related to these technologies as they evolve, in accordance with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.",
      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",
      "What this means for the future",
      "There are undeniable upsides. Autonomous trucks could operate 24/7, slash delivery times, reduce costs and help address the growing driver shortage. They may even improve road safety by eliminating accidents caused by human error. But risks remain. Public trust in driverless tech is still shaky. Many worry about what happens to jobs when machines take the wheel. The Teamsters are particularly vocal about this.",
      "\"Tens of millions of people turn a key for a living, but companies like Aurora couldn't care less if they lose their livelihoods. Eliminating all driving jobs would be disastrous for our communities and the middle class,\" McQuaid said.",
      "That said, a\u00a0Department of Transportation (DOT) study from the Trump administration projected long-haul autonomous trucking could increase U.S. employment by 26,400-35,100 jobs per year as new logistics and tech roles emerge. Aurora, for its part, claims both\u00a0human drivers and AVs are needed to meet demand.",

      "Apple's AirPlay was designed to make life easier, letting users stream music, photos and videos from iPhones and MacBooks to TVs, speakers and other compatible devices with just a tap. But now, cybersecurity researchers have revealed that this same convenience may be opening the door to hackers. A new set of vulnerabilities, collectively called AirBorne, could turn AirPlay-enabled gadgets into stealthy entry points for malware and network infiltration.",

      "What you need to know",
      "Researchers at Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm Oligo\u00a0recently disclosed AirBorne, a group of security flaws in Apple's proprietary AirPlay protocol. These bugs exist primarily in the AirPlay software development kit (SDK) used by third-party manufacturers to bring AirPlay support to smart TVs, speakers and other media devices. The security flaws mean if a hacker is on the same Wi-Fi network as a vulnerable device, they can hijack it without ever touching the device.",
      "From there, attackers could move laterally within a home or corporate network, silently hopping from one device to another. They might install malware or ransomware, disrupt operations or even lock users out of their own systems. In some cases, compromised devices could be added to a botnet, a network of hijacked machines working in unison for larger attacks. And because many smart gadgets come equipped with microphones, hackers could even turn them into tools for eavesdropping and surveillance.",

      "What is Apple doing about the AirBorne bugs?",
      "Apple has already patched the AirBorne bugs on its own devices and issued updates to third-party vendors. However, researchers warn that many third-party AirPlay-enabled products, possibly tens of millions, may never receive a fix, either because they do not auto-update or because vendors are slow or unwilling to release security patches.",
      "A striking demonstration by Oligo showed how easily a Bose speaker was taken over to display the firm's logo, proving how simple it could be for a hacker to silently gain control. Though Bose was not specifically targeted, the example highlights the broader risk. Any unpatched device using AirPlay SDK could be a gateway for malicious actors.",

      "5 ways to protect yourself from AirPlay hackers",
      "1) Set up a separate Wi-Fi network for smart devices:\u00a0Most modern routers allow you to create multiple networks. Use this feature to keep your smart home devices such as AirPlay-enabled speakers, TVs or receivers on a dedicated \"IoT\" (Internet of Things) network. Keep this separate from your main devices, like phones, laptops and work computers. This segmentation ensures that even if a hacker gains access to a vulnerable smart device, they cannot easily reach more critical or sensitive devices on the primary network.",
      "2) Disable AirPlay when not actively using it:\u00a0AirPlay is designed to always be on and discoverable, which makes it convenient but also leaves it exposed. If you rarely use AirPlay or only use it occasionally, go into your device settings and turn it off completely. On Apple devices, AirPlay settings can be found under \"General\" or \"AirPlay & Handoff.\" For third-party devices, check their companion apps or manuals. Turning off AirPlay removes it as an open door for attackers.",
      "3) Avoid using AirPlay on public or unsecured Wi-Fi and use a VPN:\u00a0One of the key conditions for exploiting AirBorne vulnerabilities is that the attacker must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the target device. This makes public Wi-Fi networks in places like caf\u00e9s, airports, hotels or shared workspaces particularly risky. If you need to use your device in such environments, avoid casting, streaming or pairing with smart devices.",
      "Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Strengthen and secure your home Wi-Fi network:\u00a0Make it more difficult for attackers to gain access to your home network. Use a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi that is different from your other account credentials. Ensure that your router firmware is updated and that encryption is set to WPA2 or WPA3. Avoid older and less secure options like WEP or open networks. Turn off features like WPS, which are designed for easy setup but can also make your network more vulnerable. If possible, disable universal plug and play (UPnP) and similar features that make all devices on your network easily discoverable. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Limit device permissions and exposure:\u00a0Smart devices with AirPlay support often include features like microphones, auto-pairing and remote access. Review each device's settings and disable any features you do not actively use. For example, if your smart speaker has a microphone, but you never use voice commands, turn off the microphone or cover it. The fewer functions a device has exposed, the fewer opportunities a hacker has to exploit it. If your router supports it, use device-level firewall rules to limit which services or internet connections your smart gadgets can access.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Apple likes to market itself as the go-to for privacy and security, but the AirBorne vulnerabilities show that the company's devices are far from bulletproof. While they patched their own products, millions of third-party AirPlay devices are still wide open to attack. It's becoming clear that Apple's control over its ecosystem isn't as tight as they'd like you to believe. If they really want to be the privacy leader, they need to step up and fix these issues across the board, not just when it suits them.",

    "story": [
      "A 35-year-old man is accused of arson after a Cybertruck was burned at a Tesla dealership in Mesa, Ariz., on April 28, 2025. (KSAZ-TV)",
      "The recent surge of attacks on Tesla owners, dealerships and charging stations has morphed into a broader campaign of intimidation, fueled by weaponized personal data. But the fallout isn't limited to Tesla owners alone.",
      "Sites like \"Dogequest\" have published names, addresses and phone numbers supposedly belonging to Tesla owners, yet many victims never owned a Tesla or sold theirs years ago. Some were misidentified due to errors in public records or outdated databases, turning ordinary people into targets for harassment and threats. The site's operators have even demanded proof of sale from anyone seeking removal, putting the burden on innocent people to clear their names.",
      "As the DOJ and FBI label these attacks as domestic terrorism and ramp up investigations, the chilling reality is that anyone, even those only suspected of owning a Tesla, can find themselves exposed and at risk.",

      "A Tesla supercharger (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How innocent people get caught in the crossfire",
      "On March 18, 2025, a hacker group launched \"Dogequest,\" a website featuring a searchable map of supposed Tesla owners and employees. The site didn't just list dealerships and charging stations; it exposed names, home addresses, phone numbers and emails, sometimes even in real time. The twist? Many of the people listed never owned a Tesla at all.",
      "The data fueling this attack came from public vehicle registration records and third-party databases, notorious for their inaccuracies. Some victims had sold their Teslas years ago. Others were never owners, just mistakenly linked by a typo, a recycled phone number or a database error. Yet they found themselves on a digital hit list, with their privacy and safety at risk.",
      "The real-world consequences",
      "This isn't just an online problem. Firebombings at showrooms, bullets through dealership windows and threats to families have all been linked to these doxxing campaigns. Law enforcement, including the DOJ, now calls it domestic terrorism. And because the data is so often wrong, anyone could be next, regardless of whether you've ever set foot in a Tesla.",
      "\"Doxxing\" affecting Tesla and non-Tesla owners alike (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why misidentification matters to everyone",
      "If you think you're safe because you don't own a Tesla, think again. The same flawed data sources that misidentified Tesla owners exist for countless other products, memberships and affiliations. Today, it's electric cars; tomorrow, it could be political donors, healthcare workers or anyone else whose data is bought and sold.",

      "What you can do to protect yourself now",

Here's how to reduce your exposure and protect yourself from becoming the next target of a doxxing attack.",
      "To help prevent your data from ending up in a breach or leak:",

      "Hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Additional critical digital defenses to implement",
      "While removing your data from brokers and minimizing online footprints are essential first steps, true safety in this new era of weaponized information also requires securing our digital infrastructure against both physical and virtual threats. Here are a few steps you can take to protect your data.",
      "Use two-factor authentication: Protect your vehicle\u2019s account and associated emails with\u00a0authenticator apps rather than SMS, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.",
      "Use a VPN: Mask your IP address when accessing your vehicle\u2019s apps on public Wi-Fi to prevent location tracking and man-in-the-middle attacks. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Cabin cam caution: Disable Cabin Camera Recording under Data Sharing unless essential. While Tesla claims footage isn\u2019t linked to identities by default, third-party app vulnerabilities could expose this data. Newer Teslas process cabin cam footage locally, but legacy models may still use cloud backups, so check your software version.",
      "Report doxxing or cyber harassment: If you\u2019ve been doxxed or targeted online, don\u2019t wait to take action. Report it to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3),\u00a0ic3.gov, or to local law enforcement, as many states have laws addressing doxxing, stalking and cyber harassment. File a police report with documented evidence (screenshots, URLs, timestamps). Also, for account-specific threats, contact Tesla customer service directly to report suspicious activity and secure your account.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The reality is unsettling but not hopeless, and while the threats of our hyper-connected world can feel overwhelming, you don\u2019t have to just hope you won\u2019t be targeted. You can take control by arming yourself with knowledge, using the right tools, building smart habits like checking your digital footprint, using removal tools and staying alert to new threats because the attackers are organized, and it\u2019s time we are, too.",

      "Kurt Knutsson discusses how a paper pill bottle could revolutionize pharmacy packaging and cut plastic waste drastically.",
      "Have you ever stopped to think about what happens to those little orange pill bottles after you finish your prescription? Every year, around 200 billion of these bottles are produced worldwide, and sadly most of them end up in landfills. In the U.S. alone, about 4 to 5 billion plastic pill bottles are thrown away each year.",
      "That\u2019s enough plastic to circle the Earth multiple times.",
      "While they might seem harmless, these bottles contribute significantly to the growing plastic pollution crisis because they\u2019re often not recycled properly.",

      "Paper Tully Tube pill bottles (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A paper bottle that\u2019s changing the game",
      "Plastic has become the go-to material for packaging, including in medicine, because it\u2019s cheap, durable and easy to produce. However, the environmental cost is huge, and the pharmaceutical industry has struggled to find a sustainable alternative.",
      "Enter the\u00a0Tully Tube, a revolutionary new pill bottle made mostly from 100% sustainably sourced paper. Developed by Parcel Health, this isn\u2019t just any paper bottle. It\u2019s the first one to meet the strict U.S. FDA regulations for food-contact packaging, making it safe to use for prescription medications.",
      "What makes the Tully Tube really impressive is how it balances sustainability with practicality. The body of the bottle is made from recyclable and compostable paper, which means it can break down naturally instead of piling up in landfills. The cap, which needs to be child-resistant for safety, is still made from plastic but uses recycled materials to reduce its environmental impact.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "STOP SORTING YOUR GARBAGE WITH THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY",
      "How does it keep pills safe?",
      "You might be wondering how a paper bottle can protect pills from moisture, heat or damage during shipping. The Tully Tube uses a clever three-layer construction. It\u2019s coated with a food-safe compostable layer that keeps water and humidity out, ensuring your medication stays fresh and effective.",
      "When it\u2019s time to toss the bottle, a patented pull tab makes it easy to separate the paper body from the plastic cap and neck. This means the paper part can be composted or recycled, while the plastic pieces can be recycled separately. It\u2019s a simple but smart way to make sure every part of the bottle is handled properly at the end of its life.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "IS THIS TECHNOLOGY THE ANSWER TO CLEANING UP OUR OCEAN'S PLASTIC PROBLEM?",
      "Why should pharmacies care?",
      "One of the biggest hurdles for sustainable packaging is cost. Fortunately, the Tully Tube is priced competitively with traditional plastic bottles, so pharmacies don\u2019t have to pay more to go green. Plus, because the paper surface is easier and cheaper to print on, pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies can customize the bottles with logos, designs or even characters to make the packaging more engaging for customers.",
      "From an environmental perspective, the Tully Tube reduces carbon emissions by about 30% compared to plastic bottles. That\u2019s a significant cut in greenhouse gases, especially when you consider the billions of bottles used every year.",

      "Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity.",
      "Data breaches have become alarmingly common and costly, putting sensitive information at risk. In fact, the number of data breaches in the United States jumped from 447 in 2012 to over 3,200 in 2023.",
      "Even firms entrusted with managing personal information are not immune. The latest example is VeriSource Services, a Texas-based employee benefits and HR administration provider that experienced a major data breach.",
      "The personal information of about 4 million people was exposed in this incident, and it took the company over a year to fully assess its impact, a critical failure for an organization specializing in data management, employee enrollment and HR support services that clients rely on to safeguard their most sensitive information.",

      "What happened at VeriSource?",
      "VeriSource discovered\u00a0the breach Feb. 28, 2024, when it noticed unusual activity disrupting some of its systems. The company later determined an unknown attacker had gained unauthorized access around Feb. 27, 2024, stealing data on or about that date.",
      "Somehow, it took VeriSource over a year to determine the full scope of the breach, including the identification all individuals who had their information exposed.",
      "According to the investigation, this was a criminal cyberattack carried out by external threat actors (hackers), as opposed to an insider mishandling data. The perpetrators accessed sensitive personal records stored by VeriSource. In a\u00a0sample notice filed with state authorities, VeriSource reported that the compromised information included individuals' full names, mailing addresses, dates of birth, gender and Social Security numbers (via\u00a0BleepingComputer).",

Information like your Social Security number, birth date and address can be misused for identity theft, such as opening fraudulent accounts or filing false tax returns in your name. Even beyond financial fraud, having such personal data in the wrong hands can lead to targeted phishing scams.",
      "What worries me the most is the delay in fully notifying everyone affected. VeriSource had sent out preliminary breach notices to about 55,000 people in May 2024 and then to another 112,000 people in September 2024. However, those early notifications covered only a small fraction of the approximately 4 million victims eventually identified. This means the majority of affected individuals did not learn of the breach until the final notification wave in April 2025, more than a year after the data was actually compromised.",

      "1. Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0VeriSource hackers have access to your name, Social Security number, mailing address and more, which they can easily use against you.\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to scam you. After the VeriSource breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the VeriSource breach, including Social Security numbers. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You can freeze your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus. They\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "4. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per yearor more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "5. Be wary of social engineering attacks and use strong antivirus software: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Also, never click on unexpected links or attachments in emails, texts or messages because they may contain malware or lead to phishing sites designed to steal your information.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "What stands out in the VeriSource breach isn\u2019t just the scale, but the silence. When a company sits on breach data for over a year, regardless of intent, it erodes trust in systems designed to protect workers. These aren\u2019t just compliance failures. They\u2019re human ones. Four million people had their most sensitive information exposed, and for many of them, the warning came far too late. This should be a moment of reckoning for how organizations define responsibility after a breach. A timely response isn\u2019t just good PR. It\u2019s a baseline expectation. And if it takes over a year to realize the full scope of a cyberattack, maybe the incident isn\u2019t the only vulnerability worth addressing.",

      "Yale New Haven Health is a nonprofit healthcare system based in New Haven, Connecticut. It includes five acute-care hospitals, a medical foundation, and a network of outpatient facilities and multispecialty centers across Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island.",

Reportedly, the number of affected individuals may still change as investigations continue. Importantly, electronic medical record systems and treatment information were not accessed, and no financial account, payment or employee HR information was involved.",
      "This is not the first time healthcare systems have been in the crosshairs of cybercriminals. In recent years, attacks on institutions like\u00a0UnitedHealth and\u00a0Ascension Health have led to months of operational disruption, massive financial costs and prolonged investigations.",

      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Yale New Haven Health data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, social security number, and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The Yale New Haven Health data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Yale New Haven Health hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses..",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",

The incident highlights a deeper issue, revealing gaps in the security infrastructure that many healthcare institutions are still not adequately addressing.",

      "\"At the end of September 1944, their luck ran out. My father was sent to Auschwitz, and incredibly, my mother volunteered to follow him the next day. She didn\u2019t know where he was going and, ever the optimist, believed it couldn\u2019t get worse and they\u2019d survive,\" she said.",

      "In April 1945, Anka was sent to Mauthausen. \"It\u2019s a beautiful village on the Danube in Austria, but the camp sits on a steep hill behind it. When my mother saw the name at the train station, she was shocked\u2014she had heard how horrific it was. That shock likely triggered her labor, and she began giving birth to me,\" Clarke said.",
      "She credits her survival to timing. \"On April 28, the Nazis ran out of gas. I was born on April 29. Hitler committed suicide on April 30. On May 5, the American 11th Armored Division liberated the camp.\"",
      "When the Americans arrived, they brought food and medicine\u2014though many, weakened, died upon receiving them. Three weeks later, once Anka regained strength, U.S. forces repatriated her to Prague.

      "He acknowledged that Holocaust denial often stems from disbelief. \"It\u2019s easy to say something didn\u2019t happen because it\u2019s hard to comprehend the death of that many people. I get that. But it did happen. Nazi Germans killed 10,000 people a day\u2014it\u2019s well-documented. They documented it themselves, and the Allied forces saw it first-hand.",

      "While Tehran has backed the Houthis since at least 2014 \u2013 and possibly as early as 2009 during the war in Yemen \u2013 through training and advanced weapons like ballistic missiles, Oman has also played a role by allowing the group to operate from its territory and serving as a key smuggling route for Iranian arms.",

      "The report breaks down the varied steps that need to be taken to effectively undermine and counter the Houthis as repeated military strikes by first, Saudi Arabia starting in 2015, then recently by the U.S. and Israel, have not significantly degraded the terrorist group.",

      "He will then be led through the Hall of Benedictions and out onto the balcony, known as the Loggia of the Blessings, where his identity will be revealed to the thousands gathered below and the millions more around the world who have closely watched the conclave."

    "summary": "After Donald Trump was elected president, Craig Souser was preparing for a surge in business for his Pennsylvania-based manufacturing company, which makes robotics systems used in food packaging.",
    "story": [
      "After Donald Trump was elected president, Craig Souser was preparing for a surge in business for his Pennsylvania-based manufacturing company, which makes robotics systems used in food packaging. Instead, he\u2019s now facing higher costs and falling demand that have caused him to delay investments in his business \u2014and look at adding manufacturing outside the United States.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been the most bizarre roller-coaster ride, where our enthusiasm going into this year was sky high, and then it was just like the air came out of the balloon,\u201d said Souser, CEO of JLS, which his family started 70 years ago. \u201cNobody saw the magnitude of this coming. I don\u2019t know if it was his plan or not, who knows, but it took what we thought was going to be a rebound year and made it really bad. We have some business but it\u2019s nowhere near what we expected. And we\u2019re not alone.\u201d",
      "It's an experience that cuts against one of the stated goals of Trump's policies: Since taking office, Trump has imposed a range of tariffs on imports that's he's said will revive American manufacturing by protecting businesses from cheaper overseas competition and incentivizing companies to move their production to the U.S.",
      "Yet, while some companies, including in the pharmaceutical and auto industries, have announced plans to expand manufacturing in the U.S. following Trump\u2019s tariff announcements, others already making their products in the U.S. say they aren\u2019t feeling a benefit from the tariffs. Instead, the tariffs have led to higher import costs for the materials and machinery they need to make their products in America, as well as falling demand from customers and a climate of uncertainty that have made it difficult to invest in expanding their U.S. operations.",
      "Since Trump\u2019s tariffs went into effect, manufacturing activity has declined to its lowest point in five months amid higher costs, falling revenue and a decline in exports, according to an April survey of manufacturers by the Institute for Supply Management. Separate surveys by the Federal Reserve also showed a manufacturing decline in several regions in April, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics found the manufacturing industry as a whole cut around 1,000 jobs last month, amid overall job growth.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re headed in the wrong direction,\u201d said Tim Fiore, chair of the ISM\u2019s manufacturing business survey committee. \u201cWhen revenue starts to decline, you can\u2019t pay your payroll. You can\u2019t pay your suppliers. You start releasing people, you start cutting back. You start watching your dollars.\u201d",
      "He said his survey found export orders had fallen to an \u201calarming\u201d level in April, similar to numbers seen during the Great Recession nearly 20 years ago. Around half of companies surveyed by the ISM said they had faced higher costs in the previous month, compared to just 14% who reported cost increases at the end of last year.",
      "\u201cYou would expect prices to go up as demand goes up, but demand has not gone up,\u201d Fiore said. \u201cSo here we have demand collapsing and we have prices growing.\u00a0 This is almost like the impossible equation.\u201d",
      "Last month, Trump placed a minimum tariff of 10% on nearly all goods coming into the U.S. and a tariff of more than 145% on goods coming from China, with the exception of electronics that have a lower tariff rate of 25%. He has also placed a 25% tariff on imported steel, aluminum, cars and auto parts.",
      "For Souser\u2019s food packaging company, he says the tariffs have made it harder to stay competitive. The key robotics equipment he needs to make his machines at his York, Pennsylvania, facility are made in Europe, and companies like his now have to pay a 10% tariff  to import European products into the U.S. Souser said he has no choice but to pass that cost along to his customers in the form of higher prices.",
      "Scott Livingston, CEO of Horst Engineering in East Hartford, Connecticut, said he\u2019s also seen a spike in costs for the materials he uses to make parts and components for the aerospace and defense industries that use steel, aluminum, cobalt, nickel and titanium from around the world.",
      "He said he doesn\u2019t have the ability to pass along those higher costs to his customers, which include major aerospace companies, because of the long-term nature of the contracts he has with them. That means the higher costs will cut into his bottom line.",
      "\u201cI do think that there is some good that will come to existing U.S. manufacturers. However, if I cannot build the capacity because my input costs are now going up, what have we gained?\u201d Livingston  said.",
      "Along with the higher cost of importing components and materials used in made-in-America products, companies are also facing higher costs to import the machinery and tools they need. Livingston just purchased several machines from a company in Japan and was planning to put in another order later this year, which he is now anticipating will cost more if Trump\u2019s tariffs remain in place. He said he isn\u2019t able to find that type of highly specialized equipment from a U.S. company.",
      "Companies have put in more than 1,000 requests for exemptions from tariffs on manufacturing equipment they say they need from China in order to build their products in the U.S., according to public comments filed with the U.S. trade representative. The requests, which came in before Trump increased the tariffs on China to more than 145% last month, include asks from Tesla and Ford for equipment the companies say is needed to manufacture electric vehicles in the U.S.",
      "Positive shifts",
      "Some companies, though, said they are optimistic Trump\u2019s tariffs will drive more U.S. customers to buy their products to avoid paying tariffs on imports.",
      "Drew Greenblatt, president of Baltimore-based Marlin Steel Wire, which makes wire baskets used primarily by medical device, aerospace and food processing clients, said he just got an order for five tractor trailers of product from a client that used to buy from a foreign competitor.",
      "\u201cBecause of these tariffs, they came to us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s five tractor trailers of steel I\u2019m gonna buy from my steel mill in Tennessee. So they\u2019re enthusiastic about this. I had to order all kinds of boxes from my local box company. I had to order all kinds of pallets for my local pallet company, and my employees are going to be working overtime trying to keep up with this.\u201d",
      "Greenblatt said Trump\u2019s 25% tariff on steel imports has increased the cost of his steel, even though he buys from a U.S. steel mill, because of higher demand that steel mill is now seeing. Steel prices industrywide have jumped since Trump announced his tariffs.",
      "Still, he sees the benefits outweighing the higher costs.",
      "With the growth Greenblatt\u2019s expecting from tariffs, he\u2019s also investing in new equipment that he buys from companies in Illinois and Indiana, and he\u2019s looking to hire 10 people with a starting wage of around $25 per hour. He is hopeful that he could double the size of his business to more than 200 employees, if Trump is able to make deals with other countries that would reduce the tariff those countries charge on his products.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just asking for equal. If it\u2019s equal, we\u2019ll thrive, we\u2019ll prosper because we\u2019re so innovative, we\u2019re so clever, we have such great technology, we have such great talent,\u201d Greenblatt said. \u201cBut we\u2019re hamstrung because the other guys cheat.\u201d",
      "Other companies, though, said they are seeing weaker demand as a result of the uncertainty the tariffs have created for their clients. Souser said he\u2019s seen orders for his products grind to a halt from the bakeries and other food companies to which he sells his equipment, as some of them are also seeing higher costs as a result of the tariffs.",
      "The tariffs have caused him to pause some of his own investments in his company, and he is now looking at manufacturing some of his robotic systems in Italy, rather than in Pennsylvania, for his customers in Europe.",
      "Even for companies poised to see a boost in their sales from tariffs, the shifting policy of the Trump administration in the first several months has made it impossible for some businesses to make long-term decisions about expanding their U.S. manufacturing, said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which has generally supported tariffs as a tool to bolster U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\u201cShould I make that decision to open a U.S. facility or to make this investment? For a lot of folks, you can\u2019t answer that until you know with absolute certainty what the policy is going to be,\u201d he said.",
      "Paul said his organization is pushing for other policy moves that could offset some of the negative effect of the current tariffs, like various tax breaks for manufacturers in legislation currently being worked on in Congress.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very much at a formation stage of all of this. I also think it\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s also the phase where you have the medicine, but not the sugar,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re in your boat, you\u2019re trying to make it through the storm in a lot of ways, and hope there\u2019s sunshine and calm water and the wind at your back when you get through it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Just a few weeks ago, President Donald Trump and White House aides were boasting that his tariffs would force a legion of foreign nations to rush into new trade deals \u2014 and that Trump's prowess would yield more favorable terms for the U.S.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my a--,\u201d Trump said last month before his reciprocal tariffs were due to go into effect. \"They are dying to make a deal. \u2018Please, please, sir, make a deal. I\u2019ll do anything. I\u2019ll do anything, sir!\u2019\u201d",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "\"We've got 90 deals in 90 days possibly pending here,\" Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro said on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" a few days later \u2014 after Trump paused some of his tariffs and declared a three-month negotiating window.",
      "But Trump has changed his tone and his tune in recent days, as it has become clear that trade agreements don't materialize as quickly as he would like and that there aren't dozens in the queue. His shift also comes amid heavy criticism that his tariffs will hike prices for consumers and harm an American economy that had its first negative growth in years in the first quarter.",
      "\"You keep writing about deals, deals. When are we going to sign one? It\u2019s very simple. We\u2019re going to say, in some cases, we want you to open up your country. In some cases we want you to drop your tariffs,\" an obviously frustrated Trump told reporters Tuesday.",
      "\"So I wish they\u2019d keep, you know, stop asking, 'How many deals are you signing this week?' Because one day we\u2019ll come and we\u2019ll give you 100 deals. And they don\u2019t have to sign.\"",
      "It was Trump who set the 90-day clock.",
      "Beyond the ambitious sweep of trying to haggle with scores of nations at once, the U.S. has yet to open discussions with its largest trading partner \u2014 China \u2014\u00a0since Trump applied a 145% across-the-board tariff on that nation's products.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers Wednesday that his planned meeting with Chinese officials in Switzerland this weekend amounts to an early phase of negotiations that is not as far along as talks with less-crucial nations.",
      "\"On Saturday, we will begin, which I believe is the opposite of advanced,\" Bessent said under questioning from Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, D-N.Y.",
      "The previous day he said that discussions are occurring with a far smaller number of countries than Trump and Navarro have counted and that the time horizon for agreements could be much longer.",
      "\"There are 18 very important trading relationships, and we are currently negotiating with 17 of those trading partners,\" Bessent told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government on Tuesday. \"Approximately 97 or 98% of our trade deficit is with 15 countries, 18% of the countries are our major trading partners. And I would be surprised if we don\u2019t have more than 80 or 90% of those wrapped up by the end of the year, and that may be much sooner.\"",
      "Bessent went on to say that there could be deals announced this week. And yet, the end-of-year timeline is far different from what White House officials had previously suggested. The change in rhetoric is intentional, according to one White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.",
      "The substance matters more than the speed, the official said.",
      "\"Obviously, we're working as expeditiously as possible, but we're not trying to make deals that are Band-Aids for the sake of making deals,\" the official added.",
      "Trump has used his authority under an emergency declaration to raise tariffs on U.S. trading partners \u2014 and he can lower them in similar fashion if and when he chooses \u2014 but he might have to involve Congress for more comprehensive trade agreements. For now, Trump is operating with one blunt-force tool \u2014 the levies applied to goods entering the U.S. from abroad \u2014 in order to win concessions on both duties and \"nontariff barriers\" to trade.",
      "\"We don't need Congress to pass a bill\" because the U.S.-applied tariffs should be enough to win those concessions, the White House official said. \"The onus is obviously on the countries we're negotiating with.\"",
      "On Wednesday night, Trump was ready to again talk about deals \u2014 now that, it seemed, he had something to tout.",
      "He said that on Thursday morning, he posted on Truth Social, he would have an Oval Office press conference \"concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY. THE FIRST OF MANY!!!\""

Exchange of live fire across the border also surged overnight.",
      "Even as hostilities spilled into Thursday, both India and Pakistan emphasized that they had acted with restraint, and there are reports that security officials in both countries have started to open lines of communication. But in order to de-escalate, the two countries need international mediation and a way for both of them to declare victory, experts said.",

      "Experts say whether the conflict between Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan spirals into the latest of several wars since the end of British colonial rule in 1947 depends on whether Pakistan can cast its response so far as sufficient and find a political off-ramp.",

      "The attack last month in Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan fully claim and partly control, was the worst of its kind on Indian civilians in two decades. India and Pakistan have fought three wars over Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority region in India, where tens of thousands of people have been killed in a decadeslong separatist insurgency.",

      "In a recent episode of his highly influential podcast, Joe Rogan declared what he sees as the latest triumph in the cultural battle over language: the return of the \u201cR-word.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery time I see people that disagree with any that\u2019s happening, any gigantic world events, it\u2019s one of these retarded shows where they\u2019re screaming,\u201d he said April 10 on an episode of \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience,\u201d before he interrupted himself to go on a quick rant about the word.",
      "\u201cThe word \u2018retarded\u2019 is back, and it\u2019s one of the great cultural victories that I think is spurred on, probably, by podcasts,\u201d he added.",
      "Rogan is right, at least to those in some circles.",
      "Once relegated to the cultural dustbin, the so-called R-word has made a resurgence in recent months, used most commonly by people in right-leaning and anti-political correctness worlds, some of whom have tried for years to bring the slur from the social media undercurrents back into the mainstream.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk now frequently uses the word on X to disparage everyone from a Danish astronaut to Ben Stiller. In March, Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, used it in questioning the mental capacity of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s twins, only to later issue an apology. The FX show \u201cEnglish Teacher\u201d included a bit about how \u201cthe kids are not into being woke\u201d and they\u2019re \u201csaying the \u2018R-word\u2019 again.\u201d And a recent Netflix comedy special invoked the word repeatedly.",
      "While its use has percolated in the comedy world for years, only recently has the word \u2014 and discussion of its return \u2014 become more normalized. That is fueled in no small part by a sense that the tide has turned both culturally and politically against those seeking to keep the word out of the popular lexicon. But the battle lines are not as clear as one might think, with even some on the left softening their stance on the slur\u2019s rebrand while some on the right \u2014 most notably former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin \u2014 decry its return.",
      "Timothy Shriver, the chairman of Special Olympics International, noted that the word is used across the political spectrum.",
      "\u201cPeople on the left and people on the right have treated people with intellectual disabilities in subhuman ways, historically,\u201d Shriver said.",
      "Still, there are some political dynamics at play. Kenneth Luna, a linguistics professor at California State University, Northridge, who teaches a course on forbidden language, said the word has emerged as a cultural signifier, used by people on the cultural and political right to reinforce a group allegiance \u2014 and create further division.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this term, the politics of cruelty,\u201d Luna said. \u201cIt\u2019s a political ploy to marginalize opponents. But it also reinforces, if you think about it, this kind of in group loyalty.\u201d",
      "And it is not just right-leaning voters who are using the word. Business Insider reported that some liberal-identifying people are using it, among other canceled words, in response to feeling overly self-censored by the fear of saying something non-inclusive.",
      "Robbie Goodwin, 33, a comedian and podcaster who identifies as an anti-Trump social Democrat, said he has used the word in his comedy to describe something dumb but never to describe a disabled person or to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings.",
      "But in the last year, Goodwin said, he has noticed people abusing the word, and he believes\u00a0the joke is going away, partly because Rogan and Musk are using it as a signifier of their culture war.",
      "\u201cI never try to offend anyone, and it feels like they are getting off on the fact that it\u2019s offending someone and triggering the libs,\u201d Goodwin said in an interview, adding that he is \u201cgrossed out\u201d by Rogan\u2019s comments about the word\u2019s supposed cultural victory. \u201cI found myself using it less now, because I see unfunny people using it. It\u2019s so cringe.\u201d",
      "Some high-profile people have pushed back. Palin, not one to usually embrace the policing of language, criticized Ye in March for using the word.",
      "\u201cBTW, he & everyone else (especially \u2018Christian conservatives\u2019) thinking it\u2019s hip to ramp up use of the \u2018R\u2019 word\u2026 please unfollow me & know that my disrespect for you is insurmountable,\u201d wrote Palin, whose son Trig has Down syndrome.",
      "The word\u2019s return has also been particularly hurtful to people with intellectual disabilities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, and it upsets me beyond words to hear anyone use the R-word. That word isn\u2019t in style; it\u2019s hurtful,\u201d said Novie Craven, a Special Olympics athlete and host of the podcast \u201cInclusion Revolution Radio.\u201d \u201cWhen that word is used, you\u2019re telling the world that people like me, people with intellectual disabilities, don\u2019t belong, can\u2019t achieve or aren\u2019t worth respect.\u201d",
      "Craven added: \u201cBut you don\u2019t know us. You don\u2019t live our lives. If you did, you\u2019d understand how wrong that word is. You should get to know us before you speak about us.\u201d",
      "Before it became an insult, the term \u201cmental retardation,\u201d derived from the Latin for \u201cto slow,\u201d was adopted in the mid-1990s by the medical community and the government to replace words like \u201cmoron,\u201d \u201cidiot\u201d and \u201cimbecile\u201d in describing people with intellectual disabilities. The term was shortened and sent into the mainstream lexicon, and by the 1990s and the early 2000s, it had become an insult.",
      "The first big move against the word came in 2003, when President George W. Bush renamed the President\u2019s Committee on Mental Retardation as the President\u2019s Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities. Seven years later, President Barack Obama signed \u201cRosa\u2019s Law,\u201d which changed the term to \u201cintellectual disability\u201d in federal language.",
      "For a time, the pejorative against the millions of people in the United States who have intellectual or developmental disabilities was largely deemed socially taboo thanks to movements like \u201cSpread the Word to End the Word.\u201d However, the word never quite disappeared the way some others have, and the rise of social media in the 2010s provided a new way to observe its use and its growing embrace by those particularly on the right as political polarization grew.",
      "Now, Musk is arguably doing more to bring the slur back than anyone else.",
      "Musk, as leader of the administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the federal government, also has a direct influence whenever he invokes the slur, which he recently hurled at Yale history professor Timothy Snyder and used in a derisive nickname for Trump adviser Peter Navarro.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m tempted to call this guy a retard but I won\u2019t because I\u2019ve used that word too many times,\u201d Musk wrote Feb. 22 on X in response to Snyder.",
      "A study in January by Montclair State University found a 207.5% increase in posts on X using the slur four days after Musk used it in a post, or 312,642 posts using the term.",
      "Musk did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Daniela Peterka-Benton, an associate professor of justice studies at Montclair State, said in the study\u2019s news release that the increase in the slur\u2019s use after Musk is an \u201cexample of how hate content has been normalized and boosted in the online space.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe online space has always held potential dangers for marginalized communities, and it appears to be getting worse,\u201d she said.",
      "And while Luna, the linguist, believes \u201call bets are off\u201d in this political environment, he does not think the slur\u2019s return to the mainstream will last as long as Rogan might hope.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get worse in the sense that I don\u2019t see people widely using it at all times because it violates linguistic social norms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just have to combat it right away.\u201d"

      "\"He is a terrific person. He wasn\u2019t getting the support,\" Trump said of Martin. \"I'm very disappointed in that. ... I'm one person. I can only lift that little phone so many times in a day.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration terminated $1.81 billion in National Institutes of Health grants in less than 40 days, including $544 million in as-yet-unspent funds.",
      "That\u2019s according to an analysis published Thursday in JAMA, which relies on data from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System.",
      "The analysis offers the most comprehensive look to date at how much NIH funding has been slashed since the Trump administration kickstarted a massive effort to reduce what it sees as waste and inefficiency in federal spending.",
      "Some grants were temporarily reinstated due to court orders as new terminations were being issued, so the data is still in flux, said Michael Liu, an author of the study and a student at Harvard Medical School. Nevertheless, the HHS grant tracker is still the most accurate, real-time dataset available, he said.",
      "From Feb. 28 to April 8, the administration terminated nearly 700 grants across 24 NIH institutes and centers focused on subjects such as aging, cancer, child health, diabetes, mental health and neurological disorders.",
      "\u201cThese cuts were not spread evenly,\u201d Liu said. \u201cNamely, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities was hit the hardest. About 30% of all of its funding was cut. That\u2019s 10 times more than the average.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s new budget proposal would eliminate all funding for the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities next year, and refers to the institute as \u201creplete with DEI expenditures.\u201d His executive order in January called for an end to programs focused on diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "The proposal also calls for an overall reduction in NIH funding, lowering next year\u2019s budget to $27 billion \u2014 a roughly $18 billion cut that would eliminate gender-focused research and research on climate change. The administration plans to prioritize research on chronic disease and other epidemics.",
      "Most of the terminated NIH grants so far had been allocated to research projects, but around 20% were early career grants for fellowships, training or career development. Larger grants were more likely to be terminated, according to the analysis, though it\u2019s unclear from the data whether they were directly targeted.",
      "\u201cThese larger grants are usually funding big clinical trials and big research centers,\u201d Liu said. \u201cClosing the lights or stopping patients from receiving medications or interventions is potentially incredibly disruptive.\u201d",
      "Liu said the analysis also suggests that terminated grants were uniformly disruptive to public and private institutions.",
      "Among grant recipients, Columbia University received the most terminations \u2014 157 in total, according to the analysis. The Trump administration has targeted Columbia with funding cuts, citing \u201cthe school\u2019s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students\u201d following large pro-Palestinian protests on campus. Columbia laid off 180 staff members this week who had been working on federal grants affected by the cuts.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican-led Senate is expected to move forward with a vote Thursday on a bipartisan crypto regulation bill, but it\u2019s unclear if enough Democrats will support it as negotiations between the two parties are ongoing.",
      "The Senate Banking Committee passed the GENIUS Act, which would create the first U.S. regulatory framework for issuers of stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to currencies like the dollar, in April, with five Democrats backing the legislation.",
      "But after Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the Senate would swiftly take the measure up, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the ranking member on the Banking Committee, privately urged Democrats \u2014 including those who support the bill \u2014 to withhold their vote to extract more concessions from Republicans, according to three people with direct knowledge of their comments.",
      "Thune said on Thursday he is still having conversations with his Democratic colleagues about changes to the bill, and expects to know within the next few hours whether they have the votes to proceed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to see if there\u2019s a path forward that would enable us to get any changes that they would like, additional changes, because we\u2019ve had, like I said, a lot of them already made to the bill, but at some point they\u2019re going to have to take yes for an answer.\u201d Thune told reporters Thursday.",
      "Democrats are seeking explicit provisions barring members of the executive branch, including President Donald Trump and his family, from owning or trading cryptocurrency and stronger anti-corruption provisions. The bill requires 60 votes to advance to final passage in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority.",
      "For more than three hours on Wednesday morning, a bipartisan group of crypto-focused senators huddled in the office of Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C.",
      "The list included Sens. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn.; Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo.; Mark Warner, D-Va.; Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz.; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.; and Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md, according to three sources familiar with the meeting. The group held another closed-door meeting on Wednesday night for several hours and have yet to reach a consensus.",
      "Hagerty led negotiations with the Democrats who voted for the legislation in committee but later backtracked on their support, citing in a statement \u201cnumerous issues that must be addressed, including adding stronger provisions on anti-money laundering, foreign issuers, national security, preserving the safety and soundness of our financial system, and accountability for those who don\u2019t meet the act\u2019s requirements.\u201d",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, heard from tech entrepreneur David Sacks for more than an hour Wednesday, according to multiple senators who attended the briefing.",
      "\u201cWell, we had a good conversation yesterday,\u201d said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who supports the legislation. \u201cEverybody needs to understand, trading bitcoin is totally different than stablecoin.\u201d (Bitcoin is not pegged to fiat currency, like the U.S. dollar.)",
      "Asked if most members of Congress understand what different digital assets are and how they are used, Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio, chuckled.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a great question. I can\u2019t speak for other people. I know I\u2019ve had to spend a lot of time on it myself to really understand the issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no regulatory regime around this right now. It is the Wild Wild West, and we want to start to recognize that we need some security around this.\u201d",
      "The shift in Democratic support comes after an Abu-Dhabi backed investment firm announced last month that it will invest billions of dollars in the Trump family crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. The news of the investment sparked backlash from Senate Democrats, who argued that it is \u201cevidence\u201d that the president is using his office to enrich himself. And it comes after Trump held a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser on Monday focused on high-profile crypto investors and tech entrepreneurs.",
      "\u201cThe opportunities for grift \u2014 in which the Trump Administration offers favors to the UAE or to Binance in exchange for their massive payouts \u2014 are mind-boggling,\u201d Sens. Warren and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., wrote in a Monday letter to Jamieson Greer, the acting director of the Office of Government Ethics. (Binance is a cryptocurrentcy exchange.)",
      "Warren and Gillibrand signed on to legislation from Merkley that would ban presidents, lawmakers and their families from financially benefiting, issuing, endorsing or sponsoring crypto assets, including stablecoins. The End Crypto Corruption Act directly targets Trump and his family\u2019s crypto ventures, including nontraditional cryptocurrency endeavors like Trump\u2019s dinner and private White House tour for the top investors in his meme coin, $TRUMP.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., has joined the chorus of Democrats calling for legislation that specifically targets meme coins like $TRUMP, introducing his own broader proposal, along with Rep. Sam Liccardo, D-Calif., to crack down federal officials from using their position to profit off digital assets.",
      "The counter-messaging effort from Senate Democrats would likely fail in the GOP-controlled Senate. But Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said he would be in favor of barring \u201call public officials\u201d from using their positions to profit off of cryptocurrency.",
      "The GENIUS Act only regulates stablecoins and does not touch meme coins, a different type of cryptocurrency that derives its value from internet culture rather than from an underlying utility or asset. But proponents of the legislation argue that the bill does have protections against money laundering and fraud.",
      "Changes were made to the legislation at the request of Democrats after it was reported out of committee, including preserving state regulatory authority for foreign-issued stablecoins and broadening suspicious transaction monitoring and reporting for stablecoin users, according to two people familiar with the process.",
      "The draft bill is expected to contain a provision that would ban elected officials from issuing stablecoins, according to Thune and one Democratic aide involved in the process.",
      "\u201cI know we could come to a good, solid bill. We just need to take the time to actually work together on this,\u201d Gallego told reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of backsliding that happened between the committee vote and the text that came out. And I think that we can get there, but the version that currently is in place is not what we negotiated before.\u201d",
      "Thune maintained he is following \u201cregular order\u201d and that further changes to the bill could happen during an amendment process, a step that is only unlocked if senators provide 60 votes to advance the bill first. The House Financial Services Committee voted to pass a competing bill, the STABLE Act, which would also provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins, last month.",
      "If the Senate ultimately passes the bill, the House would still need to take it up before it could head to Trump\u2019s desk for a signature.",
      "\u201cWhen will the Democrats take yes for an answer? And if they have other suggestions and things that they want incorporated into the draft, we are certainly welcome to taking a look at and working with them on that, but we need to start moving forward,\u201d Thune said on Tuesday.",
      "It\u2019s not just Senate Democrats reversing course: A few Republicans have indicated they plan to vote against the GENIUS Act, including Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who said that without prohibiting tech companies from owning stablecoins, he\u2019s not comfortable supporting the bill.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who often deviates from his party, said he planned to vote against the legislation due to fears of over regulation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a real big fan of federal regulations period, much less starting a whole new scheme for a whole new industry that exists and seems to be doing OK without federal regulations.\u201d Paul told reporters Tuesday."

    "story": [
      "Wildfires driven by climate change contribute to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic costs from wildfire smoke in the United States, according to a new study.",
      "The\u00a0paper,\u00a0published Friday in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment, found that from 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to about 15,000 deaths from exposure to small particulate matter from wildfires and cost about $160 billion. The annual range of deaths was 130 to 5,100, the study showed, with the highest in states such as Oregon and California.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more of these wildfire smoke events,\u201d said Nicholas Nassikas, a study author and a physician and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. So he and multidisciplinary team of researchers wanted to know: \u201cWhat does it really mean in a changing environment for things like mortality, which is kind of the worst possible health outcome?\u201d",
      "Lisa Thompson, a professor at Emory University who studies air pollution and climate change and was not involved in the paper, said it is one of the first studies she has seen to isolate the effect of climate change on mortality. Looking at the impacts across time and space also made it unique, she said.",
      "The paper\u2019s researchers focused on deaths linked to exposure to fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 \u2014 the main concern from wildfire smoke.",
      "These particles can lodge deep into lungs and trigger coughing and itchy eyes with short-term exposure. But longer term they can make existing health problems worse and lead to a range of chronic and deadly health issues. Children, pregnant people, the elderly and\u00a0outdoor workers\u00a0are among the most vulnerable. The Health Effects Institute estimated the pollutant caused\u00a04 million deaths worldwide.",
      "Evidence is emerging\u00a0that PM2.5 from wildfire smoke is more toxic than other pollution sources. When wildfires\u00a0encroach into cities, burning cars and other toxics-containing materials, it adds to the danger.",
      "Numerous studies have tied human-caused climate change \u2014 caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas \u2014 to a growth in fires in North America. Global warming is increasing drought, especially in the West, and other extreme weather. Drier conditions suck moisture from plants, which act as fuel for fires. When drier vegetation and seasons are mixed with hotter temperatures, that increases the frequency, extent and severity of wildfires and the smoke they spew.",
      "Findings dismaying but not surprising, scholar says",
      "Jacob Bendix, professor emeritus of geography and environment at Syracuse University, said he was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the findings but not surprised.",
      "\u201c(T)hese numbers are really significant. I think there\u2019s a tendency for people outside of the areas actually burning to see increasing fires as a distant inconvenience \u2026 This study drives home how far-reaching the impacts are,\u201d said Bendix in an email. He wasn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "The study\u2019s authors drew on modeled and existing data to reach their findings. First, they sought to understand how much area burned by wildfires was attributable to climate change. They did that by analyzing the real climate conditions \u2014 heat and rain, for instance \u2014 when wildfires erupted from 2006 to 2020, and compared that to a scenario where weather measurements would be different without climate change.",
      "From there, they estimated the levels of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke tied to climate change using the same approach. Lastly, integrating the current understanding of how particulate matter affects mortality based on published research, they quantified the number of deaths related to PM2.5 from wildfires and calculated their economic impact.",
      "This framework showed that of 164,000 deaths related to wildfire-PM2.5 exposure from 2006 to 2020, 10% were attributable to climate change. The mortalities were 30% to 50% higher in some western states and counties.",
      "Questions about the study\u2019s conclusions",
      "Marshall Burke, global environmental policy professor at Stanford University, said the evidence linking climate change to burned areas was \u201crock solid,\u201d but the subsequent steps were harder.",
      "\u201cLinking burned area to smoke is trickier because you never know exactly which way the wind\u2019s going to blow,\u201d he said, and he wondered how the death estimates compared to fatalities tied to general air pollution.",
      "Still, their approach was sensible and reasonable, Burke said.",
      "Johns Hopkins University lecturer in climate and energy policy Patrick Brown said he had some concerns about the study. One was conceptual. The study acknowledges the power non-climate drivers have on wildfires, but it doesn\u2019t give them proper weight, he said in an email.",
      "Brown, who was not involved in the study, worries decision-makers could wrongly conclude that mitigating planet-warming carbon emissions is the only solution. \u201cYet in many regions, the more immediate life\u2011saving action may be fuel breaks, prescribed burns, ignition\u2011source regulation, public health efforts, etc.,\u201d he said.",
      "Land management practices such as prescribed burns can reduce wildfire fuel, Nassikas said. But ultimately, the study notes, the problem of deaths from wildfire smoke will only get worse without the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\u201cPart of the study is raising awareness,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then once we kind of understand that \u2026 now what are the interventions that we can deploy at a personal level, at a community level, and then obviously at a larger level across the country and across the world?\u201d"

      "Within Pakistan, Yusuf said, there is debate as to whether Pakistan should be satisfied with the downing of Indian military aircraft or deeper shelling of Indian-administered Kashmir.",

      "India has been clear \u201cthat we are willing to raise the stakes,\u201d Hooda said.",
      "\u201cIf Pakistan wants to escalate it further, whatever the justification, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see,\u201d he said."

      "\"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump has repeatedly suggested that foreign nations are eager to ink a deal with Washington to avoid the worst effects of the wave of levies he announced last month, but this would be the first such deal.",
      "Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro raised the prospect of \u201c90 deals in 90 days\u201d after the tariffs were announced \u2014 but 36 days since \u201cliberation day\u201d, the deal with Britain would be the first.",
      "On Tuesday, an obviously frustrated Trump told reporters that he wishes they would, \u201cyou know, stop asking, \u2018How many deals are you signing this week?\u2019 Because one day we\u2019ll come and we\u2019ll give you 100 deals. And they don\u2019t have to sign.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said his planned meeting this weekend with Chinese officials in Switzerland amounts to an early phase of negotiations that is not as far along as talks with less-crucial nations. Bessent also told a House subcommittee this week that negotiations were occurring with just 17 trading partners and that the majority should be wrapped up by the end of the year \u2014 not within the three-month window Trump set last month.",

      "Chief U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg used the words of President Donald Trump and members of his administration at a hearing yesterday in questioning a Justice Department attorney about who has constructive custody of the men sent to El Salvador\u2019s CECOT facility. Plaintiffs have \u201ca lot of facts in your favor\u201d in arguing that the U.S., not El Salvador, has \u201cconstructive custody,\u201d which refers to the legal notion that people can be held at the behest of the government even if they are not held in its physical custody.",
      "Boasberg brought up the instance last week in which Trump said that he \u201ccould\u201d have Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was wrongly deported, returned to the U.S. with a phone call. In addition, press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said the U.S. was paying El Salvador \u201capproximately $6 million\u201d to keep the men, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said CECOT was \u201cone of the tools in our tool kit\u201d that the U.S. could use.",
      "So, \u201cwas the president telling the truth\u201d or not, Boasberg asked in yesterday\u2019s hearing. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Abishek Kambli responded, \u201cThat goes towards the president\u2019s belief about influence he has. Influence does not equate to constructive custody.\u201d\u00a0Read the full story here.",
      "The case regarding the men sent to El Salvador continues to be litigated as the Trump administration reportedly aims to send migrants from the Philippines, Vietnam and Laos, among other countries, to Libya as early as this week.

      "Four former housekeepers of Robinson's in a lawsuit filed Tuesday accused him of sexually assaulting them, which was alleged to have gone on for years. The lawsuit seeks no less than $50 million in damages.",
      "Robinson's attorney, Christopher Frost, in a statement late Wednesday called the lawsuit \"simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon.\"",
      "\"Through this process we have seen the bizarre theatrics of yesterday\u2019s news conference, as the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys outlined vile, false allegations against Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, trying to enlist the public as an unwitting participant in the media circus they are trying to create,\" Frost said in the statement.",
      "Frost also said that \"in time Mr. Robinson will respond in his own words.\"",
      "The lawsuit filed against Robinson in Los Angeles County Superior Court alleged that the assaults largely occurred at Robinson\u2019s home in Chatsworth, a Los Angeles neighborhood in the far northwestern section of the city.",
      "The women who sued are identified in the lawsuit as Jane Does 1-4. Three of them appeared Tuesday at a news conference in Los Angeles wearing masks, and a fourth appeared virtually.",

      "\"As low-wage workers in vulnerable positions, they lacked the resources and options to protect themselves,\" Harris said.",
      "The suit alleges that Robinson assaulted one woman at least 23 times from May 2014 to February 2020, often in places in his home without security cameras.",
      "The suit alleges that he assaulted another former employee at least 20 times during the 12 years she worked for him, beginning in 2012. According to the suit, Robinson would force her into his bedroom and perform a \u201critual\u201d of leaving his bathroom naked or nearly naked.",
      "According to the suit, Robinson would then place a towel on his bed so the linens would not be soiled \u201cfor what was about to occur.\u201d",
      "The suit says he subjected two other plaintiffs to the same behavior. One of the former housekeepers worked for Robinson for 13 months, during which, she alleges, he assaulted her at least seven times.",
      "All of the plaintiffs accused Robinson's wife, Frances Robinson, who is also named as a defendant, of perpetuating a hostile work environment by screaming at them and using ethnically pejorative language.",
      "Robinson was a pioneer for Motown Records, founding the vocal group the Miracles in the 1950s and later releasing albums as a solo artist and working as a record executive for the label. He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.",
      "Frost, Robinson's lawyer, said they will seek to have the lawsuit dismissed. He also criticized the lawyers for the women over the press conference, saying that they \"have reached beyond the bounds of liberties that even lawyers are typically allowed in this context.\"",
      "\"We will have more to say on this matter, as we fiercely defend our clients against these false allegations and work to protect their good names,\" Frost said."

      "That love radiates onstage, with Machado artfully portraying Carmen as a captivating and endearing figure, a bright and welcomed contrast to the harsher character we came to know in the film.",
      "She\u2019s charming, but Carmen still ascribes to stifling ideas of body image that her daughter fights against in the musical. Her constant commentary about her daughter\u2019s weight culminates in the musical\u2019s title song.",

      "The first track sets a vulnerable tone, with lyrics translating to: \"Give me time / Because I'm not in my best moment / But I'm getting better little by little, yes / Today I'm down, but tomorrow will be more beautiful.\"",
      "Now, the Colombian superstar is opening up even further in the new Netflix documentary \"Ma\u00f1ana Fue Bonito,\" which translates to \"Tomorrow Was Beautiful,\" a reflection of the point of her career where she found herself at her highest professionally \u2014 despite being at one of her lowest personally.",
      "The film \u2014 which hits the streamer on May 8 \u2014 brings viewers inside the story of how the Grammy winner rose from a little girl in Medell\u00edn with dreams of singing to an international superstar.",
      "There are plenty of tears, but there is also a lot of laughter, celebration and triumph \u2014 especially after many on Karol's team advised her against a stadium tour, and she persisted anyway. She went on to become the first-ever Latina to headline a global stadium tour.",
      "Directed by Cristina Costantini (who also helmed \"Mucho, Mucho Amor\" about the life of famed astrologer Walter Mercado, and the upcoming \"Sally\" about astronaut Sally Ride), \u201cTomorrow Was Beautiful\" also touches on the singer's personal life. After a breakup from a very public relationship, her most recent album was beloved by fans for artfully capturing the realities of heartbreak. In the documentary, she opens up for the first time about the experience.",
      "\"Love can make you feel like the happiest person on Earth, but at the same time it can destroy you, your dreams, your whole world... everything you are,\" she says in the film.",

      "Karol G",
      "Ultimately, though, \u201cMa\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito\" the album, tour, and now the documentary are all about Karol learning to love herself again. And after initially keeping the details private, she's also slowly opening up about learning to fall in love again, too: This time, into a \"healthy relationship\" with fellow Colombian superstar Feid. In the doc, she credits him as the person she's most been able to visualize herself with. On TODAY May 6, she told the third hour anchors: \"He understands what I do, I understand what he does. He is a really special soul. It is a blessing to have him.\"",
      "When asked if she was nervous about opening up about her love life for the first time in the Netflix doc, she admits in an interview with TODAY.com that it was a hard decision to make.",
      "\"I had a relationship that was like, super public, and everybody was into it ... so to have that hard moment of the breakup, in front of millions of eyes, was difficult,\" she says.",

I understood that there\u2019s a lot of people feeling the same, and they are not able to speak about it, or they don\u2019t have the words, but they can with my music \u2014 with my testimony, with my journey. And I love that.\"",
      "Her love life, however, wasn't the hardest part for Karol to open up about. That, she says, was the portion where she reveals the real reason why she almost quit music more than a decade ago. As she previously told TODAY, in 2012, she decided she was done with singing and moved to New York to study business and English.",
      "But in the documentary, she explains that what truly led her to become \"disillusioned\" and take a break from music was a manager who came on to her when she was only 16 years old.",
      "\"It broke my heart, because it was like ... you are putting me in a situation in which you're using my hopes and dreams and putting this condition on achieving them,\" she says in the film, before adding that she couldn't bring herself to tell her parents what happened at the time.",
      "She tells TODAY.com now the scene in the documentary was so difficult for her to record, she has still yet to watch \"Tomorrow Was Beautiful\" with anyone but herself. But it was important for her to share her experience in the hopes that it will help other women.",
      "\"When I started being surrounded by different women in this industry, I started noticing that there was a cycle \u2014 that a lot of us have experienced something similar,\" she says. \"I wanted to share this moment so women can feel OK knowing that they can say no, and they can open that door and they can leave. And to feel comfortable in that.\"",
      "With her documentary also comes another transition: A hair color change. Famous for rocking different shades throughout her career stages (blue for her \u201cKG0516\u201d album; red and then pink for  \u201cMa\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito\u201d), Karol G is now sporting brown.",
      "\"I just went back to my natural color of my hair, because there is so much going on right now, so much coming right now,\" she says. \"And I think I really wanted to be my most natural and original and authentic and genuine version of myself.\"",
      "Clearly, tomorrow really was beautiful. And the day after that will be, too."

    "story": [
      "Julia Louis-Dreyfus has done many good things during her career, but it\u2019s something she did extraordinarily badly that fans love.",
      "The \u201cSeinfeld\u201d star says there is one thing fans of the show always ask her to do.",
      "\u201cThey often come up to me and ask me if I want to dance. You want to dance?\u201d she told People, a reference to how her character on \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d Elaine, was a terrible dancer.",
      "And does Louis-Dreyfus play along by dancing for fans?",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d she said.",
      "Elaine\u2019s inability to dance and her lack of self-awareness when it comes to how poorly she moves are showcased in the 1996 Season Eight episode \u201cThe Little Kicks,\u201d in which she tries to loosen up her co-workers by hitting the dance floor, prompting people to look on in horror.",
      "Elaine\u2019s terrible dancing became one of the character\u2019s signature traits, on par with her penchant for yelling, \u201cGet out!\u201d and famously declaring, \u201cMaybe the dingo ate your baby.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you had told me that people would be doing it, I would never have believed you, no,\u201d she told Ellen DeGeneres in 2004. \u201cI got the script. They said she dances badly. I stood in front of the mirror and tried to look like the biggest horse\u2019s a-- I could look like.\u201d",
      "Louis-Dreyfus also said figuring out how to dance so poorly was a bit of a team effort.",
      "\u201cThe night before the table read, I had the script, and frankly, I just stood in front of a mirror and tried to do movements that looked incredibly bad,\u201d Louis-Dreyfus told\u00a0Vanity Fair\u00a0in 2019.",
      "\u201cI had a few of them, and I remember my mom was staying with us at the time, and I came downstairs, and I sort of auditioned these different movements for my mom and my husband \u2014 and they all voted on the one that I did.\u201d",
      "Louis-Dreyfus notched seven Emmy Award nominations for playing Elaine on \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and won once. She has since secured 10 more Emmys in her career for \u201cThe New Adventures of Old Christine\u201d and \u201cVeep.\u201d She can be seen in the new film \u201cThunderbolts*.\u201d"

      "She replied, \u201cRocky brought that,\u201d and then pointed to her stomach and quipped, \u201cI brought the kid!\u201d",

      "The Wayfarer Foundation, an organization connected to Justin Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios, announced that it is shutting down. The news comes amid the actor and director's ongoing legal battle with former co-star Blake Lively.",
      "Wayfarer Studios was founded by Baldoni and businessman Steve Sarowitz in 2019. In 2021, Wayfarer Foundation launched as a philanthropic branch of the studio.",
      "According to its website, Wayfarer Foundation was created \u201cas a Baha\u2019i-inspired organization with the mission to \u2018advance humankind spiritually towards a future peaceful world civilization.\u2019\u201d The organization funded and supported \u201cspiritually-rooted and justice-oriented nonprofits.\u201d",
      "On May 2, Sarowitz posted an update on the organization\u2019s Instagram account saying that Wayfarer Foundation would soon be ceasing operations.",
      "\u201cUpon unanimous decision of the board of directors, today we will begin the process of sunsetting the Foundation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe will honor all of our current grant commitments as we carefully wind down operations over the next several weeks. Although the Wayfarer Foundation is closing, my personal commitment to giving remains strong, and I\u2019m dedicated to making an impact on society through the ongoing mission and work.\u201d",
      "Sarowitz concluded, \u201cWe understand that this news may come as a surprise, and we will be actively working over the next several weeks to ensure all matters are concluded with care and attention.\u201d",
      "The statement did not reference the lawsuits involving Baldoni, Lively and the production of the 2024 film \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d Both Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios were named in the federal lawsuit Lively filed on Dec. 31, 2024 in which she alleged there was a \u201cretaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns,\u201d her attorney said in a statement to NBC News at the time. Producer Jamey Heath, crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel were also named in the lawsuit.",
      "Lively\u2019s lawsuit came about a week after she filed an 80-page sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni, accusing him of creating a hostile workplace on the set of the film.",
      "Baldoni\u2019s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said in a statement to TODAY.com on Dec. 21 that the allegations were \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d The \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d star and director then responded by suing The New York Times for libel following the newspaper\u2019s publication of an article detailing Lively\u2019s accusations. He also filed a lawsuit against Lively, husband Ryan Reynolds, Lively\u2019s rep Leslie Sloane and Sloane\u2019s PR firm on Jan. 16, 2025.",
      "In the 179-page complaint, Baldoni alleged that the parties engaged in defamation and disregarded contractual claims. He and his team also created a website about the lawsuit that included alleged texts between the two co-stars, as well as Reynolds and Baldoni.",
      "A trial for the legal back-and-forth has been set for March 9, 2026 in New York.",
      "Earlier in May, Lively appeared on an episode of \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers\u201d to promote her new movie, \u201cAnother Simple Favor.\u201d She also briefly addressed her \u201cintense\u201d year.",
      "\u201cWhat I can say without going too into it is that this year has been full of the highest highs and the lowest lows of my life. I see so many women around afraid to speak, afraid to share their experiences. Fear is by design. It\u2019s what keeps us silent,\u201d she said.",
      "Lively continued, \u201cI acknowledge that many people don\u2019t have the opportunity to speak. I feel fortunate that I have been able to. It\u2019s the women who have had the ability to use their voice that have kept me strong and have helped me in my fight to make the world safer for women and girls. It\u2019s a pretty simple thing.\u201d"

      "Though Potton tried several more times to get Goggins to address the rumored feud, the actor \u2014 and his publicists \u2014 continued to dodge the question.",

      "The bittersweet dramedy was co-created by Tina Fey, Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield, and inspired by a 1981 movie of the same name. It's sure to strike a chord with its dark humor, layered performances and honest look at long-term relationships and second acts.",
      "Netflix hasn't weighed in on the show's future. But if the show does return for a second season, which couples are likely to make it out intact \u2014 and which are hanging by a thread?",

      "Marco Calvani, who plays Claude, tells TODAY.com he\u2019s honored viewers see his character as the emotional anchor of the show \u2014 even if he didn\u2019t always feel that way.",
      "\u201cUsually I\u2019m described as eccentric or flamboyant \u2014 and Claude is all those things,\u201d he told me, laughing. \u201cBut at the heart of it, Claude\u2019s entire identity is tied to Danny. If Danny disappears, Claude fades. That fear fuels everything, even his joy.\u201d",

      "By the finale, the couple seems on the cusp of healing \u2014 Danny even begins to believe Claude\u2019s whimsical theory that Nick has become a butterfly.",
      "Season 2 could deepen this emotional journey \u2014 if Danny can stay honest, and Claude can feel heard.",
      "Kate and Jack",
      "Kate (Tina Fey) and Jack (Will Forte) have a marriage held together by sarcasm, snide remarks, and years of habit \u2014 not exactly a recipe for longevity. Jack literally kisses another woman mid-season, and Kate spends most of the show either rolling her eyes or rolling solo.",
      "But something shifts during a near-death moment on a frozen lake, when Jack pulls Kate to safety.",
      "They agree to stay married \u2014 for now \u2014 at the end of the season.",
      "Anne and Ginny",
      "If \"The Four Seasons\" was bold enough to kill off a major character and still tee up a second season, then it\u2019s certainly bold enough to build an emotional arc around two women who loved the same man \u2026 and are now, possibly, raising a baby together.",
      "Anne banning Ginny from the funeral felt inevitable. But by the end of her chaotic eulogy, Anne breaks down and admits: \u201cI just realized, I didn\u2019t know him at all.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s real anger in Pakistan that a nuclear country gets up, says there\u2019s been a terrorist attack, and provides not even a shred of evidence to link it to Pakistan, and still goes ahead and uses military force,\u201d said Yusuf, now a senior fellow at Harvard\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.",
      "The attack last month in Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan fully claim and partly control, was the worst of its kind on Indian civilians in two decades. India and Pakistan have fought three wars over Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority region in India, where tens of thousands of people have been killed in a decadeslong separatist insurgency.",
      "India, which has long accused Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism, said it had \u201ccredible evidence\u201d of Pakistan\u2019s involvement in the Kashmir attack as well as intelligence suggesting that more attacks were coming, without publicly revealing details.",
      "Islamabad denied the allegations and called on India to produce evidence.",
      "Lt. Gen. Deependra Singh Hooda, former head of the Indian Army\u2019s Northern Command, said \u201cthe ball is in Pakistan\u2019s court.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Indian perspective is, \u2018Look, we\u2019re tired of this,\u2019\u201d said Hooda, who was stationed in Jammu and Kashmir from 2012 to 2016.",
      "\u201cWe know infiltration is happening, whole infrastructure has been there for years, so do we really need to provide exact proof?\u201d he said.",
      "Yusuf and others say the international community must play an active role in defusing the situation. But that has become more difficult since the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, where its presence had historically acted as a deterrent against India-Pakistan violence.",
      "Trump also appears to be preoccupied with securing trade deals, \u201cwhich is giving time for India and Pakistan to attack and counterattack,\u201d said Praveen Donthi, a New Delhi-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group.",
      "Within Pakistan, Yusuf said, there is debate as to whether Pakistan should be satisfied with the downing of Indian military aircraft or deeper shelling of Indian-administered Kashmir.",
      "\u201cPakistan will not offer India a face-saver like we did in 2019 by voluntarily handing over the captured pilot,\u201d Yusuf said, referring to a dogfight between the two nations after a deadly attack on Indian security forces in Kashmir that also fueled worries of all-out war between the two nations.",
      "The stakes are now higher than ever, Donthi said.",
      "\u201cAll it takes is a miscalculation or a mistake, and we know both establishments have been under pressure to retaliate,\u201d he said.",
      "Even if the two countries were to de-escalate quickly, he said, this week\u2019s violence will have long-term repercussions, uniting \u201canti-India militants\u201d in Pakistan and increasing the likelihood of further attacks in India.",
      "India has been clear \u201cthat we are willing to raise the stakes,\u201d Hooda said.",
      "\u201cIf Pakistan wants to escalate it further, whatever the justification, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see,\u201d he said."

Born prematurely, Yussuf is now suffering from acute malnutrition, with the family unable to obtain formula or medication as Israel\u2019s blockade of aid and goods reaching Gaza enters its third month.",
      "After Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that he would give an order to ramp up the military offensive in Gaza with a plan to seize the entire strip, Yussuf\u2019s future is increasingly uncertain. Palestinians and observers fear fresh bombings and displacement, and aid groups warn of a spiraling humanitarian crisis marked by scarce food supplies.",
      "Yussuf is among the 9,000 children in Gaza to have been admitted or treated for acute malnutrition since the war began, with UNICEF saying in March that it had seen a surge in cases. Dr. Ahmed al-Farrah, head of the pediatrics and obstetrics ward at Nasser Hospital, told NBC News last week that more than 50 children had died \"from starvation.\"",
      "\u201cIsn\u2019t it a sin for a child to die like this?\u201d Al-Najjar, 30, told NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground, her face wracked with grief.",
      "Across Gaza, Palestinians expressed anxiety as they learned of the plan unanimously approved by Israel's security Cabinet to seize the entire territory in what Netanyahu described as an effort to defeat Hamas.",

      "Around 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage into Gaza in the attacks, with more than 50 people, both dead and alive, believed to remain in Hamas' captivity, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The families of hostages who remain held in Gaza have warned that a ramped-up offensive will only put the lives of their loved ones at further risk.",
      "Meanwhile, right-wing ministers in Netanyahu\u2019s fragile government coalition celebrated the plans for an expanded offensive, having advocated for such a move before and after the last ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which held for two months from Jan. 19 to March 18.",
      "Prior to that ceasefire, the Israeli military had taken control of around a third of Gaza.",
      "Even so, hopes remained in Gaza and Israel for a resumption of that truce ahead of a visit from President Donald Trump to the region planned for next week.",
      "While Trump has repeatedly touted a proposal for the U.S. to eventually take ownership of the Gaza Strip, Palestinians there implored him to take action to halt Israel\u2019s plans for an expanded offensive.",
      "Khan Younis resident Abu Muhsin, 55, asked \u201cWhere is Trump who calls for freedom and democracy?\u201d",
      "In Israel, meanwhile, Cabinet Minister Ze\u2019ev Elkin said Monday that a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d remained for talks to resume.",
      "From outside of his Cabinet, Netanyahu has faced growing criticism for resuming and expanding Israel's offensive in Gaza. The latest denunciation came from Eran Duvdevani, a prominent retired colonel who led a campaign by former and reserve Israeli paratroopers calling for an end to the war.",
      "Duvdevani told NBC News that a growing number of reservists were already rejecting calls to return to service in a war they increasingly view as politically motivated.",
      "He added that without a fresh truce between Israel and Hamas, Trump's intervention was likely the only thing that could stop an expanded offensive.",
      "\"This is the only way, to press Netanyahu,\" Duvdevani said in a phone interview early Tuesday. \"Nothing will happen if Trump will not press him.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a hearing for\u00a0Netanyahu's testimony in his ongoing public corruption trial ended early Tuesday, according to Israeli newspaper\u00a0The Times of\u00a0Israel. It came as the Israeli military issued an evacuation warning for Yemen\u2019s Sanaa Airport ahead of what appeared to be a pending attack."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday that the Trump administration believes Russia is \"asking for too much\" during talks to bring its war in Ukraine to an end.",
      "\u201cRight now, the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions, in order to end the conflict. We think they\u2019re asking for too much,\u201d Vance said at a Munich Leaders Meeting on international security policy in Washington, D.C.",
      "Asked about Vance\u2019s comments later Wednesday, President Donald Trump said, \u201cIt\u2019s possible that\u2019s right.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are getting to a point where some decisions are going to have to be made,\u201d said Trump, who has said repeatedly that U.S. may have to walk away from the negotiations if no progress has made.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not happy about it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about it.\u201d",
      "Trump and other officials have intensified pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent weeks.",
      "Vance, who has long criticized U.S. support for Ukraine and was involved in the February Oval Office blow-up with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Wednesday the Trump administration is continuing discussions with Kyiv on what it needs to bring the conflict to an end.",
      "\u201cWhat the president has said is that he will walk away if he thinks he\u2019s not making progress\u201d in talks with the two countries, said Vance, who last week predicted that the war was not going to end \"anytime soon.\"",
      "The vice president said at the event Wednesday that the U.S. would like to see direct talks between Russia and Ukraine as the next major step in the diplomatic process.",
      "\u201cObviously, the United States is happy to participate in those conversations, but it\u2019s very important for the Russians and the Ukrainians to start talking to one another,\u201d he said.",
      "Vance added that he thinks it would be \u201cprobably impossible\u201d for the U.S. to mediate the talks entirely, without at least some direct conversations between Russia and Ukraine to try to close the \u201cgulf\u201d in what the two countries are demanding. He said the U.S. has been frustrated with the negotiations because, he said, Russia and Ukraine \"hate each other so much\" that the first 30 minutes of any hourlong discussion, for example, is spent \"complaining about some historical grievance.\"",
      "The U.S. has participated in talks with Ukraine and European partners in recent weeks, but there don't appear to be formal talks underway at the moment.",
      "In an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that aired over the weekend, Trump said he believed the U.S. was \"closer\" in making progress with one party, \"and maybe not as close with the other.\" He declined to say which side was the one making progress. At the same time, however, the president admitted that \"maybe it's not possible to do\" a deal.",
      "Asked how long he would give both countries before walking away from the talks, Trump said, \"Well, there will be a time when I will say, 'OK, keep going. Keep being stupid and keep fighting.'\"",
      "After the Oval Office spat, the administration has softened its approach toward Ukraine, especially as a deal to give the U.S. access to some of Ukraine's rare earth minerals finally came together.",
      "In late April, Trump expressed outrage at Putin after his military launched one of the most devastating attacks on Ukraine's major cities since the war began. \u201cVladimir, STOP!\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Russia's attacks have still continued, with its army launching four ballistic missiles and 142 drones at Ukraine overnight, according to Zelenskyy, who had said without providing details Tuesday that it planned to ramp up pressure on Russia.",
      "\"The coming weeks are expected to be very active for Ukraine in diplomacy,\" he said. \"We are planning new measures to increase pressure on Russia \u2014 to protect our people. I thank everyone who stands with Ukraine.\""

      "Calling them an \u201cact of war,\u201d Pakistan said the strikes, which according to India hit nine locations across the Pakistani province of Punjab and in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, killed 26 people and injured 46 others. Among the dead were six people killed at two mosques and two teenagers who were killed elsewhere, Pakistani officials said.",
      "India said the strikes hit only \u201cterror camps\u201d and no civilian or military targets. It said it had exercised \u201cconsiderable restraint\u201d in its target selection.",

      "Several buildings were on fire after the strikes, which caused power outages in various locations, videos posted on social media and verified by NBC News showed. Some of the injured were being taken to hospital in ambulances, and in another video, a loud hissing sound can be heard before a blast hits a few feet away from a crowd of bicyclists.",
      "Follow live coverage",
      "India blames Pakistan for the massacre last month of 26 civilians, mostly tourists, in the Indian part of Kashmir, a disputed Himalayan region that both India and Pakistan claim in its entirety. Pakistan, which India has long accused of supporting cross-border terrorism, denies involvement and has called for a \u201cneutral\u201d investigation into the April 22 attack, the deadliest against Indian civilians in almost two decades.",
      "\u201cIt was expected that Pakistan would take action against terrorists and the infrastructure that supports them,\u201d the Indian Embassy in Washington said in a statement. \u201cInstead, during the fortnight that has gone by, Pakistan has indulged in denial and made allegations of false flag operations against India.\u201d",
      "Pakistan promised a forceful response to India\u2019s airstrikes, with security officials telling NBC News that Pakistani forces had already shot down five Indian Air Force planes and one drone. India has not confirmed the reports.",
      "At least three civilians were also killed in shelling by Pakistani troops in Indian-controlled Kashmir, the Indian army said.",
      "The strikes started at 1:05 a.m. (3:35 p.m. ET Tuesday) and lasted for 25 minutes, Col. Sofiya Qureshi, an Indian army officer,\u00a0told a news briefing Wednesday. India responded with \u201cprecision capability\u201d to avoid \u201ccollateral damage,\u201d said Indian air force Wing Cdr. Vyomika Singh.",
      "New Delhi had intelligence that indicated \u201cfurther attacks against India are impending,\u201d Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in the news briefing, adding the strikes were both a response to last month\u2019s attack and a deterrent against future attacks.",
      "\u201cPakistan has every right to give a robust response to this act of war imposed by India, and a strong response is indeed being given,\u201d said Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who has convened a meeting of his National Security Committee for Wednesday morning.",

      "As dawn broke, Pakistan announced all schools in Punjab as well as the Islamabad Capital Territory would be closed for the day. Commercial flights were also disrupted and some airports were reportedly closed.",
      "The strikes were known as Operation Sindoor in a reference to the red vermilion that newly married Hindu women wear in their hair to symbolize love and devotion. During the attack on a group of tourists in Kashmir, militants identified non-Muslims and then separated the men from the women and children, killing husbands in front of their wives.",
      "Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority region in India and one of the most militarized places in the world. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist, says his 2019 revocation of Kashmir\u2019s semiautonomous status ended a decades-long separatist insurgency and allowed tourism to flourish, a narrative that was shattered by the attack last month.",
      "Since the attack, India has threatened to disrupt Pakistan\u2019s water supply and closed the only functional land border crossing. There has also been a crackdown in Kashmir, with officials making hundreds of arrests and demolishing the family homes of suspected militants.",
      "The two countries have closed their airspaces to each other\u2019s airlines, suspended or revoked some visas for each other\u2019s nationals and suspended trade. India has also held civil defense drills, while Pakistan has test-fired missiles.",

      "Sudan\u2019s paramilitary unleashed drones on the Red Sea city of Port Sudan early Tuesday, hitting key targets there, including the airport, the port and a hotel, military officials said. The barrage was the second such attack this week on a city that had been a hub for people fleeing Sudan\u2019s two-year war.",
      "There was no immediate word on any casualties or the extent of the damage. Local media reported loud sound of explosions and fires at the port and the airport. Footage circulating online showed thick smoke rising over the area.",
      "The attack on Port Sudan, which also serves as an interim seat for Sudan\u2019s military-allied government, underscores that after two years of fighting, the military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces are still capable of threatening each other\u2019s territory.",
      "The RSF drones struck early in the morning, said two Sudanese military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",
      "Abdel-Rahman al-Nour, a Port Sudan resident, said he woke up to strong explosions, and saw fires and plumes of black smoke rising over the port. Msha\u2019ashir Ahmed, a local journalist living in Port Sudan, said fires were still burning late Tuesday morning in the southern vicinity of the maritime port.",
      "The attack apparently disrupted air traffic at the airport, with Cairo airport data in neighboring Egypt showing that three Port Sudan-bound flights were canceled on Tuesday.",
      "The RSF did not release any statements on the attack. On Sunday, the paramilitary force struck Port Sudan for the first time in the war, disrupting air traffic in the city\u2019s airport, which has been the main entry point for the county in the last two years.",
      "A military ammunition warehouse in the Othman Daqna airbase in the city was also hit, setting off a fire that burned for two days.",
      "When the fighting in Sudan broke out, the focus of the battles initially was the country\u2019s capital, Khartoum, which turned into a war zone. Withing weeks, Port Sudan, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) to the east of Khartoum, turned into a safe haven for the displaced and those fleeing the war. Many aid missions and U.N. agencies moved their offices there.",
      "The attacks on Port Sudan are also seen as retaliation after the Sudanese military earlier this month struck the Nyala airport in South Darfur, which the paramilitary RSF has turned into a base and where it gets shipments of arms, including drones.",

      "Since then, at least 24,000 people have been killed, though the number is likely far higher. The war has driven about 13 million people from their homes, including four million crossed into neighboring countries. It also pushed parts of the country into famine.",
      "The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western Darfur region, according to the United Natios. and international rights groups."

    "story": [
      "Russian forces intercepted more than 100 Ukrainian drones fired at almost a dozen regions of Russia, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said Tuesday, in an attack that forced all four airports around Moscow to temporarily suspend flights.",
      "Nine other regional Russian airports also temporarily stopped operating as drones struck areas along the border with Ukraine and deeper inside Russia, according to Russia\u2019s civil aviation agency, Rosaviatsia, and the Defense Ministry. It was the second straight night that the Moscow region reportedly was targeted.",
      "Two people were injured in the Kursk region, according to local Gov. Alexander Khinshtein, and some damage was reported in the Voronezh region.",
      "The Russian reports couldn\u2019t be independently verified.",
      "The drone assault comes two days ahead of a unilateral 72-hour ceasefire in the more than three-year war announced by President Vladimir Putin to coincide with celebrations in Moscow marking Victory Day in World War II.",
      "The day celebrating Moscow\u2019s defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 is Russia\u2019s biggest secular holiday when foreign dignitaries will gather in the Russian capital.",
      "Meanwhile, Russian forces overnight fired at least 20 Shahed drones at Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-0largest city near the border with Russia, injuring four people, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov wrote on Telegram.",
      "The drones started a fire at the biggest market in Kharkiv, Barabashovo, destroying and damaging around 100 market stalls, he said.",
      "Seven more civilians were injured elsewhere in the Kharkiv region by Russian glide bombs and drones, Syniehubov said.",
      "Putin last week declared a brief unilateral truce \u201con humanitarian grounds\u201d from May 8. Ukraine has called for a longer ceasefire.",
      "Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day halt in the fighting by insisting on far-reaching conditions. Ukraine has accepted it the proposal, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday at the White House that the brief truce \u201cdoesn\u2019t sound like much, but it\u2019s \u2026 a lot if you knew where we started from.\u201d",
      "Foreign leaders who have confirmed their attendance at the Victory Day festivities in Moscow include Chinese President Xi Jinping, described by Putin as \u201cour main guest.\u201d",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, another top ally whom Putin has courted, had been expected in Moscow but he canceled his trip amid tensions with Pakistan.",
      "Other guests include Slovakia\u2019s populist prime minister, Robert Fico, who has openly challenged the European Union\u2019s policies over Ukraine. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic also has accepted an invitation, his first trip to Russia since the invasion, but his attendance was uncertain after he became ill."
