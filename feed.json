      "LOS ANGELES -- Music giant Quincy Jones was laid to rest in a private ceremony in Los Angeles, a week after his death at age 91. A larger, more public memorial is also being planned.",
      "The family of the 28-time Grammy winning producer, arranger and composer said in a statement to The Associated Press that the \u201cintimate ceremony included Mr. Jones\u2019 seven children, his brother, two sisters, and immediate family members.\u201d",
      "The family did not reveal the cemetery where the ceremony took place. They added that they remain \u201cenormously grateful for the outpouring of condolences and tributes from his friends and fans from around the world. Details for a memorial celebration of Mr. Jones\u2019 life will be announced at a later date.\u201d",
      "Jones died surrounded by his family at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles on Nov. 3.",
      "His seven decades of musical mastery included producing Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller\u201d album, writing prize-winning film scores and collaborating on classic recordings with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of others.",
      "Tributes to him after his death came from some of the biggest figures in media and politics. \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which he once hosted, paid tribute to him a night before his service with a memorial photo in a quiet moment of the show.",
      "In lieu of flowers, Jones' family asks for donations to the Jazz Foundation of America."

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 10:58:23 -0500",
    "summary": "&rdquo;Those Opulent Days&rdquo; is a historical novel set in the Vietnam of the 1920s, when it was part of colonial French Indochina",
    "story": [
      "\u201dThose Opulent Days\u201d is a historical novel set in the Vietnam of the 1920s, when it was part of colonial French Indochina",
      "It\u2019s not often that a historical novel is set in the Vietnam of the 1920s, a period when the land in Indochina was occupied and exploited by French colonizers. It\u2019s also unusual that such a novel would be a whodunit murder mystery.",
      "\u201cThose Opulent Days,\u201d the debut novel of Jacquie Pham, is both \u2014 and a grim coming-of-age story as well.",
      "Pham, who grew up in Vietnam before moving to Australia, ably describes the land of her youth, its history and culture, including the well-heeled Vietnamese who were complicit in the French plunder of resources a century ago.",
      "\u201cThe French ruled the colony,\u201d she writes in the novel, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t understand its people \u2014 they needed locals, rich enough, corrupt and ambitious enough, to supply them with insight and cash.\u201d",
      "She vividly describes the Vietnamese peasants working long hours in rice paddies, bare feet in muddy water, pale yellow conical hats to block the harsh sun. \u201cThe fields were a vast, luscious green carpet,\u201d Pham writes, \u201calways filled with the fresh, intoxicating scent of young shoots.\u201d But little of this bounty went to impoverished, starving peasant families. \u201cThey would pay ground rent on a monthly basis, with hardly anything to call their own,\u201d Pham writes.",
      "As a mystery novel, \u201cThose Opulent Days\u201d is well-plotted, with a tangled web of possible outcomes. But the allure of the book\u2019s guessing-game narrative and its historical context does not carry over into a fully satisfying reading experience.",
      "The story is beset in part by a cast of vile characters and an overdose of melodramatic scenes. The French rulers and their prosperous Vietnamese collaborators, while living in regal splendor, partake of casual cruelty and horrid murders to such an extent they resemble cardboard cutouts of villains.",
      "This extends partly to the four boys whose fate growing up is at the core of the coming-of-age story. The four are Duy, Minh and Phong, sons of well-to-do families in Annam, as the region then was known, and Edmond, a French youth who met them at a boarding school. They are a mix of friends, rivals and would-be lovers. They binge on opium and alcohol. When they reach their early 20s, they near a dreaded, deadly end predicted by a fortune teller years earlier.",
      "The author understandably wants to convey the reality of the raw power held by the occupying masters over helpless underlings in the French Indochina era. But she has done so at the expense of solid storytelling.",
      "Pham is a young writer with a lot to offer. She succeeds admirably in laying out an enticing mystery, which makes for easy reading even when overwrought. And by linking it to a faded period of history, presaging the United States\u2019 own tragedy in the Vietnam War, she establishes herself as a writer to watch.",

      "Actor-director Tim Matheson takes readers behind the scenes of more than a few of his hundreds of credits in the new memoir, \u201cDamn Glad to Meet You: My Seven Decades in the Hollywood Trenches.\u201d",
      "Tim Matheson has portrayed a president and vice president. A police officer and military officer. And more than a few doctors. He's worked with Lucille Ball, Henry Fonda, Jackie Gleason, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell and Steven Spielberg. He appeared in episodes of everything from \u201cLeave to Beaver\u201d and \u201cMy Three Sons\u201d to \u201cThis is Us\u201d and \u201cCSI.\u201d",

      "Matheson transports readers to the sets of quite a few of his Hollywood gigs in the enjoyable and illuminating memoir, \u201cDamn Glad to Meet You: My Seven Decades in the Hollywood Trenches.\u201d",
      "The book's title is a nod to the recurring line Matheson delivers as Eric \u201cOtter\u201d Stratton, the Delta rush chairman in the all-time comedy, \u201cAnimal House.\"",
      "The section on the making of the classic 1978 film is almost worth the book's purchase price alone. Spoiler alert: Some of the actors who played Delta House members got up to their own hijinks while on location at the University of Oregon, the stand-in for the fictional Faber College. The description of the cast's visit to a real frat party in Eugene is a particular highlight.",
      "\u201cDamn Glad to Meet You\" isn't all fun and games, though. It features some helpful tips and tricks on acting/directing and navigating the Hollywood jungle as well as some poignant moments. Matheson recounts the time he spent with some actors/comedians who were taken too early, including John Candy, Chris Farley and Sam Kinison \u2014 plus, his \u201cAnimal House\u201d co-star John Belushi.",
      "\u201cYou came for some Belushi stories,\u201d Matheson writes. \u201cI know. He's who I'm asked about more than anyone else I've ever worked with, and I've worked with almost everyone.\u201d",
      "These days, Matheson is working north of the border, where his hit Netflix show, \u201cVirgin River,\u201d is shot.",
      "It's just the latest in a very long line of roles the native Californian has taken on in his productive and lengthy career.",
      "\u201cI've been lucky. I know that,\" Matheson writes. \u201cI've always found a place to tell a story.\u201d",
      "And now, he's telling us his stories. We should be damn glad he did.",

      "LONDON -- King Charles III led the nation Sunday in a two-minute silence in remembrance of fallen service personnel in central London as the Princess of Wales looked on, a further sign that the royal family is slowly returning to normal at the end of a year in which two of the most popular royals were sidelined by cancer.",
      "Remembrance Sunday is a totemic event in the U.K., with the monarch leading senior royals, political leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his eight living predecessors, and envoys from the Commonwealth countries in laying wreaths at the Cenotaph, the Portland stone memorial that serves as the focal point for honoring the nation\u2019s war dead.",
      "The service is held on the second Sunday of November to mark the signing of the armistice to end World War I \u201con the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\u201d in 1918. Across the U.K., services are conducted at the same time in memory of the dead.",
      "After the two-minute silence, buglers from the Royal Marines played the \u201cLast Post,\u201d and Charles led the wreath-laying part of the service.",
      "The 75-year-old king, dressed in his Royal Navy uniform of the Admiral of the Fleet, laid a wreath of poppies at the base of the Cenotaph in recognition of the fallen from conflicts dating back to World War I.",
      "His eldest son and the heir to the throne, Prince William, left his own floral tribute \u2014 featuring the Prince of Wales\u2019 feathers and a new ribbon in Welsh red.",
      "Dressed in somber black, his wife, Kate, watched on from a balcony of the nearby Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, as is tradition. Queen Camilla, who would normally be standing next to the princess, wasn't present as she recovered from a chest infection.",
      "It's the first time since the start of the year that Kate carried out two consecutive days of public official engagements. On Saturday, she attended the Royal British Legion Festival Of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "Following the wreath-laying, around 10,000 veterans, including those who have fought in wars this century, notably in Afghanistan and Iraq, marched past the Cenotaph. With the passage of time, there were only a handful of World War II veterans present.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always a great honor to be back on occasions like this, but I remember the guys that never came home on my ship when it was torpedoed,\" said 99-year-old Stan Ford, who has had to walk with leg calipers ever since the ship that he was serving on \u2014 HMS Fratton \u2014 was sunk off France's Normandy coast in August 1944 at the cost of 31 lives.",
      "\u201cThey never came home, and I always feel it\u2019s my duty to put in an appearance and thank God for those that did survive, and to pray for the ones who didn\u2019t,\" said Ford, who was one of 38 survivors.",
      "Charles\u2019 ceremonial role as commander in chief of the armed forces is a holdover from the days when the monarch led his troops into battle. But the link between the monarchy and the military is still very strong, with service members taking an oath of allegiance to the king and members of the royal family supporting service personnel through a variety of charities. Charles and William served on active duty in the military before taking up full-time royal duties.",
      "Charles was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February, forcing him to step away from public appearances for two months as he focused on his treatment and recovery. Just a few weeks later, Kate announced her own cancer diagnosis, which sidelined her for much of the year as she underwent chemotherapy.",
      "The king has been in good form in recent months and recently completed a taxing trip to Australia and Samoa. Kate, who made her first post-diagnosis public appearance during the monarch's birthday parade in June, is slowly returning to public duties.",
      "Prince William reflected this week on the strain that the cancer scare has placed on the royal family.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so proud of my wife, I\u2019m proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done,\u201d William told reporters on Thursday as he wrapped up a four-day trip to South Africa. \u201cBut from a personal family point of view, it\u2019s been, yeah, it\u2019s been brutal.\u201d",
      "While the Cenotaph was the focus of the national remembrance service, communities throughout the U.K. held their own ceremonies on Sunday.",
      "Needham-Crofton, who served with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers before a truck accident ended his military career, planned to attend a local service in Eastbourne on the south coast of England.",
      "He has spent much of his time honoring veterans and trying to help them, including 20 years as a volunteer for the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans. Like some of his army tasks, raising cash was rather grueling as it involved standing in front of London subway stations collecting coins to help fund the group\u2019s efforts.",
      "\u201cI like to respect all the veterans and do what I can for them,\" he told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s a brotherhood really. Even if you don\u2019t know a veteran that you meet, you feel a kinship toward them. That is very important to me. I shall be like that for the rest of my life.\""

    "summary": "In 2019",
    "story": [
      "In 2019",
      "An entire generation of literary-minded women has not stopped telling itself stories influenced by master storyteller Joan Didion. The same, alas, cannot be said of Eve Babitz, a Hollywood bad girl whose life briefly intersected with Didion\u2019s in the late 1960s and early \u201970s.",
      "Few writers, of course, have the stature of Didion, and Babitz does have a contingent of ardent and influential admirers. Her biggest fangirl might be Lili Anolik, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair whose 2014 article about Babitz, followed by her 2019 biography \u201cHollywood\u2019s Eve,\u201d fueled a revival of interest in her work.",
      "Now Anolik is back with a new book, \u201cDidion & Babitz,\u201d in which she explores the complicated relationship between the frenemies and declares her devotion to the less well-known of the two: \u201cI\u2019m crazy for Eve, love her with a fan\u2019s unreasoning abandon. Besides, Joan is somebody I naturally root against: I respect her work rather than like it; find her persona \u2014 part princess, part wet blanket \u2014 tough going; and resent her for siccing on us, the innocent reading public, an army, seemingly unending, of middle-class young-women personal essayists who take their feelings very ultra-seriously and expect us to do the same.\u201d",
      "The two women met in 1967 when Didion and her husband, John Gregory Dunne, were living at 7406 Franklin Avenue in Hollywood, a louche time and place that Didion immortalized in her breakout collection of nonfiction, \u201cSlouching Towards Bethlehem.\u201d",
      "In 1971, Didion helped Babitz get a story published in Rolling Stone magazine \u2014 \u201cShe is a painter, not a writer,\u201d Didion told the editor. Eventually, that led to a book deal. But their friendship fractured when Didion and Dunne were enlisted by Babitz\u2019s publisher to edit the book, which became \u201cEve\u2019s Hollywood,\u201d and Babitz bristled at their criticism. Later, she boasted to a friend, \u201cI fired Joan.\u201d",
      "Anolik makes a convincing case for Babitz\u2019s literary genius and sets up an interesting contrast between the two women\u2014 one loose, libidinous and joyfully debauched; the other shy, cerebral and tightly controlled.",
      "But don\u2019t expect the calm, organized, even-handed approach of a literary critic or biographer. In the breathless, gossipy style of the tabloids, and with frequent, winking asides to the \u201cReader,\u201d Anolik dishes dirt on all the major and minor players in their haute bohemian circle, especially Didion and Dunne. In the end, everyone ends up looking bad, including, sadly, Babitz.",

      "\u201cWe remember and are grateful for her artistry, humanity and incredible light, which inspired us all,\u201d Zunner said.",

    "story": [
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d isn\u2019t quite the prestige film that the first one, a best-picture winner, was",
      "Rome teeters on the brink in Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Its fall is said to be imminent. The dream it once symbolized is dead. The once high-minded ideals of the Roman Empire have deteriorated across a venal land now ruled by a pale-faced emperor.",
      "On the throne is Geta (Joseph Quinn), who sits alongside his sniveling brother, Caracalla (Fred Hechinger). The heart of this Rome, of course, is the Coliseum, where throngs cheer for the gladiators who fight and die. There, the ageless Scott remains remarkably at home. The arena, with its eruptions of spectacle and violence, is a stand in for the director\u2019s own vision of the big screen: Go big or go home.",
      "This dichotomy \u2014 a fallen society and its insatiable need for entertainment \u2014 is the clever and not altogether flattering backdrop of the \u201cGladiator\u201d films. Part two, set 20 years after the events of the first movie, brings a new combatant to the Coliseum \u2014 a mysterious outsider named Lucius Verus, played by Paul Mescal. And to answer the inevitable question, yes. Yes, I was quite entertained.",
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d isn\u2019t quite the prestige film the first one, a best-picture winner, was in 2001. It\u2019s more a swaggering, sword-and-sandal epic that prizes the need to entertain above all else. No one in \u201cGladiator II\u201d understands that more than Denzel Washington. His performance as the Machiavellian power broker Macrinus is a delicious blur of robes and grins \u2013 so compellingly over-the-top that he nearly reaches 1990s Al Pacino standards.",
      "Inside this Rome are scattered interests in toppling it, including Marcus Acacius, a decorated general who has just returned from a successful campaign taking Numidia in northwest Africa. (That siege makes the movie\u2019s blistering opening, with an armada racing at almost NASCAR speed toward the walled city, with towers on the bows of the boats to scale the parapets.)",
      "Acacius is a loyal Roman but, when he learns that the emperors have only more bloodlust for further territory and more war, he and his wife, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) begin plotting to overthrow the brothers.",
      "In a movie where everyone nurtures some secret, few stay hidden long. Foremost among them is Lucius Verus, a warrior in Numidia who\u2019s taken prisoner and forced to fight as a gladiator. He\u2019s the son of Lucilla and Maximus (Crowe in \u201cGladiator\u201d). Following the events of that film, Lucilla sent him, an heir to the empire, to Numidia to grow up outside of the empire\u2019s power struggles.",
      "Mescal, the terrific Irish actor of \u201cAftersun\u201d and \u201cAll of Us Strangers,\u201d smoothly steps into a blockbuster arena for the first time. \u201cThis one is interesting,\u201d says Macrinus, eyeing him for the first time. Mescal\u2019s Lucius is vengeful \u2014 the Roman army kills his warrior wife in the Numidia battle. \u201cRage pours out of you like milk,\u201d Macrinus says, admiringly. The glint of mischief in Mescal\u2019s eyes gives Lucius a little more character than your average revenge-seeking gladiator.",
      "We watch as Lucius cunningly survives arena after arena. Meanwhile, Macrinus manipulates him to steer the public\u2019s routing interest away from the emperor. It\u2019s a rich if slightly cartoonish tapestry of palace intrigue, with Macrinus deftly pulling all the strings.",
      "But, really, none of the power machinations are as compelling as the increasingly carnivalesque scenes of the Coliseum. In the gladiators' first trip there, they\u2019re greeted by man-eating monkeys. Next, it\u2019s a rider atop a giant, charging rhinoceros. Then, the piece de resistance: a flooded Coliseum festering with sharks. There are even little mock islands with palm trees spread about.",
      "Now, \u201cGladiator II\u201d may not stand up to much inquiry from historians. (Some issues were also taken with Scott\u2019s last historical epic, \u201cNapoleon,\u201d which likewise was scripted by David Scarpa). But this is not a movie built for accuracy. It\u2019s made for taking a few bits of history and inflating them into a feast and the charms of watching Washington\u2019s Macrinus brandish a head recently relieved of its body.",
      "Yes, heads do roll in Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator\u201d sequel. Macrinus succeeds in whipping Rome into a frenzy. In fact, he does it so easily and guilefully that, once things begin unraveling for him, the air leaves \u201cGladiator II.\u201d You don\u2019t quite believe his recklessness after he so patiently and artfully turned the screws.",
      "Nevertheless, two possible successors emerge \u2013 Lucius, who has a birthright to the throne, and Macrinus, who comes to within its grasp purely by his own wit. Is it any wonder that I was rooting for Macrinus, all the way? How could you not, with Washington chewing scenery like this and making zestful (and rather apt) pronouncements like: \u201cThat, my friend, is politics!\u201d",
      "\u201cGladiator II,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release. is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong bloody violence.\u201d Running time: 148 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "Ah, the Christmas movie",
      "Ah, the Christmas movie. That old chestnut. That cozy perennial pastime where \u2014 let\u2019s just pick one scene from \u201cRed One\u201d \u2014 Dwayne Johnson, playing Santa\u2019s body guard, faces off with a witch-possessed mercenary (Nick Kroll) and ice-sword-wielding CGI snowmen on the sandy beaches of Aruba. Can\u2019t you just taste the eggnog?",
      "Such are the ugly-sweater clashes of \u201cRed One,\u201d a big-budget gambit to supersize the Christmas movie. Countless movies before have wrestled with who Santa is. Does he really exist? But \u201cRed One\u201d is the first one to answer doubters with a superhero-like St. Nick who runs his North Pole operation like the army, who bench presses and counts carbs and who, given that he\u2019s played by J.K. Simmons, looks like he could teach one heck of a jazz class.",
      "There is ample time during \u201cRed One,\u201d which opens in theaters Thursday, to ponder who, exactly, put a Marvel-ized Santa on their wish list. The movie, directed by the \u201cJumanji\u201d reboot filmmaker Jake Kasdan and scripted by the veteran \u201cFast & Furious\u201d screenwriter Chris Morgan, was conceived by producer Hiram Garcia as the start of a holiday franchise for Amazon MGM Studios \u2014 presumably to satisfy those who have pined for a Christmas movie but with, you, know, more military industrial complex.",
      "\u201cRed One,\u201d which is brightened by its other A-list star, Chris Evans, is a little self-aware about its own inherent silliness. But not nearly enough. There is a better, funnier movie underneath all the CGI gloss. But overwhelmed by effects and overelaborate world building (there are trolls, ogres and a headless horsemen here, all loosely connected as mythical creatures), \u201cRed One\u201d feels like an unwanted high-priced Christmas present.",
      "\u201cI love the kids. It\u2019s the grown-ups that are killing me.\u201d",
      "So announces Callum Drift (Johnson), a long-serving security operative for Santa. He\u2019s not an elf but a member of ELF, Enforcement Logistics and Fortification. (Don\u2019t you just feel the holiday cheer welling up inside?) But after years, even centuries on the job, Callum\u2019s faith in Christmas traditions is waning. For the first time, those on the naughty list outnumber the nice. On a mall visit two days before Christmas, he looks despondently at adults bickering over presents, if not outright stealing them.",
      "Callum and other operatives with earpieces shuttle Santa (\u201cRed One\u201d in their secret service-styled lingo) in a fleet of Suburbans to his sleigh, which, while pulled by reindeer, moves more like a spaceship. Back at the North Pole \u2014 picture a sort of wintery Abu Dhabi \u2014 Santa is kidnapped. The culprits leave only spilt milk behind. The ensuing hunt, overseen by the chief of a special ops group protecting mystical beings (Lucy Liu), leads immediately to a hacker who helped an anonymous client geolocate Santa.",
      "The for-hire hacker, Jack O\u2019Malley (Evans) is a deadbeat dad to his son (Wesley Kimmel), and, we\u2019re informed, a \u201clevel-four naughty-lister.\u201d Evans might be most famous for his Captain America, but smarmy smart-aleck (like in \u201cKnives Out\u201d) is really his wheelhouse. And he gives \u201cRed One\u201d some comic energy as it transitions into a sort of buddy comedy with him and Johnson.",
      "But \u201cRed One\u201d keeps overdoing it. As they race to rescue Santa before Christmas Eve, the hunt brings in the villainous Christmas Witch, Gryla (Kiernan Shipka) and Krampus (Kristofer Hivju), here defined as Santa's brother. The sensation, with these characters and others, is of stuffing too much into an already gaudy stocking, and yet somehow forgetting to add any charm.",
      "\u201cRed One\u201d comes off a little like the holiday version of \u201cCowboys and Aliens\" \u2014 enough so to make you nostalgic for leaner tales about folkloric figures starring Johnson, like \u201cThe Tooth Fairy.\u201d But if we're to have every possible brand of Christmas movie, it seems a shame that when the phrase \u201cThe North Pole has been taken!\u201d Gerard Butler is nowhere to be seen.",
      "\u201cRed One,\u201d an Amazon MGM Studios release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for action, some violence, and language. Running time: 133 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "Is there a better writer of urban American stories than Richard Price? His resume is hart to beat: To episodes of HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Wire,\u201d and \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d and novels like \u201cClockers,\u201d \u201cLush Life,\u201d and \u201cFreedomland,\u201d fans can now add \u201cLazarus Man.\u201d",
      "The story opens with a boom, literally. A five-story tenement in East Harlem collapses, killing dozens and leaving survivors milling about in a \u201cmix of hot tar, cement dust and burning trash.\u201d Into that setting step our main characters: Royal Davis, the owner of a funeral home forced to chase after tragedies for bodies; Mary Roe, a city detective working the community affairs beat; Felix Pearl, a 20-something new to the city who\u2019s talented with a camera; and Anthony Carter, middle-aged, unemployed, and six months sober, found in the ruins days after the explosion and who becomes the novel\u2019s title character.",
      "Price\u2019s screenplay writing experience is noticeable as he hops from character to character, sometimes offering just a paragraph or two about their past and what\u2019s happening to them in the present before skipping to the next. It\u2019s jarring at times, but you fall into an easy rhythm as the pages turn. All the characters collide at one point or another following the explosion, and the novel draws you in with its authenticity.",
      "Here\u2019s Price inside Felix\u2019s head as he watches the \u201cgigantic neighborhood simpleton, Robert Cornish, aka Green Mile, aka the Rooster\u201d wandering the streets before his 80-year-old aunt comes outside to retrieve him: \u201cNot to say that his neighbors were nonstop hearts and flowers toward each other, but no one ever passed judgment on you for just being who you naturally were.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the details. too, that Price always nails. Mary, reminded of her time working an open-air morgue outside Bellevue Hospital after the 9/11 attacks: \u201c(She\u2019d) been part of an assembly line of detectives set up to collect whatever IDs they could from wallets and phones, jewelry and watches, the constant sharp snap of fingers being broken in order to remove rings still with her after all these years.\u201d",
      "The book is more of a tapestry than any traditional storytelling structure. There\u2019s no great mystery to solve besides how Anthony survived the explosion, and even when the truth is revealed, most readers will have known it long before. Price\u2019s overarching message is a simple one amid the hard-luck stories: People want someone to root for them. Or as Anthony, aka Lazarus Man, tells a crowd at a community event following another death on the streets outside the projects: \u201cWho here, not just in these houses, but anywhere in the world young hearts need to be nurtured and protected, couldn\u2019t use a helping hand?\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d has been no blockbuster in North American theaters. But in a lethargic fall moviegoing season, even a so-so performing superhero sequel can rule the box office for three straight weeks.",
      "For the third weekend in a row, \u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d was the No. 1 movie at the box office, collecting $16.2 million in ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday. It fended off a pair of new challengers in the Hugh Grant horror thriller \u201cHeretic\u201d and the feel-good holiday movie \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever.\u201d",
      "With the election on Tuesday, the major studios opted not to put any new releases into theaters. That allowed Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\u201d the third entry in the Tom Hardy-led franchise, to hold its position.",
      "While \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d hasn\u2019t been a huge hit domestically \u2014 opening below expectations in late October \u2014 it has thrived overseas, grossing almost triple what it has in North America. The \u201cVenom\u201d sequel has grossed $279.4 million internationally, bringing its global total to $394.2 million.",
      "\u201cHeretic\u201d and \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever\u201d were neck and neck for second place. Counting only Friday-Sunday ticket sales, the edge went to \u201cHeretic,\u201d which debuted with $11 million. \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever,\u201d though, factored in $2.2 million in sneak-peak screenings from last weekend to claim a reported opening gross of $11.1 million.",
      "A24\u2019s \u201cHeretic,\u201d directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, follows two Mormon missionaries (Sophie Thatcher and Chloe East) who knock on the door of a man (Grant) they\u2019ll regret trying to evangelize to. Though \u201cHeretic\u201d has been critically acclaimed for the darkest turn yet by Grant, audiences were less impressed, giving it a \u201cC+\u201d CinemaScore. Regardless, with a budget under $10 million, \u201cHeretic\u201d will easily turn a profit.",
      "\u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever,\u201d released by Lionsgate and Kingdom Story Company, which specializes in Christian entertainment, is about six siblings with a bad reputation who take over the local church pageant. The film, an adaptation of Barbara Robinson\u2019s 1972 children\u2019s book directed by Dallas Jenkins, did well with audiences, who gave it a \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore. It, too, was modestly budgeted at about $10 million.",
      "In its seventh week of release, Universal and DreamWorks Animation\u2019s \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d continues to show little rust in theaters. It landed in fourth place with $6.6 million, bringing its domestic haul to $130.2 million and its worldwide gross to $292 million.",
      "Sean Baker\u2019s acclaimed \u201cAnora,\u201d starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn sex worker, expanded into wide release. The Neon film, an expected best-picture contender, collected $2.4 million in 1,104 theaters. Its four-week total stands at $7.2 million.",
      "The papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d starring Ralph Fiennes, continues to perform exceptionally well for an adult-oriented drama. The Focus Features release, in its third weekend of release, added 487 theaters and dipped a modest 19% to earn $4.1 million. It has collected $21.5 million. Similarly, A24\u2019s \u201cWe Live in Time,\u201d starring Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh, has stayed strong, grossing $2.2 million in its fifth weekend for a $21.8 million total.",
      "Overall ticket sales, though, remain sluggish. Box office is running about 11% behind last year, according to Comscore. In the last two weeks, overall ticket sales are down about 50% from the pre-pandemic average, according to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment.",
      "The good news for theaters: The next few weeks are lined up for several big new releases, including the Amazon MGM Christmas comedy \u201cRed One\u201d (Nov. 15), Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cGladiator II\u201d (Nov. 22), Universal\u2019s \u201cWicked\u201d (also Nov. 22) and the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cMoana 2\u201d (Nov. 27).",

Instead of linking to Universal Pictures' official WickedMovie.com page, the website listed leads to an adult film site that requires consumers to be over 18 to enter.",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Mattel said it was \u201cmade aware of a misprint on the packaging of the Mattel Wicked collection dolls,\" which it said are primarily sold in the U.S. \u201cWe deeply regret this unfortunate error and are taking immediate action to remedy this,\u201d the company added.",

      "In the meantime, the company is advising consumers who already have the dolls to discard their packaging or obscure the link \u2014 and contact Mattel's customer service for more information.",
      "Mattel unveiled its special \u201cWicked\u201d collection earlier this year. Back in July, a promotion shared on Instagram showed Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, who star as Elphaba and Glinda in Universal Pictures' upcoming film, seeing the line's singing dolls for the first time.",
      "The beloved Broadway musical has been split into two parts for its movie adaptation. The first chapter of \u201cWicked\u201d will hit theaters on Nov. 22, with part two set for a fall 2025 release."

      "NEW YORK -- There are few images more indelible in the history of American dance: Judith Jamison, regal and passionate in white leotard and long ruffled skirt, punching the air in \u201cCry\" \u2014 Alvin Ailey\u2019s piercing solo about Black womanhood.",
      "That searing 1971 piece made her an international star. But it was truly only the beginning of Jamison\u2019s decades-long career atop modern dance, onstage and off. As Ailey\u2019s hand-picked successor beginning in 1989, she led his namesake company for more than 20 years, helping it become the most successful modern dance troupe in the nation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Jamison, who died Saturday at 81 after a brief illness, reflected in an interview with The Associated Press in 2018, marking the company\u2019s then-60th anniversary. \u201cI find it remarkable that we still exist today,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think Mr. Ailey would be absolutely beside-himself happy, that something he started 60 years ago could blossom into everything he imagined.\u201d",
      "And likely much more. Jamison brought the company not only continued global exposure and crossover cultural appeal but economic stability and growth, putting it in \u201ca stratosphere that Ailey couldn\u2019t even imagine,\u201d said Wendy Perron, author and former longtime editor of Dance Magazine.",
      "Perron attributes Jamison\u2019s success, in a world when many dance companies struggle to survive, to her unique personality and ability to forge relationships. \u201cThere was a warmth and magnetism about her \u2014 everyone wanted to be with her,\u201d said Perron. \u201cThere was a light shining around her.\u201d",
      "Taking the reins as artistic director upon Ailey\u2019s death at 58, Jamison introduced new works and choreography, but also made sure to keep front and center her predecessor's undisputed masterpiece: \u201cRevelations,\u201d a 1960 classic that has defined the company and powered its success like few others, if any, in the history of dance.",
      "It was in \u201cRevelations,\u201d a telling of Black history through spirituals and blues, that Jamison also made a mark as a dancer, holding a white parasol with one arm as she undulated the rest of her body in a baptismal scene \u2013 \u201cthe umbrella woman,\u201d as the part became known.",
      "To this day, \u201cRevelations\u201d appears on most of the company\u2019s programs, at home in New York and on tour, and is referred to as the most-seen work of modern dance. (It's hard to conceive of anything comparable.) \u201cRevelations\u201d was even performed at the White House, at a dance event hosted by Michelle Obama in 2010, in which the first lady paid tribute to Jamison, calling her \u201can amazing, phenomenal, \u2018fly\u2019 woman.\u201d",
      "Obama also told Jamison from the stage that a photo of her in \u201cCry\u201d had been \u201cthe only piece of art\u201d in the Obamas' home before the White House, and that her daughters, Malia and Sasha, had asked her: \u201cIs that the lady in the picture?\u201d",
      "A year later, retiring as artistic director, Jamison exclaimed to a cheering crowd at New York City Center gathered to honor her: \u201cI have come a long way from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania!\u201d That\u2019s where Jamison was born in 1943 and raised, her childhood spent training in various dance forms, including ballet, modern and tap.",
      "\u201cI knew I had so much energy back then \u2013 just too much for everybody,\u201d she quipped in a 2023 podcast interview. \u201cBut my parents went, \u2018OK, lets direct her this way.\u2019\u201d She credited her mother\u2019s dedication \u2014 she made her daughter\u2019s costumes, and \u201cwould massage my legs when I got home from class.\u201d",
      "In 1964, famed choreographer Agnes de Mille had seen Jamison in a class and brought her to New York to participate in a production of American Ballet Theatre. Soon after, the young dancer went to an audition for a TV special \u2014 and flubbed it, she said. But Ailey was there, and she soon was invited to join his fledgling company.",
      "She wasn\u2019t sure what he saw in her, she has said, other than a look: \u201cSmall head, broad shoulders, long arms and long legs.\u201d",
      "With the young company, Jamison traveled to Europe and Africa. Even then, it took her a few years to appreciate that this could be a career. Partly this was because, as she noted in the 2023 podcast, \u201cWe were getting paid doodly-squat\u201d \u2013 envelopes that sometimes contained a $20 bill, and sometimes just a thank-you note.",
      "But she soon realized that she loved dancing, traveling and being around other dancers. The Ailey troupe was also a rare outlet at the time for Black talent. \u201cThere were no outlets,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no place for us to say, \"Hey look, this is our artistry, this is our culture, and guess what else we can do?\u201d",
      "Ailey chose Jamison for \u201cCry\u201d in 1971, a work he dedicated to Black women everywhere, but especially mothers. On opening night, Jamison has said, she didn\u2019t know if she was going to make it though the demanding, 16-minute solo.",
      "She told the Hollywood Reporter that \u201cwhen the curtain went down, I was on the floor.\u201d She got up to take a bow, \u201cand I kept taking bows over and over until I don\u2019t know which number it was, but they were still screaming and yelling.\u201d",
      "Over the next two decades, Jamison often appeared as a guest artist with companies around the world, and left the Ailey troupe in 1980 to star on Broadway in \u201cSophisticated Ladies.\" She also formed her own company, The Jamison Project.",
      "Then an ailing Ailey told her he\u2019d like her to run the company after him.",
      "Jamison recalled, in the AP interview in 2018, being present as Ailey died, along with fellow dancer Sylvia Waters and Ailey\u2019s mother.",
      "\u201cWe were in his room as he passed, and usually you see in movies, that people have their last breath and they breathe out. But Mr. Ailey breathed IN. We expected him to breathe out, and he didn\u2019t. So I think what we\u2019re living on now, is his breath OUT ... that air, that vision, that dream.\u201d",
      "Among her many laurels, Jamison was awarded Kennedy Center Honors in 1999 and a National Medal of the Arts in 2001.",
      "Perron, the former Dance Magazine editor, said she felt Jamison had been overlooked somewhat as a choreographer. She pointed to \u201cA Case of You\u201d \u2014 a duet to Diana Krall\u2019s version of the Joni Mitchell classic and part of Jamison\u2019s 2005 \u201cReminiscin.'\" The duet, Perron said, was \u201chappy and sad and passionate and inventive .. you really believe these people are passionately in love.\u201d",
      "Jamison passed the artistic director baton to choreographer Robert Battle in 2011. Looking back, she has said one of her proudest moments at the company was the creation of the Joan Weill Center for Dance in 2005, a midtown Manhattan home for the company.",
      "\u201cMajestic\u201d and \u201cqueenly\u201d is how Waters, now Ailey II Artistic Director Emerita, described her late colleague.",
      "\u201cShe was a unique, spectacular dancer,\" Waters said. \u201cTo dance with her and to be in her sphere of energy was mesmerizing.\"",

      "LONDON -- A children's book written by British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has been withdrawn from sale after it was criticized for causing offense to Indigenous Australians.",
      "The Guardian newspaper reported Saturday that the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Corporation blasted \u201cBilly And The Epic Escape,\u201d which was published earlier this year, for employing a series of tropes and stereotypes about Indigenous Australians, including their relationships with the natural and spiritual worlds.",
      "The group criticized one of the fantasy novel's subplots, which tells the story of an Indigenous girl living in foster care, for contributing to the \u201cerasure, trivialisation, and stereotyping of First Nations peoples and experiences.\"",
      "In a statement, Oliver, 49, said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d to have caused offense and apologized \u201cwholeheartedly.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was never my intention to misinterpret this deeply painful issue,\" he said. \"Together with my publishers we have decided to withdraw the book from sale.\u201d",
      "Indigenous campaigners were particularly aghast that neither Oliver nor his publishers, Penguin Random House, had consulted with them before the novel was published.",
      "\u201cIt is clear that our publishing standards fell short on this occasion, and we must learn from that and take decisive action,\u201d the publisher said. \"With that in mind, we have agreed with our author, Jamie Oliver, that we will be withdrawing the book from sale.\u201d",
      "Oliver, who is in Australia promoting his latest recipe book, is among a long list of celebrities to have put their names to children's books, a trend that has been criticized by many children's authors, who say they are being crowded out of their market.",
      "Oliver released his first children\u2019s book, \u201cBilly And The Giant Adventure,\u201d last year and said in a social media post that he had \u201ccarefully chosen the font to make sure the text is as clear as possible\u201d as dyslexic people like himself can find it hard to read.",

      "NEW YORK -- Latin music has taken the world by storm, sparking industry conversations for the past few years. Across platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, numbers have skyrocketed, making it the fastest growing streaming genre in the United States.",
      "The Latin Grammy Awards, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, has worked to recognize and promote Latin music worldwide. This year, the Latin Recording Academy brings its star-studded celebration to Miami, the heart of Latin culture in the U.S., where they are headquartered. Here is what to know:",
      "The 25th Annual Latin Grammy Awards will take place Nov. 14 at the Kaseya Center in Miami. It will air live on Univision, UniM\u00e1s, Galavisi\u00f3n and ViX beginning at 8 p.m. EST.",
      "For the second consecutive year, producer and songwriter \u00c9dgar Barrera leads the nominations. Known for his work with artists like Madonna, Karol G, Peso Pluma, Shakira and Grupo Frontera \u2014 Barrera is up for nine awards. Last year he received 13 nominations and won three.",
      "Close behind him are some of his collaborators, reggaet\u00f3n superstars Karol G and Bad Bunny, who are tied with eight nominations each.",
      "Performers at this year's bash include Barrera, Residente, Myke Towers, DJ Khaled, Jon Bon Jovi, Joe Jonas, Anitta, Becky G, Eladio Carri\u00f3n, Grupo Frontera, Kali Uchis, Pitbull, Luis Fonsi, Juan Luis Guerra, Car\u00edn Le\u00f3n and more.",
      "Colombian singer Carlos Vives, the recipient of the 2024 Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year, will also perform.",
      "There are also two new categories this year: best Latin electronic music performance, housed within the new electronic music field, and best contemporary Mexican music album.",
      "Latin Recording Academy CEO Manuel Abud likens the Recording Academy \u2014 the governing body behind the Grammys \u2014 and the Latin Recording Academy to sister organizations.",
      "\u201cOr maybe even mother and daughter,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThe basis is the same: We are membership-based organizations for music creators and music professionals. So, we\u2019re celebrating musical excellence. We have the exact DNA. Our entire process is a Grammy process.\"",
      "While the Grammys focus on the U.S. market, he says, the Latin Grammys have different global considerations. \"Our voting process is, I would say, identical, but it has some adjustments for the international component that we have that they don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "He adds that artists can be dual members of the Recording Academy and the Latin Recording Academy, if they are Latin artists based in the U.S.",
      "The trophies themselves are also very similar: Both are gramophone-shaped, but the base of a Latin Grammy is burgundy, while the Grammys' is black.",
      "\"We are a licensee of the Recording Academy,\u201d said Abud. \u201cThe Recording Academy has four members on my board, including their chair and their CEO.\u201d",
      "In the late \u201990s and early \u201900s, Latin artists had success when they \u201ccrossed over\u201d and performed in English: \u201cThe Ricky Martins and the Gloria Estefans,\u201d as Abud describes them. But today, he said, artists are singing in Spanish. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to do the crossover.\u201d",
      "And even more noteworthy: English-speaking artists now want to work with Spanish-speaking artists in their native language.",
      "Gabriel Abaroa Jr., the Latin Recording Academy's former president and CEO (2003-2021) and current president emeritus agrees.",
      "He traces the story of the Latin Grammys to 1997, when the Recording Academy started paying closer attention to Latin music. That same year, the Latin Recording Academy was established to celebrate the diverse musical landscape of Latin music in Latin America, Spain, Brazil, Portugal and beyond \u2014 not just the artists breaking through in the U.S.",
      "The inaugural Latin Grammy Awards were held in Los Angeles in 2000, followed by shows in Miami, New York City, Houston, Seville, Spain and Las Vegas.",
      "Initially, the awards ceremony was broadcast in English, a decision that proved to be a misstep. \u201cAsking our talent to communicate in English was pretty bad,\u201d recalls Abaroa Jr. \u201cThe artists didn\u2019t want to (participate) because they felt that we were disrespecting them by making them speak in a language other than theirs.\"",
      "The worst part, he said, was that even the Mexican audience, which \u201ccomprised 75% of the market at the time,\u201d didn't turn on the TV to watch the show because \"they hated to see it in English.\u201d",
      "In response, the Latin Grammys transitioned to Spanish-language broadcasts in 2005, a transformative decision for its audience \u2014 and one that directly reflects the ways in which Latin music would be enjoyed in the years to come.",
      "The Latin Grammys will continue its global expansion by holding future awards shows in various international locations.",
      "Last year, the 2023 Latin Grammys were held in Seville, Spain, marking the first time the show took place outside the U.S.",
      "The move, facilitated by a nearly 19 million-euro deal between the government of Andalusia and the Latin Recording Academy, sparked some controversy, with some criticizing the Latin Grammys decision to hold the show in the very European country that colonized much of Latin America.",
      "Both Abud and Abaroa Jr. consider the Seville event a great success.",
      "\u201cIn the next couple of years, you will see another international edition of the Latin Grammys,\u201d said Abud.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Welcome toBeyonc\u00e9 country. When it comes to the 2025 Grammy Award nominations, \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d rules the nation. She leads the nods with 11, bringing her career total to 99 nominations. That makes her the most nominated artist in Grammy history.",
      "\u201cCowboy Carter\u201d is up for album and country album of the year, and \u201cTexas Hold \u2019Em\u201d is nominated for record, song and country song of the year. She also received nominations in a wide swath of genres, including pop, country, Americana and melodic rap performance categories.",
      "This is her first time receiving nominations in the country and Americana categories. Previously, she and her husband Jay-Z were tied for most career nominations, at 88.",
      "If Beyonc\u00e9 wins the album of the year, she\u2019ll become the first Black woman to do so in the 21st century. Lauryn Hill last won in 1999 for \u201cThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,\u201d joining Natalie Cole and Whitney Houston as the only Black women to take home the Grammys\u2019 top prize.",
      "Post Malone also received his first ever nominations in the country categories this year, having released his debut country album \u201cF-1 Trillion\" in August. That one is up for country album and \u201cI Had Some Help,\u201d his collaboration with Morgan Wallen, is nominated for country song and country duo/group performance. They are Wallen\u2019s first ever Grammy nominations.",
      "Malone is just behind Beyonc\u00e9, with seven nominations, tied with Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Charli XCX, who earned her first nominations as a solo artist.",
      "Lamar\u2019s ubiquitous diss track released during his feud with Drake, \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d is nominated for record and song of the year, rap song, music video as well as best rap performance. He has two simultaneous entries in the latter category, a career first: Future & Metro Boomin featuring Lamar, \u201cLike That\u201d is up for best rap performance and best rap song.",
      "This is his third time receiving two simultaneous nominations for best rap song.",
      "Taylor Swift and first-time nominees Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan boast of six nominations each.",
      "Last year, women artists dominated the major categories. This year, that continues somewhat, but the main trend seems to be a variance of genre. In the album of the year category, alongside \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d is Andr\u00e9 3000\u2019s new age, alt-jazz \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d and multi-instrumentalist Jacob Collier\u2019s \u201cDjesse Vol. 4.\u201d Rising pop stars Carpenter and Roan round it out, with \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d and \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\u201d respectively, as well as Swift\u2019s \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d Eilish\u2019s \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d and Charli XCX\u2019s rave-ready \u201cBRAT.\u201d",
      "Eilish is the only artist to have her first three albums become nominated for album of the year.",
      "Last year, Swift won album of the year for \u201cMidnights,\u201d breaking the record for most wins in the category with four. This year, she becomes the first ever woman to seven career nominations in the category.",
      "\u201cThe breadth and the variety of genres represented in the general field feels new and really exciting,\u201d says the Recording Academy CEO and President Harvey Mason jr. He credits an active and evolving voting body for its success. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very intentional in how we looked at and tried to rebalance our membership. So not just gender or people of color, different racial makeup, but also genre equity and trying to make sure that all different types of music in different regions and different locations are being represented in every way possible.\u201d",
      "Only recordings commercially released in the U.S. between Sept. 16, 2023 through Aug. 30, 2024 were eligible for nominations. The final round of Grammy voting, which determines its winners, will take place Dec. 12 through January 3.",
      "In the best new artist category, Carpenter and Roan will go head-to-head, alongside Benson Boone, Doechii, Khruangbin, RAYE, Shaboozey and Teddy Swims.",
      "In the song of the year category, Beyonc\u00e9 is joined by Eilish with \u201cBirds of a Feather,\u201d Swift and Post Malone with \u201cFortnight,\u201d Roan\u2019s \u201cGood Luck, Babe!\u201d, Carpenter\u2019s \u201cPlease Please Please,\u201d Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201cDie With A Smile,\u201d and Shaboozey\u2019s \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy).\u201d",
      "Shaboozey is also a first-time nominee. His \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy)\u201d is the biggest song of the year, having spent more weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 than any other \u2014 it is so popular, a remix of the track is also up for remixed recording.",
      "Elsewhere, Shaboozey is nominated in the melodic rap performance category for his feature on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSPAGHETTII.\u201d Linda Martell, the first commercially-successful Black woman musician in country, is also featured on the song, delivering the 83-year-old artist her first Grammy nomination.",
      "For record of the year, \u201cTexas Hold \u2019Em\u201d will compete against Swift and Post Malone\u2019s \u201cFortnight,\u201d Eilish\u2019s \u201cBirds of a Father,\u201d Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d Roan\u2019s \u201cGood Luck, Babe!\u201d, Carpenter\u2019s \u201cEspresso,\u201d Charli XCX\u2019s \u201c360,\u201d and the Beatles last new song, the AI-assisted \u201cNow and Then.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure we\u2019re keeping up with how music creators and our community are using technology. And in this case, AI enhanced the record and allowed it to be eligible in the categories that it was eligible in,\u201d Mason jr explains.",
      "Dolly Parton scored her 55th career nomination in the audio book, narration, and storytelling recording category for her \u201cBehind the Seams: My Life in Rhinestones,\u201d news The Associated Press broke to the country music legend Friday morning. \u201cNo! What did I get nominated for?\u201d she cheered over the phone. \"Oh, well, that's cool. I thought it would be for my rock album, I'd take it.",
      "\u201cIt feels good. I\u2019m always appreciative of everything. I don\u2019t work for that, but it\u2019s always good to say \u2018you\u2019ve done good work,' and for somebody to acknowledge that. So, I\u2019m always proud of every award I get and every mention I get. That just makes me feel like I\u2019m doing the right thing.\u201d",
      "She's up against producer Guy Oldfield, George Clinton, Barbra Streisand and Jimmy Carter, who could become the oldest Grammy award winner in history at 100.",
      "So, what\u2019s missing? Like last year, there\u2019s a huge dearth of Latin music \u2014 the fastest growing streaming genre in the United States \u2014 across the board, and no representation in the major categories. There are also only four entries in the best M\u00fasica Mexicana album category, despite it also being one of the fastest growing genres.",
      "And K-pop, too, seems to be absent. There are no nominations for the BTS members who\u2019ve released solo material this year: RM\u2019s \u201cRight Place, Wrong Person,\u201d J-Hope\u2019s \u201cHope on the Street, Vol. 1,\u201d and Jimin\u2019s \u201cMuse.\u201d As a boy band, BTS has received five nominations across their career.",
      "\u201cI definitely see room for improvement across many genres and we are continuing to invite people to be a part of the academy,\u201d Mason jr. says. \u201cWithout the right representation we don\u2019t get the right results. When I say right, I mean reflective and representative of what\u2019s happening in music today. So, the work continues.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- It looks like the 2025 Grammy Awards may be a different kind of award show. Beyonc\u00e9 leads the nods with 11, bringing her career total to a record-breaking 99 nominations. There's an incredible diversity of genres represented across the major categories, and women continue to succeed. So... who didn\u2019t make the cut? What were the best surprises of all? Let\u2019s take a look.",
      "Country music has bled into other prominent genres and the Recording Academy has taken note. Country hybridists \u2014 like Beyonc\u00e9, Post Malone and first-time nominee Shaboozey \u2014 lead many nominations, in country and beyond.",
      "But that means the traditionalists might not see rewards: CMA Awards favorites Cody Johnson\u2019s \u201cLeather\u201d and Luke Combs\u2019 \u201cFathers & Sons\u201d didn\u2019t see any nominations. The latter shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise: Comb\u2019s blockbuster cover of Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cFast Car\u201d wasn\u2019t nominated for record of the year at the Grammys in 2024, either \u2013 though it did land a nod in best country solo performance.",
      "This year also marks Malone and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first-ever nominations in the country categories.",
      "Who saw this one coming? The Beatles last new song, the AI-assisted \u201cNow and Then,\" is up for record of the year. Released in 2023, the song utilized artificial intelligence to extract John Lennon\u2019s voice from an old demo. It's the same technology used to separate the Beatles\u2019 voices from background sounds during the making of director Peter Jackson\u2019s 2021 documentary series, \u201cThe Beatles: Get Back.\u201d",
      "Last summer, the Recording Academy announced a series of changes to the Grammy Awards, including new protocols involving technological advancements in machine learning. It sparked headlines: \u201cOnly human creators\u201d could win the music industry\u2019s highest honor in a decision aimed at the use of artificial intelligence in popular music. At the 2025 Grammys, clearly, those changes are in action.",
      "Last year's album of the year category was dominated by pop women \u2014 and that continues, with Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX's rave-ready approach to the genre receiving noms. The latter is a nice surprise (more on that below), but the two men nominated are creative outliers. OutKast frontman Andr\u00e9 3000's experimental jazz-flute album \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d is a contender, as well as Jacob Collier's \u201cDjesse Vol. 4,\u201d though that one may fulfill a space left vacant by Jon Batiste.",
      "Charli XCX, having never received a solo artist nomination at the Grammys, is up for seven awards at the 2025 ceremony. Those include record and album of the year, as well as pop solo and pop duo/group performance, pop dance recording, dance/electronic album and music video. Clearly, her culture-shifting \u201cBRAT\u201d album \u2014 and the summer of memes it inspired \u2014 has continued to hold real influence.",
      "There is no shortage of first-time nominees this year. Some were expected \u2014 like Roan, Carpenter and Shaboozey \u2014 others less so. Willow Smith has received her first nomination in the arrangement, instruments and vocals category for arranging her song \u201cb i g f e e l i n g s.\u201d Linda Martell, the first commercially successful Black woman musician in country, is featured alongside Shaboozey on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSPAGHETTII,\" which is up for the melodic rap performance category. That delivers the progenitor her first-ever Grammy nomination at age 83.",
      "And lastly, Morgan Wallen \u2014 undoubtedly one of the most popular musicians in the country, and one rife with controversy \u2014 has received his first two Grammy nominations for his feature on Malone's \u201cI Had Some Help.\u201d Last year, his song \u201cLast Night\u201d was nominated for best country song, but that is a songwriter\u2019s award, and Wallen did not receive a nod.",
      "In the past, the country singer has been absent from nominations. In 2021, after video surfaced of him using a racial slur, he was disqualified or limited from several award shows and received no Grammy nominations for his bestselling \u201cDangerous: The Double Album.\u201d",
      "Just like last year, Latin music is missing from the top categories at the 2025 Grammys, despite a surplus of eligible talent: Peso Pluma\u2019s \u201c\u00c9xodo,\" Shakira\u2019s \u201cLas Mujeres Ya No Lloran,\u201d Residente, \u201cLas Letras Ya No Importan,\" Car\u00edn Le\u00f3n's \u201cBoca Chueca, Vol. 1\u201d and Bad Bunny's \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d among them.",
      "Same as above: K-pop, too, seems to be absent. There are no nominations for the BTS members who\u2019ve released solo material this year: RM\u2019s \u201cRight Place, Wrong Person,\u201d J-Hope\u2019s \u201cHope on the Street, Vol. 1,\u201d and Jimin\u2019s \u201cMuse.\u201d As a boy band, BTS has received five nominations across its career.",
      "Despite being one of the great global superstars of the current moment \u2014 regularly celebrated as one of the most streamed artists on the planet \u2014 Bad Bunny's \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d received only one nomination, for m\u00fasica urbana album.",
      "And Usher, who had a blockbuster year \u2014 including a star-studded Super Bowl halftime show \u2014 also received only one nomination, for R&B album.",
      "In pop, Dua Lipa's \u201cEternal Optimism\" is nowhere to be seen. In country, best new artist hopeful Megan Moroney received no nominations. In R&B, Normani's long-awaited debut album, \u201cDopamine,\u201d failed to make waves with voters, and in rap, Nicki Minaj's \u201cPink Friday 2\u201d and Megan Thee Stallion's \u201cMegan\u201d are absent.",
      "Last year, Jack Antonoff took home producer of the year, non-classical for a third year in a row, tying Babyface as the only other producer to do so consecutively. This year, he didn't receive a nod in that category \u2014 one he has held a place in since 2019. Who will take the mantle?",

      "LONDON -- A father and daughter crippled by a suicide bomber who killed 22 people after an Ariana Grande concert in England in 2017 were awarded 45,000 pounds ($58,000) Friday in a case against a former television producer who claimed the tragedy was a hoax.",
      "Martin Hibbert and his daughter, Eve, won their harassment suit in the High Court in London last month against Richard Hall for videos, a film and a book he produced that falsely claim the Manchester Arena bombing was staged using actors and no one was wounded or killed.",
      "Hall, an independent producer, had claimed \u201cmillions of people have bought a lie\u201d about the attack and defended his work, including surreptitiously filming the daughter, as journalism in the public's interest.",
      "Justice Karen Steyn called Hall\u2019s conduct a \u201cnegligent, indeed reckless, abuse of media freedom.\" She said he used the \u201cflimsiest of analytical techniques\u201d to dismiss \"the obvious, tragic reality to which so many ordinary people have attested.\u201d",
      "Salman Abedi blew himself up with a bomb hidden in a knapsack as fans were leaving the Grande concert on May 22, 2017. In addition to those killed, more than 260 people were wounded and hundreds of others were left with \u201cdeep psychological injuries,\u201d police said.",
      "Martin Hibbert was paralyzed from the waist down and his daughter, who was 14 at the time, nearly died and has severe brain damage.",
      "The Hibbert's also won an injunction preventing Hall from further harassment, and Hall will have to pay 90% of their legal costs that are currently estimated at 260,000 pounds ($335,000).",
      "The award, however, is meager compared to many won in U.S. lawsuits. In a case that also involved denying a major tragedy, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was ordered to pay $1.5 billion to parents of children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012 for falsely claiming it was a hoax.",
      "Martin Hibbert said that he never expects to see a penny of the award, but the victory wasn't about money.",

      "KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- After working at a crowded and dangerous internment camp in Iraq, Air Force Staff Sgt. Heather O'Brien brought home with her anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "A bouncy labradoodle and a Kansas City-area program helped her get back on her feet.",
      "Dogs 4 Valor, operated through the Olathe, Kansas-based organization called The Battle Within, helps retired veterans and first responders work with their service dogs to help manage depression, anxiety and other challenges.",
      "\u201cA lot of times the veteran with severe PTSD is homebound,\u201d said Sandra Sindeldecker, program manager for Dogs 4 Valor. \u201cThey\u2019re isolated. They\u2019re very nervous. They won\u2019t make eye contact. Some won\u2019t leave the house at all.\u201d",
      "The program involves both group and one-on-one training. The goal is to get the veteran and the dog comfortable with each other and understanding each other. The group takes outings to help the veterans regain their footing in public places like airports. Program leaders also provide mental health therapy at no cost.",
      "The veterans and dogs graduate in six to nine months, but group gatherings continue.",
      "There is growing evidence of the value of service dogs for veterans with PTSD. A small study published in JAMA Network Open in June looked at a program operated by K9s For Warriors. Service dogs in the program are taught to pick up a veteran\u2019s physical signs of distress and can interrupt panic attacks and nightmares with a loving nudge.",
      "Researchers compared 81 veterans who received service dogs with 75 veterans on the waiting list for a trained dog. After three months, PTSD symptoms improved in both groups, but the veterans with dogs saw a bigger improvement on average.",
      "O'Brien, 40, recalled that the camp where she worked in Iraq sometimes had over 20,000 detainees. Violence and rioting were common and it left her with severe anxiety.",
      "\u201cWhen I got out of the military, I just assumed that you\u2019re supposed to be on edge all the time as a veteran,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "O\u2019Brien\u2019s mother spotted the frisky lab-poodle mix on Facebook and convinced her daughter to adopt the dog she named Albus. Months later, O'Brien learned about Dogs 4 Valor, and the pair joined the program in October 2023.",
      "O\u2019Brien says she can now go out in public again \u2014 she even went on vacation to Branson, Missouri, \u201cthings that I never would have thought I would do really, probably ever again.\u201d",
      "Mark Atkinson, 38, served in Afghanistan as a corporal in the Marine Corps. He returned home with PTSD and major depressive disorder, causing sleeplessness and anxiety. He adopted Lexi, now 5, in 2020.",
      "Lexi, a muscular cane corso breed, needed Atkinson as much as he needed her. Her previous owner had kept Lexi in chains before surrendering her. Since joining Dogs 4 Valor, the two can get out together and enjoy life.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really like leaving the house because I\u2019m safe there, you know?\" Atkinson said. \u201cAnd having Lexi has just made me get out to be more social.\u201d",
      "Having a group of fellow veterans facing the same challenges has also helped, Atkinson said.",
      "\u201cWe come from the same backgrounds, different branches,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cSame issues. You know, PTSD or traumatic brain injuries. And they\u2019re all very welcoming, as well. There\u2019s no judgment.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Brien compared living with Albus to a relationship with a sometimes pushy best friend who often wants to go out.",
      "\u201cThe best friend constantly wants to make you do things that make you nervous,\u201d O\u2019Brien laughed, acknowledging that it is ultimately up to her.",
      "\u201cI have to decide to walk out and just deal with life,\" O'Brien said. \"And so that has been hard. And it still is hard from time to time, but it\u2019s it\u2019s getting manageable.\u201d",
      "Some veterans said their family relationships have improved since they started the program.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m able to talk, not fly off the handle and just get along with people and not be as stressed, not have as much anxiety,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cOr even if I do, she (Lexi) is right there with me.\u201d",
      "Timothy Siebenmorgen, 61, said his relationships also are better with help from his 1-year-old American bulldog, Rosie, and Dogs 4 Valor, which he joined in July. He served in both the Marines and the Army, deploying 18 times.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re in the military, kind of taught not to show weakness,\" Siebenmorgen said. \"So you figure you can tackle everything yourself and you honestly believe that. And then you realize you can\u2019t do it on your own.\u201d",
      "Veterans said the dogs, and the program, have given them new hope and a renewed ability to move forward.",

      "LONDON -- Cases of mpox in the region of Congo where a new and more infectious variant was first detected appear to be \u201cplateauing,\u201d the World Health Organization said on Monday, even as the virus continues to increase in other areas of the country, as well as in Burundi and Uganda.",
      "A report by the U.N. health agency said the number of mpox infections \u201cshows a general rising trend,\u201d but that they may have plateaued in South Kivu, where the more infectious form of mpox was first identified to be spreading earlier this year among sex workers and miners in the gold mining town of Kamituga.",
      "WHO acknowledged that testing is still not widespread, making it difficult to understand how exactly the virus is spreading.",
      "According to data from last week, Congo reported fewer than 100 laboratory-confirmed mpox cases, down from nearly 400 in July. In recent weeks, experts say that infections appear to be stabilizing, offering a chance for health authorities to definitively stamp out the outbreak.",
      "So far, about 50,000 people in Congo have been immunized against mpox. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 3 million vaccines are needed to stop the outbreak.",
      "Last week, Africa CDC's director Dr. Jean Kaseya said the continent was \u201cstill in the acute phase\u201d of the mpox epidemic, with 19 countries affected. He warned that without more resources, the virus could become a global threat.",
      "WHO said the Burundi outbreak is also being driven by the newer variant, which causes less severe symptoms \u2014 meaning people who are infectious may not realize they are spreading it. In the last two weeks, Burundi has reported more than 200 new mpox cases every week, mostly in children and young adults.",
      "In Uganda, which reported 100 new cases last week, WHO said the virus is spreading mostly through sex, with the vast majority of cases in adults.",
      "Mpox -- previously known as monkeypox because it was first seen in research monkeys \u2014 is spread primarily through close skin-to-skin contact with infected people or their soiled clothes or bedsheets. It often causes visible skin lesions that could make people less likely to be in close contact with others.",
      "In August, WHO declared the rapid spread of mpox in Congo and elsewhere in Africa to be a global health emergency. To date, Africa has reported more than 46,000 suspected cases, including 1,081 deaths.",
      "WHO said it would convene an expert meeting on Nov. 22 to determine if mpox still constitutes an international emergency.",
      "Last week, Britain announced the first instance of the more infectious kind of mpox spreading beyond Africa. It identified mpox in a person who had recently traveled to Africa and in three of their household contacts. All the individuals are currently being treated in two London hospitals.",

    "story": [
      "Four-year-old Hussein Mikdad survived an Israeli airstrike on his home in a Beirut suburb last month",
      "BEIRUT -- Curled up in his father \u2019s lap, clinging to his chest, Hussein Mikdad cried his heart out. The 4-year-old kicked his doctor with his intact foot and pushed him away with the arm that was not in a cast. \u201cMy Dad! My Dad!\" Hussein said. \"Make him leave me alone!\u201d With eyes tearing up in relief and pain, the father reassured his son and pulled him closer.",
      "Hussein and his father, Hassan, are the only survivors of their family after an Israeli airstrike last month on their Beirut neighborhood. The strike killed 18 people, including his mother, three siblings and six relatives.",
      "\u201cCan he now shower?\u201d the father asked the doctor.",
      "Ten days after surgery, doctors examining Hussein's wounds said the boy is healing properly. He has rods in his fractured right thigh and stitches that assembled his torn tendons back in place on the right arm. The pain has subsided, and Hussein should be able to walk again in two months \u2014 albeit with a lingering limp.",
      "A prognosis for Hussein's invisible wounds is much harder to give. He is back in diapers and has begun wetting his bed. He hardly speaks and has not said a word about his mother, two sisters and brother.",
      "\u201cThe trauma is not just on the muscular skeletal aspect. But he is also mentally hurt,\u201d Imad Nahle, one of Hussein\u2019s orthopedic surgeons, said.",
      "Israel said, without elaborating, that the strike on the Mikdad neighborhood struck a Hezbollah target. In the war that has escalated since September, Israeli airstrikes have increasingly hit residential areas around Lebanon. Israel accuses the Lebanese militant group of hiding its capabilities and fighters among civilians. It vows to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "But children have been caught in the midst.",
      "With more strikes on homes and in residential areas, doctors are seeing more children affected by the violence. More than 100 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past six weeks and hundreds injured. And of the 14,000 wounded since last year, around 10% are children. Many have been left with severed limbs, burned bodies, and broken families \u2014 scars that could last for a lifetime.",
      "Ghassan Abu Sittah, a renowned British-Palestinian surgeon who is also treating Hussein, sees that long road ahead. This is his worry: \u201cIt leaves us with a generation of physically wounded children, children who are psychologically and emotionally wounded.\"",
      "At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which is receiving limited cases of war casualties, Nahle said he operated on five children in the past five weeks \u2014 up from no cases before. Most were referred from south and eastern Lebanon.",
      "A few miles away, at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, one of the country\u2019s largest burns centers increased its capacity by nearly 180% since September so it could accommodate more war wounded, its medical director Naji Abirached said. About a fifth of the newly admitted patients are children.",
      "In one of the burn center\u2019s ICU units lies Ivana Skakye. She turned 2 in the hospital ward last week. Ivana has been healing from burns she sustained following an Israeli airstrike outside their home in southern Lebanon on Sept. 23. Israel said it struck ammunition depots and launchers in southern Lebanon that day when its warplanes launched hundreds of airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, making it the deadliest day of the war so far. More than 500 people were killed.",
      "Six weeks later, the tiny Ivana remains wrapped in white gauze from head to toe except her torso. She sustained third-degree burns over 40 percent of her body. Her hair and head, her left side all the way to her legs, both her arms and her chest were burned. Her family home was damaged, its ceiling set afire. The family\u2019s valuables, packed in their car as they prepared to leave, were also torched. Ivana\u2019s older sister, Rahaf, 7, has recovered faster from burns to her face and hands.",
      "Fatima Zayoun, their mother, was in the kitchen when the explosion hit. Zayoun jumped up to grab the girls, who were playing on the terrace.",
      "It was, Zayoun said, \"as if something lifted me up so that I can grab my kids. I have no idea how I managed to pull them in and throw them out of the window. She spoke from the ICU burns unit. \u201cThey were not on fire, but they were burned. Black ash covered them. ... (Ivana) was without any hair. I told myself, `That is not her.'\u201d",
      "Now, Ivana's wound dressings are changed every two days. Her doctor, Ziad Sleiman, said she could be discharged in a few days. She\u2019s back again to saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cBye \u2014 shorthand for wanting to go out.",
      "Like Hussein, though, Ivana has no home to return to. Her parents fear collective shelters could cause an infection to return.",
      "After seeing her kids \u201csizzling on the floor,\u201d Zayoun, 35, said that even if their home is repaired, she wouldn\u2019t want to return. \u201cI saw death with my own eyes,\u201d she said.",
      "Zayoun was 17 last time Israel and Hezbollah were at war, in 2006. Displaced with her family then, she said she almost enjoyed the experience, riding out of their village in a truck full of their belongings, mixing with new people, learning new things. They returned home when the war was over.",
      "\u201cBut this war is hard. They are hitting everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do they want from us? Do they want to hurt our children? We are not what they are looking for.\"",
      "Abu Sittah, the reconstructive surgeon, said most of the children's injuries are from blasts or collapsing rubble. That attack on a space they expect to be inviolable can have lingering effects.",
      "\u201cChildren feel safe at home,\" he said. \"The injury makes them for the first time lose that sense of security \u2014 that their parents are keeping them safe, that their homes are invincible, and suddenly their homes become not so.\u201d",
      "One recent morning, children were playing in the courtyard of a vocational school-turned-shelter in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, where nearly 3,000 people displaced from the south are now living. The parents were busy with an overflowing bathroom that serves one floor in a building that houses nearly 700 people.",
      "Only playtime brings the children, from different villages in the south, together. They were divided in two teams, ages ranging between 6 and 12, competing to get the handkerchief first. A tiny girl hugged and held hands with strangers visiting the shelter. \u201cI am from Lebanon. Don't tell anyone,\u201d she whispered in their ears.",
      "The game turned rowdy when two girls in their early teens got into a fist fight. Pushing and shoving began. Tears and tantrums followed. The tiny girl walked away in a daze.",
      "Maria Elizabeth Haddad, manager of the psychosocial support programs in Beirut and neighboring areas for the U.S.-based International Medical Corps, said parents in shelters reported signs of increased anxiety, hostility and aggression among kids. They talk back to parents and ignore rules. Some have developed speech impediments and clinginess. One is showing early signs of psychosis.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be residual symptoms when they grow up, especially related to attachment ties, to feeling of security,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cIt is a generational trauma. We have experienced it before with our parents. ... They don\u2019t have stability or search for (extra) stability. This is not going to be easy to overcome.\u201d",
      "Children represent more than a third of over 1 million people displaced by the war in Lebanon and following Israeli evacuation notices, according to U.N. and government estimates (more than 60,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel). That leaves hundreds of thousands in Lebanon without schooling, either because their schools were inaccessible or have been turned into shelters.",
      "Hussein's father says he and his son must start together from scratch. With help from relatives, the two have found a temporary shelter in a home \u2014 and, for the father, a brief sense of relief. \u201cI thank God he is not asking for or about his mother and his siblings,\u201d said Hassan Mikdad, the 40-year-old father.",
      "He has no explanation for his son, who watched their family die in their home. His two sisters \u2014 Celine, 10, and Cila, 14 \u2014 were pulled out of the rubble the following day. His mother, Mona, was pulled out three days later. She was locked in an embrace with her 6-year-old son, Ali.",
      "The strike on Oct. 21 also caused damage across the street, to one of Beirut\u2019s main public hospitals, breaking solar panels and windows in the pharmacy and the dialysis unit. The father survived because he had stepped out for coffee. He watched his building crumble in the late-night airstrike. He also lost his shop, his motorcycles and car \u2014 all the evidence of his 16 years of family life.",
      "His friend, Hussein Hammoud, arrived on the scene to help sift through rubble. Hammoud spotted young Hussein Mikdad\u2019s fingers in the darkness in an alley behind their home. At first, he thought they were severed limbs \u2014 until he heard the boy\u2019s screams. He dug out Hussein with glass lodged in his leg and a metal bar in his shoulder. Hammoud said he didn\u2019t recognize the boy. He held the child's almost-severed wrist in place.",
      "In the hospital now, Hussein Mikdad sipped a juice as he listened to his father and his friend. His father turned to him, asking if he wanted a Spider-Man toy \u2014 an effort to forestall a new outburst of tears. He said he buys Hussein a toy each day.",
      "\u201cWhat I am living through seems like a big lie. ...The mind can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank God for the blessing that is Hussein.\u201d",

      "ISLAMABAD -- The U.N. children\u2019s agency on Monday warned that the health of 11 million children in Pakistan\u2019s eastern Punjab province is in danger because of air pollution that experts say has become a fifth season in recent years.",
      "Toxic smog has shrouded Pakistan's cultural capital of Lahore and 17 other districts in Punjab since last month. Health officials say more than 40,000 people have been treated for respiratory ailments.",
      "UNICEF's representative in Pakistan, Abdullah Fadil, in a statement urged the government to make urgent and greater efforts to reduce air pollution for the 11 million affected children under the age of 5 and others.",
      "\u201cPrior to these record-breaking levels of air pollution, about 12% of deaths in children under 5 in Pakistan were due to air pollution,\" Fadil said. \"The impact of this year\u2019s extraordinary smog will take time to assess, but we know that doubling and tripling the amount of pollution in the air will have devastating effects, particularly on children and pregnant women.\u201d",
      "Pakistan has shut schools until Nov. 17 in parts of Punjab as part of measures aimed at protecting children\u2019s health. Authorities on Friday ordered the closure of all parks and museums for 10 days, and they have been urging people to avoid unnecessary travel.",
      "According to the Environmental Protection Department in Punjab, Multan remained the most polluted city on Monday, with air quality index readings of about 800. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous to health.",
      "Though the government has ordered the mandatory wearing of face masks, that has been widely disregarded. The government has also said it was looking into methods to induce artificial rainfall to combat the pollution."

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 14:42:17 -0500",
    "summary": "An attorney representing a conservate prosecutor is struggling to convince Wisconsin's liberal-leaning Supreme Court to reactivate the state's 175-year-old abortion ban",
    "story": [
      "An attorney representing a conservate prosecutor is struggling to convince Wisconsin's liberal-leaning Supreme Court to reactivate the state's 175-year-old abortion ban",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A conservative prosecutor's attorney struggled Monday to persuade the Wisconsin Supreme Court to reactivate the state's 175-year-old abortion ban, drawing a tongue-lashing from two of the court's liberal justices during oral arguments.",
      "Sheboygan County\u2019s Republican district attorney, Daniel Urmanski, has asked the high court to overturn a Dane County judge\u2019s ruling last year that invalidated the ban. A ruling isn't expected for weeks but abortion advocates almost certainly will win the case given that liberal justices control the court. One of them, Janet Protasiewicz, remarked on the campaign trail that she supports abortion rights.",
      "Monday's two-hour session amounted to little more than political theater. Liberal Justice Rebecca Dallet told Urmanski's attorney, Matthew Thome, that the ban was passed in 1849 by white men who held all the power and that he was ignoring everything that has happened since. Jill Karofsky, another liberal justice, pointed out that the ban provides no exceptions for rape or incest and that reactivation could result in doctors withholding medical care. She told Thome that he was essentially asking the court to sign a \u201cdeath warrant\u201d for women and children in Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cThis is the world gone mad,\u201d Karofsky said.",
      "The ban stood until 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide nullified it. Legislators never repealed the ban, however, and conservatives have argued the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe two years ago reactivated it.",
      "Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit challenging the law in 2022. He argued that a 1985 Wisconsin law that allows abortions before a fetus can survive outside the womb supersedes the ban. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation.",
      "Urmanski contends that the ban was never repealed and that it can co-exist with the 1985 law because that law didn\u2019t legalize abortion at any point. Other modern-day abortion restrictions also don\u2019t legalize the practice, he argues.",
      "Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled last year that the ban outlaws feticide \u2014 which she defined as the killing of a fetus without the mother\u2019s consent \u2014 but not consensual abortions. The ruling emboldened Planned Parenthood to resume offering abortions in Wisconsin after halting procedures after Roe was overturned.",
      "Urmanski asked the state Supreme Court in February to overturn Schlipper\u2019s ruling without waiting for a lower appellate decision.",
      "Thome told the justices on Monday that he wasn't arguing about the implications of reactivating the ban. He maintained that the legal theory that new laws implicitly repeal old ones is shaky. He also contended that the ban and the newer abortion restrictions can overlap just like laws establishing different penalties for the same crime. A ruling that the 1985 law effectively repealed the ban would be \u201canti-democratic,\u201d Thome added.",
      "\u201cIt's a statute this Legislature has not repealed and you're saying, no, you actually repealed it,\u201d he said.",
      "Dallet shot back that disregarding laws passed over the last 40 years to go back to 1849 would be undemocratic.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed a separate lawsuit in February asking the state Supreme Court to rule directly on whether a constitutional right to abortion exists in the state. The justices have agreed to take the case but haven't scheduled oral arguments yet."

      "A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste has been allowed to dock at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection",
      "TIRANA, Albania -- A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste was allowed to dock on Friday at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection on the orders of the prosecutor, officials said.",
      "Albania had prevented the Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A from docking early last week at the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital, Tirana, after a watchdog alerted authorities that it was carrying hazardous waste.",
      "Instead, the ship was kept at an anchorage place away from the port.",
      "The prosecutors then ordered the containers to be seized and stored \u201cat an environmentally\" safe place. Once unloaded, the containers are expected to be sent to an agency in Porto Romano, 6 kilometers (4 miles) away, for inspection.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office has asked different institutions to conduct lab tests of the cargo.",
      "The Seattle-based non-government organization Basel Action Network, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, flagged the ship to authorities in August after receiving information from a whistleblower that the containers on board are suspected to be carrying an estimated 2,100 tons of toxic dust from pollution control filters from the steel industry.",
      "The dust is suspected to have originated at an Albanian company and that it was also illegally smuggled to Albania from neighboring Kosovo and Germany.",
      "BAN said the containers left Durres on July 4 on two Maersk-chartered ships with the intended destination of Thailand. The group said it alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment.",
      "Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the containers were loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said.",
      "The customs documentation stated the containers contained iron oxide, according to local reports.",
      "\u201cThe case is under investigation from the Durres prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Tourism and Environment is cooperating for anything that the justice institution asks for,\u201d ministry spokesperson Erjon Uka told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "Albania's opposition accused the government in August of taking part in illegally trafficking hazardous material.",
      "Prime Minister Edi Rama said in Parliament in September that the shipment\u2019s documents were verified and that iron oxide is \u201cnot considered as toxic waste in the European catalogs on which the environmental and customs procedure of our country is based.\u201d",
      "Speaking to a parliamentary commission on Friday, Environment Minister Mirela Kumbaro said the case should not be politically exploited to spread panic.",
      "She urged for calm to allow the investigation to proceed.",
      "The ship, she said, is suspected of carrying hazardous waste but \u201chazardous waste does not mean toxic\u201d waste, adding that transport companies had declared the cargo consisted of \u201cnormal goods\u201d \u2014 and that it was only now being described as hazardous waste.",
      "The Seattle-based NGO has called on Albanian authorities to have a public opening and sampling of the containers to ensure transparency of the investigation.",
      "BAN has also said that while Albania is looking to join the European Union and the government has been eager to align its hazardous waste policy with that of the 27-nation bloc, it should ban \u201cthe export of hazardous wastes, household wastes, electronic wastes and plastic wastes to developing countries.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Anti-abortion advocates say they will quickly dismantle some of President Joe Biden's abortion policies once President-elect Donald Trump makes his return to the White House next year",
      "WASHINGTON -- Anti-abortion advocates say there is still work to be done to further restrict access to abortion when Republican Donald Trump returns to the White House next year.",
      "They point to the federal guidance that the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden released around emergency abortions, requiring that hospitals provide them for women whose health or life is at risk, and its easing of prescribing restrictions for abortion pills that have allowed women to order the medication online with the click of a button.",
      "\u201cNow the work begins to dismantle the pro-abortion policies of the Biden-Harris administration,\" the Susan B. Anthony List, the powerful anti-abortion lobby, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s first-term pro-life accomplishments are the baseline for his second term.\u201d",
      "The group declined to release details about what, specifically, they will seek to undo. But abortion rights advocates are bracing for further abortion restrictions once Trump takes office. And some women are, too, with online abortion pill orders spiking in the days after Election Day.",
      "Trump has said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government. Yet, during the campaign, he pointedly noted that he appointed justices to the Supreme Court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion. And there are things his administration can do, from picking judges to issuing regulations, to further an anti-abortion agenda.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to pull back Biden's controversial directive that requires emergency rooms to provide abortions when necessary to stabilize a woman's health or life. The Biden administration had argued that the decades-old federal law, which requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment for patients in exchange for Medicare funding, also applies in cases where an abortion might be needed.",
      "Reports of women being sent home or left untreated by hospitals in dangerous scenarios have proliferated across the United States since the Supreme Court overturned the national right to an abortion in 2022. In some cases, hospitals said state abortion bans had stopped them from terminating a pregnancy.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing the lives of pregnant people be put in jeopardy,\" Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said Wednesday. \"We're seeing women who have become infertile, who have been subject to sepsis and we're now hearing reports with death.\"",
      "Even if a Trump administration abandons the guidance of the law, Goss Graves said advocacy groups like hers will continue a legal fight for the Biden administration's interpretation of the law.",
      "Some doctors and hospitals also have said the federal guidance offered a protection for them to perform emergency abortions in states like Idaho and Texas, where threat of prosecution for performing an abortion hangs over their decision-making.",
      "Trump has said he supports exceptions for rape and incest cases, as well as when a woman's life is at risk. But he has not gone as far as saying he supports exemptions when a woman's health is on the line.",
      "Abortions might be necessary to prevent organ loss, significant hemorrhage or dangerous infections for pregnant women in rare but serious scenarios. In cases like ectopic pregnancy, premature rupture of membranes and placental abruptions, a fetus might still be alive but continuing the pregnancy can be detrimental. Doctors have argued that the legal gray area has put them in a bind.",
      "In Idaho, for example, one hospital resorted to airlifting women out of the state after a strict abortion ban, which only allowed for abortions to prevent a woman's death, was enacted.",
      "The Biden administration sued Idaho, arguing its state law conflicted with federal law requiring hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment, which might include abortions, for patients. The state amended its law to allow abortions for ectopic pregnancies, but other dangerous scenarios still remain unaccounted for. The Supreme Court declined to address the issue earlier this year, issuing a limited order that cleared the way for hospitals to provide emergency abortions while the case worked its way through lower courts.",
      "Enforcement of the federal law, however, is on hold in Texas, which challenged the Biden administration's guidance on emergency abortions.",
      "A patchwork of state laws governing abortion will remain in place under the Trump administration. Voters in Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota on Tuesday defeated constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "In Missouri, however, voters approved a ballot measure on Tuesday to undo one of the nation's strictest bans. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "The ease with which women have been able to get abortion pills could also be up for reconsideration under Trump.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration made it easier to obtain abortion pills, including mifepristone, allowing women to access the medication over telehealth. The agency has approved the drug's safety through 10 weeks of pregnancy, saying that adverse effects happen for .32% of patients.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates have challenged that, arguing the medications are not safe and at the very least not fit for eased access without in-person supervision by a doctor.",
      "Although the Supreme Court preserved access to the drug earlier this year, anti-abortion advocates and conservative states have renewed their challenge in lower courts.",
      "Some women are worried. Telehealth company Wisp saw an immediate spike in abortion pill orders between Election Day and the following day, with a 600% increase. In states like Florida and Texas, where the medication cannot be legally shipped, the company saw a nearly 1000% percent increase in orders of so-called \u201cmorning after\u201d pills, also known as emergency contraception.",
      "The company fills about tens of thousands of orders monthly for reproductive products including birth control pills and abortion pills, CEO Monica Cepak told the Associated Press.",
      "Right now women typically take a two-step regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol to complete a medication abortion. Cepak said the company will keep a \u201cclose eye\u201d on mifepristone under a Trump administration and is prepared to shift to a misoprostol-only regimen should restriction to mifepristone be implemented.",
      "But Trump could be a wild card on the issue, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis who is an expert on reproductive health issues. In the final months of the campaign, he backed away from a more rigid stance on abortion \u2014 even saying he would not sign a national abortion ban if it came across his desk.",
      "Although he has enjoyed firm backing from anti-abortion groups, he is willing to break with allies when he wants.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a clear sense from him about what he would do,\u201d Ziegler said.",

      "The majority of strokes could be prevented, according to new guidelines aimed at helping people and their doctors do just that",
      "The majority of strokes could be prevented, according to new guidelines aimed at helping people and their doctors do just that.",
      "Stroke was the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than half a million Americans have a stroke every year. But up to 80% of strokes may be preventable with better nutrition, exercise and identification of risk factors.",
      "The first new guidelines on stroke prevention in 10 years from the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association, include recommendations for people and doctors that reflect a better understanding of who gets strokes and why, along with new drugs that can help reduce risk.",
      "The good news is that the best way to reduce your risk for stroke is also the best way to reduce your risk for a whole host of health problems \u2014 eat a healthy diet, move your body and don't smoke. The bad news is that it's not always so easy to sustain.",
      "Dr. Sean Duke, a stroke doctor at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, blames the forces in society that keep people sedentary and eating poorly, like cell phones and cheap, unhealthy food. \u201cOur world is stacked against us,\u201d he said.",
      "Here's what to know about stroke and the new guidelines:",
      "A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked or if a blood vessel in the brain bursts. That deprives the brain of oxygen which can cause brain damage that can lead to difficulty thinking, talking and walking, or even death.",
      "Eating healthy can help control several factors that increase your risk for stroke, including high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and obesity, according to the heart association.",
      "The group recommends foods in the so-called Mediterranean diet such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and olive oil, which can help keep cholesterol levels down. It suggests limiting red meat and other sources of saturated fat. Instead, get your protein from beans, nuts, poultry, fish and seafood.",
      "Limit highly processed foods and foods and drinks with a lot of added sugar. This can also reduce your calorie intake, which helps keep weight in check.",
      "Getting up and walking around for at least 10 minutes a day can \u201cdrastically\u201d reduce your risk, said Dr. Cheryl Bushnell, a neurologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine who was part of the group that came up with the new guidelines. Among the many benefits: Regular exercise can help reduce blood pressure, a major risk factor for stroke.",
      "Of course, more is better: The heart association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic or 75 minutes of vigorous activity \u2014 or some combination \u2014 per week. How you do it doesn't matter so much, experts said: Go to the gym, take a walk or run in your neighborhood or use treadmills or stepper machines at home.",
      "Diet and exercise can help control weight, another important risk factor for strokes. But a new class of drugs that can drastically reduce weight have been approved by regulators, providing new tools to reduce stroke risk since guidelines were last updated.",
      "The guidelines now recommend that doctors consider prescribing these drugs, including those sold under the brand names Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, to people with obesity or diabetes.",
      "But while those drugs can help, people still need to eat well and get exercise, cautions Dr. Fadi Nahab, a stroke expert at Emory University Hospital.",
      "The new guidelines for the first time recommend doctors screen patients for other factors that could increase stroke risk, including sex and gender and non-medical factors such as economic stability, access to health care, discrimination and racism. For example, the risk for having a first stroke is nearly twice as high for Black adults in the U.S. as it is for white adults, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cIf somebody doesn\u2019t have insurance or they can\u2019t get to a doctor\u2019s office because of transportation issues or they can\u2019t get off work to get health care ... these are all things that can impact the ability to prevent stroke,\" Bushnell said.",
      "Doctors may be able to point to resources for low-cost health care or food, and can give ideas about how to be active without breaking the bank for a gym membership.",
      "The guidelines also now recommend doctors should screen for conditions that could increase a woman's risk for stroke, such as high blood pressure during pregnancy or early menopause.",
      "Three of the most common stroke symptoms include face weakness, arm weakness and difficulty speaking. And time is important, because brain damage can happen quickly and damage can be limited if a stroke is treated quickly. Stroke experts have coined an acronym to help you remember: FAST. F for face, A for arm, S for speech, and T for time. If you think you or a loved one could be having a stroke, call 911 right away.",

      "LONDON -- British health officials say they have identified four cases of the new, more infectious version of mpox that first emerged in Congo, marking the first time the variant has caused a cluster of illness outside of Africa. Scientists said the risk to the public remains low.",
      "Authorities announced the first case of the new form of mpox in the U.K. last week, saying the case was being treated at a London hospital after recently traveling to countries in Africa with ongoing outbreaks.",
      "This week, the U.K. Health Security Agency said it had now identified three further cases who lived in the same household as the first patient. They too are now being treated at a hospital in London.",
      "\u201cMpox is very infectious in households with close contact and so it is not unexpected to see further cases within the same household,\u201d said Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor of the U.K. Health Security Agency.",
      "The new variant of mpox was first detected earlier this year in eastern Congo. Scientists believe it causes milder symptoms that are harder to notice, which makes it easier to spread because people may not know they are infected. Its spread in Congo and elsewhere in Africa prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency in August.",

      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump is refusing to say how he voted on Florida's abortion measure \u2014 and getting testy about it.",
      "The former president was asked twice after casting his ballot in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday about a question that the state's voters are considering. If approved, it would prevent state lawmakers from passing any law that penalizes, prohibits, delays or restricts abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks.",
      "If it\u2019s rejected, the state\u2019s restrictive six-week abortion law would stand.",
      "The first time he was asked, Trump avoided answering. He said instead of the issue that he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d That was a reference to the former president having appointed three conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 2022.",
      "Pressed a second time, Trump snapped at a reporter, saying they \"should just stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump had previously indicated that he would back the measure \u2014 but then changed his mind and said he would vote against it.",
      "In August, Trump said he thought Florida\u2019s ban was a mistake, saying on Fox News Channel, \u201cI think six weeks, you need more time.\u201d But then he said, \u201cat the same time, the Democrats are radical\u201d while repeating false claims he has frequently made about late-term abortions.",

      "Voters are getting a say on abortion policy in Tuesday's election with ballot measures and elections to offices from president to local prosecutors",
      "WASHINGTON -- Voters in nine states are deciding whether their state constitutions should guarantee a right to abortion, weighing ballot measures that are expected to spur turnout for a range of crucial races.",
      "Passing certain amendments in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota likely would lead to undoing bans or restrictions that currently block varying levels of abortion access to more than 7 million women of childbearing age who live in those states.",
      "The future legality and availability of abortion hinges not only on ballot measures, as policies could shift depending on who controls Congress and the presidency. Same with state governments \u2014 including legislatures that pursue new laws, state supreme courts that determine the laws' constitutionality, attorneys general who decide whether to defend them and district attorneys who enforce them.",
      "If all the abortion rights measures pass, \"it\u2019s a sign of how much of a juggernaut support for reproductive rights has become,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and an expert on the history of reproductive rights in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf some of them fail,\" she added, \"then you\u2019re going to see some conservatives looking for guidance to see what the magic ingredient was that made it possible for conservatives to stem the tide.\u201d",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on all seven measures that have appeared since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the nationwide right to abortion. That decision opened the door to bans or restrictions in most GOP-controlled states \u2014 and protections of access in most of those controlled by Democrats.",
      "The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this year. Their opponents' efforts are focused on portraying the amendments as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before women often realize they\u2019re pregnant. Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents of the states with bans.",
      "The bans also are part of a key argument in the presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris calls them \u201cTrump abortion bans,\u201d noting former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Harris, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as a direct, consistent advocate for reproductive health and rights, including Black maternal health.",
      "Trump has struggled to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights, leaning on his catch-all response that abortion rights should be left up to individual states.",
      "His shifting stances on reproductive rights include vowing in October to veto a national abortion ban, just weeks after the presidential debate when he repeatedly declined to say. Trump also has regularly taken credit for appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "After voting in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, Trump was asked twice how he voted on the abortion measure there \u2014 and didn't answer directly. The first time he said he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d The second time, he snapped at a reporter, saying \u201cyou should stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s attempt to find a more cautious stance on abortion echoes the efforts of many Republican congressional candidates as the issue has emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP. In competitive congressional races from coast to coast, Republicans distanced themselves from more aggressive anti-abortion policies coming from their party and its allies, despite their records on the issue and previous statements opposing abortion rights.",
      "While the ballot questions have similar aims, each one occupies its own political circumstances.",
      "There\u2019s an added obstacle to passing protections in reliably Republican Florida: Supporters of the amendment must get at least 60% of the vote.",
      "Passing it there and rolling back a 6-week ban that took effect in May would be a blow to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, who has steered state GOP funds to the cause and whose administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial supporting it.",
      "Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would allow abortion further into pregnancy. The other would enshrine in the constitution the state\u2019s current law, which bars most abortions after 12 weeks \u2014 but would allow for further restrictions.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure would allow some regulations related to the health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most national abortion-rights groups are not supporting it.",
      "In some states, notably Missouri, passing amendments may not expand access immediately. Courts would be asked to invalidate the bans; and there could be legal battles over that. Clinics would need to staff up and get licenses. And some restrictions could remain in effect.",
      "Arizona, a battleground in the presidential election, bans abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The ballot measure there gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "In the Democratic-controlled Colorado and Maryland, the ballot measures would largely put existing policies into the state constitutions, though Colorado\u2019s version could also remove financial barriers to abortion. It would take 55% of the vote to pass there.",
      "Measures maintaining access also are on the ballot in Montana, where a U.S. Senate race could help determine control of the chamber, and Nevada, a battleground in the presidential election.",
      "In Nevada, where control of the state government is divided, the ballot measure would have to be passed this year and again in 2026 to take effect.",
      "New York also has a measure on the ballot that its supporters say would bolster abortion rights. It doesn\u2019t contain the word \u201cabortion\u201d but rather bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d"

      "Health officials say it's important to get flu and COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the holidays when respiratory bugs tend to spread",
      "WASHINGTON -- If you missed the early fall push for flu and COVID-19 vaccines, it's not too late.",
      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",
      "And that coincides with flu season, which tends to start in November or December and peak in January or February.",
      "It takes the body about two weeks to build up immunity after either shot \u2014 meaning vaccination is needed before these viruses start spreading. A lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.",
      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",
      "\u201cIt may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.\u201d",
      "Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot.",
      "\u201cOur best defense to protect ourselves, our loved ones and all those around us is a simple shot,\u201d Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a recent statement.",
      "While it may have faded from the headlines, the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year.",
      "\u201cMaybe we believe that it\u2019s not going to be me but let\u2019s not take a chance,\u201d said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. \u201cWhy not get a vaccine that\u2019s going to help you reduce that risk?\u201d",
      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",
      "About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access. Call your local health department to ask about options.",

The measure includes some exceptions, including allowing abortions later in pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant woman.",

      "Federal health officials are calling for more testing and treatment of workers on farms with bird flu",
      "Federal health officials on Thursday called for more testing of employees on farms with bird flu after a new study showed that some dairy workers had signs of infection, even when they didn't report feeling sick.",
      "Farmworkers in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered treatment even if they show no symptoms, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new guidance comes after blood tests for 115 farmworkers in Michigan and Colorado showed that eight workers \u2014 or 7% \u2014 had antibodies that indicated previous infection with the virus known as Type A H5N1 influenza.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the transmission of H5 to humans and to reduce the possibility of the virus changing,\u201d Shah told reporters.",
      "The CDC study provides the largest window to date into how the bird virus first detected in March in dairy cows may be spreading to people. It suggests that the virus has infected more humans than the 46 farmworkers identified in the U.S. as of Thursday. Nearly all were in contact with infected dairy cows or infected poultry.",
      "Outside experts said it\u2019s notable that the study prompted the CDC to take new action. Previous recommendations called for testing and treating workers only when they had symptoms.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant move towards the assessment that these H5N1 viruses are a greater risk than the CDC estimated before,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "Every additional infection in animals or humans gives the virus the chance to change in potentially dangerous ways, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt shows yet again that we are not responding effectively to the H5N1 cattle outbreak in humans or animals and if we continue to let this virus spread and jump from species to species, our luck will eventually run out,\u201d Rasmussen said in an email.",
      "The CDC study included 45 workers in Michigan and 70 in Colorado tested between June and August. Of the eight workers with positive blood tests, four reported no symptoms. All eight cleaned milking parlors and none used respiratory protection such as face masks. Three said they used eye protection.",
      "High levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows, increasing the risk of exposure and infection, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said that efforts to monitor dairy workers for illness have been hindered by several barriers including the reluctance of farm owners and farmworkers to allow testing.",
      "Rasmussen and others have criticized the federal response to the outbreak as too slow and \u201clackluster.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese studies should have been performed months ago and should have been prioritized,\u201d she said.",
      "The virus has been confirmed in at least 446 cattle herds in 15 states. Last week, the Agriculture Department said a pig at an Oregon farm was confirmed to have bird flu, the first time the virus was detected in U.S. swine.",

      "A former health care worker who illegally accessed the health records of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she died has been sentenced to two years in prison",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- A former health care worker who illegally accessed the health records of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she died was sentenced Thursday to two years in prison.",
      "Trent Russell, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, who worked at the time as a transplant coordinator for the Washington Regional Transplant Community and had access to hospital records all over the region, was convicted earlier this year of illegally accessing health care records and destroying or altering records at a jury trial.",
      "He was also charged with publishing that information on the internet in 2019, at a time when public speculation about Ginsburg's health and her ability to serve as a justice was a matter of public debate. Prosecutors said he posted the information along with a false claim that Ginsburg had already died. But the jury acquitted Russell on that count.",
      "Ginsburg served on the court until her death in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors said Russell disclosed the health records on forums that trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories, including conspiracy theories that Ginsburg was dead, but Russell's motivations for his actions were unclear. Indeed, Russell himself never admitted that he accessed the records, at one point suggesting that perhaps his cat walked across the keyboard in a way that mistakenly called up Ginsburg's data.",
      "Russell's excuses and refusal to accept responsibility prompted blistering critiques from prosecutors, who sought a 30-month sentence.",
      "\u201cHe offered completely implausible excuses with a straight face,\u201d prosecutor Zoe Bedell said.",
      "Russell's lawyer, Charles Burnham, sought a sentence of probation or home detention. He cited Russell's work saving lives as a transplant coordinator and his military record which included a deployment to Afghanistan as mitigating factors.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell has lived a quietly heroic life,\u201d Burnham wrote in court papers. He chalked up the criminal conduct to \u201cbeing stupid.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff's 24-month sentence , calling his crime \u201ctruly despicable conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have made it extremely difficult to understand what motivated you,\u201d Nachmanoff said. He said Russell made matters worse by lying to investigators and on the witness stand.",
      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",
      "Russell and his lawyer declined to comment after Thursday's hearing on whether they plan to appeal."

      "It also continues a plan by the previous Conservative government, which was ousted in July\u2019s general election, to raise the minimum age for buying tobacco by one year each year, so that no one born after Jan. 1, 2009 will ever be able to buy cigarettes legally in Britain.",
      "It is currently illegal to sell cigarettes, tobacco products or vapes to people under 18.",
      "If passed \u2013 as is likely because of the governing Labour Party\u2019s large majority in Parliament -- the bill would give Britain some of the toughest anti-smoking measures in the world.",

    "story": [
      "Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution \u2014 a vote that could cement access after the presidential battleground came close to a near-total ban earlier this year.",
      "Arizona is one of nine states with abortion on the ballot.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates are hoping for a win that could expand access beyond the state's current 15-week limit to the point of fetal viability, a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Doctors say it's sometime after 21 weeks, though there's no defined time frame.",
      "Advocates also are counting on the measure to drive interest among Democrats to vote the party line up and down the ballot. When Republicans running in tough races address the ballot measure, they generally don\u2019t dissuade voters from supporting it, though some like Senate candidate Kari Lake say they\u2019re personally voting against it. GOP U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, whose battleground congressional district encompasses Tucson, ran an ad saying he rejects \"the extremes on abortion.\u201d",
      "Arizona has been whipsawed by recent legal and legislative battles centered on abortion. In April, the state Supreme Court cleared the way for enforcement of a long-dormant 1864 law that banned nearly all abortions. The Legislature swiftly repealed it.",
      "In addition to the abortion ballot measure itself, the issue could sway state legislative races and lead to elimination of the voice voters have over retention of state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices.",
      "Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition leading the ballot measure campaign, has far outpaced the opposition campaign, It Goes Too Far, in fundraising. Opponents argue that the measure is too far-reaching because its physical and mental health exemption post-viability is so broad that it effectively legalizes abortion beyond viability. The measure allows post-viability abortions if they are necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the mother.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion-rights supporters prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions, including in conservative-leaning states.",
      "Voters in Arizona are divided on abortion. Maddy Pennell, a junior at Arizona State University, said the possibility of a near-total abortion ban made her \u201cdepressed\u201d and strengthened her desire to vote for the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cI feel very strongly about having access to abortion,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle Lee, an independent Arizona voter, does not support the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cAll abortion is pretty much, in my opinion, murder from beginning to end,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The Civil War-era ban also shaped the contours of tight legislative races. State Sen. Shawnna Bolick and state Rep. Matt Gress are among the handful of vulnerable Republican incumbents in competitive districts who crossed party lines to give the repeal vote the final push \u2014 a vote that will be tested as both parties vie for control of the narrowly GOP-held state Legislature.",
      "Both of the Phoenix-area lawmakers were rebuked by some of their Republican colleagues for siding with Democrats. Gress made a motion on the House floor to initiate the repeal of the 1864 law. Bolick, explaining her repeal vote to her Senate colleagues, gave a 20-minute floor speech describing her three difficult pregnancies.",
      "While Gress was first elected to his seat in 2022, Bolick is facing voters for the first time. She was appointed by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to fill a seat vacancy in 2023. She has not emphasized her role in the repeal vote as she has campaigned, instead playing up traditional conservative issues \u2014 one of her signs reads \u201cBolick Backs the Blue.\u201d",
      "Another question before voters is whether to move away from retention elections for state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices, a measure put on the ballot by Republican legislators hoping to protect two justices who favored allowing the Civil War-era ban to be enforced.",
      "Under the existing system, voters decide every four to six years whether judges and justices should remain on the bench. The proposed measure would allow the judges and justices to stay on the bench without a popular vote unless one is triggered by felony convictions, crimes involving fraud and dishonesty, personal bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure.",
      "Shawnna Bolick\u2019s husband, Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, is one of two conservative justices up for a retention vote. Justice Bolick and Justice Kathryn Hackett King, who were both appointed by former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, sided with the high court\u2019s majority to allow the enforcement of the 1864 near-total ban. Abortion-rights activists have campaigned for their ouster, but if the ballot measure passes they will keep their posts even if they don\u2019t win the retention election."

      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cKing\u201d doesn\u2019t disclose his real name. Even clients of his Sao Paulo newsstand have to call him by his moniker. The Brazilian online sports gambling addict lowered his profile after a loan shark threatened to put bullets in his head if he didn\u2019t pay up.",
      "Broke and embarrassed, King sought treatment and support earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI was once addicted to slot machines, but then sports betting was so easy that I changed. I got carried away all the time,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "King\u2019s story is that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years. The country has become the third-biggest market in the world for sports betting, following the U.S. and the U.K., a report by data analysis company Comscore said last year. But unlike those countries, rampant advertising and sponsorship have been coupled with an unregulated market. The government is now \u2014 belatedly, some say \u2014 striving to get a handle on the epidemic.",
      "On a recent evening, King's Gamblers Anonymous meeting took place in an improvised classroom inside a church, with coffee and cookies to keep everyone awake, and supportive messages scrawled onto the blackboard. One that's become ubiquitous in Brazil and beyond: \u201cOnly for today I will avoid the first bet.\u201d",
      "King and other attendees, all Christian, started a prayer and the meeting began.",
      "King said his financial problems arose from his addiction to online sports betting, chiefly on soccer.",
      "\u201cI miss the adrenaline rush when I don\u2019t bet,\" he said before the gathering. \"I have managed to stop for a couple of months, but I know that if I do it once again, even a small bet, it will all come back.\u201d",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for Brazilians embracing sports betting. King said he transformed almost every sale during that time into a bet. His hook was the non-stop advertising on TV, radio, social media as well as sponsorship of local soccer teams' jerseys. He asked for bank loans to pay his gambling debts and then, to cover those, went to the moneylender. His total debt now amounts to 85,000 reais ($15,000) \u2014 impossible to pay off with his monthly income of 8,000 reais.",
      "Digging oneself out of debt in Brazil is especially daunting with its sky-high interest rates. Loans from Brazilian banks could add interest of almost 8% per month to the borrowed sum, and from loan sharks could be even more.",
      "Four Gamblers Anonymous meetings attended by the AP in October featured discussions about difficulties paying down debts, forcing working-class members to postpone housing payments and cancel family vacations.",
      "Some members of impoverished Brazilian families have used welfare money for betting instead of paying for groceries and housing, official data suggests. In August, beneficiaries of Brazil\u2019s flagship program Bolsa Familia spent 3 billion reais ($530 million) on sports betting, according to a report from the central bank. That was more than 20% of the program\u2019s total outlay in the month.",
      "Sports betting was made legal in 2018 in a bill signed by former President Michel Temer. The subsequent turmoil has recently been setting off alarm bells, with addicts venting on social media and media reports of people losing huge sums.",
      "On Oct. 1, the economy ministry prevented more than 2,000 betting companies from operating in Brazil for having failed to provide all the required documents. Soccer-loving President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in an interview on Oct. 17 that he will shut down the entire market in Brazil if his administration\u2019s new regulations \u2014 presented at the end of July\u2014 fail to work. And Brazil\u2019s Senate on Oct. 25 opened an investigation into betting companies, focusing on crime and addiction.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tax evasion, money laundering of organized crime, the use of influencers to trick people into betting. These companies need to be audited,\u201d Sen. Soraya Thronicke, who proposed the inquiry, told journalists in Brasilia.",
      "S\u00e9rgio Peixoto, a ride-sharing app driver in Rio, is one of many lower-middle-income Brazilians who have reduced their spending due to sports betting debt. Peixoto\u2019s debt currently amounts to 25,000 reais ($4,400). His monthly income is four times less than that.",
      "\u201cIt stopped being a game, it wasn\u2019t fun. I just wanted to get the money back, so I lost even more,\u201d said Peixoto, 26. \u201cI could have invested that money. It would surely have given me more benefits.",
      "Pressure on people to gamble is everywhere. Current and former soccer players, including Vinicius J\u00fanior, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio and Roberto Rivellino, are among the poster boys for local and foreign brands. All but one of the top-tier soccer clubs have betting companies among their main sponsors, with their name and logo emblazoned on their kits. There have been cases of kids and teenagers setting up accounts using their parents' personal information and money, multiple local media outlets have reported.",
      "Brazil's economy ministry estimates that Brazil's sports betting market had $21 billion in transactions last year, a 71% increase compared with the first year of the pandemic, 2020.",
      "The ministry's newly presented regulations include facial recognition systems for gamblers to bet, the identification of a single bank account for transactions involving sports betting, new protections against hackers and the government-authorized domain, bet.br, which will host all betting sites that are legal in Brazil. Once they are in place, come January, between 100 and 150 betting companies will continue to operate in the South American nation.",
      "The changes in Brazil have prompted some companies to take preemptive action. A report by Yield Sec, a technical intelligence platform for online marketplaces, said several betting companies voluntarily restricted their operations in different places after the latest editions of the European Championships and Copa America in the hopes of presenting \u201cthe best possible license application face to the Brazilian authorities.\u201d",
      "Magnho Jos\u00e9 Santos de Sousa, the president of the Legal Gambling Institute, a betting think tank, said Brazil has been flooded by some legal platforms that have licenses in Malta, Cura\u00e7ao, Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, and also illegal sites based in China.",
      "De Sousa expressed hope that the new regulations for advertising, responsible gambling and qualification of sports betting companies will transform the country's deregulated arena into a more serious one that doesn't exploit the vulnerable.",
      "\"The whole operation could turn from water into wine,\u201d he said.",
      "Meantime, the demand for Gamblers Anonymous meetings in Sao Paulo has grown so much in recent years that the weekly gathering, in place since the 1990s, was no longer enough. Many groups have added a second day in the week to help new people recover, mostly sports bettors.",

      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them leaders,\u201d Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans \u201csee on television.\u201d He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",

      "An expensive campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state Supreme Court seats has yielded mixed results",
      "A costly campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state Supreme Court seats yielded mixed results in Tuesday's election, with Republicans expanding their majority on Ohio's court while candidates backed by progressive groups won in Montana and Michigan.",
      "One of the most expensive and closely watched Supreme Court races in North Carolina, where a Democratic justice campaigned heavily on abortion rights and Republicans hope to expand their majority, remained too early to call Thursday.",
      "Groups on both the right and left spent millions in the leadup to the election hoping to reshape courts that'll be battlegrounds for voting rights, redistricting, abortion and other issues.",
      "Abortion-rights supporters touted victories in states that Donald Trump won, saying it's a sign that reproductive rights will be key in judicial campaigns after the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. In states like Montana and Arizona, state courts may soon be tasked with interpreting how abortion-rights amendments voters passed this week would impact existing laws.",
      "\u201cState Supreme Court judges don't really have anything to say about the economy, but they certainly do have something to say about reproductive rights and voting rights and democracy and what your life is going to be like from a right to liberty perspective in your state,\" said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cSo I think we have a real opportunity to define these judges and this level of the ballot by reproductive rights.\u201d",
      "The ACLU spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in those states, as well as in Arizona and Texas.",
      "Conservative groups also spent heavily in those states, but with ads focusing on issues other than abortion such as immigration and crime.",
      "In Ohio, all three Democrats running for the state Supreme Court lost their race. The victory gives Republicans a 6-1 majority on the court. A county judge in October struck down the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban and the state Supreme Court is expected to hear more cases aiming to undo regulations that, for example, require 24-hour waiting periods or in-person appointments for patients.",
      "\u201cOhioans made a strong statement tonight that will keep the court under Republican control for years to come,\u201d said Dee Duncan, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee's Judicial Fairness Initiative, which spent nearly $1 million on the race.",
      "Michigan Democrats won two seats on the state\u2019s Supreme Court, expanding their majority to 5-2. While the elections are nonpartisan, parties nominate the candidates.",
      "\u201cWith the liberal majority protected, Michigan Dems\u2019 hard work past and future will not be threatened by the MAGA fanatics that threaten our values here in Michigan,\u201d Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Lavora Barnes said in a statement.",
      "In North Carolina, Justice Allison Riggs trailed narrowly Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin in their race for an eight-year term on the state\u2019s highest court. The Associated Press has not called the race, for which nearly 5.5 million ballots have been counted. Tens of thousands of additional provisional and absentee ballots still had to be reviewed by county election officials, and the trailing candidate could seek a recount if the final margin is narrow enough.",
      "Riggs' campaign focused on reproductive rights, running ads that said Griffin could be a deciding vote on the 5-2 majority Republican court for further abortion restrictions. Griffin had said it was inappropriate for Riggs to talk about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "Heated bids for a pair of seats on Montana's court were a split decision, with county attorney Cory Swanson defeating former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch for chief justice. State judge Katherine Bidegaray defeated state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups backed Lynch and Bidegaray, casting the races as key to protecting abortion rights in a state where Republicans control the Legislature and the governor's office. Republicans who complained about the court's rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote supported Swanson and Wilson.",
      "A longshot effort by abortion-rights advocates to unseat three justices on Texas' all-Republican Supreme Court fell short, with Jimmy Blacklock, John Devine and Jane Bland winning reelection. The three were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state\u2019s abortion ban.",
      "In Arizona, two justices won retention elections despite efforts to oust them over the court decision that cleared way for a long-dormant 1864 law banning nearly all abortions to be enforced. The state Legislature swiftly repealed it, and voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion access up to fetal viability, typically after 21 weeks.",
      "Conservatives also won in Oklahoma, where voters removed one of three Supreme Court justices appointed by a former Democratic governor who were up for retention. A 5-4 ruling by the court last year overturned a portion of the state\u2019s near total ban on abortion. It was the first time any Oklahoma appellate judge had been removed through a retention election.",
      "An Arkansas justice who wrote a blistering dissent when the court's Republican-backed majority blocked an abortion rights measure from the ballot was elected chief justice. That race, however, won't change the court's majority.",
      "The next big battleground comes next year in Wisconsin, where a race will determine whether liberals maintain their 4-3 majority on the court. The open race for retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley's seat comes after the court flipped from conservative control in a 2023 election marked by record-breaking spending.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like state Supreme Court elections are going to go back to the way they were 10 years ago anytime soon,\u201d said Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the judiciary program at the Brennan Center, which has tracked spending on state court races.",

      "Abortion rights advocates prevailed in ballot measures in seven states, but that doesn't resolve the issue",
      "WASHINGTON -- Abortion rights advocates prevailed on seven ballot measures across the U.S. in Tuesday's election and lost on three.",
      "The losses are the first on statewide reproductive rights ballot measures anywhere in the U.S. since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a ruling that struck down the nearly 50-year nationwide right to abortion, proving that abortion opponents can win on ballot measures.",
      "There were firsts on the other sides, too: Three amendments call for rolling back abortion bans, including one in Missouri that bars it at all stages of pregnancy with exceptions only under limited circumstances to save the life of the woman.",
      "Here's a look at takeaways from the results.",
      "Missouri is the most populous state where a ballot measure could roll back a current ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy.",
      "But the work isn\u2019t done there.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri filed in a state court Wednesday seeking to invalidate the state's abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead, the measure left it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood leaders said Wednesday on a Zoom call with reporters that they want to start offering abortions at clinics in Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis if they get the judicial ruling they're requesting \u2014 starting with blocking enforcement of laws on the book.",
      "\"This is only the first step to realizing and fully implementing the protections of Amendment 3. It\u2019s certainly not the last step,\u201d said Richard Muniz, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.",
      "Clinics had stopped providing abortions in Missouri even before the state\u2019s ban took effect in 2022. They said a list of regulations made it impossible for them to operate. In its legal filing, the Planned Parenthood affiliate that covers much of the state says the onerous requirements include clinicians who provide abortion have surgical licenses and that they conduct pelvic exams on all patients \u2014 even if they offer only medication abortions.",
      "\u201cSome of these patients choose medication abortion precisely because they do not want instruments inserted into their vagina,\u201d Dr. Selina Sandoval, an associate medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a legal filing. \u201cI cannot and will not subject my patients to unnecessary exams.\u201d",
      "Planned Parenthood also objects to laws requiring clinicians to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, mandating a 72-hour waiting period for abortions and banning telemedicine for abortion. Besides the ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, the group is calling for having other bans that kick in after eight, 14, 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to be struck down.",
      "Abortion rights advocates heralded victories at the ballot box as a signal of widespread support for abortion rights, even in conservative states.",
      "The three states where abortion measures were defeated had special circumstances that weren't present in the others.",
      "In Florida, the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment is 60% while most states require a simple majority. Most voters supported adding abortion rights \u2014 but it fell short of the requirement.",
      "There, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, also presented a challenge to proponents by steering state GOP funds to counter the measure and defending a state agency for publishing a webpage attacking it, among other government efforts.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure is different from the others because it would have allowed the state to regulate abortion in the second trimester \u2014 but only in ways that protect the health of the woman. Because of that provision, most national abortion rights groups did not put money into promoting it, which could have been a factor in its failure in a conservative state.",
      "In Nebraska, both sides had questions on the ballot. Voters passed the one that bars abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 which is in line with current state law \u2014 and also allows the possibility of more stringent bans. They also rejected the measure that aimed to enshrine into the state constitution the right to abortion until viability, which is considered to be sometime after 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there's not a fixed time.",
      "Abortion rights advocates condemned the novel strategy by anti-abortion groups of putting a competing measure on the ballot as an attempt to confuse voters. The approach was considered by anti-abortion groups elsewhere.",
      "Republican Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency, despite his consistently shifting stances on reproductive rights.",
      "If Republicans win the House, in addition to their victories in the Senate and White House, it could open the door to the passage of a national ban.",
      "Trump has said he would veto a national ban, despite previously declining to answer questions about it.",
      "But Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as \u201cminimum national standards\u201d in order to distort their own stances on the issue, given the political unpopularity of the GOP\u2019s position on abortion.",
      "Judicial appointments have already shaped the national abortion landscape. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned Roe v. Wade. It's not just the Supreme Court. Trump-nominated U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has issued rulings with nationwide consequences, including one impacting access to the abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "Through executive power, a president could also restrict abortion pills sent through the mail and declare that a law that requires doctors to stabilize emergency room patients does not require them to provide abortion. A new administration could also pull back on a federal lawsuit that challenges aspects of Idaho's ban.",
      "One interpretation of the presence of some of the ballot measures was that they were put up in part to drive turnout of Democratic voters in candidate elections.",
      "If that was the plan \u2014 and some abortion rights advocates say it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t seem to sway other statewide races.",
      "The mostly Republican states of Montana and Missouri passed abortion rights protections and also elected GOP candidates for president, U.S. Senate and governor.",
      "In Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy defeated three-term incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, who attempted to pair his campaign with the abortion rights push.",
      "Three other Republican states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 rejected abortion ballot measures and supported Trump for president and GOP senators where they were on the ballot.",
      "The Democratic states of Colorado and Maryland expanded abortion rights and voted for Democrats in statewide elections. The same is true in New York, where the ballot measure bars discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and does not mention abortion specifically \u2014 but was championed by abortion rights advocates, who say it will preserve access.",
      "The measures also passed in Arizona and Nevada, where the presidential and U.S. Senate races had not been called by midday Wednesday.",
      "Democrats in the most competitive Senate races centered their closing argument and ads around abortion, an issue they hoped to capitalize on after it has previously motivated voters up and down the ballot. But abortion rights failed to put them over the top \u2014 including in Montana.",
      "Texas Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat, failed in his bid to defeat Sen. Ted Cruz after investing $5 million in an ad campaign focused on abortion and invoking the issue in campaign trail speeches and during an October debate. Allred leaned on the personal stories of Texas women impacted by the state's abortion ban that have sparked national outrage.",
      "In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno defeated incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown after Brown and his allies pounced on cellphone video that emerged late in the campaign showing Moreno criticizing suburban women who base their votes on abortion rights.",
      "A hotly contested race between Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican Eric Hovde has also focused heavily on abortion and appeared to be close enough early Wednesday for a recount to be requested.",
      "In the Texas city of Amarillo, located in the state\u2019s conservative Panhandle region, voters overwhelming rejected an anti-abortion proposal that would have essentially banned travel for those seeking abortions out of state by allowing civil lawsuits against anyone who helps a local resident obtain an abortion.",
      "The \u201cSanctuary Cities for the Unborn\u201d ordinance was rejected by nearly 60% of voters.",
      "\u201cWe hope to set the tone for not only the state, but the nation, that we will not penalize anyone for seeking health care when they\u2019re facing an extreme travel ban in their own state,\" said Lindsay London, a nurse who helped found a group to oppose the effort.",

      "\u201cIt was never my intention to misinterpret this deeply painful issue,\" he said. \"Together with my publishers we have decided to withdraw the book from sale.\u201d",
      "Indigenous campaigners were particularly aghast that neither Oliver nor his publishers, Penguin Random House, had consulted with them before the novel was published.",
      "\u201cIt is clear that our publishing standards fell short on this occasion, and we must learn from that and take decisive action,\u201d the publisher said. \"With that in mind, we have agreed with our author, Jamie Oliver, that we will be withdrawing the book from sale.\u201d",
      "Oliver, who is in Australia promoting his latest recipe book, is among a long list of celebrities to have put their names to children's books, a trend that has been criticized by many children's authors, who say they are being crowded out of their market.",
      "Oliver released his first children\u2019s book, \u201cBilly And The Giant Adventure,\u201d last year and said in a social media post that he had \u201ccarefully chosen the font to make sure the text is as clear as possible\u201d as dyslexic people like himself can find it hard to read.",
      "Oliver, who rose to fame in 1999 with his book and television show \u201cThe Naked Chef,\u201d has long campaigned on children\u2019s food and nutrition and caused a furor in 2005 when he hit out at the nutritional content of some school dinners in the U.K."

      "The Israeli airstrike in Lebanon killed at least 23 people, including seven children, in Aalmat village north of Beirut, far from the areas in the east and south where Hezbollah has a major presence. There was no Israeli evacuation warning. Israel\u2019s military said that it hit a Hezbollah site used to store weapons, and the strike was under review.",
      "Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel after war broke out in Gaza, in solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas. Israel retaliated, and a series of escalations have led to all-out war.",
      "In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people, including nine women, according to Dr. Fadel Naim, director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City.",
      "Israel's military said that it targeted a site where militants were operating, without providing evidence. It said the details of the strike were under review.",
      "A separate strike hit a house in Gaza City, killing Wael al-Khour, a minister in the Hamas-run government, as well as his wife and three children, according to the Civil Defense first responders who operate under the government.",
      "Israel has struck deeper inside Lebanon since September, when it killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire from northern to central Israel. The fighting has killed more than 3,100 people in Lebanon, according to the Health Ministry, and more than 70 people in Israel.",
      "After Israel's strike in Aalmat, around 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Beirut, legislator Raed Berro denied that any Hezbollah personnel or assets were in the building hit.",
      "\u201cEveryone can see, in front of cameras, that what is being pulled from under the rubble are women, children and elderly people who have nothing to do with weapons or rocket warehouses,\" Berro said.",
      "Hassan Ghaddaf, who lived next door and was slightly wounded while heading to his balcony with morning coffee, said displaced people were in the building.",
      "\u201cI had seen them and got to know them the other day,\u201d Ghaddaf said. \u201cThey were peaceful. On the contrary, they had someone from the Lebanese Internal Security Forces that works for the state, and we saw their garb and clothes in the rubble.\u201d",
      "In Syria, an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in the Damascus suburb of Sayyida Zeinab, and the Defense Ministry said that seven civilians were killed, state news agency SANA reported. Britain-based opposition war monitor The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights suggested that Hezbollah was targeted. Israel didn't immediately comment.",
      "The mid-month deadline is approaching for the Biden administration's ultimatum for Israel: Allow more aid into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding.",
      "Israeli forces have encircled and largely isolated Jabaliya and the nearby northern Gaza towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun for the past month, allowing only a trickle of humanitarian aid. Experts from a panel that monitors food security say famine is imminent or may already be happening.",
      "The northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, has suffered the heaviest destruction of the 13-month war. Israel has sent forces back in, saying Hamas has regrouped.",
      "Israeli strikes often kill women and children. The military says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians.",
      "Also on Sunday, Israel's military released what it called footage of Hamas abusing detainees. The soundless footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, appears to show hooded detainees chained in stress positions. In some clips, men beat or poke them with batons. It wasn't possible to independently verify the videos, which the military said that it recovered during operations in Gaza.",
      "Rights groups have long accused the Hamas-run government in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank of abusing detainees and violently quashing dissent. Israel has been accused of similar abuses, especially since the start of the war. Israeli prison authorities say they follow relevant laws and investigate allegations of wrongdoing.",
      "The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted about 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third believed to be dead.",
      "Israel's offensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities who don't distinguish between civilians and militants in their count, but say more than half the dead were women and children.",
      "Israeli bombardment and ground invasions have left vast areas of Gaza in ruins and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands live in tent camps with few if any services.",
      "Cease-fire talks mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled, as have parallel efforts by the U.S. and others to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, said Saturday that it had suspended its efforts and would resume them when \u201cthe parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war.\u201d",
      "Some Palestinians in Gaza responded with frustration.",

      "The head of the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog says he will travel to Iran in the coming days to hold talks regarding the country\u2019s nuclear program",
      "VIENNA -- The head of the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog said Sunday he will travel to Iran in the coming days to hold talks regarding the country's nuclear program. The visit comes amid wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the Israel-Hamas war and uncertainty over how U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will approach Iran after his inauguration in January.",
      "Specifically, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mariano Grossi, will have high level meetings with the Iranian government and will hold technical discussions on all aspects related to the joint statement agreed with Iran in March 2023.",
      "It is intended as a path forward for cooperation between the IAEA and Iran on how to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic\u2019s rapidly advancing atomic program.",
      "The 2023 statement included a pledge by Iran to resolve issues around sites where inspectors have questions about possible undeclared nuclear activity, and to allow the IAEA to \u201cimplement further appropriate verification and monitoring activities.\u201d",
      "The meetings in Tehran will build on Grossi's discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September, a statement by the IAEA said.",
      "\u201cIt is essential that we make substantive progress in the implementation of the joint statement agreed with Iran in March 2023,\" Grossi said. \u201cMy visit to Tehran will be very important in that regard.\u201d",
      "Iran is rapidly advancing its atomic program and continues to increase its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels in defiance of international demands, according to recent reports by the IAEA.",
      "Grossi, has warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make \u201cseveral\u201d nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran\u2019s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment.",
      "Iran\u2019s 2015 landmark nuclear deal with world powers had put limits on its nuclear program \u2014 which the West fears could be used for making nuclear weapons although Tehran insists is only for peaceful purposes \u2014 while lifting punitive economic sanctions imposed on Iran.",
      "But the deal collapsed after the Trump administration in 2018 pulled the United States out of the agreement, leading Iran to abandon all limits the deal had put on its program and enrich uranium to up to 60% purity.",
      "That is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. By IAEA\u2019s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible.",
      "As Trump is to take office again in a few weeks, Iranians are divided on what his next presidency will bring. Some foresee an all-out war between Tehran and Washington, particularly as other conflicts rage in the region. Others hold out hope that America\u2019s 47th president might engage in unexpected diplomacy as he did with North Korea.",

He was arrested while cycling on a canal towpath in west London three days later after an intense nationwide hunt that included helicopter searches and extra security checks at major transport hubs.",

      "He said he escaped in the hope he would be recaptured and sent to a high-security unit at a different prison, where he thought he would be safer.",
      "His trial continues on the other charges. Prosecutors have told the jury that Khalife joined the army at 16 and was a promising soldier, but was told he would not be able to fulfil his goal of joining an intelligence unit because his mother was from Iran.",
      "Prosecutors allege Khalife passed classified information to an Iranian intelligence agent. He says the information was worthless and he was hoping to act as a double agent on behalf of Britain \u2013 inspired, in part, by a plotline on the TV spy series \u201cHomeland.\u201d",

      "An opponent of vaccines who wrote social media posts urging violence against scientists, politicians and public health officials during the COVID-19 pandemic has been sentenced to five years in prison",
      "LONDON -- An opponent of vaccines who wrote social media posts urging violence against scientists, politicians and public health officials during the COVID-19 pandemic was sentenced Monday to five years in prison after being convicted of encouraging terrorism.",
      "A British judge said 55-year-old Patrick Ruane had a \u201ccompulsive and obsessive\u201d opposition to vaccines and spewed vitriol on the Telegram messaging app. One message described \u201cwhacking\u201d England\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, over the head.",
      "In a series of messages in 2021, Ruane posted that he was \u201call for hunting them down and \u2026 executing\u201d those who made and delivered COVID-19 vaccines. He encouraged others to \u201cfind where they live, put a kill squad together and shoot\u201d them in their beds.",
      "In a discussion about Whitty, the vaccine opponent wrote that hitting someone on the back of the skull with a rounders bat \u2013 similar to a baseball bat \u2013 or a metal mace \u201cwould turn said target into a vegetable for the rest of its life.\u201d",
      "He also called for an \u201cIRA playbook,\u201d a reference to the Irish Republican Army\u2019s bombing and shooting campaign, and advocated blowing up vaccine laboratories and 5G phone towers.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t idle chit-chat online \u2013 he was encouraging people to seriously injure or kill others, suggesting who to target,\" said Acting Commander Gareth Rees of the Metropolitan Police Counterterrorism Command, which began investigating Ruane's posts in 2021.",
      "Prosecutor Julia Faure Walker said the posts reached a \u201cvery large audience\u201d through two Telegram chat groups, one of which had 18,000 users and the other 8,000 users.",
      "Ruane, an audio producer for films, was initially arrested in November 2021 and charged almost two years later. He was convicted at London\u2019s Central Criminal Court in September on two counts of encouraging terrorism.",

      "Four-year-old Hussein Mikdad survived an Israeli airstrike on his home in a Beirut suburb last month",
      "BEIRUT -- Curled up in his father \u2019s lap, clinging to his chest, Hussein Mikdad cried his heart out. The 4-year-old kicked his doctor with his intact foot and pushed him away with the arm that was not in a cast. \u201cMy Dad! My Dad!\" Hussein said. \"Make him leave me alone!\u201d With eyes tearing up in relief and pain, the father reassured his son and pulled him closer.",
      "Hussein and his father, Hassan, are the only survivors of their family after an Israeli airstrike last month on their Beirut neighborhood. The strike killed 18 people, including his mother, three siblings and six relatives.",
      "\u201cCan he now shower?\u201d the father asked the doctor.",
      "Ten days after surgery, doctors examining Hussein's wounds said the boy is healing properly. He has rods in his fractured right thigh and stitches that assembled his torn tendons back in place on the right arm. The pain has subsided, and Hussein should be able to walk again in two months \u2014 albeit with a lingering limp.",
      "A prognosis for Hussein's invisible wounds is much harder to give. He is back in diapers and has begun wetting his bed. He hardly speaks and has not said a word about his mother, two sisters and brother.",
      "\u201cThe trauma is not just on the muscular skeletal aspect. But he is also mentally hurt,\u201d Imad Nahle, one of Hussein\u2019s orthopedic surgeons, said.",
      "Israel said, without elaborating, that the strike on the Mikdad neighborhood struck a Hezbollah target. In the war that has escalated since September, Israeli airstrikes have increasingly hit residential areas around Lebanon. Israel accuses the Lebanese militant group of hiding its capabilities and fighters among civilians. It vows to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "But children have been caught in the midst.",
      "With more strikes on homes and in residential areas, doctors are seeing more children affected by the violence. More than 100 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past six weeks and hundreds injured. And of the 14,000 wounded since last year, around 10% are children. Many have been left with severed limbs, burned bodies, and broken families \u2014 scars that could last for a lifetime.",
      "Ghassan Abu Sittah, a renowned British-Palestinian surgeon who is also treating Hussein, sees that long road ahead. This is his worry: \u201cIt leaves us with a generation of physically wounded children, children who are psychologically and emotionally wounded.\"",
      "At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which is receiving limited cases of war casualties, Nahle said he operated on five children in the past five weeks \u2014 up from no cases before. Most were referred from south and eastern Lebanon.",
      "A few miles away, at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, one of the country\u2019s largest burns centers increased its capacity by nearly 180% since September so it could accommodate more war wounded, its medical director Naji Abirached said. About a fifth of the newly admitted patients are children.",
      "In one of the burn center\u2019s ICU units lies Ivana Skakye. She turned 2 in the hospital ward last week. Ivana has been healing from burns she sustained following an Israeli airstrike outside their home in southern Lebanon on Sept. 23. Israel said it struck ammunition depots and launchers in southern Lebanon that day when its warplanes launched hundreds of airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, making it the deadliest day of the war so far. More than 500 people were killed.",
      "Six weeks later, the tiny Ivana remains wrapped in white gauze from head to toe except her torso. She sustained third-degree burns over 40 percent of her body. Her hair and head, her left side all the way to her legs, both her arms and her chest were burned. Her family home was damaged, its ceiling set afire. The family\u2019s valuables, packed in their car as they prepared to leave, were also torched. Ivana\u2019s older sister, Rahaf, 7, has recovered faster from burns to her face and hands.",
      "Fatima Zayoun, their mother, was in the kitchen when the explosion hit. Zayoun jumped up to grab the girls, who were playing on the terrace.",
      "It was, Zayoun said, \"as if something lifted me up so that I can grab my kids. I have no idea how I managed to pull them in and throw them out of the window. She spoke from the ICU burns unit. \u201cThey were not on fire, but they were burned. Black ash covered them. ... (Ivana) was without any hair. I told myself, `That is not her.'\u201d",
      "Now, Ivana's wound dressings are changed every two days. Her doctor, Ziad Sleiman, said she could be discharged in a few days. She\u2019s back again to saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cBye \u2014 shorthand for wanting to go out.",
      "Like Hussein, though, Ivana has no home to return to. Her parents fear collective shelters could cause an infection to return.",
      "After seeing her kids \u201csizzling on the floor,\u201d Zayoun, 35, said that even if their home is repaired, she wouldn\u2019t want to return. \u201cI saw death with my own eyes,\u201d she said.",
      "Zayoun was 17 last time Israel and Hezbollah were at war, in 2006. Displaced with her family then, she said she almost enjoyed the experience, riding out of their village in a truck full of their belongings, mixing with new people, learning new things. They returned home when the war was over.",
      "\u201cBut this war is hard. They are hitting everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do they want from us? Do they want to hurt our children? We are not what they are looking for.\"",
      "Abu Sittah, the reconstructive surgeon, said most of the children's injuries are from blasts or collapsing rubble. That attack on a space they expect to be inviolable can have lingering effects.",
      "\u201cChildren feel safe at home,\" he said. \"The injury makes them for the first time lose that sense of security \u2014 that their parents are keeping them safe, that their homes are invincible, and suddenly their homes become not so.\u201d",
      "One recent morning, children were playing in the courtyard of a vocational school-turned-shelter in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, where nearly 3,000 people displaced from the south are now living. The parents were busy with an overflowing bathroom that serves one floor in a building that houses nearly 700 people.",
      "Only playtime brings the children, from different villages in the south, together. They were divided in two teams, ages ranging between 6 and 12, competing to get the handkerchief first. A tiny girl hugged and held hands with strangers visiting the shelter. \u201cI am from Lebanon. Don't tell anyone,\u201d she whispered in their ears.",
      "The game turned rowdy when two girls in their early teens got into a fist fight. Pushing and shoving began. Tears and tantrums followed. The tiny girl walked away in a daze.",
      "Maria Elizabeth Haddad, manager of the psychosocial support programs in Beirut and neighboring areas for the U.S.-based International Medical Corps, said parents in shelters reported signs of increased anxiety, hostility and aggression among kids. They talk back to parents and ignore rules. Some have developed speech impediments and clinginess. One is showing early signs of psychosis.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be residual symptoms when they grow up, especially related to attachment ties, to feeling of security,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cIt is a generational trauma. We have experienced it before with our parents. ... They don\u2019t have stability or search for (extra) stability. This is not going to be easy to overcome.\u201d",
      "Children represent more than a third of over 1 million people displaced by the war in Lebanon and following Israeli evacuation notices, according to U.N. and government estimates (more than 60,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel). That leaves hundreds of thousands in Lebanon without schooling, either because their schools were inaccessible or have been turned into shelters.",
      "Hussein's father says he and his son must start together from scratch. With help from relatives, the two have found a temporary shelter in a home \u2014 and, for the father, a brief sense of relief. \u201cI thank God he is not asking for or about his mother and his siblings,\u201d said Hassan Mikdad, the 40-year-old father.",
      "He has no explanation for his son, who watched their family die in their home. His two sisters \u2014 Celine, 10, and Cila, 14 \u2014 were pulled out of the rubble the following day. His mother, Mona, was pulled out three days later. She was locked in an embrace with her 6-year-old son, Ali.",
      "The strike on Oct. 21 also caused damage across the street, to one of Beirut\u2019s main public hospitals, breaking solar panels and windows in the pharmacy and the dialysis unit. The father survived because he had stepped out for coffee. He watched his building crumble in the late-night airstrike. He also lost his shop, his motorcycles and car \u2014 all the evidence of his 16 years of family life.",
      "His friend, Hussein Hammoud, arrived on the scene to help sift through rubble. Hammoud spotted young Hussein Mikdad\u2019s fingers in the darkness in an alley behind their home. At first, he thought they were severed limbs \u2014 until he heard the boy\u2019s screams. He dug out Hussein with glass lodged in his leg and a metal bar in his shoulder. Hammoud said he didn\u2019t recognize the boy. He held the child's almost-severed wrist in place.",
      "In the hospital now, Hussein Mikdad sipped a juice as he listened to his father and his friend. His father turned to him, asking if he wanted a Spider-Man toy \u2014 an effort to forestall a new outburst of tears. He said he buys Hussein a toy each day.",
      "\u201cWhat I am living through seems like a big lie. ...The mind can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank God for the blessing that is Hussein.\u201d"

      "BEIJING -- BEIJING (AP) \u2014 Indonesia's new leader called for collaboration rather than confrontation with China after the signing of $10 billion in new deals at a business forum on Sunday in the Chinese capital before heading to the U.S.",
      "President Prabowo Subianto told the forum that his country wants to be part of China's emergence as not only an economic but also a \u201ccivilizational power.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must give an example that in this modern age, collaboration \u2014 not confrontation \u2014 is the way for peace and prosperity,\u201d he said.",
      "Subianto wrapped up the first stop of his first overseas trip since taking office three weeks ago. He is headed next to Washington \u2014 where the U.S. government is confronting China\u2019s rise \u2014 and then to Peru and Brazil for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and Group of 20 summits.",
      "He and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed Saturday to deepen ties, elevating security to a fifth \u201cpillar\u201d of cooperation in addition to political, economic, maritime and people-to-people exchange. They agreed to hold a first-ever joint meeting of their foreign and defense ministers in 2025, a joint statement said.",
      "\u201cIndonesia is very clear,\" Subianto said. \"We have always been nonaligned, we have always been respectful of all great powers in the world.\u201d",
      "Indonesia has remained on the periphery of the territorial disputes between China and its Southeast Asian neighbors in the South China Sea.

      "Chinese companies have invested heavily in mining in Indonesia, as they have elsewhere in the world. China also helped build Indonesia's first high-speed railway, a 142-kilometer (88-mile) route between Jakarta and Bandung that opened last year.",
      "But a flood of low-priced Chinese products has hit Indonesia's garment makers hard, shuttering factories and prompting calls for import tariffs. The government has sought to placate domestic producers while not angering the country\u2019s biggest trading partner.",

      "A new typhoon has made landfall in the northeastern Philippines, which has been battered by earlier storms",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- A new typhoon barreled across an agricultural region in the northeastern Philippines on Monday after thousands were evacuated to safety while still struggling to recover from the devastation caused by three successive storms in the last three weeks.",
      "Typhoon Toraji slammed into northeastern Aurora province and was forecast to blow over the mountainous Luzon region, where President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. \u2014 just the day before \u2014 inspected the damage from the last storm and led the distribution of food packs to residents in Cagayan and Ilocos provinces. Marcos skipped this week\u2019s Asia-Pacific Cooperation forum in Peru to oversee recovery efforts from back-to-back storms.",
      "After making landfall in Aurora on Monday morning with sustained winds of up to 130 kilometers (81 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 180 kph (112 mph), the typhoon was expected to barrel northwestward across Luzon, weaken as it crosses a mountain range and then blow into the South China Sea.",
      "Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla on Sunday ordered the forcible evacuation of people in 2,500 villages expected to be lashed by Toraji, locally named Nika, warning that the rain-soaked Luzon mountains, valleys and plains were more susceptible to flash floods and landslides. With the typhoon approaching fast, there was little time to move large numbers of people to safety, he said.",
      "\"We understand if some would want to stay, but we have to get them out,\u201d Remulla told reporters.",
      "The military said its disaster-response forces have been deployed near high-risk areas and were standing by for new contingencies. It added that it suspended combat drills in the north due to the weather.",
      "\u201cOur commitment remains steadfast in safeguarding and assisting our countrymen specially in times of disaster,\u201d Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesperson Col. Francel Margareth Padilla said.",
      "Schools were shut down, inter-island ferry services and domestic flights were suspended in provinces in or near the path of the typhoon, the 14th weather disturbance to batter the Philippine archipelago this year. Forecasters said they were monitoring another brewing storm in the Pacific that could affect the country if it strengthens.",
      "The last two typhoons and a tropical storm caused more than 160 deaths, damaged thousands of houses and farmlands and affected more than 9 million people, including hundreds of thousands who fled to emergency shelters, after dumping from one to two months\u2019 worth of rain in just 24 hours in some cities and towns.",
      "Overwhelmed, the Philippines received help from Southeast Asian countries led by Singapore, along with longtime treaty ally the United States, to transport food, water and other aid to hard-hit northern provinces.",
      "The Philippine archipelago is often battered by typhoons and earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the most natural disaster-prone countries in the world.",
      "In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines."

      "Yiannis Boutaris was a winemaker who served two terms as mayor of Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second largest city, and shook up its conservative image",
      "THESSALONIKI, Greece -- Yiannis Boutaris, a winemaker who served two terms as mayor of Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second largest city, and shook its conservative image, died Saturday evening, his company Kir-Yianni announced on social media.",
      "No cause of death was given, but his health had been declining. A couple weeks ago he had undergone a hip operation, was discharged but readmitted to hospital a few days before his death.",
      "The announcement, written by his two sons, who run the winemaking company, called him \u201clarger than life, visionary, charismatic, innovator, maverick.\u201d Maverick he undoubtedly was.",
      "Politicians across the spectrum paid tribute to Boutaris, emphasizing his passionate and non-conformist personality.",
      "Boutaris, a progressive man who eschewed party labels, was involved in local politics late in life, being elected municipal councilor at age 60. He first ran for mayor in 2006, coming third, before running a successful campaign in 2010. His supporters ranged from leftists to moderate conservatives, and he won by a whisker in a city where hardline conservatives had held the mayor\u2019s office for 24 years. In 2014, he won reelection with 58% of the vote.",
      "After a four-year hiatus, he was elected municipal councilor again in 2023, serving until his death.",
      "\u201cHe was the daring visionary who fought with all his might to bring the city back in touch with its rich multicultural, colorful and cosmopolitan past,\u201d said current Thessaloniki mayor Stelios Angeloudis.",
      "As mayor of a city close to other Balkan countries, Boutaris worked on good neighborly relations.",
      "He sought to attract Turkish tourists to the city where the Turkish Republic\u2019s founder, Kemal Ataturk, was born. He invited Zoran Zaev, the prime minister of what was then The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, to dinner on New Year\u2019s Day 2017, paving the way for an agreement between the countries that ended a decades-long dispute over the name Macedonia, and after which Greece\u2019s northern neighbor adopted the name North Macedonia. He also emphasized the city\u2019s strong Jewish heritage, playing an important role in building the Holocaust Museum.",
      "These moves were sometimes resented by the city\u2019s nationalist element, including the Orthodox Church. Boutaris did not shy from confrontation, leading the city\u2019s archbishop, Anthimos, to name-call him during a church service in October 2010, telling him that without the Church\u2019s support he could not hope to be elected mayor. Nineteen days later, he was.",
      "In May 2018, a gang of nationalists attacked Boutaris, slightly injuring him. Nine persons, including a police officer, were convicted for the attack five years later.",
      "\u201cMy views on gay pride and North Macedonia caused great enmity and personal hatred,\u201d he had said in an interview.",
      "Before he delved into politics, Boutaris had made his name in the winemaking business founded by his grandfather. Business differences with his brother led him to quit the family business in 1996 and start his own, Kir-Yianni (\u201cMr. Yiannis\u201d) winery.",
      "Boutaris was also an active environmentalist, founding an NGO, Arktouros, initially aiming to protect the country\u2019s brown bears, but whose sanctuary eventually took on many other species. He was also involved in his beloved Aris Thessaloniki sports club. The club\u2019s professional basketball team said he was a major provider of funds during the club\u2019s golden era in the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "In 2021, he published a well-received memoir, \u201c60 Years of Harvests,\u201d in which he was open about his struggles with alcoholism. He had stayed sober since 1991.",
      "Besides his two sons, his survivors include a daughter and six grandchildren.",
      "His family announced that he will be cremated Tuesday. No religious service will take place.",

It has revived fears of violence after a period of peace following a successful operation launched in 2020 by the Chadian army to destroy the extremist groups' bases.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. researchers have concluded that China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor to power future aircraft carriers",
      "Bangkok -- China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing the country\u2019s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California is the first to confirm it is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \u201cblue-water\u201d force capable of operating around the globe in a growing challenge to the United States.",
      "Nuclear carriers take longer to build than conventional carriers, but once in operation they are able to stay at sea for much longer because they do not need to refuel, and there is more room on board for fuel and weapons for aircraft, thus extending their capabilities. They are also able to produce more power to run advanced systems.",
      "Right now, only the United States and France have nuclear-powered carriers. The U.S. has 11 in total, which allows it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "China currently has three carriers, including the new Type 003 Fujian, which was the first both designed and built by China. It has said work is already underway on a fourth, but it has not announced whether that will be nuclear or conventionally powered.",
      "The modernization aligns with China\u2019s \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\u201d for its navy \u201cto operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China\u2019s military.",
      "Middlebury researchers were initially investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan over suspicions that China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons. Instead they said they determined that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship.",
      "The conclusion was based upon a wide variety of sources, including satellite images, project tenders, personnel files, and environmental impact studies.",
      "The reactor is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship.\u201d as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizeable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \u201cfirst-class\u201d navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s great rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \u201cspeeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\u201d",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the new Fujian aircraft carrier in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \u201csoon be announced,\u201d but so far it has not been.",
      "Neither China's Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "Even if the carrier that has been started will likely be another conventionally-powered Type 003 ship, experts say Chinese shipyards have the capability to work on more than one carrier at a time, and that they could produce a new nuclear-powered vessel concurrently.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico is facing a second Donald Trump presidency, and few countries can match its experience as a target of Trump's rhetoric: There have been threats to close the border, impose tariffs and even send U.S. forces to fight Mexican drug cartels if the country doesn\u2019t do more to stem the flow of migrants and drugs.",
      "That\u2019s not to mention what mass deportations of migrants who are in the U.S. illegally could do to remittances \u2014 the money sent home by migrants \u2014 that have become one of Mexico\u2019s main sources of income.",
      "But as much as this second round looks like the first round \u2014 when Mexico pacified Trump by quietly ceding to his immigration demands \u2014 circumstances have changed, and not necessarily for the better. Today, Mexico has in Claudia Sheinbaum a somewhat stern leftist ideologue as president, and Trump is not known for handling such relations well.",
      "Back in 2019, Mexico\u2019s then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, plain-spoken, folksy leader who seemed to understand Trump, because both had a transactional view of politics: You give me what I want, I\u2019ll give you what you want. The two went on to form a chummy relationship.",
      "But while L\u00f3pez Obrador was forged in the give-and-take politics of the often-corrupt former ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Sheinbaum grew up in a family of leftist activists and got her political experience in radical university student movements.",
      "\u201cClaudia is more ideological than L\u00f3pez Obrador, and so the problem is that I see her potentially responding to Trumpian policies, whether it\u2019s, you know, organized crime or immigration or tariffs with a much more nationalistic, jingoistic view of the relationship,\u201d said Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S. from 2007 to 2013.",
      "Sheinbaum made a point of being one of the first world leaders to call Trump on Thursday to congratulate him after the election, but during the call Trump did two things that may say a lot about how things will go.",
      "First, Sheinbaum said, Trump quickly brought up the border to remind her there were issues there. Then he asked Sheinbaum to send his greetings to L\u00f3pez Obrador, with whom Trump said he had \u201ca very good relationship.\u201d That might suggest that Trump believes that L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2014 the new president's political mentor \u2014 is still in charge, a view shared by some analysts.",
      "Sarukhan said he believes the fact that Sheinbaum is a woman and is from Mexico will be \"a very important challenge, an issue out there as both of them get going in their relationship.\u201d",
      "There's little likelihood that Trump will get caught up in other issues and just forget about Mexico. Karoline Leavitt, the Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman, said Trump had been given \"a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver.\u201d",
      "Not everything has changed for the worse: Cross-border trade has topped $800 billion per year and U.S. companies are more dependent than ever on Mexican plants.",
      "But the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, or USMCA, is coming up for review, and Mexico has made legal changes that Trump could seize on to demand a re-negotiation of parts of the deal.",
      "Sheinbaum has suggested Mexico won't give in even if backed into a corner, saying \u201cwe obviously are going to address any problems that come up with dialogue, as a collaborative process, and if not, we are going to stand up, we are prepared to do that with great unity.\u201d",
      "Standing up hasn\u2019t worked particularly well before. In 2018, Marcelo Ebrard was Mexico\u2019s top diplomat; former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Ebrard basically bent to U.S. demands to keep asylum seekers in Mexico and accept migrants back even if they weren\u2019t Mexicans.",
      "Ebrard just asked that the deal not be made public to avoid embarrassing L\u00f3pez Obrador, Pompeo wrote. (Ebrard later claimed he had avoided signing a much worse \"safe third country\u2019\" agreement.)",
      "Today, Ebrard is Mexico\u2019s economy secretary, and would lead Mexico\u2019s delegation in the scheduled 2026 review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, something that Trump has greeted with mirth (\"I've never seen anybody fold like that,\" Trump once said of Ebrard.)",
      "Ebrard on Thursday downplayed any risks this time around, saying e conomic ties between the two countries would keep Trump from closing borders or imposing tariffs.",
      "\u201cI am optimistic. Unlike other countries, we are the largest trading partner (of the U.S.), so, if you put up a tariff, that will have repercussions in the United States,\u201d Ebrard said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it is going to be easy, because it is not at all easy, but the relationship with President Trump will be good because, what unites us? These numbers, this gigantic economy.\u201d",
      "But some former diplomats say any argument that Mexico can avoid friction with the Trump administration is overconfident, and that 2025 is not necessarily going to be like 2019.",
      "Martha B\u00e1rcena, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. from 2018 to 2021, said she doesn't think Trump would back away from campaign promises to deport migrants who are in the country illegally. She said Mexican officials who believe Trump might temper his \u201ccampaign promises because Mexican migrants are necessary for the U.S. economy\u201d are being overly optimistic.",
      "\u201cMexico is looking at it through the lens of economic logic. The logic that the Trump campaign applies on immigration is a logic of national security and cultural identity issues,\" B\u00e1rcena said.",
      "Some of Trump's biggest policy concerns \u2013 restoring U.S. jobs and the increasing rivalry with China \u2014 also run through Mexico.",
      "U.S. and foreign automakers have set up dozens of plants in Mexico, and some in the U.S. worry that Chinese companies could do the same to take advantage of existing trade rules to export Chinese cars or auto parts to the United States.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help that Sheinbaum has pushed through L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies aimed at eliminating independent regulatory and oversight bodies, and laws the U.S. government says could reduce the independence of the judiciary, both of which are required under the USMCA trade agreement.",
      "\u201cIf they go ahead with the elimination of independent regulators and autonomous bodies, that\u2019s going to be a further violation of the USMCA,\u201d Sarukhan said. \u201cAnd then that\u2019s going to make things even worse. Obviously, the big piece is going to be China and the Chinese footprint in Mexico.\u201d",
      "That could lead Trump to demand the re-negotiation of all auto industry agreements under the trade pact.",
      "As far as efforts to jointly combat the illegal drug trade \u2014 such cooperation fell to historic lows in 2019 and 2020 \u2014 there have been some modestly encouraging signs. Last week, Mexico announced the seizure in Tijuana of over 300,000 fentanyl pills after months when t he country\u2019s entire seizures had amounted to as little as 50 grams \u2014 a couple of ounces \u2014 per week.",
      "Sheinbaum, who took office on Oct. 1, also appears to be tacitly abandoning L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s strategy of not confronting drug cartels. But neither she nor her predecessor and political mentor could ever accept any Trump plan to send U.S. forces to operate independently on Mexican soil.",
      "It remains to see how far Trump might go; he often makes only token gestures to carry through on threats. But Sarukhan noted, \u201cI do think that he will talk loudly and carry a big stick.\u201d",

      "Jugnauth, in office since 2017, had been seeking another five-year term in the Indian Ocean island nation, but his government faced corruption allegations after recordings of politicians and business people were leaked online.",
      "The Alliance for Change coalition, led by former prime minister Navin Ramgoolam, appeared poised for victory. They had no immediate comment.",
      "\u201cThe population has decided to choose another team. I wish good luck to the country,\u201d Jugnauth said.",
      "Final results were expected later Monday.",
      "At least 1 million people were registered to vote in the 12th election since Mauritius gained independence from Britain in 1968. Mauritians were voting for 62 seats in Parliament, and the party or alliance with a majority forms the government and chooses the prime minister.",
      "Mauritius, about 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) off Africa\u2019s east coast, has developed a successful economy underpinned by its finance, tourism and agricultural sectors. It was briefly rated a high-income country in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic set back its tourism sector.",

      "The head of the Church of England, spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, is under pressure to resign after an investigation found he failed to inform police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as...",
      "LONDON -- The head of the Church of England, spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, is under pressure to resign after an investigation found that he failed to inform police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it.",
      "Some members of the General Synod, the church\u2019s national assembly, have started a petition calling on Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby to step down, saying he had \u201clost the confidence of his clergy.\u201d The petition had garnered more than 1,800 signatures on Change.org by late morning London time on Monday.",
      "Compounding the pressure, a senior cleric added her voice to those who believe he should resign. Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, told the BBC that Welby\u2019s position is \u201cuntenable.''",
      "Calls for Welby\u2019s resignation have grown since Thursday, when the church released the results of an independent review into John Smyth, who sexually, psychologically and physically abused about 30 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and 85 in Africa over five decades.",
      "The 251-page report concluded that Welby failed to report Smyth to authorities when he was informed of the abuse in August 2013, soon after he became Archbishop of Canterbury.",
      "Welby last week took responsibility for not ensuring that the allegations were pursued as \u201cenergetically\u201d as they should have been after he learned of the abuse, but said he had decided not to resign.",
      "On Monday, his office issued a statement reiterating Welby\u2019s \u201chorror at the scale of John Smyth\u2019s egregious abuse.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs he has said, he had no awareness or suspicion of the allegations before he was told in 2013 \u2014 and therefore, having reflected, he does not intend to resign,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe hopes the Makin Review supports the ongoing work of building a safer church here and around the world.\u201d",
      "Church officials were first made aware of the abuse in 1982, when they received the results of an internal investigation into Smyth. The recipients of that report \u201cparticipated in an active cover-up\u201d to prevent its findings from coming to light, the Makin Review found.",
      "Between 1984 and 2001, Smyth moved to Zimbabwe and subsequently relocated to South Africa. He continued to abuse boys and young men in Zimbabwe and there is evidence that the abuse continued in South Africa until he died in August 2018.",
      "Smyth\u2019s abuse wasn\u2019t made public until a 2017 investigation by Britain\u2019s Channel 4 television, which led Hampshire Police to start an investigation. Police were planning to question Smyth at the time of his death and had been preparing to extradite him.",
      "The Makin Review found that if Smyth had been reported to police in 2013, it could have helped to uncover the truth, prevented further abuse and led to a possible criminal conviction.",
      "\u201cIn effect, three and a half years was lost, a time within which John Smyth could have been brought to justice and any abuse he was committing in South Africa discovered and stopped,\u201d the review found.",
      "The Archbishop of Canterbury is the head of the Church of England and is seen as the spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion, which has more than 85 million members in 165 countries. He is considered first among equals with respect to the communion\u2019s other primates.",

      "A massive drone strike has rattled Moscow and its suburbs, injuring several people and temporarily halting traffic at some of Russia\u2019s busiest airports",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A massive drone strike rattled Moscow and its suburbs overnight into Sunday, injuring several people and temporarily halting traffic at some of Russia's busiest airports, officials reported. Meanwhile, a huge nighttime wave of Russian drones targeted Ukraine.",
      "This came after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a pact with North Korea Saturday night, obliging the two countries to provide immediate military aid using \u201call means\u201d if either is attacked. The agreement marks the strongest link between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War.",
      "Earlier this week, Ukraine reported that its troops engaged for the first time with North Korean units. U.S. officials earlier confirmed the deployment of at least 3,000 North Korean troops to Russia, while Kyiv has repeatedly said the number is far higher. This has fueled concerns of a marked escalation in Moscow's war on Ukraine, and tensions spilling over into the Asia-Pacific.",
      "Both Moscow and Kyiv have kept a tight lid on casualty figures since the start of the full-scale war despite regular reports of Russian forces taking huge losses following \u201chuman wave\u201d attacks that aim to exhaust Ukrainian defenses.",
      "However, the chief of the U.K. defense staff, Tony Radakin, told the BBC that Russian forces had suffered their worst month of casualties in October since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He said Moscow\u2019s troops suffered an average of 1,500 dead and wounded per day, bringing their total losses in the war to 700,000.",
      "According to Radakin, ordinary Russians were paying \u201can extraordinary price\u201d for the war, even as a grueling, monthslong Russian offensive in Ukraine\u2019s industrial east continues to eke out gains. He did not say how U.K. officials had calculated the Russian casualty figures.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine,\u201d he said. But he added that they were \u201ctiny increments of land,\u201d and Moscow\u2019s mounting defense and security spending was putting an increasing strain on the country.",
      "Radakin insisted that Ukraine\u2019s Western partners should stand by it for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d to beat back Russian aggression, even as allies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have signaled that Kyiv may have to cede territory to seek peace.",
      "On Sunday, the Kremlin\u2019s official spokesman voiced cautious optimism about Trump\u2019s upcoming presidency, saying: \u201cAt least he talks about peace. \u2026 He does not talk about confrontation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe signals are positive. Trump, during his election campaign, said that he perceives everything through deals, that he can make deals that will lead everyone toward peace,\u201d Dmitry Peskov told reporters at a briefing.",
      "\u201cHe does not talk about a desire to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, and this favorably distinguishes him from the current (U.S.) administration,\u201d Peskov said.",

      "Fierce fighting has continued near the eastern Ukrainian cities of Toretsk and Kurakhove, Ukraine\u2019s General Staff reported Sunday. Between 700 and 1,000 residents remain in Kurakhove, a front-line city surrounded on three sides and battered into ruin. Most of them live underground with no running water, heating or electricity.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said a total of 84 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight in Russian territory, following what it called a \u201cmass strike on civilian infrastructure.\" A man died under rubble after drones struck his apartment block in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, just kilometers from the Ukrainian border, local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported.",
      "Five other people were injured in the Moscow suburb of Ramenskoe and a nearby village, according to local officials. Russian channels on the messaging app Telegram carried eyewitness reports of drone debris setting fire to suburban homes.",
      "Russia's aviation authority said flights were briefly grounded at major international airports including Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo. At least 14 flights bound for Moscow were rerouted to Nizhnyi Novgorod, a city over 490 kilometers (300 miles) east, airport representatives there reported.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s General Staff claimed on Sunday that Ukrainian drones caused a fire at an arms depot in Russia\u2019s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine and Belarus. The online update featured a photo showing thick plumes of reddish smoke rising into the night sky. The AP could not verify the circumstances in which it was taken, and there was no immediate comment from Russia.",
      "Separately, Russia\u2019s emergencies ministry on Sunday said that a major fire broke out at a warehouse outside of Moscow. There were no immediate reports of casualties, and it was not clear whether the blaze was linked to the Ukrainian drone strikes.",
      "Russia overnight launched a \u201crecord\u201d 145 drones at Ukrainian territory, according to Ukraine\u2019s air force, 62 of which were shot down. A further 67 were \u201clost,\u201d the air force said, a likely reference to electronic jamming that caused the drones to veer off course.",
      "At least one person was injured as Russian drones struck residential areas in Ukraine\u2019s southern port of Odesa, local Gov. Oleh Kiper reported.

      "The decree, set to be published on Monday, was provided to The Associated Press by a government source. It marks even more turmoil in an already rocky democratic transition process for Haiti, which hasn\u2019t held democratic elections in years in a large part due to the soaring levels of gang violence plaguing the Caribbean nation.",

The businessman studied at Boston University and was previously considered for the position as a private sector candidate for the post before Conille took the seat.",

      "The transitional presidential council was established in April, tasked with choosing Haiti\u2019s next prime minister and Cabinet with the hope that it would help quell turmoil Haiti. But the council has been plagued with politics and infighting, and has long been at odds with Conille. Organizations like the Organization of American States tried and failed last week to mediate disagreements in an attempt to save the fragile transition, according to The Miami Herald.",

    "story": [
      "For the first time, a group of U.S. researchers has concluded that China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor to power future aircraft carriers",
      "BANGKOK -- China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \"blue-water\u201d force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States.",
      "\u201cNuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\u201d said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \u201cFor China\u2019s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country\u2019s global image as a leading power.\u201d",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",
      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China\u2019s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\u201cThe reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\u201d",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles (112 kilometers) southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship\u201d under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \u201cnational defense-related construction project\u201d that is classified \u201csecret.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\u201d researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \u201cconvincing argument.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\u201d she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \u201ccarefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\u201d",
      "\u201cGiven the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\u201d said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \u201cski-jump\u201d type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \u201csoon be announced,\u201d but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \u201cincremental improvements.\u201d",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \u201chave taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\u201d",
      "Eventually, however, \u201clarger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\u201d Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\u201cAs well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\u201d Childs said.",
      "\u201cMuch will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\u201d",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \u201cwith greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\u201d said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\u201cThese carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\u201d Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \u201cfirst-class\u201d navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \u201cspeeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\u201d",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \u201cgrowing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China\u2019s shore,\u201d the report said.",

      "International mega banks, funded by taxpayer dollars, are the biggest, fastest-growing source of climate finance for the developing world",
      "As climate change leads to a seemingly endless stream of weather disasters around the world, countries are struggling to adapt to the new reality. Preparing to better withstand hurricanes, floods, heat waves, droughts and wildfires will take hundreds of billions of dollars.",
      "And then there is confronting the root cause of climate change \u2014 the burning of fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil \u2014 by transitioning to clean energies like wind and solar.",
      "That will take trillions of dollars.",
      "Enter climate finance, a term for how to pay for projects to adapt to and combat the cause of climate change. It's especially important for developing countries, which don't have the same resources or access to credit that rich countries do.",
      "International mega banks, funded by taxpayer dollars, are the biggest, fastest-growing source of climate finance for the developing world. Called multilateral development banks because they get contributions from various countries, there are only a handful of these banks in the world, the World Bank the largest among them.",
      "The banks were a key reason why, in 2022, the world met a goal countries had set in 2009 to supply developing nations with $100 billion annually to address climate change.",
      "At the annual U.N. climate conference that opens Monday in Azerbaijan, global leaders are expected to discuss how to generate trillions of dollars for climate finance. The nonprofit research group Climate Policy Initiative estimates the world needs about five times the current annual amount of climate financing to limit warming to 1.5 C (2.7 degrees F) since the late 1800s. Currently, global average temperatures are about 1.3 C (2.3 degrees F) higher.",
      "A new goal needs to reach higher and hold institutions and governments accountable to their promises, said Tim Hirschel-Burns, an expert at Boston University's Global Development Policy Center.",
      "\"The core of it is getting a goal that is going to catalyze the actions that fills the really significant climate finance gap,\u201d he said.",
      "The debate has also shifted to the question of where the money will come from, said Dharshan Wignarajah, director of Climate Policy Initiative\u2019s London-based office.",
      "\u201cUltimately it comes down to who pays,\u201d said Wignarajah, who helped lead the climate talks, called the Conference of Parties, when the United Kingdom was host in 2021. \u201cThat has forced finance to be ever-more prominent at the COP discussions.\u201d",
      "Developing nations are much more reliant on these banks for financing climate projects than industrialized countries.",
      "In the U.S. and Canada, commercial banks and corporations provided funding for more than half of climate-friendly projects in 2022, according to Climate Policy Initiative. In sub-Saharan Africa, those private lenders only accounted for 7%.",
      "This is because it is harder for developing countries to get low interest rates.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re Kenya, and you want to borrow from private lenders, they might charge you 10% interest rates because your credit rating isn\u2019t very good,\u201d Hirschel-Burns said.",
      "But the multilateral banks have better credit ratings than many countries do. For example, the International Development Association \u2014 an arm of the World Bank and the top international aid provider to Kenya \u2014 has the highest possible rating from Moody\u2019s Investor Service, while Kenya itself has a junk rating.",
      "The banks borrow money with that better rating, then lend to developing countries in turn, offering a more reasonable rate than governments could get if they borrowed directly from private lenders.",
      "The multilateral banks\u2019 development seek to improve people's health and the environment, expand energy access and end poverty. It means the banks have also provided billions of dollars for fossil fuel power plants, according to an AP analysis, though their policies have improved and fewer such projects have been funded in recent years.",
      "Investment in fossil fuels continues to rise worldwide, reaching $1.1 trillion in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency. And multilateral banks continue to rank among the biggest funders of fossil fuel-prolonging projects, helping to \u201clock in a high-carbon pathway\u201d for countries, according to a report by the Clean Air Fund, which lobbies for the funding of projects to improve air quality.",
      "\u201cIt should be assisting countries to leapfrog,\u201d said Jane Burston, CEO of the Clean Air Fund, referring to the idea that developing countries could industrialize with renewable energy and skip over development that rich nations historically made with fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cIt's baffling why development assistance is being given to something that continues to make people unhealthy as well as harms the planet,\u201d she added.",
      "For example, an arm of the World Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development loaned $105 million toward rehabilitating coal plants in India, with their last loans toward the project going out in 2018, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "However, the improvements made coal plants more efficient and reduced their greenhouse gas emissions, according to project documents.",
      "The Clean Air Fund's report estimated the World Bank provided $2.7 billion in \u201cfossil fuel prolonging finance\u201d between 2018 and 2022. During that time, the bank also loaned about 32 times the amount for renewables.",
      "\"Renewable energy support is always our first choice as we work to provide access to electricity,\" a World Bank spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The bank's policies still \u201cselectively support natural gas as a transition fuel\u201d if its research shows the project is low risk to the climate, the spokesperson said. The bank's recent policies require vetting for every project to make sure its investments reduce climate impacts.",
      "The World Bank delivered $42.6 billion in climate finance in its most recent fiscal year, a 10% increase from the year before. And at the most recent COP, the bank promised nearly half of its lending will soon go toward climate finance.",
      "In Vietnam, about half of power generation comes from fossil fuels, primarily coal power. The Asian Development Bank loaned about $900 million on coal in Vietnam, with their spending on the fossil fuel in the country ending in 2017. The bank's updated climate policies \u201cwill not support coal mining, processing, storage, and transportation, nor any new coal-fired power generation,\u201d it said in a statement. The bank put $9.8 billion toward climate finance in 2023, and aims to finance $100 billion in climate-friendly projects between 2019 and 2030.",
      "The country\u2019s biggest growth area for energy is in wind. The Global Energy Monitor ranks Vietnam seventh in the world in planned wind power. And the Asian Development Bank committed about $60 million in loans toward wind energy in Vietnam between 2021 and 2022.",
      "The banks have made broad commitments in recent years to align with the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. But those promises leave pathways open to continue funding fossil fuels, said Bronwen Tucker, global public finance co-manager at Oil Change International.",
      "According to the group's monitoring of the banks' commitments, all nine of the major banks tracked can fund gas projects in at least some cases.",
      "\u201cThe MDBs can't be climate bankers if they are still fossil bankers,\" she said. \u201cRelying on banks that are locking in fossil fuels and the worst-ever debt crisis is not working.\u201d",

      "The Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival looks less attractive this year amid a sluggish economy, forcing e-commerce firms to look abroad for growth",
      "HONG KONG -- Businesses and consumers in China found the annual Singles' Day shopping festival less attractive this year amid a sluggish economy, forcing e-commerce firms to look abroad for growth.",
      "Online service provider and e-commerce platform Alibaba started the now-famous event on Nov. 11, 2009, offering attractive discounts to entice shoppers to spend more. The extravaganza, also known as \u201cDouble 11,\u201d has since expanded to other platforms in China \u2014 like JD.com and Pinduoduo \u2014 and abroad.",
      "It has long been regarded as a barometer of consumer sentiment.",
      "While Singles\u2019 Day was previously a one-day event, shopping platforms in China now kickstart the festival weeks ahead to drum up sales volume. Even some brick-and-mortar stores join the festival by launching sales campaigns and hanging promotional banners and posters in the hopes of luring shoppers.",
      "But amid China\u2019s lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a real estate crisis and deflationary pressures, consumers no longer go all out during the shopping extravaganza.",
      "Meanwhile, e-commerce platforms grappling with a slowing domestic market have turned to overseas markets to seek new growth, offering promotions like global free shipping and allowing merchants to sell worldwide with ease.",
      "Alibaba, for example, said in a blog post on its Alizila site that some 70,000 merchants saw sales double with global free shipping. In markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, new customers also doubled, the e-commerce company said.",
      "Since the festival began in late October, \u201cI have only spent a few hundred yuan on daily necessities,\u201d said Wang Haihua, who owns a fitness center in the capital, Beijing.",
      "Wang said that the prices offered on e-commerce platforms during Singles\u2019 Day are not necessarily cheaper than usual. \u201cThey\u2019re all tricks and we\u2019ve seen through it over the years,\u201d she said.",
      "Zhang Jiewei, a 34-year-old who runs a barber shop in the city of Xi\u2019an, echoed Wang\u2019s sentiments, saying that he no longer trusts Singles\u2019 Day promotions as some merchants tend to raise the usual prices before offering a discount, giving consumers the illusion they are getting a deal.",
      "\u201cI used to buy a lot two or three years ago and I even purchased a mobile phone (during Singles\u2019 Day),\u201d he said. However, following the coronavirus pandemic, he stopped \u201cbecause of lower income.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am not going to buy anything this year,\u201d Zhang said.",
      "Some experts say that Beijing\u2019s recent stimulus measures have had little impact on boosting consumer confidence.",
      "\u201cPeople are not interested in spending and are cutting back on big-ticket items,\u201d said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. \u201cSince October 2022, the weak economy means that everything has been on discount year-round, 11.11 is not going to bring in more discounts than the month before.\u201d",
      "Rein said he expects low growth for the Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival as consumers tighten their spending in anticipation of difficult economic times ahead.",
      "Categories such as sportswear and fitness, however, have been doing well as customers \u201ctrade down a Gucci bag for Lululemon sportswear,\u201d he said.",
      "Jacob Cooke, CEO of e-commerce consultancy WPIC Marketing + Technologies, said that despite the luxury downturn, the shopping festival still showed strong sales for goods in premium price brands across categories like mother-baby, personal care and toys, as well as outdoor and sport.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear shift in consumer priorities towards experiences, hobbies, and health,\u201d Cooke said. \u201cWith record-level platform subsidies and generous membership programs like Alibaba\u2019s 88VIP, consumers actually showed a preference for premium branded goods during this year\u2019s festival.\u201d",
      "Platforms like JD.com and Alibaba previously used to publish the total value of the festival's transactions, but have stopped since 2022. While yearly growth used to be in the double digits, estimates of recent figures have dwindled to low single-digit growth.",
      "Syntun, a data provider, estimated that last year\u2019s gross merchandising volume sales across major e-commerce platforms grew just 2% to 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.40 billion), a far cry from double-digit growth before COVID-19.",
      "Alibaba also owns popular e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall,",
      "Even some merchants who typically participated in the festival say the high cost of advertising no longer pays off as sales dwindle.",
      "Zhao Gao, who owns a garment factory in eastern Zhejiang province, said that after paying to advertise on e-commerce platforms, he would only break even after sales.",
      "\u201cThe platforms have so many rules for promotions and customers have become more skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a merchant, I no longer participate in the Singles\u2019 Day promotions.\u201d",
      "Another merchant, Du Baonian who runs a food company processing mutton in Inner Mongolia, said consumers spend less and his overall sales were down by 15% compared to the past year.",
      "He still takes part in the Singles\u2019 Day promotions but said the higher expenses do not typically generate returns because of slow sales.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing shrinking revenue, but advertisement on the platform can help us maintain our leading sales position,\u201d he said, adding that he was considering advertising on more e-commerce platforms to target more consumers.",

      "Mexico is facing a second Donald Trump presidency, and few countries can match its experience as a target of Trump\u2019s rhetoric: There have been threats to close the border, impose tariffs and even send U.S. forces to fight Mexican drug cartels if the co...",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico is facing a second Donald Trump presidency, and few countries can match its experience as a target of Trump's rhetoric: There have been threats to close the border, impose tariffs and even send U.S. forces to fight Mexican drug cartels if the country doesn\u2019t do more to stem the flow of migrants and drugs.",
      "That\u2019s not to mention what mass deportations of migrants who are in the U.S. illegally could do to remittances \u2014 the money sent home by migrants \u2014 that have become one of Mexico\u2019s main sources of income.",
      "But as much as this second round looks like the first round \u2014 when Mexico pacified Trump by quietly ceding to his immigration demands \u2014 circumstances have changed, and not necessarily for the better. Today, Mexico has in Claudia Sheinbaum a somewhat stern leftist ideologue as president, and Trump is not known for handling such relations well.",
      "Back in 2019, Mexico\u2019s then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, plain-spoken, folksy leader who seemed to understand Trump, because both had a transactional view of politics: You give me what I want, I\u2019ll give you what you want. The two went on to form a chummy relationship.",
      "But while L\u00f3pez Obrador was forged in the give-and-take politics of the often-corrupt former ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Sheinbaum grew up in a family of leftist activists and got her political experience in radical university student movements.",
      "\u201cClaudia is more ideological than L\u00f3pez Obrador, and so the problem is that I see her potentially responding to Trumpian policies, whether it\u2019s, you know, organized crime or immigration or tariffs with a much more nationalistic, jingoistic view of the relationship,\u201d said Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S. from 2007 to 2013.",
      "Sheinbaum made a point of being one of the first world leaders to call Trump on Thursday to congratulate him after the election, but during the call Trump did two things that may say a lot about how things will go.",
      "First, Sheinbaum said, Trump quickly brought up the border to remind her there were issues there. Then he asked Sheinbaum to send his greetings to L\u00f3pez Obrador, with whom Trump said he had \u201ca very good relationship.\u201d That might suggest that Trump believes that L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2014 the new president's political mentor \u2014 is still in charge, a view shared by some analysts.",
      "Sarukhan said he believes the fact that Sheinbaum is a woman and is from Mexico will be \"a very important challenge, an issue out there as both of them get going in their relationship.\u201d",
      "There's little likelihood that Trump will get caught up in other issues and just forget about Mexico. Karoline Leavitt, the Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman, said Trump had been given \"a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver.\u201d",
      "Not everything has changed for the worse: Cross-border trade has topped $800 billion per year and U.S. companies are more dependent than ever on Mexican plants.",
      "But the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, or USMCA, is coming up for review, and Mexico has made legal changes that Trump could seize on to demand a re-negotiation of parts of the deal.",
      "Sheinbaum has suggested Mexico won't give in even if backed into a corner, saying \u201cwe obviously are going to address any problems that come up with dialogue, as a collaborative process, and if not, we are going to stand up, we are prepared to do that with great unity.\u201d",
      "Standing up hasn\u2019t worked particularly well before. In 2018, Marcelo Ebrard was Mexico\u2019s top diplomat; former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Ebrard basically bent to U.S. demands to keep asylum seekers in Mexico and accept migrants back even if they weren\u2019t Mexicans.",
      "Ebrard just asked that the deal not be made public to avoid embarrassing L\u00f3pez Obrador, Pompeo wrote. (Ebrard later claimed he had avoided signing a much worse \"safe third country\u2019\" agreement.)",
      "Today, Ebrard is Mexico\u2019s economy secretary, and would lead Mexico\u2019s delegation in the scheduled 2026 review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, something that Trump has greeted with mirth (\"I've never seen anybody fold like that,\" Trump once said of Ebrard.)",
      "Ebrard on Thursday downplayed any risks this time around, saying e conomic ties between the two countries would keep Trump from closing borders or imposing tariffs.",
      "\u201cI am optimistic. Unlike other countries, we are the largest trading partner (of the U.S.), so, if you put up a tariff, that will have repercussions in the United States,\u201d Ebrard said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it is going to be easy, because it is not at all easy, but the relationship with President Trump will be good because, what unites us? These numbers, this gigantic economy.\u201d",
      "But some former diplomats say any argument that Mexico can avoid friction with the Trump administration is overconfident, and that 2025 is not necessarily going to be like 2019.",
      "Martha B\u00e1rcena, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. from 2018 to 2021, said she doesn't think Trump would back away from campaign promises to deport migrants who are in the country illegally. She said Mexican officials who believe Trump might temper his \u201ccampaign promises because Mexican migrants are necessary for the U.S. economy\u201d are being overly optimistic.",
      "\u201cMexico is looking at it through the lens of economic logic. The logic that the Trump campaign applies on immigration is a logic of national security and cultural identity issues,\" B\u00e1rcena said.",
      "Some of Trump's biggest policy concerns \u2013 restoring U.S. jobs and the increasing rivalry with China \u2014 also run through Mexico.",
      "U.S. and foreign automakers have set up dozens of plants in Mexico, and some in the U.S. worry that Chinese companies could do the same to take advantage of existing trade rules to export Chinese cars or auto parts to the United States.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help that Sheinbaum has pushed through L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies aimed at eliminating independent regulatory and oversight bodies, and laws the U.S. government says could reduce the independence of the judiciary, both of which are required under the USMCA trade agreement.",
      "\u201cIf they go ahead with the elimination of independent regulators and autonomous bodies, that\u2019s going to be a further violation of the USMCA,\u201d Sarukhan said. \u201cAnd then that\u2019s going to make things even worse. Obviously, the big piece is going to be China and the Chinese footprint in Mexico.\u201d",
      "That could lead Trump to demand the re-negotiation of all auto industry agreements under the trade pact.",
      "As far as efforts to jointly combat the illegal drug trade \u2014 such cooperation fell to historic lows in 2019 and 2020 \u2014 there have been some modestly encouraging signs. Last week, Mexico announced the seizure in Tijuana of over 300,000 fentanyl pills after months when t he country\u2019s entire seizures had amounted to as little as 50 grams \u2014 a couple of ounces \u2014 per week.",
      "Sheinbaum, who took office on Oct. 1, also appears to be tacitly abandoning L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s strategy of not confronting drug cartels. But neither she nor her predecessor and political mentor could ever accept any Trump plan to send U.S. forces to operate independently on Mexican soil.",
      "It remains to see how far Trump might go; he often makes only token gestures to carry through on threats. But Sarukhan noted, \u201cI do think that he will talk loudly and carry a big stick.\u201d",

      "Many veterans who\u2019ve started small businesses tell a similar story: Their military service prepared them mentally for the task, but they were at a disadvantage when it came to the financial part",
      "NEW YORK -- Many veterans who\u2019ve started small businesses tell a similar story: Their military service prepared them mentally for the task, but they were at a disadvantage when it came to the financial part.",
      "\u201cVetrepreneurs\u201d \u2013 veterans that start small businesses or startups -- own nearly 2 million small businesses that employ 5.5 million people in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration. They take in about $1.3 trillion in revenue annually. Their numbers have shrunk, however, as the veteran population has aged. In a 2023 report, the SBA found veteran ownership declined from 11% of businesses in 2014 to 8.1% in 2020.",
      "Veterans enter the business world prepared with skills they gain in the field like leadership and problem-solving. But they haven\u2019t had a chance to build up credit or savings that civilians have had more time to do. That can cause problems because banks use that information to approve loans. Not to mention the mental toll it takes to transition from the military life to civilian life.",
      "According to data from business coaching nonprofit SCORE, about a third of veteran businesses have limited access to capital or lack of financing. That compares to a quarter of non-veteran-owned firms.",
      "SCORE CEO Bridget Weston says the good news is that veterans have plenty of places to turn to for help. Those include nonprofit organizations aimed at getting them on their feet and building up financial literacy, veteran-only loans and grants, and contracts earmarked for veteran owned and disabled veteran owned small businesses.",
      "The place that many start is the Small Business Administration, which offers a program to get certified as a veteran-owned or disabled veteran-owned small business, which can make it easier to get certain loans and federal contracts.",
      "That\u2019s the route Jackson Dalton decided to take when he started Black Box Safety, a maker of personal protective equipment, in 2017. Dalton enlisted in the U.S. Marines in 2000 and was selected for the prestigious Marine Corps Special Operations. But a badly broken leg, suffered during training, eventually forced him medically retire after two years of active duty.",
      "Although the transition back to civilian life was difficult, Dalton went on to get a master\u2019s degree in public health, and spent 10 years working in the health and safety industry. When he ventured out on his own, he decided to focus on federal contracts and got certified by the SBA. He thought prisons would be a good place to start since 3% of their contracts go to disabled veteran businesses. His first contract was selling gloves to a prison in Minnesota. Today, he serves major clients like the Department of Veterans Affairs and the State of California.",
      "Dalton credits his military training with his success.",
      "\u201cThe skills and attributes that I picked up in the military were resilience and grit and the ability to adapt, improvise, overcome when you know, when encountering resistance or obstacles and barriers,\u201d he said.",
      "Veteran focused nonprofits can be another key place to look for help.",
      "Adam Isch, a Marine Corp. veteran who served two tours in Iraq, worked with nonprofit Warrior Rising in Salt Lake City, to find a mentor to help him start his business, Isch Body Works in Fort Worth, Texas, which sells men\u2019s hygiene products. The business donates part of its revenue to charities supporting Texas children in foster care and awaiting adoption. Similar nonprofits include Bunker Labs, Tactical Launch, and others around the country.",
      "\u201cAnybody who wants to start a business, especially a veteran, go find a group like a Warrior Rising, there are all kinds of different groups like that getting mentorship,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who are doing what you do. They\u2019re doing what I do, and they love it and they want to talk about it.\"",
      "For some, a veteran-earmarked loan can be what makes or breaks a business. Elizabeth Gore, the co-founder and President of Hello Alice, a financial technology firm that works with small businesses on getting funding, including 117,000 military small business owners. \u201cThey have to really struggle more than other groups and demographics on access to capital,\u201d she said.",
      "John Griveas in Buffalo, N.Y. spent two years as a Navy Seal in the mid-1990s and his remaining four years in New York in the active reserves, ending his tenure in 2002. After that he \u201cbounced around\u201d different jobs and spent 10 years in the local collections industry.",
      "But in 2014 he met his current partner, Jackie, and decided her hobby of making all-natural dog treats could be a real business. They formed Fetch! Dog Treats as an LLC in 2015 and today they sell their treats at about 300 independently owned mom and pop brick and mortar stores, news shops, banks and even the Venetian Hotel on the Las Vegas strip.",
      "For himself and other veterans he\u2019s talked to, one of the biggest challenges they face is getting funds. He found a $10,000 grant via the FedEx Entrepreneur Fund, which partners with Hello Alice to give grants to small businesses owned by military veterans. It came at a pivotal time, when his landlord decided to redevelop his space and gave him only a few months to find a new location.",
      "\u201cIt was something that quite literally was going to end us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when that grant came through, it was literally a lifesaver for us.\u201d",
      "He advised other veterans to take advantage of veteran resources.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tons of resources out there,\u201d he said. \"Whatever it might be that you know, just helps you get through the day-to-day, because there\u2019s a lot involved with running a business.\u201d"

      "During the first day of the U.N. climate talks, COP29, Climate Adviser John Podesta struck a defiant but realistic tone in a press conference.

      "\u201cAre we facing new headwinds? Absolutely. But we won\u2019t revert back to the energy system of the 1950s. No way,\u201d Podesta said.",
      "\u201cSetbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,\u201d Podesta said paraphrasing a Biden speech last week. \u201cThis is not the end of our fight for a cleaner, safer planet. Facts are still facts. Science is still science. The fight is bigger than one election, one political cycle in one country. This fight is bigger, still, because we are all living through a year defined by the climate crisis in every country of the world.\u201d",
      "During the campaign, Trump said would pull America from the Paris Agreement, rollback parts of the IRA and increase drilling and oil production. He has called emissions regulations part of a \u201cgreen new scam\u201d and claimed, without evidence, that offshore wind turbines harm whales.",
      "During Trump's first administration, between 2017 and 2021, many environmental regulations were rolled back, later to be reversed by the Biden administration. The incoming Trump administration has signaled it plans to now undo Biden's changes.",
      "During his press conference, Podesta ran through a shopping list of climate disasters, starting with the hottest day recorded, July 22, continuing with floods, hurricanes and droughts.",

      "Podesta said the Biden administration is still negotiating even as it prepares to leave.",
      "\u201cWe are here to work, and we are committed to a successful outcome at COP29,\" Podesta said. \u201cWe can and will make real progress on the backs of our climate committed states and cities, our innovators, our companies and our citizens, especially young people who understand more than most that climate change poses an existential threat that we cannot afford to ignore.\u201d",
      "Another senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said other countries are still working with American diplomats because they care what the U.S. thinks and any agreement struck here must be by consensus. Outside analysts had speculated the U.S. would be ignored.",

    "story": [
      "California farmers have been devoting more land to pistachios, which are seen as hardier and more drought-tolerant in a state prone to dramatic swings in precipitation",
      "LOST HILLS, Calif. -- In a sprawling plant in the heart of California's farmland, millions of shells rush down a metallic chute and onto a conveyor belt where they are inspected, roasted, packaged and shipped off to groceries around the world.",
      "Pistachios are growing fast in California, where farmers have been devoting more land to a crop seen as hardier and more drought-tolerant in a state prone to dramatic swings in precipitation. The crop generated nearly $3 billion last year in California and in the past decade the United States has surpassed Iran to become the world\u2019s top exporter of the nut.",
      "\u201cThere has been an explosion over the last 10 or 15 years of plantings, and those trees are coming online,\u201d said Zachary Fraser, president and chief executive of American Pistachio Growers, which represents more than 800 farmers in the southwestern U.S. \u201cYou are starting to see the fruit of people\u2019s vision from 40 years ago.\u201d",
      "California grows more than a third of the country's vegetables and three quarters of its fruit and nuts, according to state agricultural statistics. Pistachios have surged over the past decade to become the state's sixth-biggest agricultural commodity in value ahead of longtime crops such as strawberries and tomatoes, the data shows.",
      "Much of the crop is headed to China, where it is a popular treat during Lunar New Year. But industry experts said Americans also are eating more pistachios, which were rarely in grocery stores a generation ago and today are a snack food found almost everywhere. They are sold with shells or without and flavors range from salt and pepper to honey roasted.",
      "The Wonderful Co., a $6 billion agricultural company known for brands such as Halo mandarins and FIJI Water, is the biggest name in pistachios. The company has grown pistachios since the 1980s, but it ramped up in 2015 after developing a rootstock that yields as much as 40% more nuts with the same soil and water, said Rob Yraceburu, president of Wonderful Orchards.",
      "Now, Wonderful grows between 15% and 20% of the U.S. pistachio crop, he said. Its pistachio orchards stretch across vast tracts of dust-filled farmland northwest of Los Angeles also lined with pomegranates and dairies. The trees are shaken each fall and the nuts hauled to a massive processing facility to be be prepped for sale.",
      "\"There is an increasingly growing demand in pistachios,\" Yraceburu said. \u201cThe world wants more.\u201d",
      "Pistachios are poised to weather California's dry spells better than its even bigger nut crop, almonds, which generated nearly $4 billion in the state last year, industry experts said.",
      "Pistachio orchards can be sustained with minimal water during drought, unlike almonds and other more sensitive crops. The trees also rely on wind instead of bees for pollination and can produce nuts for decades longer, Yraceburu said.",
      "Many California farmers who grow both nuts are applying lessons learned from almonds to the pistachio boom. Almond production, which is much bigger than pistachio, also soared in California, but prices fell amid a glut of post-pandemic supply while farmers grappled with drought and rising input costs, leading some to not replant aging orchards when it came time to take them out.",
      "Pistachio growers say they hope to avoid a similar fate and are striving to keep demand for the nut ahead of supply. For example, American Pistachio Growers recently inked an endorsement deal with a top cricket player in India hoping to help promote pistachios there, Fraser said.",
      "The rise of pistachios is part of California farmers' shift into perennial crops commanding higher returns than products such as cotton, according to a 2023 report by the Public Policy Institute of California.",
      "Perennial crops, which are not replanted annually, can't just be swapped out during dry years, which can be challenging during extensive drought, said Brad Franklin, a research fellow at the institute's Water Policy Center.",
      "But pistachios have benefits other perennial crops don't. They can go longer without water and grow in saline soils. That may make them appealing to California farmers who are facing limits on how much groundwater they can pump under a state law aimed at conserving the critical resource, he said.",
      "When farmers decide what to plant, \u201cI think the biggest thing is the market and where is the market,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cAnd water is right below that.\u201d",
      "Farmers across California are bracing for the impact of the 2014 state law aimed at ensuring a more sustainable use of groundwater after years of over pumping depleted basins and eroded water quality in some rural areas. About a fifth of California's pistachio crop is grown in areas that rely exclusively on groundwater for irrigation, Yraceburu said, adding he expects some of these orchards will eventually come out of production.",
      "But over the next few years, pistachio acreage is expected to continue to grow in the state as trees planted in recent years come into production. That is in contrast to almond and walnut acreage, which are stabilizing or declining as orchards are being pulled out, said David Maga\u00f1a, a senior analyst at Rabobank in Fresno, California.",
      "Pistachios require about 3 acre-feet (3,700 cubic meters) of water per acre (0.4 hectares) compared with nearly 4 acre-feet (4,934 cubic meters) for almonds and produce more per acre than almonds while fetching a higher price, he said.",
      "\u201cYou see all the value the pistachio industry is providing to California agriculture is approaching that of almonds with a lot less acreage,\u201d Maga\u00f1a said. \u201cI haven't seen pistachio orchards being pulled out.\u201d"

      "Before opening in U.S. theaters, \u201cRed One,\u201d starring Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans, kicked off in 75 overseas markets, collecting $26.6 million. The film carries a hefty price tag of about $250 million to make.",

    "story": [
      "Experts calculate that curbing and coping with global warming is going to cost trillions of dollars and poor nations just don\u2019t have it",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- A complex international two-week-long game of climate change poker is convening. The stakes? Just the fate of an ever-warming world.",
      "Curbing and coping with climate change's worsening heat, floods, droughts and storms will cost trillions of dollars and poor nations just don't have it, numerous reports and experts calculate. As United Nations climate negotiations started Monday in Baku, Azerbaijan, the chief issue is who must ante up to help poor nations and especially how much.",
      "The numbers are enormous. The floor in negotiations is the $100 billion a year that poor nations \u2014 based on a categorization made in the 1990s \u2014 now get as part of a 2009 agreement that was barely met. Several experts and poorer nations say the need is $1 trillion a year or more.",
      "\u201cIt's a game with high stakes,\u201d said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, a physicist. \u201cRight now the fate of the planet depends very much on what we're able to pull off in the next five or 10 years.\u201d",
      "But this year's talks, known as COP29, won't be as high-profile as last year's, with 48 fewer heads of state scheduled to speak. The leaders of the top two carbon polluting countries \u2014 China and the United States \u2014 will be absent. But if money negotiations fail in Baku, it will handicap 2025\u2019s make-or-break climate negotiations, experts say.",
      "Not only is dealing with money always a touchy subject, but two of the rich countries that are expected to donate money to poor nations \u2014 the United States and Germany \u2014 are in the midst of dramatic government changes. Even though the United States delegation will be from Biden Administration, the reelection of Donald Trump, who downplays climate change and dislikes foreign aid, makes U.S. pledges unlikely to be fulfilled.",
      "The overarching issue is climate finance. Without it, experts say the world can't get a handle on fighting warming, nor can most of the nations achieve their current carbon pollution-cutting goals or the new ones they will submit next year.",
      "\u201cIf we don't solve the finance problem, then definitely we will not solve the climate problem,\u201d said former Colombian deputy climate minister Pablo Vieira, who heads the support unit at NDC Partnership, which helps nations with emissions-cutting goals.",
      "Nations can't cut carbon pollution if they can't afford to eliminate coal, oil and gas, Vieira and several other experts said. Poor nations are frustrated that they are being told to do more to fight climate change when they cannot afford it, he said. And the 47 poorest nations only created 4% of the heat-trapping gases in the air, according to the U.N.",
      "About 77% of the heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere now comes from the G20 rich nations, many of whom are now cutting back on their pollution, something that is not happening in most poor nations or China.",
      "\u201cThe countries that are rich today have become rich by polluting the Earth,\u201d said Ani Dasgupta, president of World Resources Institute.",
      "The money being discussed is for three things: Helping poor nations switch from dirty fossil fuels to clean energy; helping them adapt to the impacts of a warming world such as sea level rise and worsening storms; and compensating vulnerable poor nations for climate change damage.",
      "\u201cShould the global community fail to reach a (finance) goal, this is really just signing the death warrant of many developing countries,\" said Chukwumerije Okereke, director of the Center for Climate Change and Development in Nigeria.",
      "Michael Wilkins, a business professor who heads Imperial College's Centre for Climate Finance and Investment in the U.K., said since 2022 total climate finance has been nearly $1.5 trillion. But only 3% of that is actually geared toward the least developed countries, he said.",
      "\u201cThe Global South has been repeatedly let down by unmet pledges and commitments,\u201d said Sunita Narain, director general of New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment.",
      "\u201cFinance is really the key component that compels all types of climate action,\u201d said Bahamian climate scientist Adelle Thomas, adaptation director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cWithout that finance, there's simply not much that developing countries in particular can do.\u201d",
      "It's an issue of both self-interest and justice, Thomas and others said. It's not charity to help poor nations decarbonize because rich nations benefit when all countries cut emissions. After all, a warming world hurts everyone.",
      "Compensating for climate damage and helping nations prepare for future harm is a matter of justice, Thomas said. Even though they didn't create the problem, poor nations \u2014 especially small island nations \u2014 are particularly vulnerable to climate change's rising seas and extreme weather. Thomas mentioned how 2019's Hurricane Dorian smacked her grandparents home and \u201cthe only thing left standing was one toilet.\u201d",
      "The trillion-dollar figure on the table is about half of what the world spends annually on the military. Others say global fossil fuel subsidies could be redirected to climate finance; estimates of those subsidies range from the International Energy Agency\u2019s $616 billion a year to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s $7 trillion a year.",
      "\u201cWhen we need more for other things, including conflict, we seem to find it,\u201d United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said. \u201cWell, this is probably the largest conflict of all.\u201d",
      "A U.N. climate finance committee report looked at the need from 98 countries and estimated it as ranging from $455 billion to $584 billion per year.",
      "The money isn't just direct government aid from one nation to another. Some of it comes from multinational development finance banks, like the World Bank. There's also private investment that will be considered a large chunk. Developing nations are seeking relief from their $29 trillion global debt.",
      "Andersen said at least a sixfold increase in investment would be required to get on the path to limit future warming to just another two-tenths of a degree Celsius (0.4 degrees Fahrenheit) from now, which is the overarching goal the world adopted in 2015.",
      "Andersen's agency calculated that with nations' current emissions-curbing targets, the difference between well-financed and current efforts translates to half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) less future warming. Experts say stepped-up efforts that could reduce future warming even more also costs more.",
      "Who will pay is another sticking point. Climate talks for decades have used 1992 standards to categorize two groups of nations, essentially rich and poor, deciding that rich nations like the U.S. are the ones to financially help poor ones. Financial circumstances have changed. China, the world\u2019s top carbon polluter, has increased its per capita GDP by more than 30 times since then. But neither China nor some rich oil nations are obligated to help in climate finance.",
      "Developed nations want those countries that couldn't afford to give before, but now can, included in the next round of donors. But those nations don't want those obligations, said E3G analyst Alden Meyer, a climate negotiations veteran.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very fraught landscape to think about huge scale-up of existing climate finance,\u201d Meyer said.",

JPMorgan Chase rose 1.2%, and bank stocks broadly continue to benefit from expectations for stronger economic growth, less regulation from Washington and an increase in mergers and acquisitions.",

    "story": [
      "Opponents of offshore wind energy projects expect President-elect Donald Trump to kill an industry he has vowed to end on the first day he returns to the White House",
      "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- Opponents of offshore wind energy projects expect President-elect Donald Trump to kill an industry he has vowed to end on the first day he returns to the White House.",
      "But it might not be that easy.",
      "Many of the largest offshore wind companies put a brave face on the election results, pledging to work with Trump and Congress to build power projects and ignoring the incoming president's oft-stated hostility to them.",
      "In campaign appearances, Trump railed against offshore wind and promised to sign an executive order to block such projects.",
      "\u201cWe are going to make sure that that ends on Day 1,\u201d Trump said in a May speech. \u201cI\u2019m going to write it out in an executive order. It\u2019s going to end on Day 1.\"",
      "\u201cThey destroy everything, they\u2019re horrible, the most expensive energy there is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey ruin the environment, they kill the birds, they kill the whales.\u201d",
      "Numerous federal and state scientific agencies say there is no evidence linking offshore wind preparation to a spate of whale deaths along the U.S. East Coast in recent years. Turbines have been known to kill shorebirds, but the industry and regulators say there are policies to mitigate harm to the environment.",
      "Trump has railed against offshore wind turbines spoiling the view from a golf course he owns in Scotland. But numerous environmental groups say the real reason he opposes offshore wind is his support for the fossil fuel industry.",
      "There is almost 65 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity under development in the U.S., enough to power more than 26 million homes, and some turbines are already spinning in several states, according to the American Clean Power Association.",
      "Currently operating projects include the Block Island Wind Farm in Rhode Island, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind pilot project and the South Fork Wind Farm about 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Montauk Point on New York\u2019s Long Island.",
      "Trump is unlikely to end those projects but might have more leverage over ones still in the planning stage, those in the debate say.",
      "Bob Stern, who headed an office in the U.S. Energy Department responsible for environmental protection during the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations, said Trump can get Congress to reduce or eliminate tax credits for offshore wind that were granted in the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. Those credits are an integral part of the finances of many offshore wind projects.",
      "Stern, who leads the New Jersey anti-offshore wind group Save LBI, said Trump also could issue executive orders prohibiting further offshore leases and rescinding approval for ones already approved while pushing Congress to amend federal laws granting more protection for marine mammals.",
      "The president-elect also can appoint leaders of agencies involved in offshore wind regulation who would be hostile to it or less supportive.",
      "Opponents of offshore wind, many of them Republicans, were giddy following the election, saying they fully expect Trump to put an end to the industry.",
      "\u201cI believe this is a tipping point for the offshore wind industry in America,\u201d said Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast NJ, one of the most vocal groups opposing offshore wind on the East Coast. \"They have been given a glidepath by Democrat-run administrations at the federal and state level for many years. For this industry, (Tuesday's) results will bring headwinds far greater than they have faced previously.\"",
      "But Tina Zappile, director of the Hughes Center for Public Policy at New Jersey's Stockton University, noted that in 2018, Trump Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke voiced strong support for offshore wind. And even though the president-elect has bashed the technology, she predicted he won't just make it go away.",
      "\u201cOffshore wind might appear to be on the chopping block \u2014 Trump\u2019s explicitly said this was something he\u2019d fix on the first day \u2014 but when the economics of offshore wind are in alignment with his overall strategies of returning manufacturing to America and becoming energy-independent, his administration is likely to back away slowly from this claim,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cOffshore wind may be temporarily hampered, but its long-term prospects in the U.S. are unlikely to be hurt.\u201d",
      "Commercial fishermen in Maine said they hope the Trump administration will undo policies designed to help build and approve offshore wind projects, saying regulators attempted to \u201cfuture-proof\u201d the industry against political change. Jerry Leeman, CEO of the New England Fishermen\u2019s Stewardship Association, called on Trump to reverse a commitment to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.",
      "The offshore wind industry is taking an optimistic stance, pledging to work with Trump his political allies. National and New Jersey wind industry groups, and several offshore wind developers including Atlantic Shores and Denmark-based Orsted, issued similarly worded statements highlighting terms likely to appeal to Republicans including job creation, economic development and national security.",
      "\u201cBy combining the strengths of all domestic energy resources, the Trump administration can advance an economy that is dynamic, secure, and clean,\u201d Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. \"We are committed to working with the Trump-Vance administration and the new Congress to continue this great American success story.\u201d",
      "But few Republicans were in a welcoming mood following the election. New Jersey Assemblyman Paul Kanitra listed the major offshore wind companies in a Facebook post, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time to pack your bags and get the hell away from the Jersey Shore, our marine life, fishing industry and beautiful beaches.\u201d",
      "Kanitra said he was looking forward \u201cto your stock prices tanking.\u201d And that was starting to happen.",
      "The stock prices of European offshore wind companies, many of which are planning or building projects on the U.S. East Coast, plunged amid fears the new administration would seek to slow or end such projects. Orsted closed down nearly 14% on Wednesday and was down 11% over the past five days. Turbine manufacturer Vestas Wind Systems was down nearly 24% over that same period.",
      "Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, hosted Trump at a rally earlier this year at which Trump again vowed to kill offshore wind.",
      "\u201cWe are currently working out the specifics of what that will look like once he takes office again this January,\" VanDrew said. \u201cPresident Trump is a good friend of New Jersey, and he understands the devastating impact these projects will have on our communities.\u201d",

      "PHOENIX -- A natural gas utility with more than 2 million customers in Arizona, Nevada and parts of California is being fined $2 million by regulators in Arizona over concerns about piping that is known to degrade in the heat.",
      "The Arizona Corporation Commission announced Friday that it reached a consent agreement with Southwest Gas that includes the civil penalty and requires more inspections.",
      "At issue is piping that can degrade in locations with hot ambient temperatures. Federal regulators issued an advisory in 2012 alerting operators that the piping \u2014 known as Driscopipe polyethylene (PE) M7000 and M8000 \u2014 could be susceptible to degradation.",
      "It was reported that degradation and resulting leaks involved piping installed in the Southwest, particularly in the Mohave Desert region in Arizona, California and Nevada.",
      "In Arizona, state investigators concluded that Southwest Gas failed to properly map where this type of piping had been installed.",
      "Southwest Gas estimates there are more than 10,000 miles (16,100 kilometers) of the piping throughout Arizona. The utility says it has a plan to target high-risk areas for replacement or abandonment.",
      "The agreement between state regulators and Southwest Gas stems from two separate incidents in 2021, including one in Chandler in which an explosion injured four people.",
      "In addition to replacing or abandoning all newly discovered and previously unmapped spots that contain the defective piping, Southwest Gas must also notify regulators of any leaks.",
      "An amendment to the agreement that was proposed by Corporation Commissioner Kevin Thompson made clear that the company would have to propose new rates \u2014 and win regulatory approval through an administrative process \u2014 if it wants to recoup from customers any of the costs associated with fulfilling the agreement.",
      "\u201cThis matter has been before the commission long enough and the approval of this settlement is a big step in the direction of maintaining public safety and holding the utility accountable,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe customers should bear the entire responsibility for the mistakes of the manufacturer and their defective products, and I wish the utility would have pursued this path more aggressively when they had the chance.\u201d",
      "Southwest Gas also agreed to increase leak patrols throughout the year."

      "China has announced a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt in the latest push to rev up growth in the world's second largest economy",
      "BEIJING -- China on Friday approved a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt, in the latest push to rev up growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy.",
      "The plan will be implemented over the next three years, Xu Hongcai, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress's financial and economic committee, said at a news conference Friday.",
      "Finance minister Lan Fo'an estimated that the hidden debt of local governments was 14.3 trillion yuan ($2 trillion) at the end of 2023. Hidden debt refers to debt that has not been disclosed publicly.",
      "Lan said 2 trillion yuan would be allocated each year from 2024 to 2026 to help local governments resolve their debts. He estimated that the amount of hidden debt will drop to 2.3 trillion yuan ($320.9 billion) by the end of 2028.",
      "Officials also said Friday that the ceiling to issue special bonds will be raised to 35.52 trillion yuan ($4.96 billion) from 29.52 trillion yuan ($4.12 billion) for local governments.",
      "Lan said that the implementation of such a large-scale replacement measure indicates a \u201cfundamental shift\u201d in China's approach to debt restructuring and said that China\u2019s government debt risk was \u201ccontrollable.\u201d",
      "Analysts have called for bold, multi-trillion-yuan measures to reinvigorate the world's second largest economy, which has yet to bounce back fully from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Local government debts have ballooned partly due to high spending and low tax revenues during the pandemic, but also due to a downturn in the property industry, since sales of land use rights, a key source of local government revenue, have sagged.",
      "The central bank loosened restrictions on borrowing in late September, sparking a stock market rally, but economists say the government needs to do more to ignite a sustained recovery. Government officials have indicated that could come at this week's meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which must give official approval to any new spending.",
      "The economy has shown signs of life in the past two months. Purchase subsidies offered to people who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones helped auto sales rebound in September. A survey of manufacturers turned positive in October after five straight months of decline, and exports surged 12.7% last month, the largest increase in more than two years.",
      "For most of the year, the ruling Communist Party appeared more focused on addressing long-term structural issues with the economy rather than short-term ones. Previous steps to boost the economy were piecemeal, seemingly aimed at keeping the economy afloat rather than sparking a robust recovery.",
      "In recent weeks, the party has signaled a growing concern about the economy's sluggishness as it tries to meet its goal of achieving growth of around 5% this year. The central bank's monetary easing was followed by government pronouncements that it still has ample funds to pump into the economy.",
      "Still, the longer-term goals of transforming China into a high-tech and green energy economy seem likely to remain the chief aims of the Communist Party, which doesn't face election pressures like the ones that toppled the Democrats and swept Donald Trump's Republicans to power in America this week.",

      "German Eonomy Minister Robert Habeck says he hopes to become his Green Party\u2019s candidate for chancellor in the coming election",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's economy minister said Friday that he hopes to become his Green Party's candidate for chancellor in the upcoming election.",
      "The announcement by Robert Habeck, who is also vice chancellor, follows the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition on Wednesday.",
      "The Greens are a small party that lost popularity in recent elections and whose support currently hovers around 10%. Germany\u2019s opposition center-right is leading in the polls.",
      "It is therefore unlikely that Habeck could end up as the country's leader. His move, however, indicates how German politicians are gearing up for an early election after the collapse of the coalition.",
      "\u201cI am applying as a candidate for the Greens, for the people of Germany,\u201d Habeck said in a video posted on X. \u201cIf you want, also as chancellor. But that is not my decision, that is your decision. Only you can decide that.\u201d",
      "Scholz indicated plans for a timeline that could bring an early election by late March \u2014 before the vote that is regularly scheduled for September 2025.",
      "However, the opposition is calling for an immediate confidence vote in the parliament to speed that up. Industry leaders are also among those saying that Germany needs a stable government in place soon, as the economy struggles and as Europe prepares for a change of leadership in the United States.",
      "Scholz on Friday said that he's willing to talk about the timing of a vote of confidence and the subsequent new election. He said consultations were taking place with stakeholders, including groups in the German Bundestag and constitutional bodies, in order \u201cto take into account what the others think and mean.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe that we will soon achieve good results, at least that would be my hope,\" he said on the sidelines of a meeting in Budapest.",
      "Habeck hopes to be nominated at a party conference in Wiesbaden next week. He doesn't appear to have serious contenders after Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock announced this summer that she didn't want to pursue a candidacy for chancellor.",
      "Germany has been governed since 2021 by a coalition led by Scholz's Social Democrats and which included the smaller pro-business Free Democrats and the environmental Greens.",
      "It has been an uneasy and fractious alliance, and it collapsed Wednesday when Scholz fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the Free Democrats in a late-night move following disagreements over how to revive the shrinking economy.",
      "Scholz said that he hoped to lead the country with a minority government and call for an confidence vote in parliament in mid-January."

      "The relatively quiet trading followed huge gains  earlier in the week after Donald Trump won the presidential election  and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates again  to make things easier for the economy.",

It jumped 28.7% after delivering stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also raised its revenue forecast for the full year to $2.07 billion, which would mean 32% growth.",

      "Treasury yields climbed in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it\u2019s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.",
      "Some of the rise in yields has also been because of Trump. He talks up tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation and the U.S. government\u2019s debt higher, along with the economy\u2019s growth.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 08:10:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Maine is testing the legal limits of restrictions on so-called super PACs",
    "story": [
      "Maine is testing the legal limits of restrictions on so-called super PACs",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Maine residents this week overwhelmingly approved a referendum to limit donations to political action committees that spend independently in candidate elections, setting the stage for a legal showdown over caps on individual contributions to so-called super PACs that spend freely in elections.",
      "In the nation's only campaign finance reform initiative on the ballot on Election Day, residents voted to cap individual donations to super PACs at $5,000. Supporters fully expect a lawsuit that they hope will bring clarity to PAC donations after the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to unlimited spending by super PACs.",
      "The measure was carefully crafted to survive legal challenges as states try to find a way to regulate campaign spending after the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, said state Sen. Rick Bennett, a supporter of the proposal.",
      "\"We\u2019ve become a place where our democracy is being bought and sold by the richest people in our country,\" said Bennett, a Republican from Oxford. \u201cPeople of all political stripes support this measure. The only people who really oppose this are the monied interests who abuse the system.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court opened the floodgates for big business and labor unions to spend freely on elections in the Citizens United decision, and a Court of Appeals decision three months later lifted limits on individual spending.",
      "The Maine initiative doesn't attempt to limit independent spending on behalf of candidates. It focuses instead on limits on individual donations to super PACS, an area the Supreme Court has not ruled on, observers say.",
      "Cara McCormick, leader of Citizens to End Super PACs in Maine, said the goal is to reduce the outsized influence that super PACs currently enjoy through so-called \u201cdark money\u201d spending.",
      "Political nonprofit groups are not required to disclose their donors and do not have to reveal much about how they spend the donations they receive. A super PAC may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to campaign independently for candidates for federal office. Its activities must be reported to the Federal Elections Commission but is not otherwise regulated if not coordinated with the candidate or campaign.",
      "\u201cWe have the right to stand up to the big money in politics in Maine. We\u2019re asserting our right to limit the amount of money that someone can give to a super PAC to eliminate not only corruption in our politics but the appearance of corruption in our politics. We think that\u2019s something worth fighting for,\u201d McCormick said.",
      "In Maine, the limit would only apply to PACs spending money on behalf of candidates, not ballot committees involved in referendums. Maine law currently limits contributions to candidates, not PACs. For general elections, individuals can contribute a maximum of $1,950 to a gubernatorial candidate and $475 to a legislative candidate.",
      "Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, a longtime advocate for campaign finance reform, and his Equal Citizens nonprofit backed the Maine referendum. A similar citizen initiative effort in Massachusetts was blocked by the attorney general on constitutional concerns.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue of individual contributions to PACs, and long-established case law supports the notion that states can limit individual contributions to PACs despite a decision to the contrary by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Lessig said.",
      "The concern with unlimited individual contributions is the risk of a quid pro quo even when super PACs are spending independently and not coordinating directly with a candidate, Lessig said.",
      "The matter will ultimately have to be decided by the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic that the U.S. Supreme Court will apply existing jurisprudence that states are free to limit contributions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue that this case would raise is not asking the Supreme Court to change its jurisprudence, not asking them to overturn Citizens United.\u201d",
      "The Maine law goes into effect this winter, if there is no legal challenge, after an emphatic vote. Nearly 75% of voters supported the citizen initiative."

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Recent efforts to smooth the frequently volatile ties between neighbors and regional rivals Greece and Turkey are bearing fruit, their foreign ministers said Friday, although significant differences remain between the two countries as they seek ways to prevent spats from escalating dangerously.",
      "Despite both being members of NATO, Greece and Turkey have been at loggerheads for decades over a long series of issues, including complex maritime boundary disputes that led them to the brink of war in 1987 and in 1996. In 2020, tension over drilling rights led to Greek and Turkish warships shadowing each other in the eastern Mediterranean.",
      "Over the past 16 months, the two sides have made concerted efforts to reduce tensions, with the Greek and Turkish leaders meeting six times. Last December, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation deals during a meeting in Athens between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.",
      "\u201cI am not claiming that through the dialogue we have developed, all the problems in the two countries' relations have been magically resolved,\u201d Greek Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis said in statements to the media after a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, in Athens. The ministers didn't take any questions.",
      "\u201cThere were indeed difficult moments during the past year,\u201d Gerapetritis said. \u201cBut in all cases, there was an immediate and honest channel that prevented escalation.\u201d",
      "With two brutal conflicts raging in the wider region, in Ukraine and in the Middle East, mending ties and preventing flare-ups in tension between the two neighbors has become all the more essential.",
      "\"We are working to understand each other better on critical issues. The region we are in has many problems,\" Fidan said. \"Turkey and Greece need to be able to act with mutual trust in this difficult geography. Through a win-win approach, we can contribute to the prosperity and peace of our people.\u201d",
      "Despite the positive climate, the two sides remain far apart on some of the thornier issues, notably on territorial rights in the Aegean Sea. The two disagree on the delineation of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, which determines exploitation rights for resources, as well as on the extent of territorial waters.",
      "Turkey has said that any move by Greece to extend its territorial waters around its islands in the Aegean Sea from six nautical miles to 12 nautical miles, which Greece insists it has the right to do at any time, would be a cause for war.",
      "Turkey also doesn\u2019t recognize that Greek islands off its borders have a continental shelf, while Greece insists that position is in contravention of international law.",
      "Athens insists the issue of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone is the only dispute it has with Turkey and is willing to bring it to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.",
      "Friday\u2019s talks \u201cincluded the evaluation of the conditions for the start of a fundamental discussion for the delineation of the continental shelf and the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean,\u201d Gerapetritis said. \u201cIt is an initial, honest approach of a difficult but also crucial issue.\u201d",
      "Fidan stressed that all areas of disagreement connected to the Aegean, the sea that lies between the two countries, must be tackled.",
      "\u201cThere are many problems that are interconnected in the Aegean. These disputes cannot be reduced to the issues of the continent shelf and exclusive economic zones,\" Fidan said. \"We must address all issues that have the potential to create tensions and crises on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs Turkey, we continue to defend the principle of equitable sharing in the eastern Mediterranean,\u201d he added.",
      "Migration has been a source of tension between the two countries for years. Tens of thousands of people make their way each year from Turkey to nearby Greek islands, using European Union-member Greece as a gateway to more prosperous countries in the 27-nation bloc.",
      "While thousands of migrants continue to arrive in Greece, risking sometimes fatal sea crossings, the two ministers stressed the need to crack down on illegal migration and smuggling networks.",
      "The two \u201cemphasized the importance of acting together to combat irregular migration,\u201d Fidan said.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across 226,000 square miles (590,000 square kilometers) of remaining grouse habitat spanning 11 states.",
      "Now, in the closing weeks of the Biden administration, officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling sites located outside the protected areas.",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's science-based proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on government lands to continue.",
      "\u201cFor too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\u201d Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with the oil and renewable energy industries, Republicans and even some environmentalists.",
      "A spokesperson for American Clean Power, a renewables industry lobbying group companies, said it had supported an earlier version of the proposal but not the final details released Friday. Spokesperson Phil Sgro said the proposal \u201cunnecessarily restricts the development of wind, solar, battery storage and transmission, undermining the ability to deploy much needed clean energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Most of the land at issue is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "In Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon said the proposal would add new layers of federal regulation and hinder practical solutions for the grouse. U.S. Sen. John Barrasso accused the Biden administration of trying to ram though the changes on its way out the door.",
      "\u201cI look forward to working with the Trump-Vance administration to reverse this reckless decision,\u201d said Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee.",
      "Several major conservation organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation and Natural Resources Defense Council, issued a joint statement in support of the changes.",
      "Other environmentalists said officials had squandered a chance to put in place more meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles (122,000 square kilometers) of sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cIt's death by a thousands cuts,\u201d said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \u201cThe Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't.\u201d",
      "Federal officials predicted minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance. She said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cSo they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\u201d Sgamma said. \u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will accept protests against Friday's proposal until Dec. 9. Final decisions on changes to the agency's land management plans will be made after the protests are resolved.",
      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",
      "An analysis of the mining ban will be published by the end of the year, according to the Interior Department.",
      "Greater sage grouse once numbered in the millions across all or portions of 11 Western states. Populations have dropped 65% since 1986, according to government scientists."

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah athletic director Mark Harlan blasted the Big 12 officiating crew following BYU\u2019s 22-21 win over the Utes on Saturday night for controversial calls on the Cougars\u2019 winning drive.",
      "Harlan took the podium shortly before players and coach Kyle Whittingham arrived to address the media.",
      "\u201cThis game was absolutely stolen from us,\u201d Harlan said. \u201cWe were excited about being in the Big 12, but tonight I am not. We won this game. Someone else stole it from us. Very disappointed. I will talk to the commissioner. This was not fair to our team. I\u2019m disgusted by the professionalism of the officiating crew tonight.\u201d",
      "Utah appeared to have stopped BYU twice on fourth down on the final drive. Both times, the play was wiped out by officials.",
      "BYU quarterback Jake Retzlaff threw an incomplete pass in the end zone, but the play was blown dead a few seconds after the snap because officials said BYU called a timeout before the snap.",
      "Then, Junior Tafuna and Karene Reid sacked Retzlaff on the replayed fourth down. Their sack was negated when Utes cornerback Zemaiah Vaughn was called for holding.",
      "BYU earned a fresh set of downs and marched down the field. Retzlaff completed passes to Chase Roberts and Darius Lassiter and then Hinckley Ropati ran 14 yards to help set up Will Ferrin\u2019s winning 44-yard field goal with four seconds left.",
      "Ferrin\u2019s third and final field goal completed BYU\u2019s rally from an 11-point halftime deficit. The Cougars scored their lone offensive touchdown with 12:35 remaining.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say about it,\u201d BYU coach Kalani Sitake said. \u201cThat\u2019s the game of football. You can\u2019t hold people. So I didn\u2019t see it because I\u2019m not watching the whole field, but I\u2019ll take a look at it and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find some other holdings over there that weren\u2019t called.\u201d",
      "Whittingham shared Harlan\u2019s ire over the officiating.",
      "\u201cThings out there were ridiculous,\u201d Whittingham said after the game. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019ll leave it.\u201d",
      "Utah and BYU each were whistled for 10 penalties. The Utes totaled 90 penalty yards while the Cougars finished with 67 penalty yards.",

      "Taron Johnson returned Joe Flacco\u2019s first pass 23 yards for a touchdown, and Josh Allen and James Cook each scored on TD runs to lead the AFC East-leading Buffalo Bills past the Indianapolis Colts 30-20",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Josh Allen expects more out of Buffalo\u2019s offense than he saw Sunday at Indianapolis.",
      "He couldn\u2019t have asked for anything more from the Bills' defense.",
      "Taron Johnson picked off Joe Flacco\u2019s first pass and returned it 23 yards for a touchdown, and Allen and James Cook each ran for scores as the Bills beat the Colts 30-20 for their fifth consecutive win.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have a faster start. We didn\u2019t play our best today, but we\u2019ll take the win,\u201d Allen said. \u201dFour forced turnovers \u2014 we\u2019ve got to hold onto the ball a little bit better. We\u2019ll take them how we can get them, and we\u2019ll turn the page tomorrow.\u201d",
      "The AFC East-leading Bills have topped 30 points in four straight games and improved to 8-2 for the first time since 1993. They earned their first win at Indianapolis since 1998 with Allen's receiving corps depleted by injuries.",
      "The defense delivered for the Bills this time, logging four sacks, picking off Flacco three times and recovering a fumble by Flacco to put Allen in position to cash in.",
      "\u201cI thought the defense, the takeaways was a big-time difference in the game,\u201d coach Sean McDermott said. \u201cI think they\u2019re just a very competitive group, they take a lot of pride in not letting each other down.\u201d",
      "Allen finished 23 of 37 for 280 yards with two interceptions while running eight times for 50 yards and his 57th career rushing TD to tie the late O.J. Simpson for No. 2 in Bills history. Cook had 19 carries 19 for 80 yards. Mack Hollins caught six passes for 86 yards.",
      "Meanwhile, Buffalo's defense forced the 39-year-old Flacco into multiple mistakes and negated Jonathan Taylor in the second half after he rushed for more than 100 yards before halftime. Taylor wound up with 21 carries for 114 yards while rookie receiver Adonai Mitchell had his best game of the season \u2014 six receptions, 71 yards.",
      "It wasn't enough to prevent the Colts (4-6) from losing their third straight or preventing Flacco from getting booed as he went 26 of 35 for 272 yards, two touchdowns and the three picks. He has six turnovers in his two starts since replacing the benched Anthony Richardson. Flacco is 1-3 as Indy's starter this season, failing to recapture the form he had last year when he led the Browns to the playoffs.",
      "\u201cThe first one was just an awful decision,\u201d Flacco said. \u201cThe toughest thing about not playing well is just your mentality and having to deal with the fact that you're not playing well and the best way to do that is to go back to work.\u201d",
      "Just seven plays after Johnson's pick-6, Flacco was intercepted again near midfield and the Bills quickly converted that takeaway into a field goal and a 10-0 lead.",
      "The Colts responded with Taylor's 59-yard run, which set up the first of two field goals by Matt Gay. After Indy's defense stopped the Bills on fourth down, Flacco capitalized with a 2-yard TD pass to Tyler Goodson.",
      "Allen's interception on the Bills' ensuing series set up the field goal that gave Indy a 13-10 lead, but Allen quickly regained control with his 13-yard TD run. Tyler Bass made field goals for Buffalo at the end of the first half and early in the fourth quarter, and Cook sealed the win with a 2-yard TD run early in the fourth.",
      "\u201cI threw two interceptions, can\u2019t do that. We can be cleaner, that\u2019s on me. We\u2019ve got to play better on offense,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThe defense played awesome. We gritted it out and that was a team win right there.\u201d",
      "When the Bills needed a fourth-down conversion in the fourth quarter, Allen took matters into his own hands with a 5-yard run. But as Allen plowed forward for the first down, Colts defensive lineman Dayo Odeyingbo threw three punches in the scrum.",
      "No penalty was called, but Odeyingbo could hear from the league office this week.",
      "The Bills opened the game without two injured receivers, rookie Keon Coleman and the recently acquired Amari Cooper. They also lost TE Dalton Kincaid (knee) during the game. RT Spencer Brown left briefly with an ankle injury.",

He has called the recoveries from consecutive injuries one of the hardest and most grueling things he has ever endured.",
      "The 34-year-old Thompson insists he will be able to focus as if it\u2019s just another game on the schedule, even if that is hardly the case. He offered a farewell message to the Bay Area fans when he joined the Mavericks four months ago and is still plenty beloved here.",

      "Dallas Cowboys receiver CeeDee Lamb is throwing shade at his home field after losing a ball in the sun on a potential touchdown catch",
      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- CeeDee Lamb was unhappy about losing a ball in the sun on an incompletion that helped keep Dallas from scoring a go-ahead touchdown in the first half of a 34-6 loss to Philadelphia on Sunday.",
      "Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones was perturbed that the sun was brought up again as an issue in his $1.2 billion retractable roof stadium, which has glass doors on either end.",
      "AT&T Stadium has an unusual east-west alignment from end zone to end zone, as opposed to most venues being north-south. On clear days, the sun shines in the windows on the west side during the first half of games that kick off in the afternoon.",
      "Lamb, Dallas' All-Pro receiver, was looking into the sun in the second quarter while open on a crossing route in the end zone when a throw from Cooper Rush went behind him and he never adjusted to the ball.",
      "Lamb then pointed to his eyes and was making similar gestures on the sideline during another frustrating home loss for the Cowboys (3-6), who are on a four-game losing streak overall and 0-4 at AT&T Stadium.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t see the ball. Couldn\u2019t see the ball, at all. The sun,\u201d said Lamb, who ended a preseason-long holdout by signing a $136 million, four-year contract extension in late August.",
      "Asked whether the Cowboys should put up curtains, Lamb said: \u201cYes. One thousand percent.\u201d",
      "And on the question of making the suggestion to Jones, Lamb said, \u201cI mean, y\u2019all are doing my job for me right now.\u201d",
      "It has been suggested plenty of times, and Jones always has flatly rejected it. The 82-year-old billionaire angrilyrebuffed it after bringing up the issue unprompted in his postgame session with reporters.",
      "\u201cBy the way, we know where the sun is going to be when we flip the coin, so we do know where the damn sun is going to be in our own stadium,\u201d Jones said. \u201cLet\u2019s just tear the damn stadium down and build another one. Are you kidding me?\u201d",
      "While Jones' response could be taken as a criticism of embattled coach Mike McCarthy, Jones said it wasn't.",
      "\u201cEvery team that comes in here has the same issues,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey know where the sun is going to be. Every team has the same thing. I'm not saying (it\u2019s on McCarthy). I\u2019m saying the world knows where the sun is. We get to know that almost a year in advance. So someone asked me about the sun. What about the sun? Where\u2019s the moon? We\u2019re fine. But everybody plays in the sun out here.\u201d",
      "The Cowboys are bracing for official word that quarterback Dak Prescott needs season-ending surgery for a torn hamstring. They have lost five in a row at AT&T Stadium, with five turnovers in each of the past two losses.",
      "The curtains, or lack thereof, just add to the angst. The next time they will be an issue is Thanksgiving Day against the New York Giants.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t win games turning the ball over five times,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI don\u2019t give a (expletive) who lines up. So that\u2019s the part we got to get right.\u201d",

      "Oilers: The lackluster power play went 1 for 3 after coming in 26th in the league at 14.3%. With Hronek in the box for holding, McDavid tapped in a backdoor shot to boost Edmonton\u2019s lead to 5-2 midway through the third period.",
      "Edmonton broke the game open 6:10 into the third when former Oilers defenseman Vincent Desharnais couldn\u2019t clear a puck from in front of the Vancouver net. Brown picked it up and sent it up and in over Lankinen for his first goal of the game to make it 4-2.",

      "CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Worst day ever? Worst week ever? There was no joy, at least of the major-college football variety, in Florida this weekend.",
      "There were eight games involving the state's FBS and FCS teams on Saturday. There were nine such games this weekend.",
      "There were no wins.",
      "For only the second time, the other being Oct. 10, 2020, the state saw its seven FBS programs \u2014 Miami, Florida, Florida State, UCF, South Florida, Florida Atlantic and Florida International \u2014 combine to go 0-5 on the same day.",
      "It all happened Saturday: Miami watched its unbeaten start end with a 28-23 loss to Georgia Tech, Florida State lost 52-3 to Notre Dame, Florida lost to Texas 49-17, South Florida lost 28-7 to Navy and UCF lost 35-31 to Arizona State.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a bad place with the results that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Florida State coach Mike Norvell after his team fell to 1-9 with a seven-touchdown loss.",
      "He was speaking of his team, and it indeed has been a miserable year for the Seminoles \u2014 the preseason pick to win the Atlantic Coast Conference and a team that will finish no better than tied for last in that 17-team league.",
      "But misery had a lot of company this weekend. Misery has had a lot of company all season.",
      "This is the 20th season of Florida having seven FBS-level programs \u2014 and combined, it\u2019ll be one of the worst years the state has seen in that era.",
      "Miami is 9-1, by far the best of the bunch and still in control of its destiny when it comes to reaching the ACC title game even after losing to Georgia Tech. No other Sunshine State school at the FBS level even has a winning record at this point.",
      "\u201cWe have everything in front of us to play for,\u201d Miami coach Mario Cristobal said.",
      "Not everyone else in Florida can say that. Not even close.",
      "South Florida and Florida are both 4-5, UCF is 4-6, Florida International is 3-6, Florida Atlantic is 2-7 and Florida State is 1-9. It's possible the Hurricanes will be the only major-college Florida team that goes to a bowl game, an unthinkable notion given the state's football tradition.",
      "\u201cWe have a ton of young talent that I think will continue to develop,\u201d Florida coach Billy Napier said after losing to Texas. \"They\u2019re learning, they\u2019re going through this experience, and I think that will prove beneficial in the future.\u201d",
      "Add up the records so far this season and the state\u2019s FBS teams are 27-39, a .409 winning percentage. The worst combined record in the era of the state having seven FBS schools came in 2021 when they went 35-51, a .407 winning percentage.",
      "Saturday marked only the sixth time since 1978 that the state\u2019s three traditional top programs \u2014 the Hurricanes, Seminoles and Gators \u2014 lost on the same day. The UCF and USF losses added to the tally, and the news got worse when adding the state\u2019s three FCS teams into the mix.",
      "With Florida A&M, Bethune-Cookman and Stetson, the Sunshine State's record on Saturday fell to 0-8 \u2014 the worst one-day showing in state history by FBS and FCS teams. Florida A&M lost to Prairie View 31-12, Bethune-Cookman fell 25-23 to Southern in five overtimes and previously winless Marist beat Stetson 40-31.",
      "And Saturday wasn't the entire story of the state's lost weekend. The weekend record for Sunshine State schools fell to 0-9 with the inclusion of Florida Atlantic's 49-14 loss to East Carolina on Thursday.",
      "The only team among the state's FBS and FCS schools that didn't lose this weekend was FIU. The Panthers didn't play.",

      "Chiefs linebacker Leo Chenal blocked Broncos kicker Wil Lutz\u2019s 35-yard field goal attempt as time expired, and Kansas City escaped with a 16-14 victory over the Broncos that extended the Super Bowl champs\u2019 winning streak to 15 games",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Chiefs have won just about every way imaginable during a perfect 15-game run that dates to last season: Patrick Mahomes leading last-second touchdown drives, their defense making a stand, and Harrison Butker kicking game-winning field goals.",
      "They added a walk-off block to the list against the Broncos on Sunday.",
      "Leo Chenal was part of a red wave that crashed through the center of the Denver field goal unit, and the Chiefs linebacker got his hand on Wil Lutz's 35-yard attempt as time expired, allowing Kansas City to escape with a 16-14 victory.",
      "\u201cIt's a complete shock, you know? Not much I can say about it,\" Chenal said. \u201cI was really praying for something to happen. That moment is so heavy. There's a second on the clock, they're going to kick a field goal and you feel the weight of the moment.\u201d",
      "Chiefs coach Andy Reid indicated they took advantage of something they had seen in the Broncos' field-goal operation.",
      "\u201cWe did,\u201d Reid said, \u201cbut it's also something we work on like crazy. It normally doesn't work quite like that one.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs had taken the lead on Butker's field goal with 5:57 remaining, but Bo Nix and the Broncos converted a trio of third downs while marching right back down the field. They proceeded to set up Lutz for the winner, but Chenal came up the middle amid a big push by the Kansas City defensive line to get his hand on the kick.",
      "The ball squibbed away toward the Denver sideline as the Chiefs rushed onto the field to celebrate.",
      "\u201cI felt like we outplayed them but we didn't finish,\u201d Broncos coach Sean Payton said. \u201cThat one will take a while. It'll sting.\u201d",
      "Mahomes finished with 266 yards passing and a touchdown for the Chiefs, who became only the fifth Super Bowl champion to win its first nine games the next season. That also matches the best start to a season in franchise history, and their 15-game win streak dating to last season is the longest in the NFL since the Packers won 19 in a row from 2010-11.",
      "Travis Kelce had eight catches for 64 yards and a touchdown for Kansas City. DeAndre Hopkins caught four passes for 56 yards, and Kareem Hunt was held to 35 yards rushing but also caught seven passes for 65 yards.",
      "\u201cAny way you win is good in this league,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cYou live for these moments. When you grow up playing football, you live for the walk-off whatever-it-is. And I'm glad we get to experience it together.\u201d",
      "Nix finished with 215 yards passing and two touchdowns for the Broncos (5-5). Courtland Sutton had six catches for 60 yards and a score. And their 13-yard hookup on third-and-6 with 1:45 left is what gave Denver a chance to kick as time expired.",
      "\u201cThey just made one extra play. When we thought it was in our hands, it wasn't,\u201d Nix said. \u201cIt's tough. And again, it's two good football teams out there playing against each other, and one day it will go our way.\u201d",
      "The Broncos stunned the Chiefs a year ago, forcing five turnovers in a 21-9 win at Denver that ended a 16-game losing streak in the series. And they clearly had the same intention in mind as the AFC West rivals met again Sunday.",
      "Their defense harassed Mahomes throughout the first half, particularly when an injury to Wanya Morris forced rookie left tackle Kingsley Suamataia into the game. And the Broncos capitalized on offense with two long scoring drives, the first ending with Nix finding Devaughn Vele wide open and the second with Sutton's 32-yard TD catch for a 14-3 lead.",
      "It was Mahomes who got the Chiefs on track, going 7 for 7 for 62 yards on the ensuing drive. When it looked as if it had stalled at the Denver 2, Reid went against his conservative nature on fourth down, and Mahomes hit Kelce for the score.",
      "The Chiefs still trailed 14-10 at the break, meaning they had Denver right where they wanted them.",
      "Unflappable in winning its last eight games when trailing in the second half, Kansas City closed within 14-13 on Butker's chip-shot field goal late in the third quarter. The Chiefs defense then forced back-to-back punts, and Mahomes and the offense drove to the Denver 2, where Butker added the go-ahead kick with just under six minutes remaining.",
      "Plenty of time for the Broncos to drive down the field. Not enough time for them to win.",
      "\u201cI told our team I was proud of the way they fought. I thought we outplayed them,\" Payton said. \u201cBut nonetheless, you have to beat a champion and we weren't able to do it, so obviously gut-wrenching.\u201d",

      "LANDOVER, Md. -- Anyone who questioned Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin's switch to Russell Wilson from Justin Fields might be reconsidering the wisdom of the move right about now. Wilson is looking like the guy who was a star earlier in his career \u2014 especially with those 50-50 deep balls he keeps connecting on.",
      "Wilson shook off his first interception in 11 months and hit trade-deadline pickup Mike Williams for a 32-yard touchdown with less than 2 1/2 minutes left in the fourth quarter for the quarterback's third scoring throw Sunday, lifting the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 28-27 comeback victory over Jayden Daniels and the Washington Commanders.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen it a few times on highlights,\u201d Tomlin said of Wilson's ability to complete the big play, something that helped the QB win one Super Bowl and reach another with the Seattle Seahawks. \u201cIt\u2019s a little better in person. Believe me.\u201d",
      "Coming off a bye, the AFC North-leading Steelers (7-2) won their fourth game in a row, including all three since Wilson took over from Fields. Wilson's stats were not the prettiest on Sunday, but he got the job done: 14 for 28 for 195 yards, the three TDs and the one pick.",
      "\u201cIt was a big-time catch by Mike. I just tried to give him a chance, let him do his thing,\u201d Wilson said about Williams, acquired last week from the New York Jets. \u201cYou visualize those moments and what could happen and just trusting guys. That was all Big Mike there.\u201d",
      "George Pickens delivered an acrobatic catch in the end zone on a 16-yarder in the first quarter, and tight end Pat Freiermuth scored on a pass from 3 yards out in the second, much to the delight of the thousands of Terrible Towel-twirling Steelers fans in the stands.",
      "Washington (7-3) led 24-14 but couldn't hold on as it attempted to get to 8-2 overall for the first time since 1986 and 5-0 at home for the first time since 1991, when the team went on to win the Super Bowl under coach Joe Gibbs.",
      "\u201cToo many small mistakes,\u201d defensive end Clelin Ferrell said.",
      "Daniels, the No. 2 overall draft pick who has starred for first-year coach Dan Quinn, was 17 for 34 for 202 yards without a touchdown or interception. He also had three carries for 5 yards, his lowest output as a pro, while still dealing with a rib injury that he described as \u201cstill there, but it's nothing that's holding me back.\u201d",
      "As for watching his counterpart Wilson, Daniels observed: \u201cHe made plays when the plays needed to be made.\u201d",
      "Never more so than on the over-the-shoulder toss to Williams \u2014 his only catch of the game \u2014 to turn a six-point deficit into a one-point lead for the visitors.",
      "Pickens' take on what Wilson showed there?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one of his biggest components of his game: trusting his receivers,\u201d Pickens said.",
      "After that play, Daniels moved Washington to midfield. On fourth-and-9 with less than 1 1/2 minutes to go, Daniels connected with Zach Ertz, but the catch was ruled just short of a first down; until then, the Commanders were 11 for 11 on fourth down this season.",
      "On the ensuing possession, Pittsburgh faced a fourth-and-1 at Washington's 49 with 1:02 on the clock and decided to line up as if to go for it. But Wilson's hard count got rookie defensive lineman Johnny Newton to jump too soon, and the penalty allowed the Steelers to keep the ball and run out the clock.",
      "This was far from a perfect performance by Pittsburgh, though.",
      "Commanders safety Jeremy Chinn picked off Wilson late in the third quarter and recovered Jaylen Warren's fumble at the 1-yard line in the fourth.",
      "The worst turnover by the Steelers had to be the fake punt deep in its own territory in the first quarter. The snap went to up-back Miles Killebrew, who threw to a wide-open James Pierre, but he dropped the ball. That gave Washington possession at Pittsburgh's 15, and three plays later, Austin Ekeler scored the first of his two short touchdowns runs.",
      "\u201cThat is me. I own that. I\u2019ll do it again,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t execute it, so it was a bad idea.\u201d",

      "Commanders: C Tyler Biadasz (ankle) left the game briefly but returned. ... RT Andrew Wylie (shoulder) was a late scratch, while newly acquired CB Marshon Lattimore (hamstring), RB Brian Robinson Jr. (hamstring) and K Austin Seibert (hip) sat out, as expected. ...

      "He capitalized with his his third NACAR Cup Series championship, using a near-flawless drive to hold off teammate Ryan Blaney and give Team Penske its third major motorsports title in less than a month and third consecutive NASCAR title.",
      "Logano actually called his shot after qualifying second Saturday when he confidently acknowledged it was his Cup Series title to lose.",
      "\u201cYeah, I do. I feel like our car is strong. We got them down now,\u201d Logano boasted. \u201cWe just have to put our foot on their throats. We feel pretty strong about our team, and these type of pressure situations we feel really solid about as far as our team in these moments.\u201d",
      "It may not have been how boss Roger Penske would have phrased it, but it showed the team owner how relentless his team leader can be.",
      "\u201cI might have used different words, but that\u2019s OK,\" Penske said, \u201cwhen you win, you can say whatever you want, I guess.\u201d",
      "Logano held off Blaney over the final 20 laps to beat him for the Cup series title by 0.330 seconds. Blaney was trying to become the first back-to-back champion since Jimmie Johnson won five straight from 2006 to 2010.",
      "Instead, Logano became the 10th driver in NASCAR history to win three or more championships. Kyle Busch is the only other active driver with multiple titles.",
      "\u201cI love the playoffs, I love it man,\u201d Logano said. \u201cWhat a team, what a Penske battle there at the end. Three of them? That's truly special.\"",
      "It was the first time in Team Penske history the organization finished 1-2 in the championship. And, it came after Penske's sports car team in IMSA won the title last month and his World Endurance Championship team won the title last weekend in Bahrain.",
      "Roger Penske said he worried in the closing laps his two drivers would crash into each other, ending the title hopes for both. He also praised longtime sponsor Shell-Pennzoil, which was on Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden\u2019s car for his victory in May for Penske.",
      "Penske also deferred taking too much of the credit for the team success.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about the people,\u201d Penske said. \u201cMy name might be on the door, but it\u2019s all about the people who make the difference and we sure have them on this team.\u201d",
      "Blaney was exhausted after the race, and despite his disappointment was thrilled for the Penske organization.",
      "\u201cAt least a Penske car won it,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cThey put together a great playoffs, and we\u2019re happy. If we\u2019re going to race somebody, I\u2019m happy it was him for the championship, and happy to be 1-2 for Roger, three in a row for Roger, super amazing, and Ford.\u201d",
      "Penske and Ford have won three consecutive Cup Series championships. Logano won in 2022 and Blaney won last year.",
      "\u201cOne-two for Team Penske, three championships in a row, can't be more proud of this team,\u201d Logano said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the best driver but I\u2019ve got the best team. And together, we\u2019re very well-rounded and can show up when it matters the most.\u201d",
      "The finale was winner-take-all to the highest finisher between Logano, Blaney, William Byron in a Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports and Tyler Reddick of the 23XI Racing team owned by NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin.",
      "Byron finished third in the race and Reddick was sixth. It was Byron's second consecutive appearance in the finale, first for Reddick.",
      "\u201cMakes you hungrier, but also just more experience in what it takes,\u201d said Byron, the Daytona 500 winner. \u201cI feel like this style of track has been tough on us, and we made a lot of strides this year, but still more to go. If we can just kind of inch up on this style of track, I know we\u2019re so good at all the other ones, and we can put it all together.\u201d",
      "Reddick, who had been subdued all week compared to his fellow title contenders, didn't lead a lap and had Jordan pacing behind the pit wall much of the race.",
      "\u201cMichael was just proud of the effort of our team all year long,\u201d Reddick said. \u201cPut up a good fight. We didn't make any mistakes that took ourselves out of it. We fought as hard as we could.\u201d",
      "The four title contenders finished in the top six, with Reddick behind Kyle Larson of Hendrick and Christopher Bell, who led a race-high 143 laps after he was disqualified from the finale last week at Martinsville for a safety violation. Byron took his spot instead, and Bell insisted he had been cheated out of the chance to race for the title.",
      "Logano, a 34-year-old from Connecticut, led 107 laps in the dominating win that Blaney made closer than expected in the final laps.",
      "But, his very presence in the final four was controversial as Logano was eliminated from the playoffs after the second round. He was reinstated before Las Vegas, where he won to give the No. 22 team three weeks to prepare for Phoenix.",
      "\u201cOur team is better under pressure,\u201d Logano said. \u201cThe race started in Vegas for us. The amount of work and effort that went into building this race car right here, the amount of time, I don\u2019t think anyone works harder than us. We were up at 6 in the morning this morning going over stuff. The guys just want it bad and I\u2019m glad we delivered.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 15:22:28 -0500",
    "summary": "There is no such a thing as a perfect season, according to Roger Penske, even after winning his third consecutive NASCAR Cup Series championship",
    "story": [
      "There is no such a thing as a perfect season, according to Roger Penske, even after winning his third consecutive NASCAR Cup Series championship",
      "AVONDALE, Ariz. -- There is no such a thing as a perfect season. At least that is what Roger Penske told The Associated Press hours after winning his third consecutive NASCAR championship.",
      "Maybe not.",
      "But Team Penske sure came close.",
      "It started in January with a rare show of emotion from \u201cThe Captain\u201d \u2014 Josef Newgarden said his 87-year-old boss was in tears \u2014 after Team Penske won its first Rolex 24 at Daytona endurance race since 1969.",
      "Weeks later, Joey Logano put a Penske car on the pole for the Daytona 500 for the first time in team history. It turned out Logano was wearing an illegal glove for that historic qualifying run \u2014 a trick Penske lit into his veteran leader for even trying \u2014 but the organization moved on to win nearly everything else in major motorsports this season.",
      "Will Power came up short in the IndyCar championship to three-time champion Alex Palou, and Team Penske didn't win the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but shy of that? Most major trophies say Penske this year.",
      "The IndyCar team \u2014 rocked by its own cheating scandal in the season-opening race \u2014 won six races and Newgarden claimed a second consecutive Indianapolis 500 victory. Scott McLaughlin finished third in the final standings.",
      "The sports car program that Penske has built from scratch with partner Porsche last month won the IMSA championship and two weekends ago in Bahrain won the World Endurance Championship. At the same time in Martinsville, Virginia, reigning NASCAR champion Ryan Blaney won the race to put two Penske cars in Sunday's winner-take-all Cup Series championship at Phoenix Raceway.",
      "A 50% chance is pretty decent odds for any team owner, but Penske was armed with 2022 champion Logano, defending champion Blaney and a shot at winning three straight Cup titles. The organization delivered, with Logano earning his third championship in a closing laps battle with Blaney that gave Penske its first 1-2 NASCAR points finish in team history.",
      "Team Penske is also the only team to win the Cup championship since NASCAR introduced its new car in 2022, and the organization is the first since Hendrick Motorsports in 1998 to win three-straight titles with multiple drivers.",
      "Longtime sponsor Shell-Pennzoil was on the car for both Newgarden's Indy 500 win and Logano's championship Sunday, and, as far as Penske is concerned, this season ranks among the best for an organization that began in 1968.",
      "\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019d have to say it\u2019s probably, if not the best, one of the best,\u201d Penske said. \u201cI think that obviously not to win the IndyCar championship, which of course it\u2019s where we all started and built our first racing team, was disappointing.\u201d",
      "And there it is, the part about nothing ever being perfect. Penske can still find a shortfall in this otherwise impeccable season that saw the organization win its 100th Cup Series race with Ford; a 20th Indianapolis 500 win; a second career sweep of front row qualifying at Indy; the 100th sports car win and 100th sports car pole for the organization; Logano becoming just the 10th driver in NASCAR history to win three or more titles, and crew chief Paul Wolfe, with 41 victories, now the winningest active team leader in the Cup Series.",
      "It is all the people who have made this a banner season, Penske insisted. His name is on the cars, but it is the long-term employees who make the organization so successful.",
      "\u201cRacing is a common thread through our company. It\u2019s our brand, and of course we want to win,\u201d Penske said. \u201cWhat I try to do is provide them with what they need to be champions. We\u2019re not always up like this. Sure, we want to win more. We want to win properly.\u201d",
      "He listed the key personnel of his race teams, all Penske-grown and not plucked away from another team \u2014 a key factor in both loyalty and commitment to the \u201cPenske Perfect\u201d cause.",
      "\u201cThey have that domain knowledge, which makes it so important, and they work as one team,\u201d Penske said. \"So what I need to do is continue to push them because we\u2019re not interested in sitting here and not having the success. We talk about the 24 Hours of Daytona, that rubbed off on these guys.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re always asking me how are we doing?\" Penske continued. \"And I think when you think about it, the number of people that we have that we touch every race in our company, and we have 74,000 people that (Monday) are going to be just climbing the walls with happiness because of the success \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019m in it for.\u201d",
      "Logano, in the glow of his latest championship, quoted his father to explain what it is like to work for Penske: \u201cYou can\u2019t soar like an eagle if you\u2019re working with a bunch of turkeys,\u201d he said of Tom Logano's mantra.",
      "\u201cYou think about what Team Penske is today, racing in all the different forms of motorsports and winning in all of them, like where else do you want to go? This is where you go to win. You surround yourself with a winner, that\u2019s what happens,\u201d Logano said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of eagles there. There\u2019s a lot of really smart people, a lot of driven individuals, and that goes through so many different forms throughout Penske.\u201d",

      "HARRISON, N.J. -- Rose Lavelle scored in stoppage time and Gotham FC defeated the Portland Thorns 2-1 on Sunday to advance to the semifinals of the National Women's Soccer League playoffs.",
      "Gotham, the defending NWSL champions, will face the second-seeded Washington Spirit next weekend. The Spirit defeated visiting Bay FC 2-1 in extra time earlier on Sunday in the quarterfinals.",
      "It was the final NWSL game for Thorns forward Christine Sinclair, who is retiring after 12 seasons with the club.",
      "A club record 15,540 fans were on hand for the match at Red Bull Arena. Gotham finished the season with the third seed, going 17-4-5.",
      "The Thorns struggled down the stretch but defeated Angel City in the final regular season match to secure the eighth and final seed.",
      "Sophia Smith, who played for the United States at the Olympics this summer, appeared to put the Thorns up in the 43rd minute but she was offside.",
      "There was a lengthy video review in the second half to determine if Portland defender Becky Sauerbrunn committed a handball in the box, which would have given Gotham a penalty. Ultimately it wasn't ruled a penalty.",
      "Tierna Davidson broke through with her first goal of the season to put Gotham up 1-0 in the 67th minute. It came off a free kick that Lavelle sent into a crowd in front of the goal.",
      "Rookie Reilyn Turner's goal on a header off a set piece in the 75th minute pulled Portland even. Morgan Weaver nearly put the Thorns on top but her shot caromed off the post before Lavelle scored the winner seven minutes into stoppage time.",
      "\"It's always nice to score in stoppage time so you don't have to go into overtime,\" Lavelle said.",
      "Sinclair, 41, has played for Portland since the NWSL's launch in 2013 and has helped the Thorns win NWSL championships in 2013, 2017 and 2022. She has scored a club-record 65 regular-season goals with the team, ranking third all-time in the league",
      "Sinclair retired from the Canadian national team last year as international soccer's all-time leading scorer among both men and women with 190 goals.",
      "Shield winners the Orlando Pride, the top seed, will face the Kansas City Current next weekend in the other semifinal. The NWSL championship will be played on Nov. 23 at Kansas City's CPKC Stadium.",

      "U.S. researchers have concluded that China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor to power future aircraft carriers",
      "Bangkok -- China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing the country\u2019s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California is the first to confirm it is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \u201cblue-water\u201d force capable of operating around the globe in a growing challenge to the United States.",
      "Nuclear carriers take longer to build than conventional carriers, but once in operation they are able to stay at sea for much longer because they do not need to refuel, and there is more room on board for fuel and weapons for aircraft, thus extending their capabilities. They are also able to produce more power to run advanced systems.",
      "Right now, only the United States and France have nuclear-powered carriers. The U.S. has 11 in total, which allows it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "China currently has three carriers, including the new Type 003 Fujian, which was the first both designed and built by China. It has said work is already underway on a fourth, but it has not announced whether that will be nuclear or conventionally powered.",
      "The modernization aligns with China\u2019s \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\u201d for its navy \u201cto operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China\u2019s military.",
      "Middlebury researchers were initially investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan over suspicions that China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons. Instead they said they determined that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship.",
      "The conclusion was based upon a wide variety of sources, including satellite images, project tenders, personnel files, and environmental impact studies.",
      "The reactor is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship.\u201d as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizeable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",

      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",

      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\u201cThe reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\u201d",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles (112 kilometers) southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship\u201d under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \u201cnational defense-related construction project\u201d that is classified \u201csecret.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\u201d researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \u201cconvincing argument.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\u201d she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \u201ccarefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\u201d",
      "\u201cGiven the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\u201d said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \u201cski-jump\u201d type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \u201csoon be announced,\u201d but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \u201cincremental improvements.\u201d",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \u201chave taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\u201d",
      "Eventually, however, \u201clarger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\u201d Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\u201cAs well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\u201d Childs said.",
      "\u201cMuch will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\u201d",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \u201cwith greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\u201d said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\u201cThese carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\u201d Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \u201cfirst-class\u201d navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \u201cspeeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\u201d",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \u201cgrowing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China\u2019s shore,\u201d the report said.",

      "The U.S. government\u2019s highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves",
      "DETROIT -- The U.S. government's highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves, conflicting with owners manuals and briefings with the agency saying the electric vehicles need human supervision.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is asking the company to \u201crevisit its communications\u201d to make sure messages are consistent with user instructions.",
      "The request came in a May email to the company from Gregory Magno, a division chief with the agency's Office of Defects Investigation. It was attached to a letter seeking information on a probe into crashes involving Tesla's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system in low-visibility conditions. The letter was posted Friday on the agency's website.",
      "The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\" when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.",
      "Critics, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have long accused Tesla of using deceptive names for its partially automated driving systems, including \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and \u201cAutopilot,\u201d both of which have been viewed by owners as fully autonomous.",
      "The letter and email raise further questions about whether Full Self-Driving will be ready for use without human drivers on public roads, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk has predicted. Much of Tesla's stock valuation hinges on the company deploying a fleet of autonomous robotaxis.",
      "Musk, who has promised autonomous vehicles before, said the company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.",
      "A message was sent Friday seeking comment from Tesla.",
      "In the email, Magno writes that Tesla briefed the agency in April on an offer of a free trial of \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and emphasized that the owner's manual, user interface and a YouTube video tell humans that they have to remain vigilant and in full control of their vehicles.",
      "But Magno cited seven posts or reposts by Tesla's account on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, that Magno said indicated that Full Self-Driving is capable of driving itself.",
      "\u201cTesla's X account has reposted or endorsed postings that exhibit disengaged driver behavior,\u201d Magno wrote. \u201cWe believe that Tesla's postings conflict with its stated messaging that the driver is to maintain continued control over the dynamic driving task.\"",
      "The postings may encourage drivers to see Full Self-Driving, which now has the word \u201csupervised\u201d next to it in Tesla materials, to view the system as a \u201cchauffeur or robotaxi rather than a partial automation/driver assist system that requires persistent attention and intermittent intervention by the driver,\u201d Magno wrote.",
      "On April 11, for instance, Tesla reposted a story about a man who used Full Self-Driving to travel 13 miles (21 kilometers) from his home to an emergency room during a heart attack just after the free trial began on April 1. A version of Full Self-Driving helped the owner \"get to the hospital when he needed immediate medical attention,\u201d the post said.",
      "In addition, Tesla says on its website that use of Full Self-Driving and Autopilot without human supervision depends on \u201cachieving reliability\" and regulatory approval, Magno wrote. But the statement is accompanied by a video of a man driving on local roads with his hands on his knees, with a statement that, \u201cThe person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself,\u201d the email said.",
      "In the letter seeking information on driving in low-visibility conditions, Magno wrote that the investigation will focus on the system's ability to perform in low-visibility conditions caused by \u201crelatively common traffic occurrences.\u201d",
      "Drivers, he wrote, may not be told by the car that they should decide where Full Self-Driving can safely operate or fully understand the capabilities of the system.",
      "\u201cThis investigation will consider the adequacy of feedback or information the system provides to drivers to enable them to make a decision in real time when the capability of the system has been exceeded,\u201d Magno wrote.",
      "The letter asks Tesla to describe all visual or audio warnings that drivers get that the system \u201cis unable to detect and respond to any reduced visibility condition.\u201d",
      "The agency gave Tesla until Dec. 18 to respond to the letter, but the company can ask for an extension.",
      "That means the investigation is unlikely to be finished by the time President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January, and Trump has said he would put Musk in charge of a government efficiency commission to audit agencies and eliminate fraud. Musk spent at least $119 million in a campaign to get Trump elected, and Trump has spoken against government regulations.",
      "Auto safety advocates fear that if Musk gains some control over NHTSA, the Full Self-Driving and other investigations into Tesla could be derailed.",
      "Musk even floated the idea of him helping to develop national safety standards for self-driving vehicles.",
      "\u201cOf course the fox wants to build the henhouse,\u201d said Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit watchdog group.",
      "He added that he can't think of anyone who would agree that a business mogul should have direct involvement in regulations that affect the mogul\u2019s companies.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge problem for democracy, really,\u201d Brooks said."

    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across 226,000 square miles (590,000 square kilometers) of remaining grouse habitat spanning 11 states.",
      "Now, in the closing weeks of the Biden administration, officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling sites located outside the protected areas.",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's science-based proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on government lands to continue.",
      "\u201cFor too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\u201d Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with the oil and renewable energy industries, Republicans and even some environmentalists.",
      "A spokesperson for American Clean Power, a renewables industry lobbying group companies, said it had supported an earlier version of the proposal but not the final details released Friday. Spokesperson Phil Sgro said the proposal \u201cunnecessarily restricts the development of wind, solar, battery storage and transmission, undermining the ability to deploy much needed clean energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Most of the land at issue is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "In Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon said the proposal would add new layers of federal regulation and hinder practical solutions for the grouse. U.S. Sen. John Barrasso accused the Biden administration of trying to ram though the changes on its way out the door.",
      "\u201cI look forward to working with the Trump-Vance administration to reverse this reckless decision,\u201d said Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee.",
      "Several major conservation organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation and Natural Resources Defense Council, issued a joint statement in support of the changes.",
      "Other environmentalists said officials had squandered a chance to put in place more meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles (122,000 square kilometers) of sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cIt's death by a thousands cuts,\u201d said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \u201cThe Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't.\u201d",
      "Federal officials predicted minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance. She said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cSo they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\u201d Sgamma said. \u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will accept protests against Friday's proposal until Dec. 9. Final decisions on changes to the agency's land management plans will be made after the protests are resolved.",
      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",
      "An analysis of the mining ban will be published by the end of the year, according to the Interior Department.",
      "Greater sage grouse once numbered in the millions across all or portions of 11 Western states. Populations have dropped 65% since 1986, according to government scientists."

      "The Rhesus macaques made a break for it Wednesday after an employee at the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee didn't fully lock a door as she fed and checked on them, officials said.",
      "\u201cThey are very social monkeys and they travel in groups, so when the first couple go out the door the others tend to just follow right along,\u201d Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard told CBS News.",
      "Westergaard said his main goal is to have the monkeys returned safely with no other problems. \u201cI think they are having an adventure,\u201d he said.",
      "The monkeys on Friday were exploring the outer fence of the Alpha Genesis compound and are cooing at the monkeys inside, police said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe primates are exhibiting calm and playful behavior, which is a positive indication,\u201d the police statement said, adding company workers are closely watching the monkeys while keeping their distance as they work to safely recapture them.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police all said the monkeys pose no risk to public health. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical and other researchers.",
      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday.",
      "Authorities still recommend that people who live near the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee shut their windows and doors and call 911 if they see the monkeys. Approaching them could make them more skittish and harder to capture, officials said.",
      "Eve Cooper, a biology professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who has studied rhesus macaques, said the animals have the potential to be dangerous and urged people to keep their distance.",
      "Rhesus macaques monkeys can be aggressive. And some carry the herpes B virus, which can be fatal to humans, Cooper said.",
      "However, Alpha Genesis states on its website that it specializes in pathogen-free primates. Cooper noted that there are pathogen-free populations of rhesus macaques that have been quarantined and tested.",
      "\u201cI would give them a wide berth,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThey\u2019re unpredictable animals. And they can behave quite aggressively when they\u2019re afraid.\u201d",
      "Alpha Genesis provides primates for research worldwide at its compound about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia, according to its website.",
      "Locally, it is known as \u201cthe monkey farm.\u201d And there is more amusement than panic around Yemassee and its population of about 1,100 just off Interstate 95 about 2 miles from Auldbrass Plantation, a Frank Lloyd Wright house designed in the 1930s.",
      "There have been escapes before, but the monkeys haven't caused problems, said William McCoy, who owns Lowcountry Horology, a clock and watch repair shop.",
      "\u201cThey normally come home because that\u2019s where the food is,\" he said.",
      "McCoy has lived in Yemassee for about two years and while he plans to stay away from the monkeys, he has his own light-hearted plan to get them back.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m stocking up bananas, maybe they\u2019ll show up,\" McCoy said.",
      "The Alpha Genesis compound is regularly inspected by federal officials.",
      "In 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined Alpha Genesis $12,600 in part after officials said 26 primates escaped from the Yemassee facility in 2014 and an additional 19 got out in 2016.",
      "The company's fine was also issued because of individual monkey escapes as well as the killing of one monkey by others when it was placed in the wrong social group, according to a report from the USDA.",
      "The group Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent a letter Thursday to the USDA asking the agency to immediately send an inspector to the Alpha Genesis facility, conduct a thorough investigation and treat them as a repeated violator. The group was involved in the 2018 fine against the company.",
      "\u201cThe clear carelessness which allowed these 40 monkeys to escape endangered not only the safety of the animals, but also put the residents of South Carolina at risk,\u201d wrote Michael Budkie, executive director of the group.",
      "The USDA, which has inspected the compound 10 times since 2020, didn't immediately respond to the letter.",
      "The facility's most recent federal inspection in May showed there were about 6,700 primates on site and no issues.",
      "In a 2022 review, federal veterinarians reported two animals died when their fingers were trapped in structures and they were exposed to harsh weather. They also found cages weren't adequately secure. Inspectors said criminal charges, civil penalties or other sanctions could follow if the problems weren't fixed.",
      "Since then, Alpha Genesis has undergone six inspections with minor problems reported only once.",
      "In January 2023, the USDA said temperatures were out of the 45 to 85 degree Fahrenheit (7.2 to 29.5 degree Celsius) required range at some of the compound's monkey cages. The inspection found moldy food in one bin, sharp edges on a gate that could cut an animal and sludge, food waste, used medical supplies, mechanical equipment, and general construction debris on the grounds.",
      "Supporters of medical research involving nonhuman primates said they are critical to lifesaving medical advances like creating vaccines against COVID-19 because of their similarities to people. Keeping a domestic supply of the animals is critical to prevent shortages for U.S. researchers.",
      "Humans have been using the rhesus macaque for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe that rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "These monkeys have been launched into space on V2 rockets, used for AIDS research, had their genome mapped and made stars of their own reality television show. They were in such high demand in the early 2000s that a shortage led to scientists paying up to $10,000 per animal.",
      "Outside of rats and mice, rhesus macaques are one of the most studied animals on the planet, said Dario Maestripieri, a behavioral scientist at the University of Chicago who wrote the 2007 book \u201cMacachiavellian Intelligence: How Rhesus Macaques and Humans Have Conquered the World.\u201d",
      "The animals are very family oriented, siding with relatives when fights break out. And they\u2019re adept at building political alliances in the face of threats from other monkeys. But they can be painful to watch. Monkeys with lower status in the hierarchy live in a constant state of fear and intimidation, Maestripieri said.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, they kind of represent some of the worst aspects of human nature,\u201d Maestripieri said.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s states and territories on Friday unanimously backed a national plan to require most forms of social media to bar children younger than 16.",
      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",
      "The minor Greens party was critical, saying the ban would prevent the emergence in Australia of future child environmental activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg.",
      "More than 140 academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Critics say most teenagers are tech savvy enough to get around such laws. Some fear the ban will create conflicts within families and drive social media problems underground.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, argues that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe think these laws will make a real positive difference,\u201d Albanese said.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also facing bullying and other challenges online, but they actually need the social supports to know how to navigate the platforms safely and so they need more support from parents, from care-givers, not less access to a single or multiple platforms,\u201d Given added.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere are so many questions about this that have yet to be answered, but even if we had solid answers about how this might work technically and how this might get implemented socially, it's still hard to believe that this would actually keep kids safe online,\" he added.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said children would retain access to online education and health services.",
      "The legislation would also include strong privacy protections surrounding age verification.",

      "Rowland said YouTube would likely be included among the mainstream platforms defined under the legislation as age restricted services.",
      "But YouTube Kids could be exempted. Gaming and messaging services would not face age restrictions, she said,",

    "story": [
      "The assets of Alex Jones' Infowars are set to be auctioned off next week, and both supporters and detractors of the conspiracy theorist are expressing interest in bidding",
      "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars broadcasts could end next week as he faces a court-ordered auction of his company's assets to help pay the more than $1 billion defamation judgment he owes families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Or maybe not.",
      "Both opponents and supporters of the bombastic internet show and radio host have expressed interest in bidding on the Infowars properties he has built over the past 25 years. They include Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and Donald Trump, and anti-Jones progressive media groups. If Jones supporters buy the assets, he could end up staying on Infowars.",
      "Up for sale are everything from Jones' studio desk to Infowars' name, video archive, social media accounts and product trademarks. Buyers can even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. For now, Jones' personal social media, including his account on X, formerly known as Twitter, with 3 million followers, are not up for sale, but court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "The auctions resulted from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after the Sandy Hook families were awarded nearly $1.5 billion in damages in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas over his claims that the school shooting was a hoax. Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets also are being liquidated to help pay the judgment.",
      "The deadline to submit bids and nondisclosure agreements on the Infowars assets is Friday afternoon. After the bids are reviewed, prospective buyers deemed qualified will be invited to a live auction that could see multiple bidding rounds next Wednesday. Any items not sold will be put up at another auction on Dec. 10.",
      "Jones has expressed confidence that supporters \u2014 whom he did not name \u2014 will buy the assets of Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, allowing him to continue using its platforms. He also appears to be preparing for losing the brand because he has set up new websites and social media accounts and has been directing his audience to them.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buyers, people that are patriots that want it and will come in,\u201d Jones said on his show in August. \u201cIf not ... we'll work with somebody else, fire something up. And it\u2019ll be a little bit of a hiccup for the crew, and things. But that will just make us bigger.\u201d",
      "Email messages to Infowars and Jones' bankruptcy lawyer were not returned.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much money the auctions might bring in. In court documents, Free Speech Systems listed the total value of its properties and holdings at $18 million. Proceeds from the sales will go to creditors including the Sandy Hook families, who have not yet received any money from Jones and his company.",
      "Confidentiality agreements and sealed bids generally are used in auctions to maximize bid amounts while preventing bidders from talking to each other and driving down the offers. The trustee in Jones' bankruptcy case said in court documents that the procedures for the Infowars auction were designed to attract the highest possible bids.",
      "Christopher Mattei, a Connecticut lawyer representing the Sandy Hook families, called the auctions an important milestone in their yearslong fight to hold Jones accountable. He also said the families will be seeking a portion of all Jones' future income.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, the Connecticut families have sought to hold Jones fully accountable for his lies and to protect other families from him,\u201d Mattei said. \u201cStripping Jones of the corrupt business he used to attack the families while poisoning the minds of his listeners is an important measure of justice.\u201d",
      "The families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 hoax conspiracies and threats by his followers.",
      "Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the judgments.",
      "Jones has made millions of dollars from his internet and radio shows, primarily through sales of nutritional supplements, survival gear, clothing and other merchandise.",
      "Jones and other right-wing commentators once on the fringe have catapulted in popularity as many people have moved away from traditional news sources. Trump elevated them further during his 2024 campaign by repeating some of their conspiracy theories and appearing on several of their podcasts and shows. On Thursday, Jones, a long-time Trump supporter, even accepted proposals, some perhaps tongue-in-cheek, by Donald Trump Jr. and other conservatives to be the president-elect's press secretary.",
      "Stone, the Jones and Trump ally and a conservative commentator, said on his X account and on Jones' show that he would like to put together a group of investors to buy Infowars. He did not return email and social media messages on Thursday.",
      "\u201cI understand the importance of Infowars as a beacon of the truth, as a beacon of truthful information. And therefore, I would like to do whatever I possibly can to ensure, if possible, that Infowars survives,\" Stone said on Jones' show in September.",
      "People on social media also have urged billionaire Elon Musk, owner of Tesla and X, to buy Infowars, an idea Jones has backed but Musk has not publicly responded to.",
      "On the other side, Jones' detractors have shown interest in buying Infowars, kicking Jones out and turning it into something else, such as a news site that debunks conspiracy theories or even a parody site. They include officials at two progressive media sites, The Barbed Wire and Media Matters for America.",
      "An opinion piece by The Barbed Wire in September by publisher Jeff Rotkoff had a headline that read, \"Let\u2019s Buy Infowars. Alex Jones used these exact materials to exploit his viewers, peddle conspiracy theories, and damage the lives of grieving parents. We want revenge.\u201d",
      "Rotkoff urged readers to donate money to help put in bids, but he said Thursday that The Barbed Wire, based in Jones' home state of Texas, was now unlikely to make any offers.",
      "\u201cBut we have talked to a number of similarly ideologically aligned bidders and we are certain we will be outbid,\u201d Rotkoff said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that there appear to be multiple well-resourced bidders who share our interest in undoing much of the damage to our country done by Alex Jones. We\u2019ll be rooting for those folks to be successful.\u201d",
      "He declined to say who the other potential bidders were.",
      "Who exactly has submitted bids so far has not been disclosed. Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, which is helping to run the auction along with Tranzon Asset Advisors, would only say there have been a large number of inquiries.",
      "If detractors buy up Infowars' properties and Jones gets the boot, he should be able to build new platforms fairly quickly, said Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor of communication and media at Merrimack College in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cAs long as there is an audience hungry for his content \u2014 and there is \u2014 he\u2019ll be able to utilize X and various fringe social media platforms,\" she said in an email."

      "The text not only used her daughter's name, but it directed her to report to a \u201cplantation\u201d in North Carolina, where Dunham said they\u2019ve never lived. When they looked up the address, it was the location of a museum.",
      "\u201cIt was very disturbing,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s just trying to figure out what does this all mean for me? So, I definitely had a lot of fear and concern.\u201d",
      "Her daughter initially thought it was a prank, but emotions are high following Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. Dunham and her family thought it could be more nefarious and reported it to local law enforcement.",

      "A police chief in South Carolina says there is no \u201calmost no danger\u201d to the public after 43 monkeys escaped from a compound used for medical research",
      "Forty-three monkeys escaped from a compound used for medical research in South Carolina but the nearby police chief said there is \"almost no danger\u201d to the public.",
      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday morning.",
      "The Rhesus macaque primates escaped from the Alpha Genesis facility Wednesday when a new employee didn't fully shut an enclosure, Alexander said.",
      "The monkeys are females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms) and are so young and small that they haven't been used for testing, police said.",
      "Alpha Genesis employees \u201ccurrently have eyes on the primates and are working to entice them with food,\u201d police said in a statement issued around noon Thursday.",
      "The company usually handles escapes on site, but the monkeys got outside the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee, Alexander said.",
      "\u201cThe handlers know them well and usually can get them back with fruit or a little treat,\u201d Alexander told The Associated Press by phone.",
      "But rounding up these escapees is taking some more work. Alpha Genesis is taking the lead, setting up traps and using thermal imaging cameras to recapture the monkeys on the run, the chief said.",
      "\u201cThere is almost no danger to the public,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "People living nearby need to shut their windows and doors so the monkeys can't find a place to hide inside and if they see the primates, call 911 so company officials and police can capture them.",
      "Alpha Genesis provides primates for research worldwide at its compound about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia, according to its website. The company did not respond to an email asking about Wednesday's escape.",
      "In 2018, federal officials fined Alpha Genesis $12,600 after dozens of primates escaped as well as for an incident that left a few others without water and other problems with how the monkeys were housed.",
      "Officials said 26 primates escaped from the Yemassee facility in 2014 and an additional 19 got out in 2016.",
      "The group Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture asking the agency to immediately send an inspector to the Alpha Genesis facility, conduct a thorough investigation and treat them as a repeated violator. The group was involved in the 2018 fine against the company.",
      "\u201cThe clear carelessness which allowed these 40 monkeys to escape endangered not only the safety of the animals, but also put the residents of South Carolina at risk,\u201d Michael Budkie, the executive director of the group, wrote in the Thursday morning letter."

      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\u201cWe were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\u201d said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \u201cIt opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\u201d",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \u201cthe house of the golden bracelet,\u201d the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \u201cthe story that was long spun around these individuals\u201d was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\u201cThey have a better overview of what\u2019s happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \u201cWe actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\u201d",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",

      "TOKYO -- A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",
      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "The first sample alone is not enough and additional small-scale sampling missions will be necessary in order to obtain more data, TEPCO spokesperson Kenichi Takahara told reporters Thursday. \u201cIt may take time, but we will steadily tackle decommissioning,\u201d Takahara said.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the. plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",
      "That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",
      "The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel.",
      "Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them.",
      "The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said there have been some delays but \u201cthere will be no impact on the entire decommissioning process.\u201d",
      "No specific plans for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal have been decided."

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would institute an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing harm to our kids and I\u2019m calling time on it,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced in Parliament during its final two weeks in session this year, which begin on Nov. 18. The age limit would take effect 12 months after the law is passed, Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The proposal comes as governments around the world are wrestling with how to supervise young people's use of technologies like smartphones and social media.",
      "Social media platforms would be penalized for breaching the age limit, but under-age children and their parents would not.",
      "\u201cThe onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. The onus won\u2019t be on parents or young people,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "Antigone Davis, head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the company would respect any age limitations the government wants to introduce.",
      "\u201cHowever, what\u2019s missing is a deeper discussion on how we implement protections, otherwise we risk making ourselves feel better, like we have taken action, but teens and parents will not find themselves in a better place,\u201d Davis said in a statement.",
      "She added that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. TikTok declined to comment.",
      "The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, described the age limit as a \u201c20th Century response to 21st Century challenges.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement.",
      "More than 140 Australian and international academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Jackie Hallan, a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut, opposed the ban. She said 73% of young people across Australia accessing mental health support did so through social media.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\u201d Hallan said.",
      "Child psychologist Philip Tam said a minimum age of 12 or 13 would have been more enforceable.",
      "\u201cMy real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground,\u201d Tam said.",
      "Australian National University lawyer Associate Prof. Faith Gordon feared separating children from there platforms could create pressures within families.",
      "Albanese said there would be exclusions and exemptions in circumstances such as a need to continue access to educational services.",
      "But parental consent would not entitle a child under 16 to access social media.",
      "Earlier this year, the government began a trial of age-restriciton technologies. Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, the online watchdog that will police compliance, will use the results of that trial to provide platforms with guidance on what reasonable steps they can take.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the year-long lead-in would ensure the age limit could be implemented in a \u201cvery practical way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere does need to be enhanced penalties to ensure compliance,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "\u201cEvery company that operates in Australia, whether domiciled here or otherwise, is expected and must comply with Australian law or face the consequences,\u201d she added.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support for an age limit at 16.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Paul Fletcher said the platforms already had the technology to enforce such an age ban.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really a technical viability question, it\u2019s a question of their readiness to do it and will they incur the cost to do it,\u201d Fletcher told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThe platforms say: \u2019It's all too hard, we can\u2019t do it, Australia will become a backwater, it won\u2019t possibly work.' But if you have well-drafted legislation and you stick to your guns, you can get the outcomes,\u201d Fletcher added."

      "TORONTO -- Canada announced Wednesday it won\u2019t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it.",
      "Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc.",
      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",
      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement that the shutdown of its Canadian offices will mean the loss of hundreds of local jobs.",
      "\u201cWe will challenge this order in court,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.\u201d",
      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",
      "TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.",
      "Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver.",
      "Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that \"banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.\u201d",
      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",
      "Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China\u2019s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.",
      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell.",

    "story": [
      "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan\u2019s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour.",
      "As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan.",
      "Perhaps the biggest consequence for China \u2014 if Trump stays true to his campaign promises \u2014 is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "Tariffs like that would be a blow to China\u2019s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China\u2019s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS.",
      "During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised.",
      "President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles.",
      "Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade.",
      "\u201cGiven the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.\u201d",
      "Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump\u2019s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he\u2019ll be able to do quickly, without saying how.",
      "Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.",
      "\u201cChina is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,\" Wang wrote in a recent commentary. \"These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.\u201d",
      "There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs \u2014 150% to 200% \u2014 on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.",
      "Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979.",
      "Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing.",
      "China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cWill (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,\u201d he said.",
      "As for China\u2019s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m (expletive) crazy.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. weapons this year.",
      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said.",
      "Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe are clear about the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence.",
      "But Trump has criticized Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.",
      "The island\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.",
      "Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago.",
      "\u201cRather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan\u2019s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,\u201d Goto said."

      "It\u2019s no surprise that students are pushing back on cellphone bans in classrooms",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- It\u2019s no surprise that students are pushing back on cellphone bans in classrooms. But school administrators in one South Florida county working to pull students\u2019 eyes away from their screens are facing some resistance from another group as well \u2013 parents.",
      "Since the beginning of the 2024 school year in August, students in Broward County Public Schools, the country\u2019s sixth largest district, have been barred from using cellphones during the school day, including during lunch and breaks, unless given special permission.",
      "The schools are some of the many across the country wrestling with how to crack down on cellphones, at a time when experts say social media use among young people is nearly universal \u2013 and that screen time is linked to higher rates of anxiety and depression among kids.",
      "But a survey sent out by the South Florida school district earlier this fall found that of the more than 70,000 students, teachers and parents surveyed, nearly one in five parents believe the cellphone ban is having a negative impact on their student\u2019s wellbeing.",
      "Among the top concerns for the students and parents surveyed is not being able to communicate with their family members, especially in an emergency \u2014 an anxiety that cuts deep in the district that\u2019s home to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a 2018 shooting killed 17 people.",
      "District officials have said students can use their phones during an emergency and that teachers have the flexibility to grant kids access for other reasons too.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us thinks kids should be on their phones during class,\u201d said Erin Gohl, a parent and advocate in the district.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really talking about giving kids tools during those times when they need it,\u201d she added, including letting students use their phones for \u201cpositive mental health purposes\u201d.",
      "Officials in the Fort Lauderdale-area district have acknowledged that implementation of the policy has been inconsistent. Some teachers have struggled to monitor students\u2019 phone use, and are facing the reality that for some kids, phones can be a needed tool to access online lessons and turn in assignments, especially for those who don\u2019t have a school-issued laptop. And parents have argued their students are better off with their phones, helping them coordinate afternoon pickup times or text their parents for advice about a school bully.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t expect students to say \u2014 or parents of high schoolers to say \u2014 right, that, they don\u2019t want their kids to have cellphones,\u201d said Howard Hepburn, Broward superintendent of schools. \u201cThe expectation that we\u2019re going to just have a hard stop is not reality. It takes time.\u201d",
      "Landyn Spellberg, a student advisor to the Broward school board, said there are a lot of benefits to phones \u2014 and that the district's blanket ban isn't helping students with something many adults still struggle with: learning how to use technology in a healthy way.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s important that we teach students about the negatives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t inform students of those things.\u201d",

      "Trump won't vote in the secret-ballot race, but his influence on it is palpable.",
      "Senate Republicans are poised to make a historic decision on Wednesday when they'll gather behind closed doors to select their new party leader -- and President-elect Donald Trump's influence in undeniable as he insists that whoever be selected support his ability to install recess appointments to his Cabinet.",
      "With Trump's victory and Senate Republican's majority secured, the lead up to the race has intensified the jockeying between the three major contenders for the position: Sen. John Thune, Sen. John Cornyn and Sen. Rick Scott.",
      "The leadership election, slated to occur just one day after the Senate returns from its monthlong election recess, will see Senate Republicans selecting their first new leader since 2007, when current Republican Leader Mitch McConnell first won the job. McConnell is the longest-serving party leader in United States history, but announced earlier this year he'd be stepping aside after the election.",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican who currently serves as the No. 2 Republican, is somewhat of a front-runner in the race. He has served as the party whip for the last six years and in that time has notched a number of policy wins for the party, and has been working behind closed doors to whip support for the role for months. Thune said he keeps in regular contact with Trump and his team, but the two have at times had an icy relationship.",
      "Running against Thune is Cornyn, a Texas Republican and another established GOP leader who served as the party's whip for the six years prior to Thune before being term-limited out of the role. Though Cornyn has a slightly more conservative track record than Thune, he also faced ire from Trump for his support of the bipartisan gun safety bill that passed in the wake of the shooting in Uvalde, Texas.",
      "Also vying for the role is Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican who just won reelection. Scott has attempted to brand himself as the most Trump-aligned of the contenders, but is less popular among some of his Senate colleagues after a stint atop the Senate GOP's campaign arm in 2022 led to a less-than-successful night for Senate Republicans.",
      "Trump won't get a vote in this secret-ballot race, but his influence over it is palpable.",
      "Many Republicans see Trump's comfortable victory in Tuesday's elections coupled with Senate Republicans' new majority as a sweeping mandate to implement Trump's policies, and as such, potential party leaders seem to be cozying up to Trump ahead of the vote.",
      "Trump has not yet endorsed a specific candidate for the race, and it's unclear whether he ultimately will. Instead, Trump has attempted to exert influence over the race by arguing that whoever is slated to fill the role supports a modification to what has become the Senate's normal operating procedure to allow him to temporarily install appointments to federal vacancies without Senate approval during the Senate recesses.",
      "\"Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner. Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more. This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again. We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\" Trump wrote on his social media platform on Sunday.",
      "Recess appointments are permitted by the constitution, and allow presidents to fill federal vacancies during Senate recesses. Though once a regular occurrence, the Senate has operated in such a way as to block all recess appointments since former President Barack Obama's first term. Allowing recess appointments for Trump's second term could allow controversial nominees who may otherwise fail to get the support they need from the GOP-controlled Senate to serve for nearly two years without Senate approval.",
      "None of the top contenders have ruled out supporting the use of these recess appointments, and their responses to Trump's post show how far each is willing to go to show that they're on Trump's side.",
      "Though Thune said in an interview on Thursday that his \"preference\" would be for Trump to stay out of the Senate leadership race, he issued a statement Sunday night following Trump's post affirming his commitment to installing Trump's Cabinet, and not ruling out the appointments Trump is seeking.",
      "\"One thing is clear: We must act quickly and decisively to get the president's cabinet and other nominees in place as soon as possible to start delivering on the mandate we've been sent to execute, and all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments,\" Thune said in a statement. \"We cannot let Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats block the will of the American people.\"",
      "Cornyn meanwhile discussed the use of recess appointments with Trump prior to his post, per a source familiar. In a post on X Sunday afternoon, Cornyn affirmed his support, noting that if he is elected leader, he will keep the Senate in session continuously until nominees are confirmed.",
      "\"It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump's cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent. Additionally, the Constitution expressly confers the power on the President to make recess appointments,\" Cornyn wrote.",
      "Almost immediately after Trump posted on Sunday, Scott posted on X that he was in lockstep with Trump on this policy.",
      "\"100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible,\" Scott wrote, reposting Trump's post.",
      "A small handful of senators have come out publicly to endorse their chosen candidate.",
      "Scott, for his part, has picked up endorsements from some of Trump's most out-and-proud supporters in the Senate as well as a number of Trump-aligned outside voices, including Robert F. Kennedy and Elon Musk.",
      "But this critical race has a very small constituency: only Republican senators serving in the incoming Senate get a vote. ABC News has not yet reported a projection in the Pennsylvania Senate race, but that means only about 52 people will get to cast ballots.",
      "Senators are also shielded behind closed doors and by secret ballot in this race. In order to win the election, a candidate must amass a simple majority of the vote. If all candidates fail to get a simple majority, the lowest vote earner is eliminated from the process, and senators vote again.",
      "Because of the secret nature of the vote, it's unclear how much of an influence any outside factor, including Trump, will ultimately wield.",
      "Newly elected incoming senators including Bernie Moreno of Ohio, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana and John Curtis of Utah and Tim Sheehy of Montana will all be in attendance to cast votes.",
      "Sen. JD Vance, who is now the vice president-elect, is also eligible to cast a vote in the election if he so chooses, but his team has not yet said whether he ultimately will attend Wednesday's vote.",
      "In addition to the closely-watched race for party leader, a number of other positions will also be selected during Wednesday's vote. Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, is running unopposed to becoming the No. 2 Senate Republican. Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, and Sen. Tom Cotton, the Republican from Arkansas, are in a race to become the conference chair. Additional down-ballot races will also be voted on Wednesday.",

    "summary": "Before he comes back for good on Inauguration Day, Donald Trump will return to the White House briefly at the invitation of President Joe Biden",
    "story": [
      "Before he comes back for good on Inauguration Day, Donald Trump will return to the White House briefly at the invitation of President Joe Biden",
      "WASHINGTON -- Before he comes back for good on Inauguration Day, Donald Trump will return to the White House briefly at the invitation of Democratic President Joe Biden, who had hoped to defeat his Republican predecessor a second time and reside there for four more years.",
      "That may make for an awkward encounter, especially given that, after Biden ousted Trump in 2020, Trump offered no such White House invitation to Biden. Trump even left Washington before the Jan. 20, 2021, inauguration, becoming the first president to do so since Andrew Johnson skipped the 1869 swearing-in of Ulysses S. Grant.",
      "Biden also has the unusual distinction of having beaten Trump in one cycle and run against him for about 15 months during this year\u2019s campaign. As he sought reelection, Biden constantly decried Trump as a threat to democracy and the nation\u2019s core values before leaving the race in July and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, who took on her own campaign and lost on Election Day.",
      "When the two meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday, it\u2019ll technically be the first time since 1992 that an outgoing president sits down with an incoming one he competed against in a campaign. Back then, Republican President George H.W. Bush met with Democrat and President-elect Bill Clinton about two weeks after they squared off on Election Day.",
      "Bush and Clinton talked policy before going together to the Roosevelt Room to meet with their transition staff. Clinton later called the meeting \u201cterrific\u201d and said Bush was \u201cvery helpful.\u201d",
      "Over the decades, such handoff meetings between outgoing presidents and their replacements have been by turns friendly, tense and somewhere in between.",
      "This time, Biden has vowed to ensure a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working with Trump, who is both his presidential predecessor and successor, to bring the country together. Biden\u2019s White House invitation to Trump includes his wife, the former and now incoming first lady, Melania Trump.",
      "\u201cI assured him that I\u2019d direct my entire administration to work with his team,\u201d Biden said of the call with Trump when he made the invitation. The president-elect \u201clooks forward to the meeting,\" spokesman Steven Cheung said.",
      "Jim Bendat, a historian and author of \u201cDemocracy\u2019s Big Day: The Inauguration of Our President,\u201d called face-to-face chats between outgoing and incoming presidents \u201chealthy for democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see that the Democrats have chosen to take the high road and returned to the traditions that really do make America great,\u201d Bendat said.",
      "This year's meeting won't be uncharted territory for Trump.",
      "He and then-Democratic President Barack Obama held a longer-than-scheduled 90-minute Oval Office discussion days after the 2016 election. White House chief of staff Denis McDonough also showed Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner around the West Wing.",
      "\u201cWe now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed. Because, if you succeed, then the country succeeds,\u201d Obama told Trump, despite the president-elect being fresh off a victory that dented the outgoing president\u2019s legacy.",
      "Trump appeared nervous and was unusually subdued, calling Obama \u201ca good man\u201d and the meeting \u201ca great honor.\u201d He said he had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for Obama and that they \u201cdiscussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties.\u201d",
      "\u201cI very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel,\u201d Trump said. Obama White House press secretary Josh Earnest described the meeting as \u201cat least a little less awkward than some might have expected,\u201d and he noted that the two \u201cdid not relitigate their differences in the Oval Office.\u201d",
      "In fact, that encounter went smoothly enough to reassure a few Trump critics that he might grow into the job and become more presidential in temperament and action \u2014 an assessment quickly subsumed by Trump\u2019s unique relish of bombast and political conflict once his administration began, particularly when it came to his predecessor.",
      "Only about four months later, Trump accused Obama \u2013 without evidence \u2013 of having his \u201cwires tapped\u201d in Trump Tower before the 2016 election. On social media, he blasted the former president for engaging in \u201cMcCarthyism\u201d and decrying it as \u201cNixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\u201d",
      "Obama aides now say that while the 2016 Trump-Obama meeting went well publicly, the incoming president's team ignored most of the transition process and did not have the same reverence for the White House and federal institutions that they or Republican President George W. Bush\u2019s team had.",
      "One recalled that the only question Trump counterparts asked at the time was not about the coming workload or responsibilities, but how best to find an apartment in Washington.",
      "The official transition process does not mandate that presidents invite their successors to face-to-face meetings, though it can feel that way.",
      "\u201cThe psychological transfer occurs then,\" former Vice President Walter Mondale once said.",
      "There's no record of George Washington scheduling a formal meeting with the nation's second president, John Adams, before leaving the then-capital city of New York. And Adams, after moving into the White House during his term, never invited his political rival and successor, Thomas Jefferson, over before leaving without attending Jefferson's inauguration in 1801.",
      "Still, by 1841, President Martin Van Buren hosted President-elect William Henry Harrison \u2014 who had soundly beaten him on Election Day \u2014 for dinner at the White House. He even later offered to leave the official residence early to make room for his successor after Washington's National Hotel, where Harrison had been staying, became overcrowded. Harrison instead made a brief, preinaugural trip to Virginia.",
      "More recently, Republican George W. Bush welcomed Obama to the White House in 2008 after calling the election of the nation's first Black president a \u201ctriumph of the American story.\u201d",
      "And eight years prior, Bush himself was the newcomer when he met with the outgoing Clinton, who had denied his father a second term. Their chat came just eight days after the Supreme Court resolved the disputed 2000 election, and Bush also later headed to the vice presidential residence to briefly talk with the man he defeated, Al Gore.",
      "Bush and Gore didn't say what they discussed, though vice presidential press aide Jim Kennedy described the conversation as meant to \u2033demonstrate that this is a country where we put aside our differences after a long and difficult campaign.\u2033",
      "Trump and Harris spoke by phone this past week but don't have a face-to-face meeting planned.",

      "\"The 13 states that currently ban abortion -- there are real consequences to that including death. Women are dying from these abortion bans,\" Baden said.",
      "Trump may have persuaded voters that there won't be a federal abortion ban, but experts warn nationwide access could be at risk.",
      "\"I don't think that people know that a federal abortion ban would preempt state constitutional protection. There could also be this sense that, 'I'm voting yes on this amendment, and that means my state is fine,'\" Elisabeth Smith, the director of state policy at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told ABC News.",
      "\"A federal abortion ban -- if the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it to take effect -- would preempt the policy of a state where abortion is legal and accessible,\" Smith said. \"We don't yet know which party controls the House [of Representatives], but that is a possibility.\"",
      "The regulation of federal agencies could also impact access to abortion care. Medication abortion could come under fire if the Food and Drug Administration -- under a Trump presidency -- limits access to mifepristone, one of the pills used in the regimen to terminate pregnancy, or rolls back its approval, as anti-abortion groups have tried to do.",
      "The Trump administration could also attempt to misuse the Comstock Act to try to prevent access to medication abortion, Smith warned.",
      "The 150-year-old law is an anti-obscenity law \"makes it a crime to mail anything that\u2019s 'indecent, filthy, or vile' or 'intended for producing abortion,'\" according to\u00a0the ACLU.",

      "But, there is not currently a single brick-and-mortar abortion clinic in Missouri which means that even when the law is repealed, it would still take time for access to care to resume, according to Baden.",
      "\"So, we'll continue to see people having to leave the state for clinician-provided abortion care or to find another way to get care in the meantime,\" Baden said.",
      "The legal proceeding to overturn the state's ban under the new constitutional amendment could also take months to years, according to Baden.",
      "The battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada were also among 10 states with abortion on the ballot Tuesday. Some strategists hypothesized that this would boost turnout among the majority of voters who support legal abortion, aiding Democratic candidates in the process.",
      "But, exit polling showed that some supporters of abortion still elected Trump in battleground states.",
      "Advocates warn that while ballot initiatives have proved effective, they are not a universal solution.",
      "\"They are just one tool in the toolbox. They are clearly not our silver bullet, both, because structurally they can't be. Not every state even allows for ballot measures like that, they're expensive and they also are not an immediate solution ... a series of litigation has to happen,\"",
      "Advocates for abortion-care-related protections said they will continue to work to restore and protect access to abortion care under the incoming administration.",

      "\u201cIronic isn\u2019t it? The man in charge of enforcing laws can now just break them,\u201d Sotomayor claimed in her dramatic dissent in the case Trump v. U.S. in July.",
      "Republican control of Congress would give Trump significant leeway to advance his priorities and undertake a sweeping overhaul of American government and society.",
      "A six-justice conservative majority on the Supreme Court will potentially provide legal cover, and its decision in June to enshrine presumptive immunity for official presidential acts could well embolden Trump in ways he hadn\u2019t been before.",
      "But Trump\u2019s agenda and his personal impulses won\u2019t proceed entirely unchecked.",
      "Trump\u2019s appointments to lead executive agencies will require Senate confirmation and are not guaranteed. During his first term, several picks had to withdraw from consideration after stiff opposition from within his own party.",
      "Presidential executive orders and Trump agency regulations will have to comply with the Administrative Procedures Act, an arcane 1946 law requiring a \u201cnotice and comment period\u201d for policy changes and proof that public input was considered.",
      "\u201cWe will use all the tools at our disposal -- including aggressive litigation -- to ensure that key consumer and other regulatory protections remain intact,\u201d said Robert Weissman and Lisa Gilbert, co-presidents of Public Citizen, a progressive advocacy group that has sued Trump in the past.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, more than 246 agency regulations, guidance documents and memoranda were challenged in federal courts. The administration won 54 of the cases, a 22% success rate, according to data from the Institute for Policy Integrity at the NYU School of Law.",
      "In 192 cases, a court either ruled against the Trump agency or the agency withdrew the controversial action after being sued. Many of those losses involved a violation of the APA.",
      "The Supreme Court notably struck down Trump\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; blocked the White House effort to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census; and invalidated the initial Trump travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think people paid enough attention to the fact that Trump heeded the Court and agreed to rewrite the \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 three times so that it would pass constitutional muster,\u201d said Sarah Isgur, a former Trump Justice Department official and an ABC News legal contributor.",

      "\u201cLet there be no mistake, we intend to stand with states across our nation to defend our Constitution and uphold the rule of law,\u201d said Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, which filed more than 100 lawsuits against the first Trump administration.",

      "The expected onslaught of litigation will collide with a federal judicial system packed full of judges that Trump appointed -- more than 200 nominees in four years surpassing the total elevated by then-President Barack Obama in eight years.",
      "Trump appointed three justices to the Supreme Court bench -- justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett -- and may get a historic opportunity to nominate even more should a current justice retire or die. Such a development would consolidate conservative power on the Supreme Court for generations.",
      "\u201cWill the Supreme Court act as a meaningful check on a second Trump presidency? During the first Trump administration they were a real check,\u201d said University of Pennsylvania Law Professor Kate Shaw, an ABC News legal contributor. \u201cThat, however, was a different court. Trump has now transformed the Supreme Court, and this court is not one that is likely to act as a comparable check.\u201d",

      "\"I know it feels like the divided states of America over the last several years, but it is still the United States of America,\" said the influential radio host who supported Harris. \"We've got to unify in some way, shape or form.\"",
      "Charlamagne (n\u00e9 Lenard McKelvey) co-hosts the popular iHeart Radio program \"The Breakfast Club,\" which is heard by millions of monthly listeners, and is the author of the new book \"Be Honest or Die Lying.\"",

      "In an interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl on \"This Week,\" Charlamagne said he's \"optimistic\" about America regardless of Harris' loss.",

      "Following President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the race and endorse Harris in August, Charlamagne applauded the vice president's candidacy for energizing the Democratic Party.",
      "Charlamagne said there was \"no life whatsoever\" with the Biden campaign and had previously called for him to not run for reelection.",
      "\"The vice president made a lot of people sit up on the couch and pay attention and at least be curious,\" he said. \"She has nothing to be ashamed of, she ran a great campaign\"",
      "In a stark demographic shift from 2020, Trump won one in three voters of color, notably gaining among Black and Latino voters. Charlamagne attributed part of this shift as \"a backlash to race and gender and identity politics.\"",
      "Trump improved his 2016 and 2020 numbers in traditional Democratic strongholds, like New Jersey and New Mexico. Charlamagne said that \"dinner table issues\" were top of mind for voters.",
      "\"Every day people wake up and all they want to do is have more money in their pocket and they want to feel safe,\" he said. \"I don't care if you're black, white, gay, straight, whatever religion you are, those are the two things that you're thinking about every day.\"",
      "He also said that Democrats \"didn't know how to message\" their stance on immigration, including the bipartisan border bill that Trump and his allies effectively killed.",
      "\"It's not like the Democrats didn't want border security. They just didn't know how to message it right,\" Charlamagne said. \"'Build the wall' may sound elementary, but you know what that signals to people? Border security.\"",
      "When asked if Harris should have done more to separate herself from Biden, Charlamagne said, \"I think that if she wanted to go in a different direction, she should have expressed that.\"",
      "He also pointed to Harris' appearances on \"The View\" and her interview with Fox's Brett Baier, where she gave mixed answers on how she would be a different leader than the current president.",
      "Even as an outspoken critic of Trump, Charlamagne said he's choosing to have a positive outlook on the next four years.",
      "\"We just got to hope for the best,\" said Charlamagne. \"Like, I'm not wishing for America to fail. Why would I want that?\"",

      "Speaking to \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl, Ramaswamy urged Democrats to give Trump a chance in office and called on them to resist efforts to cast him as a threat to democracy.",
      "\"What you're hearing from Donald Trump is he is going to be a president for all Americans. He is a guy who, in that first term, he had crowds chanting 'lock her up' for Hillary Clinton. He didn't prosecute her. I think Donald Trump is focused on what makes people's lives better. And actually, my message to Democrats out there, even those who didn't vote for Donald Trump, is to give him a chance to actually make your life better,\" Ramaswamy said.",
      "\"I think it's time to turn the page on a lot of these histrionics, or Hitler comparisons,\" he added, before later saying that \"success is unifying. Nothing's going to unite this country more than economic growth.\"",
      "Ramaswamy ran against the former and now president-elect in the 2024 GOP primary as a culture warrior in Trump's image, though he ended his campaign the night of the Iowa caucuses and endorsed the former president.",
      "On Sunday, he also defended Trump's vow for a mass deportation force, predicting that the tougher enforcement measures will also lead to undocumented immigrants leaving the country on their own.",
      "\"Donald Trump's campaign promise was the largest mass deportation in American history, and he's going to keep that promise,\" Ramaswamy said. \"Not an iota, not a cent of government spending should go to subsidize this, not to sanctuary cities, not to federal aid to people who are in this country illegally, and we're going to see a large number, by the millions, of self-deportations as well.\"",
      "Pressed by Karl on the fate of the so-called \"Dreamers\" -- people who were brought to the United States as children without valid documentation -- Ramaswamy declined to explicitly say how the incoming administration would approach this group of undocumented immigrants, which includes many adults who have spent most of their life in the U.S. During his first term, the Trump administration attempted to rescind the Obama-era program that allowed such migrants to stay and work in the country.",
      "\"I say this as the kid of legal immigrants to this country, as the proud child of legal immigrants to the United States of America. If your first act of entering this country broke the law, that doesn't allow you to remain in this country,\" Ramaswamy said. \"One is, no migration without consent. Think about your nation like a body. Number two is that consent should only be granted, and should be granted to migrants who benefit the United States of America. But those who enter without consent must be removed.\"",
      "As a vocal Trump ally, Ramaswamy is thought of as a potential future member of the Trump administration, though he did not specify what role would interest him.",
      "\"There's a couple great options on the table. I want to have the biggest possible impact on this country. We're not going to sort that out in the press\u2026 we're having some high-impact discussions.\"",

    "story": [
      "Before he comes back for good on Inauguration Day, Donald Trump will return to the White House briefly at the invitation of President Joe Biden",
      "WASHINGTON -- Before he comes back for good on Inauguration Day, Donald Trump will return to the White House briefly at the invitation of Democratic President Joe Biden, who had hoped to defeat his Republican predecessor a second time and reside there for four more years.",
      "That may make for an awkward encounter, especially given that, after Biden ousted Trump in 2020, Trump offered no such White House invitation to Biden. Trump even left Washington before the Jan. 20, 2021, inauguration, becoming the first president to do so since Andrew Johnson skipped the 1869 swearing-in of Ulysses S. Grant.",
      "Biden also has the unusual distinction of having beaten Trump in one cycle and run against him for about 15 months during this year\u2019s campaign. As he sought reelection, Biden constantly decried Trump as a threat to democracy and the nation\u2019s core values before leaving the race in July and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, who took on her own campaign and lost on Election Day.",
      "When the two meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday, it\u2019ll technically be the first time since 1992 that an outgoing president sits down with an incoming one he competed against in a campaign. Back then, Republican President George H.W. Bush met with Democrat and President-elect Bill Clinton about two weeks after they squared off on Election Day.",
      "Bush and Clinton talked policy before going together to the Roosevelt Room to meet with their transition staff. Clinton later called the meeting \u201cterrific\u201d and said Bush was \u201cvery helpful.\u201d",
      "Over the decades, such handoff meetings between outgoing presidents and their replacements have been by turns friendly, tense and somewhere in between.",
      "This time, Biden has vowed to ensure a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working with Trump, who is both his presidential predecessor and successor, to bring the country together. Biden\u2019s White House invitation to Trump includes his wife, the former and now incoming first lady, Melania Trump.",
      "\u201cI assured him that I\u2019d direct my entire administration to work with his team,\u201d Biden said of the call with Trump when he made the invitation. The president-elect \u201clooks forward to the meeting,\" spokesman Steven Cheung said.",
      "Jim Bendat, a historian and author of \u201cDemocracy\u2019s Big Day: The Inauguration of Our President,\u201d called face-to-face chats between outgoing and incoming presidents \u201chealthy for democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see that the Democrats have chosen to take the high road and returned to the traditions that really do make America great,\u201d Bendat said.",
      "This year's meeting won't be uncharted territory for Trump.",
      "He and then-Democratic President Barack Obama held a longer-than-scheduled 90-minute Oval Office discussion days after the 2016 election. White House chief of staff Denis McDonough also showed Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner around the West Wing.",
      "\u201cWe now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed. Because, if you succeed, then the country succeeds,\u201d Obama told Trump, despite the president-elect being fresh off a victory that dented the outgoing president\u2019s legacy.",
      "Trump appeared nervous and was unusually subdued, calling Obama \u201ca good man\u201d and the meeting \u201ca great honor.\u201d He said he had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for Obama and that they \u201cdiscussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties.\u201d",
      "\u201cI very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel,\u201d Trump said. Obama White House press secretary Josh Earnest described the meeting as \u201cat least a little less awkward than some might have expected,\u201d and he noted that the two \u201cdid not relitigate their differences in the Oval Office.\u201d",
      "In fact, that encounter went smoothly enough to reassure a few Trump critics that he might grow into the job and become more presidential in temperament and action \u2014 an assessment quickly subsumed by Trump\u2019s unique relish of bombast and political conflict once his administration began, particularly when it came to his predecessor.",
      "Only about four months later, Trump accused Obama \u2013 without evidence \u2013 of having his \u201cwires tapped\u201d in Trump Tower before the 2016 election. On social media, he blasted the former president for engaging in \u201cMcCarthyism\u201d and decrying it as \u201cNixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\u201d",
      "Obama aides now say that while the 2016 Trump-Obama meeting went well publicly, the incoming president's team ignored most of the transition process and did not have the same reverence for the White House and federal institutions that they or Republican President George W. Bush\u2019s team had.",
      "One recalled that the only question Trump counterparts asked at the time was not about the coming workload or responsibilities, but how best to find an apartment in Washington.",
      "The official transition process does not mandate that presidents invite their successors to face-to-face meetings, though it can feel that way.",
      "\u201cThe psychological transfer occurs then,\" former Vice President Walter Mondale once said.",
      "There's no record of George Washington scheduling a formal meeting with the nation's second president, John Adams, before leaving the then-capital city of New York. And Adams, after moving into the White House during his term, never invited his political rival and successor, Thomas Jefferson, over before leaving without attending Jefferson's inauguration in 1801.",
      "Still, by 1841, President Martin Van Buren hosted President-elect William Henry Harrison \u2014 who had soundly beaten him on Election Day \u2014 for dinner at the White House. He even later offered to leave the official residence early to make room for his successor after Washington's National Hotel, where Harrison had been staying, became overcrowded. Harrison instead made a brief, preinaugural trip to Virginia.",
      "More recently, Republican George W. Bush welcomed Obama to the White House in 2008 after calling the election of the nation's first Black president a \u201ctriumph of the American story.\u201d",

      "Republican Rep. David Schweikert has won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing Arizona",
      "PHOENIX -- Republican David Schweikert has won an eighth term in an affluent congressional district in the Phoenix area by fending off a challenge from a Democratic former state lawmaker.",
      "Schweikert defeated Amish Shah, an emergency room doctor, Sunday in Arizona\u2019s 1st Congressional District that includes north Phoenix, Scottsdale, Fountain Hills and Paradise Valley.",
      "While Republicans hold a voter registration advantage in the district, it started to trend toward the center after Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory as some voters who historically backed Republicans reluctantly voted for Democrats or left their ballots blank.",
      "Redistricting ahead of the 2022 midterms accelerated the trend, fueling hopes among Democrats that Schweikert could be defeated and the district flipped. Schweikert is known for railing against government debt.",
      "\u201cCongressman Schweikert is pleased to have the support from the voters of Arizona\u2019s 1st Congressional district,\u201d said Chris Baker, a spokesperson for Schweikert, in a statement late Sunday. He said voters showed they want a representative committed to the economy, lower taxes and border security.",
      "Shah\u2019s campaign did not respond to an emailed request for comment Sunday.",
      "Schweikert has been in close races before. He won reelection in 2022 by just 3,200 votes against a relatively unknown Democrat who received minimal support from national Democrats.",
      "Schweikert\u2019s reputation has been tarnished in recent years by ethics scandals. In 2022, he received a $125,000 fine by the Federal Election Commission for misappropriating campaign funds. Two years prior, he agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and accept 11 campaign finance violations after an investigation by the U.S. House Committee on Ethics.",
      "Shah, who had emerged as the primary winner among a field of six Democrats, had campaigned on reducing the prices for housing and health care.",
      "Earlier Sunday, Democratic Rep. Greg Stanton won reelection against Republican Kelly Cooper in the 4th District, which includes the cities of Tempe, Mesa and Chandler outside of Phoenix. Stanton, a former Phoenix mayor, has served in Congress since 2019.",
      "In the 6th Congressional District, Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani remained locked in a tight race with Democrat Kirsten Engel, whom he narrowly beat two years ago. The district runs from Tucson east to New Mexico and includes a stretch of the Arizona-Mexico border.",
      "The U.S. Senate race between Republican Kari Lake, a well-known former television news anchor and staunch Trump ally, and Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, an Iraq War veteran, also hasn't been decided."

      "Authorities in South Carolina have captured a Tennessee fugitive accused of killing a man and trying to pass off the body as someone else's",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A fugitive accused of killing a man in Tennessee and trying to pass off the body as someone else's by calling 911, identifying himself as that person and saying he had fallen off a cliff while being chased by a bear has been captured in South Carolina, authorities said.",
      "In a social media post Sunday, the Columbia Police Department said Nicholas Wayne Hamlett, 45, was recognized by an employee at a hospital in the South Carolina city. Authorities confirmed his identity with a fingerprint scanner and he's in the temporary custody of the U.S. Marshals Service while awaiting extradition to Tennessee.",
      "Authorities in Monroe County, Tennessee, and elsewhere had been looking for Hamlett since last month.",
      "\u201cAfter observing Hamlett at a local hospital, a good citizen alerted the authorities and brought this manhunt to a peaceful end,\u201d Monroe County Sheriff Tommy Jones said in a social media post.",
      "The sheriff's office said last month that Hamlett called 911 on Oct. 18 claiming to have fallen off a cliff while running from a bear. Using the name Brandon Andrade, Hamlett claimed he was injured and partially in the water, authorities added.",
      "When emergency responders searched the area near a highway bridge in Tellico Plains, where the call had come from, they found the body of a man with Andrade's ID on it.",
      "However, authorities determined that the man was not Andrade, whose ID had been stolen and used multiple times. The person using Andrade's stolen identification was Hamlett, who was wanted in Alabama for a parole violation, the sheriff's office said. Andrade was alive and well, authorities confirmed.",
      "Forensics officials also determined that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head, which isn't consistent with a high fall or a bear attack, Jones said.",
      "Hamlett likely fled his Tennessee home before police could verify his real identity, authorities said. That set off a manhunt for Hamlett, who was considered armed and dangerous. The U.S. Marshals Service had been offering a reward of up to $5,000 for help finding him.",
      "On Oct. 31, law enforcement officers searched Chapin, South Carolina, with helicopters and police dogs after getting information that Hamlett was in the area, telling residents to lock their doors on Halloween night. He was spotted near a high school in the city the next day.",
      "On Nov. 4, the Tennessee sheriff's office identified the dead man as 34-year-old Steven Douglas Lloyd, of Knoxville. It said Hamlett had befriended Lloyd, then lured him into the woods to kill him and take his identity.",
      "According to the sheriff, Lloyd's family said he was diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder and would leave home and live on the streets, but remained in touch with his family.",
      "\u201cSteven loved the outdoors and was so helpful when it came to others,\u201d Jones wrote in a Nov. 4 social media post. \u201cThe family was shocked to learn that their beloved son's life had been taken by someone that Steven trusted.\""

      "Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida are running in a secret ballot election Wednesday to lead the GOP conference and replace longtime GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who is stepping aside from the job after almost two decades. All three have courted Trump's support in the race, vying to show who is the closest to the president-elect as they campaign to become majority leader.",
      "Trump has not endorsed in the race, but on Sunday he made clear that he expects the new leader to go around regular Senate order, if necessary, to allow him to fill his Cabinet quickly. In a statement on X and Truth Social, Trump said that the next leader \u201cmust agree\u201d to allow him to make appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing a confirmation vote.",
      "\u201cAny Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,\u201d Trump posted, adding that positions should be filled \u201cIMMEDIATELY!\u201d",
      "The Senate has not allowed presidents to make so-called recess appointments since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling limited the president\u2019s power to do so. Since then, the Senate has held brief \u201cpro-forma\u201d sessions when it is out of town for more than 10 days so that a president cannot take advantage of the absence and start filling posts that have not been confirmed.",
      "But with Trump\u2019s approval paramount in the race, all three candidates quickly suggested that they might be willing to reconsider the practice. Scott replied to Trump, \u201c100% agree.

      "Cornyn said that \u201cIt is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump \u2019s cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent.\u201d He noted that recess appointments are allowed under the Constitution.",

      "Trump\u2019s relationship with Congress \u2014 especially the advice and consent role afforded to the Senate when it comes to nominations \u2014 was tumultuous in his first term as he chafed at resistance to his selections and sought ways to work around lawmakers. With Trump now entering a second term emboldened by his sweeping election victory, he is already signaling that he expects Senate Republicans, and by extension, their new leader, to fall in line behind his Cabinet selections.",
      "Trump also posted on Sunday that the Senate should not approve any judges in the weeks before Republicans take power next year \u2014 a more difficult demand to fulfill as Democrats will control the floor, and hold the majority of votes, until the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3.

      "With days to go, the race for Senate Republican leader is deeply in flux.",
      "Thune and Cornyn are both well-liked, longtime senators who have served as deputies to McConnell and have been seen as the front-runners, despite past statements criticizing Trump. Scott \u2014 a longtime friend of Trump\u2019s and fierce ally \u2014 has been seen as more of a longshot, but he has mounted an aggressive campaign in recent days on social media and elsewhere with the aim of getting Trump\u2019s endorsement.",

      "All three candidates are promising that they will be more open and transparent than McConnell was and that they would give senators more power to get their priorities to the floor. They have also tried to make clear that they would have a much different relationship with Trump than McConnell, who once called the former president a \u201cdespicable human being\u201d behind closed doors.",

Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that there are \u201ca couple of great options on the table.\u201d Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Republican from Tennessee who served as U.S. ambassador to Japan between 2017 and 2019, said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that one of his greatest honors was to represent the Trump administration overseas.

      "While she is a member of the House Armed Services Committee and serves on the coveted House committee that oversees national intelligence, her pick further solidifies Trump\u2019s preference for unconditional loyalty in his second administration over career experience.",
      "One area of foreign policy that Stefanik has been vocal about is Israel.",
      "Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Stefanik has focused much of her attention on the United Nations, accusing the world body and international organizations of antisemitism for their criticism of Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza, which has resulted in the death of more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to their Health Ministry.",
      "She has gone as far as calling last month for a \u201ccomplete reassessment\u201d of U.S. funding for the United Nations, while helping push for the blocking of American support for the U.N. agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the region.",
      "Her departure for the United Nations would also mean that Republicans, who are on track to have a razor-thin majority in the House, would be down one crucial vote. But Stefanik\u2019s district is located in a deeply red part of upstate New York, where Republicans are likely guaranteed to win the special election that would take place after she leaves office.",
      "\u201cRepublicans will hold this safe Republican seat as part of a Republican majority in the House that will help deliver on President Trump\u2019s historic mandate,\u201d Ed Cox, the chair of the New York Republican party, said in a statement Monday.",
      "Trump did not say much about the U.N. during his campaign, but has generally advocated for a less interventionist foreign policy. He also has repeatedly questioned the utility of international alliances, including NATO, and he has threatened allies with higher tariffs and said he will not protect them unless they contribute more to their own defense.",
      "Trump also has talked about how he initially wanted to select his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, for the role after he was elected the first time.",
      "\u201c'You would be a great ambassador to the United Nations, United Nations secretary.' There\u2019d be nobody to compete with her, I tell you,\u201d he said at a Moms for Liberty Summit in August. \u201cShe may be my daughter, but nobody could have competed with her.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Most U.S. stocks are rising Monday and adding to the gains made during their best week of the year.",
      "The S&P 500 was up 0.1% in afternoon trading, and two out of every three stocks in the index were climbing. It's coming off a 4.7% spurt last week spurred by Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory and a cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve to bolster the economy.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 322 points, or 0.7%, as of 1:59 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.1% lower.",
      "Tesla was the strongest force pushing the S&P 500 higher after rising 8.1%. Its leader, Elon Musk, has become a close ally of Trump\u2019s, and its stock jumped nearly 15% the day after the election and has kept rising.",
      "Several pieces of what\u2019s known as the \u201cTrump trade\u201d also helped drive the market, as investors try to identify which kinds of companies will be winners under a second Trump term. JPMorgan Chase rose 1.2%, and bank stocks broadly continue to benefit from expectations for stronger economic growth, less regulation from Washington and an increase in mergers and acquisitions.",
      "A White House more friendly to big tie-ups has helped Wall Street speculate about a merger between insurers Cigna Group and Humana, for example. It\u2019s been so feverish that Cigna said Monday it isn\u2019t pursuing a deal with Humana. Cigna\u2019s stock rose 7.7%, and Humana\u2019s sank 2%.",
      "Stocks of companies more focused on the U.S. economy were also rising more than the rest of the market, including a 1.5% rally for the smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index, because they\u2019re seen as benefiting more from Trump\u2019s America First policies than big multinational companies.",
      "Companies are also continuing to deliver earnings reports showing they made more in profit during the summer than analysts expected. Aramark gained 0.8% after it reported broad-based growth during the latest quarter, including for food at stadiums and among customers around the world.",
      "They helped offset a drop of 1.9% for Nvidia, which was the heaviest weight on the market and helped drag the Nasdaq composite in particular.",
      "AbbVie tumbled 12% after saying trials investigating its treatment for some adults with schizophrenia failed to show statistically significant improvement compared with a placebo group at week six.",
      "Some of the sharpest swings were in the crypto market, where bitcoin rose above $86,000 for the first time. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies generally and pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world. Bitcoin hit a record of $86,375, according to CoinDesk.",
      "Another Trump trade has been a rise in Treasury yields, as traders anticipate potentially higher economic growth, U.S. government debt and inflation because of Trump\u2019s policies. But trading in the bond market is closed Monday in observance of Veterans Day.",
      "Treasury yields been generally climbing since September, in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it\u2019s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.",
      "But Trump\u2019s win has scrambled expectations for coming cuts to rates. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many the Fed will deliver next year. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel.",
      "Stock markets abroad have swung following Trump\u2019s election amid worries about increased tariffs and disruptions to global trade.",

Wiles is said to have earned Trump's trust in part by guiding what was the most disciplined of Trump's three presidential campaigns.",
      "Wiles was able to help keep Trump on track as few others have, not by criticizing his impulses, but by winning his respect by demonstrating his success after taking her advice.",
      "Homan, 62, has been tasked with Trump\u2019s top priority of carrying out the largest deportation operation in the nation\u2019s history.",
      "Homan, who served under Trump in his first administration leading U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was widely expected to be offered a position related to the border, an issue Trump made central to his campaign.",
      "Though Homan has insisted such a massive undertaking would be humane, he has long been a loyal supporter of Trump's policy proposals, suggesting at a July conference in Washington that he would be willing to \"run the biggest deportation operation this country\u2019s ever seen.\u201d",
      "Democrats have criticized Homan for his defending Trump's \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy on border crossings during his first administration, which led to the separation of thousands of parents and children seeking asylum at the border.",
      "Stefanik is a representative from New York and one of Trump's staunchest defenders going back to his first impeachment.",
      "Elected to the House in 2014, Stefanik was selected by her GOP House colleagues as House Republican Conference chair in 2021, when former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was removed from the post after publicly criticizing Trump for falsely claiming he won the 2020 election. Stefanik, 40, has served in that role ever since as the third-ranking member of House leadership.",
      "Stefanik\u2019s questioning of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses helped lead to two of those presidents resigning, further raising her national profile.",
      "If confirmed, she would represent American interests at the U.N. as Trump vows to end the war waged by Russia against Ukraine begun in 2022. He has also called for peace as Israel continues its offensive against Hamas in Gaza and its invasion of Lebanon to target Hezbollah.",
      "Miller, an immigration hardliner, was a vocal spokesperson during the presidential campaign for Trump's priority of mass deportations. The 39-year-old was a senior adviser during Trump's first administration.",
      "Miller has been a central figure in some of Trump's policy decisions, notably his move to separate thousands of immigrant families.",
      "Trump argued throughout the campaign that the nation's economic, national security and social priorities could be met by deporting people who are in the United States illegally. Since Trump left office in 2021, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal, an organization made up of former Trump advisers aimed at challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as free speech and national security."

      "DELPHI, Ind. -- A former drugstore worker in the small Indiana town of Delphi was found guilty of murder on Monday in the 2017 killings of two teenage girls who vanished during an afternoon hike.",
      "Jurors convicted Richard Allen of of two counts of murder and two additional counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping in the killings of 13-year-old Abigail Williams and 14-year-old Liberty German.",
      "Reporters inside the courtroom said Allen, 52, showed no reaction as the verdict was delivered, but looked back at his family at one point. Allen is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 20. He could face up to 130 years in prison.",
      "The 12 jurors along with alternates were sequestered throughout the trial, which began Oct. 18 in the girls\u2019 hometown of Delphi, a small northwest Indiana city where Allen also lived and worked.",
      "The seven women and five men began deliberations Thursday afternoon after hearing closing arguments in the weekslong murder trial.",
      "A special judge oversaw the case. Superior Court Judge Fran Gull, along with the jurors, came from northeastern Indiana\u2019s Allen County.",
      "Reports that the jury had reached a verdict began to spread and drew a crowd outside the courthouse. Minutes later, a handful of people spilled outside and people on the sidewalk began to cheer.",
      "The case has drawn outsized attention from true-crime enthusiasts, with repeated delays, a leak of evidence, the withdrawal of Allen\u2019s public defenders and their reinstatement by the Indiana Supreme Court. It has also been the subject of a gag order.",
      "Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas McLeland told jurors in his closing arguments that Allen is the man seen following the teens in a grainy cellphone video recorded by one of the girls, known as Abby and Libby, as they crossed an abandoned railroad trestle called the Monon High Bridge.",
      "\u201cRichard Allen is Bridge Guy,\u201d McLeland told jurors. \u201cHe kidnapped them and later murdered them.\u201d",
      "McLeland also said it was Allen\u2019s voice that was captured on German\u2019s cellphone video telling the teens, \u201c Down the hill \u2033 after they had crossed the bridge just before vanishing on Feb. 13, 2017. Their bodies were found the next day, their throats cut, in a wooded area about a quarter-mile (less than half a kilometer) from that bridge.",
      "An investigator testified during trial that Allen told him and another officer that on the day the teens vanished he was wearing a blue or black Carhartt jacket, jeans and a beanie \u2014 clothing that\u2019s similar to the person seen in German\u2019s cellphone video.",
      "McLeland recapped evidence in his closing that an unspent bullet found between the teens\u2019 bodies \u201chad been cycled through\u201d Allen\u2019s .40-caliber Sig Sauer handgun. An Indiana State Police firearms expert told the jury her analysis tied the round to Allen\u2019s handgun.",
      "But a firearms expert called by the defense questioned the state police bullet analysis, and attorney Bradley Rozzi dismissed it in his closing arguments as a \u201cmagic bullet,\u201d saying investigators had made an \u201capples to oranges\u201d comparison of the unspent round to one fired from Allen\u2019s gun.",
      "Allen was arrested in October 2022. He became a suspect after a retired state government worker who had volunteered to help police with the investigation found paperwork in September 2022 showing that Allen had contacted authorities two days after German and Williams\u2019 bodies were found. That paperwork indicated that Allen had told an officer he had been on the hiking trail the afternoon the girls went missing, according to testimony.",
      "McLeland noted in his closing that Allen had repeatedly confessed to the killings \u2014 in person, on the phone and in writing. In one of the recordings he replayed for the jury, Allen could be heard telling his wife, \u201cI did it. I killed Abby and Libby.\u201d",
      "Allen\u2019s defense argued that Allen\u2019s confessions are unreliable because he was facing a severe mental health crisis while under the pressure and stress of being locked up in isolation, watched 24 hours a day and taunted by people incarcerated with him. The defense called witnesses, including a psychiatrist who testified that months in solitary confinement could cause a person to become delirious and psychotic.",
      "Prosecutors said Allen\u2019s incriminating statements contained information only the killer could have known. McLeland pointed to notes written by Allen\u2019s psychologist at the Westville Correctional Facility that Allen told her during one of their sessions that he had planned to rape the teens but did not do so after he saw a van traveling nearby.",
      "A state trooper testified that Allen\u2019s van remark corroborated a statement by a man whose driveway passes under the Monon High Bridge and who said he was driving home from work in his van around that time.",
      "That van, McLeland told jurors in his closing, was a detail \u201conly the killer would know.\u201d",
      "Allen\u2019s prison psychologist, Dr. Monica Wala, testified that he began confessing to killing the girls in early 2023 during his sessions with her. She said he provided details of the crime in some of the confessions, including telling her he slashed the girls\u2019 throats and put tree branches over their bodies.",
      "During cross-examination, Wala acknowledged that she had followed Allen\u2019s case with interest during her personal time even while she was treating him and that she was a fan of the true-crime genre.",
      "Rozzi said in his closing arguments that Allen is innocent. He said no witness explicitly identified Allen as the man seen on the hiking trail or the bridge the afternoon the girls went missing. And he said no fingerprint, DNA or forensic evidence links Allen to the murder scene.",
      "And for more than five years after the teens were killed, Allen still lived in Delphi while working at a local pharmacy.",

      "\u201cToday, we celebrate a soldier and a person who earned the title of veteran,\" Moore said. \"Today we celebrate one of the greatest authors of the American story.\u201d",
      "Tubman escaped slavery herself in 1849, settling in Philadelphia in 1849. Intent on helping others achieve freedom, she established the Underground Railroad network and led other enslaved Black women and men to freedom. She then channeled those experiences as a scout, spy and nurse for the Union Army during the Civil War, helping guide 150 Black soldiers on a gunboat raid in South Carolina.",
      "Nobody would have judged Tubman had she chosen to remain in Philadelphia and coordinate abolitionist efforts from there, Moore said.",
      "\u201cShe knew that in order to do the work, that meant that she had to go into the lion\u2019s den,\u201d Moore siad. \u201cShe knew that leadership means you have to be willing to do what you are asking others to do.\u201d",
      "The reading of the official order was followed by a symbolic pinning ceremony with Tubman's great-great-great-grandniece, Tina Wyatt.",
      "Wyatt hailed her aunt's legacy of tenacity, generosity and faith and agreed Veterans Day applied to her as much as any other servicemember.",

      "Tubman's status as an icon of history has only been further elevated within the last few years. The city of Philadelphia chose a Black artist to make a 14-foot (4.3-meter) bronze statue to go on display next year. In 2022, a Chicago elementary school was renamed for Tubman, replacing the previous namesake, who had racist views. However, plans to put Tubman on the $20 bill have continued to stall."

      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary is still up in the air, but it\u2019s a sure bet he will look to reshape the Pentagon and pick a loyalist following his tumultuous first term",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's choice for defense secretary is still up in the air, but it is a sure bet he will look to reshape the Pentagon and pick a loyalist following his tumultuous first term. Five men held the job as Pentagon chief only to resign, be fired or serve briefly as a stopgap.",
      "While he has yet to announce a decision, the names of potential Pentagon chiefs stretch from the well known \u2014 such as Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida \u2014 to an array of former administration loyalists, including retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who held national security posts during Trump's first term.",
      "Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been floated, but Trump said on social media Saturday that Pompeo would not be joining the new administration.",
      "Some decisions may linger for days as candidates jostle for attention and officials wait for the final results from House races, weighing whether Republican lawmakers can be tapped or if others are a safer pick to avoid a new election for an empty congressional seat.",
      "\u201cThe choice is going to tell us a lot about how he will deal with the Pentagon,\u201d said Mark Cancian, senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a retired Marine colonel.",
      "He said someone like Waltz \u2014 a former Army officer and Green Beret \u2014 with a deep military background may not be as dramatic of a change as others who may be viewed as stronger Trump loyalists.",
      "With a number of top jobs at the State Department, National Security Council and Defense Department up for grabs, Trump is expected to lean toward those who back his desire to end U.S. involvement in any wars, use the military to control the U.S.-Mexico border and take a hard line on Iran.",
      "The key test, however, will be loyalty and a willingness to do whatever Trump wants, as he seeks to avoid the pushback he got from the Pentagon the first time around.",
      "Trump's relationship with his civilian and military leaders during those years was fraught with tension, confusion and frustration, as they struggled to temper or even simply interpret presidential tweets and pronouncements that blindsided them with abrupt policy decisions they weren't prepared to explain or defend.",
      "Time after time, senior Pentagon officials \u2014 both in and out of uniform \u2014 worked to dissuade, delay or derail Trump, on issues ranging from his early demand to prohibit transgender troops from serving in the military and his announcements that he was pulling troops out of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan to his push to use troops to police the border and stem civil unrest on the streets of Washington.",
      "In his first administration, Trump hewed toward what he considered strong military men and defense industry executives. Initially enamored with generals, Trump over time found them to be not loyal enough.",
      "\u201cHe soured on them,\u201d Cancian said. \u201cThey were not as pliable as he had thought. ... I\u2019ve heard people speculate that maybe the chairman would be fired. So that\u2019s something to watch.\u201d",
      "Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, took over as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 2023 for a four-year term, but military leaders serve at the pleasure of the president. Brown, a combat pilot and just the second Black officer to serve as chairman, spoke out after the police killing of George Floyd, describing the bias he faced in his life and career.",
      "Trump also is expected to choose someone as defense secretary with disdain for equity and diversity programs and less likely to counter his plans based on limits laid out in the Constitution and rule of law. But he also may well push for increased defense spending, at least initially, including on U.S. missile defense.",
      "A key overriding concern is that Trump will select someone who won't push back against potentially unlawful or dangerous orders or protect the military's longstanding apolitical status.",
      "On Thursday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin raised that red flag. In a message to the force, he said the U.S. military stands ready to \u201cobey all lawful orders from its civilian chain of command,\u201d adding that troops swear an oath to \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d",
      "He echoed retired Army Gen. Mark Milley's pronouncement during a speech as he closed out four years as chairman of the Joint Chiefs.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t take an oath to a king or a queen or to a tyrant or a dictator. And we don\u2019t take an oath to a wannabe dictator,\u201d Milley said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take an oath to an individual. We take an oath to the Constitution, and we take an oath to the idea that is America, and we\u2019re willing to die to protect it.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s first defense chief, retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, learned quickly to stay off his boss\u2019 radar by largely eliminating press conferences that Trump could see.",
      "Mattis and Milley, along with Trump's chief of staff John Kelly, a retired Marine general, and retired Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, who also served as Joint Chiefs chairman, all worked quietly behind the scenes to temper some of Trump's decisions.",
      "They stalled his demands that troops be quickly and completely withdrawn from Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and managed to prevent the use of active-duty troops to quell civil unrest in Washington.",
      "Two years in, Mattis abruptly resigned in December 2018 in frustration over Trump\u2019s national security policies, including a perceived disdain for allies and his demands to pull all troops out of Syria. Patrick Shanahan, the deputy defense secretary, took over as acting Pentagon chief but withdrew as the nominee six months later due to personal family problems that were made public.",
      "Then-Army Secretary Mark Esper took over in an acting role, but he had to step aside briefly when nominated, so Navy Secretary Richard Spencer served as the acting chief until Esper was confirmed.",
      "Esper was fired days after Trump lost the 2020 election, largely because the president did not believe him to be loyal enough. Trump was especially angry over Esper\u2019s public opposition to invoking the two-centuries-old Insurrection Act to deploy active-duty troops in the District of Columbia during unrest following the police killing of George Floyd.",
      "Trump named Christopher Miller, a retired Army officer who has been director of the National Counterterrorism Center, to serve as acting secretary and surrounded him with staunch loyalists.",
      "That is the Pentagon that officials quietly say they expect to see in Trump's new administration."

      "It's a short but important to-do list as Congress returns to Washington this week to begin what is known as a lame-duck session \u2014 that period between Election Day and the end of the two-year congressional term.",
      "Republicans are anxious to turn the page and move on to next year when they'll have control of the White House and possibly both chambers of Congress, while Democrats hope to get in as many of their priorities as they can while they still have the majority in the Senate.",
      "Here's a look at where things stand going into the final weeks of the tumultuous 118th Congress:",
      "Just before lawmakers left Washington in September, they passed a short-term extension of government funding to avoid a shutdown before the election. They still need to pass full-year spending bills for the current fiscal year, or at least another extension, by Dec. 20.",
      "A Republican aide in the House and another in the Senate not authorized to speak publicly about internal planning said it is likely that Congress will pass another short-term extension into early next year rather than complete work on the bills.",
      "That's because the two sides still have major differences on spending levels and policy priorities. Also, Republicans have less incentive to negotiate now because they will have control of the White House, Senate and possibly the House come January.",
      "Much will depend upon whether government funding is a fight President-elect Donald Trump really wants to take on in his first few weeks as president or whether he'd prefer to focus on other priorities.",
      "Under terms of a previous deal that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy reached with the Biden administration, spending for defense and nondefense programs would rise 1% this fiscal year.",
      "The Senate has been charting a course to go above that level, while House Republicans have been voting for steep cuts to many non-defense programs, and they have attached policy mandates to the spending bills that Democrats overwhelmingly oppose. So a final agreement will be difficult to reach this Congress.",
      "Congress replenished the Federal Emergency Management Agency 's disaster relief fund with more than $20 billion in September. But that money is being spent quickly in the wake of Hurricanes Helene and Milton.",
      "Congress is expected to take up a supplemental disaster funding package at some point during the lame-duck. But, for now, lawmakers are awaiting a request from the Biden administration on what additional money will be needed for FEMA's disaster fund and for other disaster aid programs, such as Small Business Administration program that provides low-interest loans to businesses and homeowners hit with property damage. The program ran out of money in mid-October, though the agency continues to take applications, so it can move quickly when Congress does provide funding.",
      "Lawmakers are expecting a hefty request.",
      "When visiting North Carolina after Hurricane Helene, House Speaker Mike Johnson said Congress provided money to meet immediate needs and would at the appropriate time \"act in a bipartisan fashion to supply what is needed to help these communities recover, the appropriate amount that the federal government should do.\u201d",
      "Congress for more than six decades has passed an annual defense policy bill that authorizes specific weapons systems and sets troop strength and pay levels.",
      "The House passed its $895.2 billion measure in June. That amounts to a 1% increase from the last fiscal year, an amount in keeping with the spending caps set by the McCarthy-White House agreement. The measure provided a 19.5% boost in pay for junior enlisted service members and a 4.5% increase for other service members. But the measure was also filled with scores of conservative policy mandates, including overturning the Pentagon's policy of reimbursing transportation expenses to service members for travel out of state for an abortion.",
      "The inclusion of culture war provisions turned what is typically a bipartisan bill into one that the vast majority of House Democrats opposed.",
      "The Senate version would authorize about $919.9 billion in spending. The bipartisan measure passed out of committee in July, but has not been brought to the floor as Democrats reserved precious floor time for other priorities. But behind the scenes, lawmakers have been negotiating to reconcile the differences in the two bills.",
      "Democrats have made confirming judges a high priority after watching Trump get 234 judges confirmed during his first four years in office.",
      "So far, the Senate has confirmed 213 of President Joe Biden 's judicial nominees, and a committee spokesman said the chairman, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., aims to confirm every nominee possible by the end of the Congress. Seventeen nominees are pending on the floor and several more are pending in committee.",
      "It's possible that Biden could beat Trump's overall number, but Trump still gets the edge when it comes to the most important nominations \u2014 those to the Supreme Court, with Trump appointing three and Biden appointing one. Trump also had more appellate court judges confirmed.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has already lined up votes on two judges next week, an indication of the priority Democrats are placing on the issue during the lame-duck."

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 06:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Technology differences mean meters in northern England and Scotland may not work properly, energy firm body admits.",
    "story": [
      "The way smart energy meters work in northern England and Scotland is causing issues for customers, BBC Panorama has been told.",
      "The body that represents energy companies, Energy UK, has confirmed for the first time there is a regional divide - because of the way meters send usage data back to suppliers.",
      "The technology used in the north of Great Britain can affect whether smart meters work properly - and could leave customers having to submit manual readings and receiving estimated bills.",
      "The issues have also been confirmed by meter engineers who have spoken to the BBC.",
      "In the Midlands, Wales and southern England, all meters use cellular technology - similar to mobile phones - to send data to energy providers.",
      "But in northern England and Scotland, meters instead rely on longer-range radio frequencies.",
      "It is a legal requirement, the government says, for suppliers to make sure smart meters are working and it expects suppliers to \u201cresolve all issues at a much faster pace\u201d.",
      "The mass roll-out of smart meters began 12 years ago, with the goal of helping people save money on their bills, while lowering carbon emissions as part of the government\u2019s net zero plan.",
      "By showing how much energy households are using, and how much it is costing, meters are intended to encourage people to use more energy at times of day when it is cheaper - because there is a surplus while most are in bed and factories are closed.",
      "As more energy comes from renewable sources, smart meters will form a vital part of a \u201csmart grid\u201d, allowing consumers\u2019 demand for energy to match the available supply, minute-by-minute.",
      "The cost of installing smart meters across Great Britain is estimated to be \u00a313.5bn, according to the government. There are 36 million such devices in England, Wales and Scotland - but recent government figures show 3.5 million of them are not working properly.",
      "As a rule of thumb, smart meters in the northern region designed to connect to the radio signal have two small indicator lights on the communications hub, fitted to the top of the smart meter. The hubs fitted to smart meters in central and southern regions, receiving the cellular signal, usually have five of these indicator lights.",
      "Northern Ireland\u2019s energy market is separate with its own rules and regulator - and a consultation on a proposed smart meter roll-out is taking place.",
      "Hartesh Battu, a doctor from Glasgow, has had six different smart meters, fitted by two energy suppliers, none of which have worked. \u201cI just think it\u2019s astonishingly bad in terms of the technology,\u201d he told us. \u201cI do feel like, \u2018how could billions of pounds be spent on something so bad?\u2019\u201d",
      "He told the BBC he had wanted a smart meter so he could save energy on his bills and take advantage of a night-time rate that would make it cheaper to charge his electric car.",
      "His current energy supplier, Octopus Energy, told him the problem was down to signal issues in the area and may be because he lived \u201cfar up north\u201d - reasoning that left him feeling deeply unimpressed. \u201cI just thought that was a bit bonkers because I live in Glasgow, I\u2019m hardly up in Shetland, I\u2019m not rural at all.\u201d",
      "When the mass roll-out started, the decision to use radio signals across northern England and Scotland - rather than the mobile technology further south - was because it was thought the signals would be able to travel far across the hills and mountains, reaching more rural communities more easily.",
      "But Energy UK admits there are problems regarding how the radio signals transmit. \u201cThere are issues in the north,\u201d chief executive Dhara Vyas told us.",
      "She said there were \u201clive conversations\u201d within the industry about increasing the network range in the north of England and Scotland.",
      "This technological divide has been experienced by smart meter engineers who have spoken anonymously to Panorama.",
      "One engineer, \u201cAhmed\u201d told us there were more problems in northern England and Scotland on average, adding that the technology further south was more up to date.",
      "\u201cYou can end up going to someone\u2019s house at the bottom of a mountain in the north and the radio frequency can\u2019t get through. But there could be a good 3G signal nearby and that could get through - the customer doesn\u2019t know that,\u201d he said.",
      "Another engineer, \u201cSteve\u201d working for a major energy supplier in Merseyside, who has experience of installing meters in homes on both sides of the regional divide, told us it was \u201cfar easier to complete a successful installation\u201d in the south and Midlands where he could use the cellular network.",
      "The truth about smart meters",
      "Smart meters are supposed to make paying our energy bills easier and cheaper. But is that the whole story?",
      "Watch now on BBC iPlayer - or on BBC One on Monday 11 November at 20:00 (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland).",
      "Energy suppliers do not have direct control over the communication network - in both the north and south. Instead it is run by an organisation known as the Data Communications Company (DCC) and is operated by outsourcing company, Capita.",
      "Panorama contacted Dr Battu\u2019s energy supplier, Octopus Energy, about the problems he was having with his meter. The company said the situation was \u201cfrustrating\u201d because government regulations dictated it must use the radio-wave technology to provide a signal to Dr Battu\u2019s meter - and that it was not permitted to access the local 3G signal instead.",
      "However, in what they described as \u201ca highly unusual move\u201d, Octopus told us that it had in fact decided to break the rules and fix his meter by connecting it to the mobile network. It added that \u201cregulation has not moved with technology\u201d.",
      "Capita told the BBC it advised energy suppliers against using alternative technological solutions, because that would mean there was no contractual or consumer protection for the meter user to ensure service was maintained or problems addressed.",
      "It said the network it runs provides 99.3% coverage across Great Britain, adding that it was \u201cfully committed to resolving connection issues\u201d.",
      "In a statement it added: \u201cThe DCC is actively working with government to provide a future-proof 4G technology solution for the whole of Britain.\u201d",
      "Most energy users pay a little bit extra on their bills towards the cost of installing and fixing smart meters. That is supposed to be offset by the savings they could make and the environmental benefits.",
      "Energy suppliers are primarily responsible for funding the communications infrastructure - and, according to the National Audit Office, some or all of these costs are passed on to consumers in bills.",
      "The latest figures show that nine in 10 smart meters are working fine. But a recent survey by Citizens\u2019 Advice suggests one in five households have had to regularly send manual meter readings because their smart meters haven\u2019t worked properly.",
      "The government told Panorama that \u201cwhile over 90% of smart meters are operating normally\u2019\u2019 the number not working properly was \u201cstill too high\u201d and, as a result, \u201cmany households are missing out on cheaper, flexible tariffs\u201d.",
      "It also said that a recent customer experience survey by Ofgem \u201cfound no statistically significant differences\u201d in the proportion of customers reporting that their meter was not sending readings to their suppliers for areas in, or predominantly\u202fin, the north.",
      "Most experts agree smart meters can help to deliver lower bills and lower carbon emissions. But if the tech problems continue, that could put people off having them and undermine the government\u2019s goal of getting them into every home."

      "It adds that businesses have \"no capacity to pass the costs onto customers\", which would instead lead to job cuts and closures of smaller firms.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said that her National Insurance changes for businesses will generate \u00a325bn, which would aid funding of public services, such as the NHS.",
      "From April, the rate employers pay in National Insurance will rise from 13.8% to 15%, and the threshold at which they start paying the tax on each employee's salary will be reduced from \u00a39,100 per year to \u00a35,000.",

      "They are supported by a further 209 businesses, together employing tens of thousands of people across the UK.",

      "It is easy to check whether a refund is owed by logging on to the government's Student Loan Company portal, where individual refunds could range from tens of pounds to more than \u00a31,000.",
      "Tom Allingham from Save the Student said for many getting a refund could make a world of difference.",
      "Charlotte Gill is one such former student who was eligible for a refund on her loan payments, to the tune of \u00a368.",

      "There are four reasons people may be eligible for refunds.",

      "Since May, those who fall into this category have been able to use a new service offered by the SLC to request refunds online. In the first six months of the service, 418,000 people have done so.",
      "Other reasons may be that former students are charged repayments before they are required to pay, which is generally in the April after they finish studying.",
      "Some people may have been put on the wrong payment plans by their employer, while others may have continued making payments after their loan had been paid off in full.",
      "Any money overpaid does count towards the full repayment of the loan, and may save graduates money in the long run on interest.",
      "However, as Mr Allingham said, many university graduates may need the cash for their day-to-day expenses.",

      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",

      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",

      "The firm landed a \u00a390m fine for dumping raw sewage in the sea, which its chief executive said came about because the company had not invested enough.",
      "Ofwat has forecast Southern Water will put bills up by 44% and Mr Sawers told the BBC the extra \u201c\u00a3200-\u00a3300 a year won\u2019t just appear from nowhere\u201d.",
      "He said paying the water bill after constant increases has \u201cbeen tough at times\u201d that has put stress on his wife and children. He has just come out of arrears from previous bill rises, he added.",
      "\u201cNow with the possibility of a 44% increase to our bill so that Southern Water can pay the fine imposed by Ofwat, our bill could potentially be \u00a3900,\" he said.",
      "\u201cConsidering my latest pay offer is 1% per year over three years and along with the gas and electric hikes of the past couple of years it\u2019s all looking a bit bleak\u201d, he said.",
      "In July, Ofwat provisionally said bills would rise by an average of \u00a319 per year between 2025 and 2030 - totalling a \u00a394 increase, or a 21% rise, over that five year period. That increase does not include inflation.",
      "The bill hike varies by region with the regulator agreeing to a rise of 44% for Southern Water, and 11% for Northumbrian Water.",
      "Since July, some companies have asked for further increases. For example, Thames Water, the UK's largest water company, was given the go-ahead to lift bills by 23%. It has since said it needs to raise bills by 59%, in order to keep operating as normal.",
      "The BBC understands Ofwat is considering permitting bigger bill increases for some companies when it makes a final decision in December, to reflect higher financing costs.",

      "Ofwat said it would \"fully consider\" the findings from the CCW research.",

    "story": [
      "The Treasury should have disclosed a \u00a39.5bn overspend in the public finances in the run-up to the previous government's Spring Budget \"under the law\", the UK's budget watchdog has said.",
      "Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), told a committee of MPs on Tuesday the Treasury should explain why information was \"not provided to us\".",
      "His comments prompted the committee's chair and Labour MP Meg Hillier to suggest the Treasury \"may have broken the law\".",

      "Last week, the OBR said the previous government \"did not provide\" them with all available information at former chancellor Jeremy Hunt's last Budget in March.",
      "The \u00a39.5bn overspend forms the basis of Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 claim that the Conservatives left Labour with a significant \"hole\" in the public finances.",
      "Asked by the committee on Tuesday how the shortfall could have happened, the OBR's Mr Hughes said \"the system very clearly broke down\", but insisted \"that kind of failure will not happen again\" because of processes put in place since.",
      "The OBR works closely with the Treasury. Its role is to assess the government's tax and spending plans and produce reports on whether the chancellors' plans are sound.",
      "Its judgements and forecasts are closely watched by financial markets to determine if the UK's economic plans are credible.",
      "Pushed on whether the Treasury broke the law over not disclosing an overspend, Mr Hughes said there may \"have been a misunderstanding of how the law ought to be interpreted\".",
      "\"There is no doubt in our minds that had that information been provided we would have had a materially different judgement,\" he added.",
      "He said it \"was a question for the Treasury to ask: why was information available within the Treasury and not provided to us?\"",
      "In summarising Mr Hughes' comments, Hillier said: \"The Treasury may have even broken the law in the run-up to the Spring Budget in not disclosing all the spending information.\"",
      "Shadow chancellor Hunt has previously accused the OBR of failing to act in a \"politically impartial manner\" by releasing its findings about the overspend on the day of the Budget last week, arguing it would help make the case for Labour's big tax rises.",
      "Hunt said it was \"impossible to know\" how much of the \u00a39.5bn would have been compensated for by savings elsewhere.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson told the BBC: \u201cAt the time of the Spring Budget, we communicated to the OBR the decision that ministers would manage spending pressures by making offsetting savings. This was within the law.",
      "\"We have accepted all the recommendations put forward by the OBR in its review of the March 2024 forecast.",

      "At the Budget, Reeves said employers will pay NI at a rate of 15% on salaries above \u00a35,000 from April, up from 13.8% on salaries above \u00a39,100.",
      "The OBR has calculated that three quarters of the impact would be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "The watchdog's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "Prof Miles said the OBR estimated employers would only take around a quarter of the hit from the NI changes in terms of lower profits, and suggested that the rest would be felt by workers.",
      "He said part of the reason for this was the reduction of the threshold for employers paying the tax.",
      "However, he suggested that the personal impact for workers might see \"a bit of an offset\" with the increase to minimum wages announced in the Budget.",

      "'Just pay up,' says Post Office scandal victim",
      "'The Post Office has ruined every happy moment of my life since 2005'",
      "At the committee, lawyers were asked about their experience of the Horizon Shortfall compensation scheme, which is overseen by the Post Office.",
      "This compensation scheme is for sub-postmasters who were not convicted, or part of the Group Litigation Order (GLO) court action, but who believe they experienced shortfalls because of Horizon.",
      "David Enright, whose law firm represents hundreds of Post Office victims, said there is no funding for legal advice at the start, with claimants presented with a \"DIY questionnaire\".",
      "Then, six to nine months later, he said there is a request for more information which often involves 50-150 further questions that can only be answered by the likes of a forensic accountant.",

      "\"But you do have to want the actual products,\" says Cissy. \"Otherwise, it\u2019s a bit of a waste of money.\"",

      "However, even if a product may seem like good value for money, for some, spending more than \u00a3200 on an advent calendar is simply a luxury they cannot afford.",

      "But part of the reason beauty advent calendars are so popular is because shoppers still want to treat themselves, says Natalie Berg.",

    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 00:06:39 GMT",
    "summary": "Deputy PM admits former Soviet state was until recently a 'highly corrupt country' - but insists things are changing fast.",
    "story": [
      "The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.",
      "\"I went with a backpack, and set up a business,\" says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.",
      "Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing \"the clich\u00e9 that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time\".",
      "\"Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner you'd get attention,\" he says.",
      "Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.",
      "Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.",
      "The country's standard corporation tax rate - the amount that firms have to pay on their profits - is just 12%. This compares with 25% in the UK, and 25.8% in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.",
      "There's an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the country's IT sector - the Moldova IT Park (MITP).",
      "This isn't a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country - and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7%.",
      "The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.",
      "This drive is being led by Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu, who this week was re-elected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted \"yes\" on pro-EU constitutional changes.",
      "However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46% and No receiving 49.54%. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldova\u2019s authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an \"unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy\".",
      "Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily.",
      "Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.",
      "\"Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that it's a country that can change very fast,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This used to be a highly corrupt country, a country where, exactly 10 years ago, a billion dollars from our central banks just disappeared.\"",
      "\"We are moving very fast towards joining the EU, and we are reforming our economy at top speed. Of course, we have a long way to go.\"",
      "He pointed to Moldova's rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International.",
      "Out of 180 countries - with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt - Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.",
      "\"Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.\"",
      "Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.",
      "\"Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.",
      "\"It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with.\"",
      "Member companies of the MITP don't just benefit from the 7% corporation tax rate. They also don't need to make employer social security contributions, and staff don't have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.",
      "The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.",
      "More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.",
      "In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined \u20ac365m ($397m; \u00a3308m) in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6% of the country's GDP.",
      "While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldova's IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.",
      "Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.",
      "He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than \u20ac100,000 a year, \"because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany\".",
      "At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. \"Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.\"",
      "Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe \"as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine\".",
      "Marina Bzovii, MITP's administrator and an assistant professor at the Technical University of Moldova, already sees Moldova as a regional business hub. \"Moldova is connecting even Central Asia, countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who are culturally much further from Europe.",
      "\"However, Moldova understands both of the cultures. So it's the kind of business hub that Europe needs... and Chisinau is now really vibrant.\"",

      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",

    "story": [
      "University graduates across the UK are being urged by a campaign group to check whether they are due a refund on their student loan repayment after it was revealed that nearly \u00a3200m was overpaid last year.",
      "Save the Student's comments come after figures were published which show that hundreds of thousands of people currently paying off their loans are eligible for a share of \u00a3184m in refunds.",
      "It is easy to check whether a refund is owed by logging on to the government's Student Loan Company portal, where individual refunds could range from tens of pounds to more than \u00a31,000.",
      "Tom Allingham from Save the Student said for many getting a refund could make a world of difference.",
      "Charlotte Gill is one such former student who was eligible for a refund on her loan payments, to the tune of \u00a368.",
      "She said it did not make a huge difference \"but every little helps when you are a student\".",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's your money, it\u2019s not the government's money, so if you've got any entitlement to a refund then absolutely take it,\" she said.",
      "Martin De'Ath received \u00a3396 in his refund and says the substantial payment made him question how he could have used it in the 10 months he was without it.",
      "\"I was definitely pleased to get it back at least,\" he said.",
      "There are four reasons people may be eligible for refunds.",
      "The main reason, behind \u00a3146m of the total, is that repayments were taken from people despite them not earning above the annual threshold at which point repayments automatically kick in.",
      "This can happen when someone earns above the monthly threshold which triggers the beginning of loan repayments, due to things like to taking extra shifts, getting a new job or receiving a bonus, but their annual earnings might still fall below the yearly threshold.",
      "Since May, those who fall into this category have been able to use a new service offered by the SLC to request refunds online. In the first six months of the service, 418,000 people have done so.",
      "Other reasons may be that former students are charged repayments before they are required to pay, which is generally in the April after they finish studying.",
      "Some people may have been put on the wrong payment plans by their employer, while others may have continued making payments after their loan had been paid off in full.",
      "Any money overpaid does count towards the full repayment of the loan, and may save graduates money in the long run on interest.",
      "However, as Mr Allingham said, many university graduates may need the cash for their day-to-day expenses.",
      "\"It is definitely worth doing, particularly even with the cost of living crisis still lingering on a little bit, having that extra boost of cash right now could make a world of difference,\" Mr Allingham said.",

    "story": [
      "A 17-year-old girl in China hailed as a genius in a mathematics contest cheated, competition organisers have said - ending months of scepticism over her stellar results.",
      "Jiang Ping, a fashion design student from a rural town in Jiangsu province, made headlines in June when she came 12th in the qualifiers of an international maths contest run by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "She was the first finalist since the competition began in 2018 to have come from a lowly vocational school, Chinese media reported. The vast majority of the 800 finalists came from elite universities.",
      "Jiang's results turned her into an overnight sensation, and she was labelled a \"prodigy\" in the press and on social media.",
      "Under China's notoriously cut-throat education system, academic excellence is lauded. Many people online were encouraged by Jiang's results, seeing them as proof that students from vocational institutes could still excel academically.",
      "However, as doubt surrounding her abilities snowballed, competition organisers  said last Sunday that Jiang had violated competition rules in the preliminary round, by receiving help from her teacher, who was also a contestant himself.",
      "\u201cThis has exposed problems like inadequacies in the competition format and the lack of rigour in supervision. We sincerely apologise,\u201d organisers said in a statement.",
      "According to the final results announced on Sunday, neither Jiang nor her teacher was among 86 winners in the competition.",
      "The rise of a maths sensation",
      "The annual mathematics contest is open to contestants from institutions worldwide and hosted by Damo Academy, Alibaba\u2019s research institute.",
      "This year, Jiang, a student at Jiangsu Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, outperformed other finalists from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions \u2014 including Peking University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Oxford.",
      "She had chosen to study at the vocational school both because she was interested in fashion design, and because her sister and friends were there, said local media outlets.",
      "Jiang's results and unconventional educational background soon grabbed nationwide attention. Her story was featured in a video produced by Damo Academy and she was interviewed by news outlets across the country.",
      "\u201cLearning maths is bumpy, but every time I solve the problems I feel quite happy,\u201d she told the state-run People\u2019s Daily. \u201cNo matter what the future holds, I will keep learning.\u201d",
      "Jiang\u2019s teacher, Wang Runqiu, was also thrust into the spotlight, hailed as an educator who noticed and encouraged her passion for maths. Speaking to the media, he described her as an attentive student who had learnt advanced mathematics herself.",
      "\"I have encountered many setbacks in the process of learning maths,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I want to do everything I can to help my students and let them know that there are other possibilities in the future.\u201d",
      "But along with an outpouring of praise for Jiang and her teacher, the student\u2019s story also sparked a discussion about whether China\u2019s education system did enough to support gifted students in less academic pathways - especially those who may not have received similar recognition by their teachers.",
      "China's education system focuses much of its resources on those taking the \"Gaokao\" - the notoriously difficult exam that students need to take in order to get into university. Those in vocational schools had long faced restrictions in taking the gaokao and enrolling in regular universities, until an education reform in 2022 offered vocational school students an alternative university entrance exam.",
      "An earlier op-ed in state-news media outlet Xinhua said that Jiang's results \u201chint[ed] at an awkward truth: even youths as talented as her may be easily buried without good education credentials\u201d.",
      "'She was not the mastermind'",
      "But as Jiang\u2019s fame burgeoned, criticism and scepticism surrounding her skills also started to bubble.",
      "In June, dozens of other finalists published a joint letter they wrote to the competition organising committee demanding an investigation into Jiang. They also called for her answers to the preliminary test questions to be made public.",
      "The finalists alleged that Jiang had made \u201cseveral apparent writing mistakes\u201d in an online video and that she \u201cseemed unfamiliar with these mathematical expressions and symbols\u201d.",
      "While the preliminary round of the competition allowed participants to use programming software, the final round was a closed-book exam. The results of the finals, which were initially set to be released in August, were postponed for several months.",
      "When the results were finally made public on Sunday, Jiang was not among the 86 winners of the final round.",
      "Her school also confirmed in a statement on Sunday that Jiang had been helped by her teacher Wang, and that Wang had been given a warning and disqualified from teachers\u2019 awards for the year. The statement also called for leniency and protection for the teenager.",
      "Attempts by the BBC to contact Jiang's family were unsuccessful. A social media account once used by her mother is now defunct, and a phone number linked to her father has been deactivated. Multiple phone calls by the BBC to Jiang's school went unanswered, and a village official declined to discuss Jiang when contacted by the BBC.",
      "While Sunday\u2019s revelation unleashed a wave of criticism of Jiang and her teacher, many social media users also spoke up for the teenager, arguing the bigger responsibility lay with her school and teacher.",
      "\u201cJiang Ping is not innocent, that\u2019s without question. But who are the worst parties in this?\u201d reads a post on Weibo. \u201cThe adults brought this child along to do a bad deed, and let her suffer all the consequences.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven if the whole thing was faked, Jiang Ping was not the mastermind behind it,\u201d another wrote on Weibo. \u201cShe should not be burned at the stake.\u201d",

      "\"You miss Russell Crowe, but Mescal is always watchable, with a stocky, swarthy, brooding presence,\" he added in the four-star review.",
      "The FT's review celebrated veteran director, Ridley Scott, for his \"stubborn charm\", \"belligerent swagger\" and \"ideas that are more pulpy and loopy\".",
      "\"The best of the film is its sheer bloody-minded heft, a blockbuster fuelled by an insistence on bigger, sillier, movie-r,\" Danny Leigh wrote, giving the film three stars.",
      "But he added that he'd \"be amazed if the sequel is remembered by Christmas, let alone in 24 years\".",
      "Variety's Owen Gleiberman said that while the sequel was a \"solid piece of neoclassical popcorn\" it's \"ultimately a mere shadow\" of the original.",
      "He also noted that while Mescal delivers a fine performance he has \"an anger that never quite simmers to a boil\" and \"we now can\u2019t help but see him as a millennial knockoff of Crowe\u2019s glowering royal punk\".",

      "The Independent's four-star review also commended 86-year-old Scott, who appears to care less about habits and expectations the older he gets.",
      "\"Gladiator II is equal in scale and spectacle, and weighted with metaphor, but it\u2019s also shot through with the kind of wry, absurdist slant that\u2019s come to dominate Scott\u2019s work of the last decade and a half,\" wrote Clarisse Loughrey. \"At times, Gladiator II is pure camp.\"",
      "'Marvel-esque sequel'",
      "The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film delivers bigger, bolder action thanks to advances in digital technology.",
      "There are \"heavily armed gladiators riding a charging rhinoceros\" and \"wounded men tumbling from boats into the jaws of ravenous sharks\" during the nautical battle staged in the flooded pit of the Colosseum.",
      "David Rooney was less favourable about Mescal's performance and called it \"a tad flat at times\" with his emotional range \"sticking mostly to the same notes of brooding intensity and simmering rage\".",
      "Kevin Maher at The Times also criticised Mescal and said he \"disappoints in this dreary, Marvel-esque sequel\".",
      "In his two-star review, he wrote that the film is a \"scattershot effort with half-formed characters and undernourished plotlines that seem to exist only in conversation with the Russell Crowe original.",
      "\"There is no substantial story this time around, and no driving ideas in the hotchpotch screenplay.\"",
      "The Wrap's William Bibbiani agreed and said while the film \"has everything it needs in the action department, it\u2019s the story that falls apart\".",
      "\"The whole thing hangs on contrivance and familiarity, not characters, so the fights don\u2019t seem to matter much.\"",
      "However, Bibbiani and Maher noted that Denzel Washington is particularly good as Machiavellian former slave, Macrinus, who now profits off gladiators.",
      "Maher said the film \"only ignites when Denzel Washington\u2019s brilliant, bisexual slave manager is on screen,\" he said.",
      "Other critics agreed and The Guardian said he \"almost steals the entire picture\", while The Hollywood Reporter called his performance \"lip-smacking\".",

    "story": [
      "When I ask the creator of the hit Korean drama Squid Game about reports that he was so stressed while shooting the first series he lost six teeth, he quickly corrects me. \u201cIt was eight or nine,\u201d he laughs.",
      "Hwang Dong-hyuk is speaking to me on set as he films the second series of his dystopian Netflix thriller, which sees hundreds of debt-laden contestants fight it out for a whopping cash prize, by playing a string of life-or-death children\u2019s games.",
      "But another series was not always on the cards. At one point, he swore against making one.",
      "Given the stress it has caused him, I ask what changed his mind.",
      "\u201cMoney,\u201d he answers, without hesitation.",
      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t fully finish the story,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first series was Netflix\u2019s most successful show to date, thrusting South Korea and its home-grown television dramas into the spotlight. Its dark commentary on wealth inequality touched a nerve with audiences around the globe.",
      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang has had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time audience expectations are sky high.",
      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",
      "\u201cNew lines are being drawn. We\u2019re in an era of us vs them. Who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d",
      "As I toured the show\u2019s playful set, with its distinctive brightly-coloured staircase, I picked up a few clues as to how the director\u2019s despair will be reflected this time around.",
      "In this series, the previous winner, Gi-hun, re-enters the game on a quest to bring it down and save the latest round of contestants.",
      "According to Lee Jung-jae, who plays the leading character, he is \"more desperate and determined\u201d than before.",
      "The floor of the dormitory, where the contestants sleep at night, has been divided in two.",
      "One half is branded with a giant red neon X symbol, the other with a blue circle.",
      "Now, after every game, the players must pick a side, depending on whether they want to end the contest early and survive, or keep playing, in the knowledge all but one of them will die. The majority decision rules.",
      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",
      "For all those who were captivated by the shocking storytelling of Squid Game, there were others who found it gratuitously violent and difficult to watch.",
      "But it is clear from talking to Hwang, that the violence is fully thought out. He is a man who thinks and cares deeply about the world and is motivated by a mounting unease.",
      "\u201cWhen making this series, I constantly asked myself \u2018do we humans have what it takes to steer the world off this downhill path?\u2019. Honestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.",
      "While viewers of the second series might not get the answers to these big life questions, they can at least be comforted that some plot holes will be filled in \u2013 like why the game exists, and what is motivating the masked Front Man running it.",
      "\u201cPeople will see more of the Front Man\u2019s past, his story and his emotions,\u201d reveals the actor Lee Byung-hun, who plays the mysterious role.",
      "\u201cI don't think this will make viewers warm to him, but it may help them better understand his choices.\u201d",
      "As one of South Korea\u2019s most famous actors, Lee admits that having his face and eyes covered and his voice distorted throughout the first series, was \u201ca little bit dissatisfying\u201d.",
      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",
      "They paid him a modest upfront amount, leaving him unable to cash in on the whopping \u00a3650m it is estimated to have made the platform.",
      "This explains the love-hate relationship South Korea\u2019s film and television creators currently have with international streaming platforms.",
      "Over the past few years, Netflix has stormed the Korean market with billions of dollars of investment, bringing the industry global recognition and love, but leaving creators feeling short-changed.",
      "They accuse the platform of forcing them to relinquish their copyright when they sign contracts \u2013 and with it, their claim to profit.",
      "This is a worldwide problem.",
      "In the past, creators could rely on getting a cut of box office sales or TV re-runs, but this model has not been adopted by streaming giants.",
      "The issue is compounded in South Korea, creators say, due to its outdated copyright law, which does not protect them.",
      "This summer, actors, writers, directors and producers teamed up to form a collective, to fight the system together.",
      "\u201cIn Korea, being a movie director is just a job title, it\u2019s not a way to earn a living,\u201d the vice-president of the Korean Film Directors Guild, Oh Ki-hwan, tells the audience at an event in Seoul.",
      "Some of his director friends, he says, work part-time in warehouses and as taxi drivers.",
      "Park Hae-young is a writer at the event. When Netflix bought her show, 'My Liberation Notes', it became a global hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been writing my whole life. So, to get global recognition when competing with creators from across the world, has been a joyful experience,\u201d she tells me.",
      "But Park says the current streaming model has left her reluctant to \u201cpour her all\u201d into her next series.",
      "\u201cUsually, I\u2019ll spend four or five years making a drama in the belief that, if it's successful, it could somewhat secure my future, that I'll get my fair share of compensation. Without that, what's the point of working so hard?\u201d",
      "She and other creators are pushing the South Korean government to change its copyright law to force production companies to share their profits.",
      "In a statement, the South Korean government told the BBC that while it recognised the compensation system needed to change, it was up to the industry to resolve the issue. A spokesperson for Netflix told us it offers \u201ccompetitive\u201d compensation, and guarantees creators \u201csolid compensation, regardless of the success or failure of their shows\u201d.",
      "Squid Game\u2019s Hwang hopes his candor over his own pay struggles will initiate that change.",
      "He has certainly sparked the fair pay conversation, and this second series will surely give the industry another bump.",
      "But when we catch up after filming has wrapped, he tells me his teeth are aching again.",

      "There was no sign of Take That or Aitch, or Liam Gallagher - even though he won best rock star.",

      "But the show took a more global perspective, highlighting acts from Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and America - including a predictable victory for Taylor Swift in the night's two biggest categories, best artist and video of the year.",
      "She only appeared by video, choosing instead to spend the night watching her boyfriend, American Football player Travis Kelce, lead the Kansas City Chiefs to victory against the Denver Broncos.",
      "But there were plenty of other stars at the show and on the red carpet. Here's some of the gossip we picked up along the way.",
      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",
      "\"You let it go, because you think you can come back to it - and now there are so many ideas that are just gone. It's so sad.\"",
      "But the singer, who won best UK artist, maintained a positive outlook.",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason. I'll have to start again and maybe it's a blessing in disguise.\"",
      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",
      "\"I went to karate school, and we illegally went into nightclubs, to make a little money break-dancing,\" he told us.",
      "\"I remember Boy George was cool, Wham was cool,\" he continued.",
      "\"But our favourite was Benny Hill. Benny Hill is still our favourite to this day. I don't think anybody has as ever been as funny or as charismatic as Benny Hill.\"",
      "So, during those halcyon days of watching smutty comedy in Morecambe, did he ever think he'd be back, winning a lifetime achievement prize?",
      "\"You can never foresee something like that,\" he said. \"When we first got involved with hip-hop, we didn't do it for none of the accolades. We just did it because we loved it.",
      "\"But with that being said, tonight is a dream come true.\"",
      "To honour that moment, he gave a nine-minute acceptance speech thanking everyone from his mother to an art teacher he'd met backstage.",

      "3) Olly Alexander had advice for next year's Eurovision contestant",
      "Olly Alexander played a pre-show party on Saturday night, and couldn't quite believe the reception for Dizzy - the song which earned him 18th place at this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "\"That went down a lot better than it did in Eurovision,\" he laughed, shortly before Jedward invaded the stage and caused utter chaos.",
      "At the main ceremony, Alexander was there to award song of the year to Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso. But he also had a few words for anyone considering representing the UK at next year's contest.",
      "\"I would say to them, whoever it is, 'Call me, and we will have a serious conversation about it',\" he said with the haunted look of a man who has seen some things.",
      "4) Benson Boone has a new fan: Bez",

    "story": [
      "The much-anticipated new Paddington in Peru film has had mixed reviews over its opening weekend, with critics calling it \"charming-enough\", but some agreeing the film struggles to reach the heights of its predecessors.",
      "The third instalment in the Paddington live action adventure franchise sees the marmalade sandwich munching bear return to Peru to visit his aunt Lucy.",
      "The film, that includes a return of much loved cast members including Ben Whishaw, Emily Mortimer and Hugh Bonneville, opened in UK cinemas on Friday 8 November.",
      "Since the beginning of the film series in 2014, Paddington Bear has grown to become a national treasure with fans of all ages through its heart-warming appeal.",
      "Of the latest film, Peter Bradshaw wrote in the Guardian that the experience was \"just as jolly as the previous two films, but not really as funny\" and likened it to a \"special episode of a TV sitcom that takes the cast to the Costa del Sol\".",
      "In the Hollywood Reporter, Leslie Felperin wrote that while the film \"lacks the absurdist wit and decidedly dark edge that elevated the first two Paddington movies\", it was \"serviceable enough given its limitations\".",
      "Nick Curtis was more cutting with his two star review in the Standard, saying Paddington in Peru \"misses the easy charm, the fluency and the icy sliver of jeopardy\" from the first two movies \"which had genuine cross-generational appeal\".",
      "He added the pacing felt \"ponderous and slow\".",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey was one of many critics to give Paddington in Peru a three-star rating, praising the addition of new characters portrayed by Hollywood heavyweights Olivia Colman and Antonio Banderas, calling them \"assets\" to the film, albeit not matching the previous \"scene-stealing\" from Hugh Grant.",
      "Nick de Semlyen also agreed, writing in Empire: \"Colman is perfect casting as sinister sister Reverend Mother, overseer of the Home For Retired Bears.",
      "\"Whether riffing on The Sound Of Music, strumming irritatingly on a guitar, or struggling to keep a phony smile plastered across her face, Colman is great fun, though a little underused. Antonio Banderas, meanwhile, goes full Kind Hearts And Coronets, playing not just a boat captain with a secret, but his many descendants.\"",
      "Speaking in an interview with BBC Radio 1, Whishaw, who has voiced the character of Paddington in all three movies, said \"I think they are beautiful films made with such care and love.",
      "\"A good film is a good film and they are hard to make, so I feel very proud of them and very proud to be associated in this way with this character.\"",
      "The director of the first two Paddington films, Paul King, has since moved on to new projects including Wonka, starring Timothee Chalamet, but he is credited with writing this latest story alongside Simon Farnaby and Mark Burton.",
      "Clarisse Loughrey gave the film three stars in the Independent, calling Paddington in Peru \"the worst in the franchise\" but praised the production design, which takes full advantage of moving the cast away from the cosy comforts of London, and making \"every interior look like an untouched escape room with secrets hidden under every trinket\".",
      "Leila Latif of Total Film gave Paddington in Peru four stars, saying \"despite the title, the film feels distinctly un-Peruvian\".",
      "She added: \"There are no Peruvian characters (unless you count the bears) and while the film alludes to the previous horrors of plundering Spanish colonizers in a surprisingly brutal montage, it's still an uneasy shift that there is more screen presence from people of colour in London than there is in South America.\"",
      "Away from the big screen, a new Paddington musical is being developed for the stage, with McFly's Tom Fletcher set to write the music and lyrics.",

    "story": [
      "Is it legal to import Sir Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses in India?",
      "This question has been puzzling legal experts since the Delhi High Court suggested this week that the notification banning the novel\u2019s import - issued in 1988 - might no longer be valid, as the government couldn't locate it.",
      "The Satanic Verses, criticised by some Muslims as blasphemous, was banned in India shortly after its release, sparking protests worldwide. Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989, calling for Rushdie\u2019s assassination. This forced the Indian-born Booker Prize-winning author into hiding for nearly a decade.",
      "Although the book remains officially banned in India, some legal experts now believe it could be imported unless the government reaffirms the ban. Others, however, caution that practical obstacles may still exist.",
      "The ban on the book came under scrutiny after Sandipan Khan, a resident of West Bengal state, tried to buy the book but learnt that it was not published in India nor could it be imported.",
      "In 2017, he filed a Right to Information (RTI) request for the official notification banning the book\u2019s import, but was sent through a series of departments without finding it.",
      "In 2019, Khan took the matter to the Delhi High Court, arguing that the ban impacted his freedom to read.",
      "Over five years, government departments repeatedly failed to produce the notification, despite customs having similar records from as far back as 1968.",
      "Finally, on 5 November, the court declared it had no option but to \u201cpresume\u201d that no such ban notification exists and therefore couldn\u2019t assess its validity.",
      "The case raises a perplexing question: is a notification valid if no copy of it can be found?",
      "The simple answer is, we don't know yet.",
      "The court has not clarified if the book could be accessed in India but advised Mr Khan to pursue any legal options to obtain it.",
      "Uddyam Mukherjee, Mr Khan\u2019s lawyer, told the BBC that federal departments couldn\u2019t provide a clear answer either, when asked by the court.",
      "\u201cI have never come across a situation like this,\u201d said Madan Lokur, a former judge of the Supreme Court.",
      "If the notification is not found then \u201ctechnically no ban exists\u201d and the book can be imported.",
      "\u201cHowever, the government may pass a fresh notification [banning the book's import],\u201d Mr Lokur added, since the court has not declared the ban to be unconstitutional, but only said that the notification is presumed to not exist.",
      "Mr Mukherjee argued that the book could now be imported \u201cas there is no legal impediment\u201d against the book.",
      "However, some legal experts disagree.",

      "Disabled TikTokers have been posting about their experiences, and a teacher recently wrote a Reddit thread titled \u201cGetting real sick of this Timmy trend\u201d, expressing frustration at students' lack of awareness.",
      "This is why I challenged the teens at the station - I felt a duty not only to my 12-year-old self, who once burst into tears feeling helpless at similar taunts, but also to disabled students today.",
      "I returned a second time when the boys called out \u201cTimmy\u201d again after I turned to leave.",
      "\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked forcefully. Silence. One of the group eventually apologised, admitting the behaviour was wrong.",
      "\u201cSpeak to your friends,\u201d I pleaded, sensing a glimmer of hope. \u201cMaybe then they\u2019ll listen.\u201d"

    "summary": "The actress was the last surviving original cast member of BBC Radio 4 serial The Archers.",
    "story": [
      "June Spencer, who has died aged 105, was the last surviving original cast member of The Archers.",
      "For nearly 70 years, she played Peggy Woolley in the long-running radio drama: one of the best-loved matriarchs in British broadcasting.",
      "Spencer helped launch BBC Radio's \"everyday story of country folk\" on 1 January 1951. Clement Attlee was Prime Minister, and meat, cheese, sugar, and petrol were still being rationed after World War Two.",
      "As Peggy, she weathered the ups and downs of life in Ambridge, with plot lines including alcoholism, gambling, and dementia, until Spencer\u2019s retirement in 2022 at the age of 103.",
      "At the time, her colleagues paid tribute to an actor who never fluffed a line.",
      "\u201cI have rarely worked with such an inventive, focused and technically brilliant actor,\u201d said Jeremy Howe \u2013 the editor of the programme, \"or with such a lovely person\".",
      "The Archers radio star June Spencer dies aged 105",
      "June Rosalind Spencer was born on 14 June 1919, just six months after the end of World War One.",
      "Her acting career began at the age of three, when she was cast as King of the Land of Nod in a school play. When she heard the audience laugh, June knew it was the life for her.",
      "She went to Nottingham High School for Girls, which she found \u201cvery stark, grey and cold\u201d.",
      "She was forced to give up sport \u2013 her favourite lesson \u2013 when a doctor somehow misdiagnosed a heart condition.",
      "An only child, her father was a \u201csensible and supportive\u201d biscuit salesman, but her mother was another story.",
      "A \u201ccomplex woman\u201d, Mrs Spencer had once aspired to the stage herself, but \u2013 according to her daughter - \u201cjust gave up on life... and decided she was an invalid at the age of 40\u201d.",
      "June Spencer had little choice but to leave school to look after her mother \u2013 who eventually lived until she was 94.",
      "Miserably, mother and daughter sat together in a darkened room in case Mrs Spencer had \"an attack\".",
      "Her headmistress was angry, complaining that her former pupil was throwing her life away. \u201cI was frightened of her,\u201d June later recalled.",
      "\u201cShe told me, \u2018Of course, you can't expect to get anywhere without your School Certificate\u2019.",
      "\"I have thought of those words many times since, particularly when I received my OBE.\u201d",
      "In her teens, the aspiring actress enjoyed writing comic monologues - performing them as part of the after-dinner entertainment at local Masonic lodges.",
      "But with her heart set on the stage, her mother was obstructive: refusing to let her daughter sit the exams for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.",
      "\u201cI think my mother thought I would fall in with a bad lot,\u201d Spencer said. \"When I did finally get in [to the theatre] she said: 'Oh well, I suppose it was inevitable'.\"",
      "She joined a drama club, studied for a London Guildhall drama school certificate, and finally joined a local theatre company in 1942.",
      "The same year she married a \u201cfair-haired, blue-eyed boy with the cheekiest grin I\u2019d ever seen\u201d.",
      "She had first met Roger Brocksom when she was 17 years old, on holiday near Skegness \u2013 but he didn\u2019t have the money to buy her a ring.",
      "The wedding took place while he was on leave from the army; wartime shortages meant they had rice paper rather than icing on the cake.",
      "A series of small parts on BBC radio programmes followed, and \u2013 by the time her husband returned from the war \u2013 Spencer was finding regular work.",
      "Then came the moment that changed her life.",
      "The founder of The Archers, Godfrey Baseley, is said to have talked openly in meetings about who was going to be in his new programme \u2013 and news travelled fast.",
      "It reached a mystified June Spencer while she was getting lunch in the BBC canteen.",
      "\u201cA girl said to me, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to be in The Archers, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\" she recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Am I? What\u2019s The Archers?\u2019\u201d",
      "In 1950, there were a few pilot episodes and then the big launch on New Year\u2019s Day, 1951 \u2013 with June Spencer playing a heavily pregnant Peggy Archer.",
      "The series hoped to be a public service for farmers, with gentle storylines that brought urban listeners into rural surroundings \u2013 almost as if they were eavesdropping on farmers and their wives.",
      "To start with, Spencer had a 13-week contract and little idea that she was helping to create a unique slice of British life.",
      "The shows were then broadcast live, with producers creeping in and scribbling alterations on scripts, moments before she read them.",
      "But The Archers was an instant hit with the actors \u2013 despite never having their credits read out on air \u2013 in demand for local appearances.",
      "\"I remember going down to a gathering of all the Women's Institutes in Cornwall,\u201d June recalled, \u201cand I was mobbed. It was quite frightening.\"",
      "There was a brief break from the show when June and Roger adopted two children in the late 1950s. Thelma Rogers took over the part for a while, but soon returned to the theatre.",
      "On taking back the role, Spencer insisted she had little in common with Peggy, who rather lacked a sense of humour, but her on-air journey from young barmaid to grieving widow saw them both involved in some of the show's strongest storylines.",
      "Peggy\u2019s first husband, Jack Archer, succumbed to alcoholism, while her second husband Jack Woolley \u2013 with whom she hoped to enjoy a happy retirement - was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.",
      "The show\u2019s slow-moving plot lines meant each disease unfolded over years - as they do in real life. And both issues were close to June\u2019s heart.",
      "Around the time of her Golden Wedding anniversary, Spencer had noticed that Roger\u2019s memory \u201cwas playing him false\u201d and \u201cthen the repetitive questions started,\u201d she said.",
      "When Peggy Woolley\u2019s husband was given the same disease in The Archers, June was supportive and \u2013 with her experience of Roger\u2019s gradual disintegration \u2013 was often consulted by the scriptwriters.",
      "Roger passed away in 2001. Five years later, June saw her son David \u2013 a ballet dancer who had lost his career through injury - die of alcohol abuse. He was 55 years old.",
      "For Spencer, such things were not unusual occurrences of life imitating art. Her attitude was that every family experiences traumas and disasters, and drama helps them to deal with it.",
      "\u201cWe tackle difficult situations that come up in real life, and treat them without being sensational,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI think people appreciate that. When they have the same sort of problems, they hear how the Archers coped, and I think it helps them.\"",
      "June Spencer was made an OBE in 1991 and a CBE in Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Birthday Honours List in 2017.",
      "Interviewers who came to her home in rural Surrey were routinely charmed.",
      "\u201cIt's hard not to go overboard with admiration for a nonagenarian who remains so unaffected by her fame on the one hand,\u201d wrote one, \u201cand some of the awful things life has thrown at her on the other.\u201d",
      "She held a special place in the nation\u2019s heart as queen of its longest-running radio drama, and was thought of with enormous affection by her fellow cast members.",
      "June \u201cshone through sadness without a word of complaint,\" recalled Charles Collingwood - who plays Brian Aldridge, her fictional son-in-law, \u201cand always remained immense fun\"."

    "story": [
      "Boris Johnson\u2019s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said.",
      "Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.",
      "Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said.",
      "The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.",
      "Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK.",
      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",
      "In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.",
      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",
      "In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals.",
      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4 m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",
      "Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time.",

      "In his first TV interview since announcing his condition, Sir Chris told BBC Breakfast how people with a strong family history should consider seeing their GP for PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test to help spot the disease.",
      "PSA tests are not routinely offered to men under 50 without symptoms but who may be at risk. Doctors are instead told to use their judgement.",
      "Sir Chris told BBC Breakfast: \"To me it seems a no-brainer. Why would they not reduce the age? Bring the age down and allow more men to go in and get a blood test.\"",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC that Sir Chris makes a powerful argument. \"That's why I've asked the NHS to look at the case for lowering the age.\"",

      "\"Right now, you need to be aware of this and bring it up with a GP yourself. As prostate cancer often has no symptoms in its earlier stages this is leading to too many men getting a late, incurable diagnosis - like Sir Chris.\"",

      "The news that he had a terminal illness, in September 2023, came \"completely out the blue\".",

      "The NHS advises men to speak to a doctor if they think they are higher risk of prostate cancer. A man's risk of this cancer increases with age.",
      "Cancer Research UK says the evidence so far suggests that routinely screening people using PSA would not greatly help prevent deaths and might instead lead to men having unnecessary treatment that could cause undue stress and potential side effects.",
      "PSA is not diagnostic. A raised PSA level does not necessarily mean there is cancer. It can be elevated with other conditions too, such as inflammation.",
      "If you ask for a PSA test, your doctor may advise you to think carefully about the benefits and disadvantages.",

    "story": [
      "Boris Johnson\u2019s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said.",
      "Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.",
      "Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said.",
      "The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.",
      "Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK.",
      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",
      "In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.",
      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",
      "In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals.",
      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4 m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",
      "Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Top pub and restaurant bosses have warned the chancellor that tax rises in last month's Budget will \"unquestionably\" cause closures and job losses.",
      "In a letter, more than 200 signatories have said the hospitality industry is disproportionately impacted by an \"unsustainable\" hike in the amount employers pay in National Insurance contributions (NICs).",
      "It adds that businesses have \"no capacity to pass the costs onto customers\", which would instead lead to job cuts and closures of smaller firms.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said that her National Insurance changes for businesses will generate \u00a325bn, which would aid funding of public services, such as the NHS.",
      "From April, the rate employers pay in National Insurance will rise from 13.8% to 15%, and the threshold at which they start paying the tax on each employee's salary will be reduced from \u00a39,100 per year to \u00a35,000.",
      "Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the changes had been designed in a way \"that tried to limit the extra cost on small business\".",
      "Signatories of the letter include Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, the bosses of pub firms Fuller's and Stonegate Group, and Premier Inn's owner, Whitbread.",
      "They are supported by a further 209 businesses, together employing tens of thousands of people across the UK.",
      "According to the letter, the cost increases will cause jobs to be \"drastically\" cut and hours to be reduced for workers.",
      "Ms Nicholls told the BBC that firms in the industry facing these \"tough decisions\" may also reconsider investing.",
      "\"We understand that the government has a tough job to do,\" she said, but urged politicians to \"have a rethink\".",
      "Jones said that the government would not reassess the plan, and that many employers would pay the same in NI contributions as they do now, or less.",
      "\"I think the public would recognise that bigger businesses are able to burden some of the contributions that we need to make to the state.",
      "\"Getting the NHS back on its feet so workers who are off sick can get back to work is probably something that we'd say we'd all benefit from,\" he added.",
      "Impact on lower earners",
      "The letter from industry bosses suggests that changes in the NICs threshold are \"regressive in their impact on lower earners and will impact flexible working practices which many older workers and parents rely upon\".",
      "The signatories are calling for the government to consider one of two measures to \"protect businesses who employ low earners\"  to mitigate the impact.",
      "Suggested measures are a new employer NICs band which would apply between \u00a35,000 and \u00a39,100 at a lower rate of 5%, or implementing an exemption for taxpayers working fewer than 20 hours per week.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has calculated that three quarters of the impact of the NI changes will be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "During a select committee hearing on Tuesday, the OBR's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "The changes set out in the Budget are, however, predicted to raise some \u00a325bn a year, making it one of the biggest single tax-raising measures in history.",
      "The chancellor has previously said that she was not immune to \"criticism\" over the move, but has argued that it will put public finances on a \"firm footing\".",
      "The hospitality industry's letter follows on from big British supermarkets such as M&S and Sainsbury's hinting that they may put up prices in a bid to offset higher wage bills.",
      "Sainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts said on Thursday that the NI changes would cost the business around \u00a3140m - a sum which does not include the increases to minimum wage.",
      "The boss of Wetherspoons also said earlier this week that following the Budget, taxes and business costs were \"expected to increase by approximately \u00a360m\".",
      "Its chairman said that he believed many food and drink businesses planned to pass costs on to customers.",

      "UK interest rates could take longer to fall further after the Bank of England forecast that inflation will creep higher after last week's Budget.",
      "The Bank cut interest rates to 4.75% from 5% in a move that had been widely expected.",
      "But it indicated that while the extra spending outlined in the Budget would initially boost growth, measures such as raising the cap on bus fares and VAT on private school fees would push prices up at a faster rate.",
      "Bank governor Andrew Bailey said rates were likely to \"continue to fall gradually from here\u201d, but cautioned they could not be cut \"too quickly or by too much\u201d.",
      "\u201cThe path is downward from here. We\u2019ll see how quickly and by how much. I do emphasise the word gradual and the reason for that is there are a lot of risks out there in the world at large and also domestically,\" he told the BBC.",

      "Given this, the Bank is \"wary of cutting rates further\", Ms Coles said.",

      "The Bank's interest rate heavily influences the rates High Street banks and other money lenders charge customers for loans, as well as credit cards.",
      "More than one million mortgage borrowers on tracker and variable deals are likely to see an immediate fall in their monthly repayments.",

    "title": "What's so wrong with Right To Buy?",
    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 07:43:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The Labour government is expected to make major changes to the Right To Buy scheme launched in the 1980s.",
    "story": [
      "When Harold Wilson was Labour prime minister in the late 1960s, up to a third of people in England lived in a council house or flat.",
      "But by the time Keir Starmer became prime minister in July this year, the proportion of people in England living in social housing had fallen to about 16% of the population \u2013 about four million.",
      "About two million council-built properties have been sold to their tenants at significantly discounted prices under the Right To Buy (RTB) scheme since it was introduced by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government in the early 1980s.",
      "Michael Heseltine described the advent of RTB as \"laying the foundations of one of the most important social revolutions of the century\", but was selling off council houses more cheaply than new ones could be built simply laying the foundations of a housing crisis?",
      "Waiting lists",
      "Historically, money raised from selling off council houses has not gone far towards building new ones - new ones desperately needed, considering about 1.3 million people are on waiting lists for them in England.",
      "Across the north-west of England, for example, about 4,350 council houses have been sold off in the last 10 years, with the money made from the sales going towards building or buying just over 1,400 others, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "While the \u00a3336,612,000 raised from those sales may sound a reasonable sum, it works out on average at about \u00a377,000 per house. And, generally, councils have not been allowed to keep the whole amount, instead having to hand a sizeable chunk back to the government.",
      "About 200,000 people are on waiting lists for social housing in the region.",
      "While housing associations may have built homes, and there may have been schemes funded by cash from other government pots, the fact that the money raised from selling off homes is nowhere near enough to rebuild or buy like-for-like has been a long-standing concern.",
      "And it would seem Labour deputy prime minister and minister for housing Angela Rayner \u2013 who famously bought her own council house in Stockport under RTB \u2013 has taken on board the views of RTB critics.",
      "Rayner has said recently she may impose restrictions so that people who move into newly built council houses will not be able to buy them in the future.",
      "It is a decision that is likely to be welcomed by Labour politicians in regions where the need for social housing is arguably as great as ever, but the amount of it available is very low.",
      "The Labour metro-mayors of both Liverpool and Manchester regions have both said they want to see more social housing built in their regions.",
      "In May, Andy Burnham, leader of Greater Manchester, called on the-then Conservative government to pause RTB on new builds after losing 500 social homes to the scheme in 2022.",
      "He argued that if planned homes could be bought by their tenants, it would be \"like trying to fill a bath without the plug in\".",
      "On Merseyside, virtually all former council housing stock was transferred to housing associations over the last two decades.",
      "But metro mayor Steve Rotheram says registered social landlords (RSLs) have inherited some of the problems that came with RTB.",
      "He says one Merseyside RSL had lost about a third of its homes through sales to tenants in the decade since the housing stock was transferred.",
      "People who are tenants of RSLs can buy their homes under \u201cpreserved\u201d RTB if they lived in their homes when the council owned them.",
      "And once someone has lived in an RSL property for three years, they can apply for the Right To Acquire.",
      "Rotheram says cheaper borrowing rates for RSLs and a moratorium on sales would help boost growth in social housing.",
      "\"You are not going to build a lot of houses for someone to come along in three or four years and buy it below market value,\" he says.",
      "\"How we deal with this is part of our growth plan going to the government, and we are now trying to see if we can work with [Rayner] to come up with proposals.\"",
      "Blackpool Council\u2019s cabinet member for economy and the built environment, Mark Smith, is clear that while the money generated from RTB sales is used to support various investments in housing, the RTB receipts his council receives are \"not sufficient to replace lost social rent housing\".",
      "And he says even with changes such as the government giving councils more flexibility to allow RTB receipts to be used alongside cash from other streams such as funds given by developers who get planning permission for private schemes, there is still some red tape in the way of using different types of funding together to build council housing.",
      "\"We do the best we can within the parameters of the policy as it exists currently but there is always room for improvement,\" he says.",
      "Under the new Labour government policies, councils and housing associations are being given \u201cmore freedom\u201d to decide how to use their RTB money.",
      "Previously, only 50% of the money a council received from a sale could go towards building or buying a new house.",
      "But in future councils will be able to use all that money, and put money received from private developers handed over as part of planning agreements into projects as well.",
      "These deals, known as Section 106 agreements, see developers give money to councils to mitigate any negative impacts their private schemes might have on local communities or housing markets.",
      "Sources within the social housing sector say that in the past the \"policy has never achieved anything like a one-for-one replacement ratio\".",
      "\"If it had then there would be a lot less concern about the policy,\" one says.",
      "\"Yes, a Right To Buy home continues to be a home after it\u2019s sold, but it contributes to a huge loss of social housing stock and contributes to housing waiting lists, or people having to live in unsuitable accommodation.\"",
      "'Serious shortage'",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, says there is a \"serious housing shortage in this country\" and \"record numbers of people living in temporary accommodation\".",
      "Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, says: \u201cWhile the Right To Buy can and has delivered home ownership for many the scheme in its current form does not work.",
      "\"Rising discounts, alongside other measures that restrict councils\u2019 use of Right To Buy receipts, mean that the money raised from the sale of property is usually not sufficient to cover the building costs of replacing the property.",
      "\"We have long called for the removal of rules and restrictions which disincentivise local authorities from building social homes, at risk of losing them.",
      "\"Councils must be given the control, power and flexibility to use receipt monies in a way that works best for their local areas, which includes retaining 100 per cent of the receipts permanently.\"",
      "'Scandal'",
      "In 2012, the Conservative-led government increased the discount a tenant could receive when buying their home.",
      "Since coming to power, Labour has said the discount will be reduced to between \u00a316,000 and \u00a338,000, depending on the location \u2013 a significant reduction from the \u00a3136,000 discount currently available in London and the discount of just over \u00a3100,000 elsewhere.",
      "Rayner, who bought her Stockport council house under a RTB discount in 2007 and sold it several years later for \u00a348,000 more than she paid for it, said she wanted to see a \u201cfairer\u201d system.",
      "Her department says it is a \"scandal\" that only about one third of homes lost to RTB have been replaced since 2012, and that it was \"working at pace to reverse the continued decline of social rented homes\".",
      "But while the government stresses there are \"no plans to abolish the RTB\", the \"social revolution\" Lord Heseltine heralded nearly 45 years ago is clearly facing a radical change to everything but its name.",

      "Donald Trump is a lot less willing than the current president to pay for other countries\u2019 defence.",

      "So Trump's return puts this question right to the top of the list.",

      "But there\u2019s a defence review underway, and a spending review of every penny spent in Whitehall to get through first.",
      "They\u2019re expected to come one after the other, next spring.",
      "John Healey, the defence secretary, was granted an extra \u00a33bn in the Budget, which is a chunky sum of money - but in terms of defence spending, not a transformative amount of cash.",
      "And it\u2019s only a top-up for a year, with no certainty over long-term funding.",
      "A former minister said: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to order for the years ahead - how long can we be talking, when the need is now?\u201d",
      "The government will not say when they expect to hit the 2.5% target - and won\u2019t commit to hitting it before the end of the Parliament in 2029 - causing frustration in some quarters.",

      "And earlier on the Today programme, former Defence Secretary Ben Wallace accused Labour of making an effective \u201ccut in our defence budget\u201d by including \u00a33bn of Ukraine funding in it.",
      "If Labour reach the 2.5% target, he said he\u2019d welcome it, \u201cbut it\u2019s got to be real money with a timetable\u201d.",
      "There is little disagreement that more resources are needed.",
      "John Healey himself has acknowledged the military \u201chave not been ready to fight\u201d. A squeeze on funding over many years had made money tight \u2013 the forces \u201chollowed out\u201d, according to Wallace.",

      "According to the National Audit Office, the UK has committed nearly \u00a38 billion to Ukraine - air defence missiles, drones, cruise missiles, tanks and ships, as well as clothing and personal equipment.",
      "Another former minister told me that funding \u201cis absolutely urgent \u2013 it is urgent to help Ukraine but the most urgent is where our forces are in danger \u2013 it\u2019s not hypothetical, in the Red Sea the Houthis are firing at our ships.\u201d",
      "And shortly before the election, the government\u2019s new national security adviser Jonathan Powell wrote that a new administration would need to reinforce the UK\u2019s defence and security \u201cwithin the bounds allowed by a struggling economy\u201d.",
      "Some insiders argue rising threats around the world mean the UK should spend way more than 2.5% in any case.",
      "Another former minister told me, \u201cby any measure we are underspending \u2013 if you don\u2019t buy the insurance policy you end up having to pay yourself and the cost of real conflicts would be immense in comparison\u201d.",
      "A defence source told me, \u201cwe are going to have to make a move on spending or we can put our fingers in our ears and hope we get through it \u2013 the Treasury has to do the maths on this \u2013 the way to stop spending 5 percent of GDP in the future is to spend now.\u201d",
      "How it's spent",
      "But it\u2019s not just about how much money goes to defence - it\u2019s also about how it\u2019s spent.",

      "Power era",

      "Twenty-three now meet the 2% target, up from just six countries in 2021.",
      "Rather than worrying about what Trump might do in office, they said, \u201ca precondition for Trump to take European defence seriously is for Europe to take its own defence seriously.\u201d",

    "summary": "David Lammy is on his first visit to the continent since he became foreign secretary.",
    "story": [
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy is coming to the end of his maiden tour of Africa with the aim of resetting relations with the 54-nation continent.",
      "\"Our new approach will deliver respectful partnerships that listen rather than tell, deliver long-term growth rather than short-term solutions and build a freer, safer, more prosperous continent,\" he said as he set out the agenda for his trip to the continent's two biggest powers - Nigeria and South Africa.",
      "Lammy's visit follows his appointment as foreign secretary in the Labour government that took office earlier this year.",
      "Since Labour was last in office in 2010, relations between African states and other world powers have changed massively.",
      "Today, China is the largest trade partner for many African countries, while Russia has increasingly made inroads, including by offering military support to West African states battling jihadists.",
      "Oil-rich Gulf nations, along with Turkey,  have also been increasing their influence on the continent by striking business and military deals.",
      "In contrast, UK-Africa relations have been \"a lot more lacklustre\", says Alex Vines, the head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "This is particularly the case between the UK and its  biggest trading partner on the continent, South Africa, and the trip is an \"attempt to reboot that\", he adds.",
      "\"I want to hear what our African partners need and foster relationships so that the UK and our friends and partners in Africa can grow together,\" Lammy said.",
      "Britain is no newcomer to the continent. A long \u2013 and at times chequered \u2013 history underpins many of its relationships with African countries.",
      "Almost all its former colonies on the continent are part of the Commonwealth, although countries that did not have this historical link to the UK have joined the group, including Rwanda, Togo and Gabon. Angola has also applied to join.",
      "\"The Commonwealth will likely continue to be a key platform,\" says Nicole Beardsworth, an academic at South Africa's Wits University.",
      "As its former colonies gained independence in the middle of the last century, Britain continued to play a sort of \"big brother\" role.",
      "But this is now changing.",
      "Dr Vines says Africa did not feature significantly in a major document released last year to outline the UK's priorities on the global stage.",
      "\"There were name checks to countries like Nigeria and South Africa and Kenya in it, but there wasn't much written,\" he says.",
      "Dr Vines adds that he expects South Africa-UK relations to improve under Labour because of its historic ties with the anti-apartheid movement that fought white-minority rule.",
      "\"That comes from the anti-apartheid struggle and the solidarity that Labour and people that were the Labour movement provided for combating apartheid,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth, however, notes that former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May tried to bolster ties with Africa, but her efforts were \"scuppered\" after she resigned in 2019 following turmoil in the then governing party.",
      "The UK then had an unprecedented turnover of prime ministers who had to deal with domestic crises, the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, and the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"Africa fell off the radar,\" Dr Beardsworth says, adding that the exception was the controversial, and now-scrapped, deal to send some asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda.",
      "Being the world\u2019s youngest continent \u2013 with a median age of 19 \u2013 Africa presents opportunities for the future, the UK Foreign Office said.",
      "\"Africa has huge growth potential, with the continent on track to make up 25% of the world\u2019s population by 2050,\" read a statement from the office.",
      "With an ageing population in the UK - as with much of the developed world - Dr Vines says that the sharing of skills will increase.",
      "He adds that migration is an \"emotive and complicated issue\", but the UK and other Western nations should avoid \"cherry-picking the best and corroding African states from being successful themselves\".",
      "The UK Foreign Office said that \"growth is the core mission of this government and will underpin our relationships in Nigeria, South Africa and beyond\".",
      "That will mean \"more jobs and more opportunities for Brits and Africans alike,\" it added.",
      "The UK's Africa policy has long focused on development aid, but this has been slashed in recent years as the country faces its own economic crisis.",
      "Dr Vines says aid can be important to deal with humanitarian crises, climate shocks and to finance projects aimed at expanding the private sector in Africa, but he does not see the Labour government increasing funding.",
      "\"When you had a previous Labour government under Tony Blair, Britain saw itself as a global superpower for international development - that\u2019s no longer the case,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth says relations are expected to move towards being more economically focused, and \"much more mutually beneficial\".",
      "She says this could also see the normalisation of the UK's relations with Zimbabwe and Harare being welcomed back to the Commonwealth after relations broke down during the rule of the late Robert Mugabe.",
      "Differences over international affairs such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could also play out less in the public.",
      "South Africa\u2019s position on both conflicts has been at odds with much of the West.",
      "But South African analyst Yanga Molotana does not see this as a major problem.",
      "\"Two things can exist at the same time - I can still hold my position, I can still hold my views, and we can still have a mutually beneficial relationship without the moral pressure of you saying that I have to agree with everything that you say,\" she adds.",
      "Dr Vines agrees, saying he expects the UK to continue promoting multi-party democracy in Africa, but there will be \"less finger-wagging, and more quiet diplomacy\".",
      "\"The concern is probably going to be more regularly raised in private,\" he says.",

    "summary": "The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the sterile worlds scientists have long thought.",
    "story": [
      "The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the dead sterile worlds that scientists have long thought.",
      "Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say.",
      "Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasa\u2019s Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago.",
      "But a new analysis shows that Voyager's visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like.",
      "Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds \u2013 as if it had been knocked over \u2013 making it arguably the weirdest.",
      "We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons.",
      "But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought.",
      "The measurements from the spacecraft\u2019s instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranus\u2019s protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun.",
      "A planet\u2019s magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive.",
      "This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar system\u2019s other planets and their moons.",
      "But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day.",
      "The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field.",
      "So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London.",
      "\u201cThese results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans that below the surface that could be teeming with fish!\u201d.",
      "Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have been published in the Journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\u201cThe results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system,\u201d she told BBC News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. It\u2019s amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries\u201d.",
      "Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as \u201cvery exciting\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions\u201d.",
      "Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research.",
      "It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years\u2019 time.",
      "According to Nasa\u2019s Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey.",
      "\u201cSome of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries\u201d.",
      "Nasa\u2019s Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life."

    "summary": "Britain's oldest satellite is in the wrong part of the sky, but no-one's really sure who moved it.",
    "story": [
      "Someone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why.",
      "Launched in 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces.",
      "When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean.",
      "But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas.",
      "Orbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location.",
      "Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose?",
      "It's intriguing that key information about a once vital national security asset can just evaporate. But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we're talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago.",
      "\"It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,\" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves.",
      "\"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.",
      "\"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.",
      "Dr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft.",
      "It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise.",
      "But there's no connection other than the name and, in any case, real life is always more prosaic.",

      "MoD contracts Airbus for Skynet telecoms satellite",
      "How do we solve the problem of space debris?",
      "What we do know is that Skynet-1A was manufactured in the US by the now defunct Philco Ford aerospace company and put in space by a US Air Force Delta rocket.",
      "\"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation.",
      "This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire.",
      "\"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me.",
      "\"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.",
      "Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives.",
      "Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility.",
      "\"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?\u201d Ms Hill speculated.",
      "The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A\u2019s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977.",
      "But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an \"orbital graveyard\".",
      "This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites.",
      "Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.",
      "Attitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested.",
      "At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day.",
      "That might sound like they\u2019re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it\u2019s starting to get a little too close for comfort.",
      "The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there's likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.",
      "Ultimately, though, the British government may have to think about removing the old satellite to a safer location.",
      "Technologies are being developed to grab junk left in space.",
      "Already, the UK Space Agency is funding efforts to do this at lower altitudes, and the Americans and the Chinese have shown it's possible to snare ageing hardware even in the kind of high orbit occupied by Skynet-1A.",
      "\"Pieces of space junk are like ticking time bombs,\" observed Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.",

      "\"There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,\" Soltanov says on the recording. \"Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.\"",
      "Soltanov then described natural gas as a \"transitional fuel\", adding: \"We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps forever.\"",
      "The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear that \"developing\u2026 new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C\".",

      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",
      "Many scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain.",
      "\"We will watch with interest what happens going into 2025 and beyond,\" says Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.",
      "But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set.",
      "\"The warmer temperatures [are making] storms more intense, heatwaves hotter and heavy rainfall more extreme, with clearly seen consequences for people all around the world,\" says Prof Hawkins.",
      "\"Stabilising global temperatures by reaching net zero emissions is the only way to stop adding to the costs of these disasters.\"",

      "While climate change did not play much of a role in this year's campaign, Trump's likely actions in office this time could be far more significant than in 2017.",
      "Back then, he announced the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the most important UN process to tackle climate change.  The agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.",
      "But the shock of Trump's decision was limited. The treaty's rules meant the US was not able to withdraw until November 2020, a few months before he left office.",
      "If Trump withdraws again, he will only have to wait a year before the US is completely out. That would give him three years to chart his own course without any need to report to the UN or be bound by its rules.",

      "\"They can't commit to anything and that means that countries like China will not want to commit to anything.\"",
      "In recent years, richer countries such as the US, UK and EU states have tried to increase the funds available for developing countries to cope with climate change. But they also insist that big developing economies also contribute.",
      "\"The US basically wanted to have China cough up some money for that fund as well. Now they won't be able to do that. That leaves China off the hook,\" Prof Klein said.",
      "Climate scientists say developing countries need billions of dollars of extra investment to become net zero, where they are not contributing to climate change, and stave off the effects of rising temperatures.",
      "While the US might leave the Paris Agreement quite quickly, Trump would still be bound by other global efforts to fight climate change.",
      "There have been reports that some of his supporters also want to turn their backs on these as well. Some have argued for a complete break from UN efforts on climate change, urging the president-elect to leave something called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that underpins global collective action to tackle climate change.",

    "summary": "The Northern Taurids are at their peak on 11-12 November - but will the clouds part to let us see them?",
    "story": [
      "Shooting stars may be spotted tonight as the Northern Taurid meteor shower peaks",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Sky watchers will be looking out for the Northern Taurids meteor shower which will peak overnight on Monday (11-12 November).",
      "The meteors can be seen from virtually anywhere on Earth but sightings will be affected by the phase of the Moon and the weather conditions.",
      "These showers, known for their slow-moving, long-lasting meteors, are linked to Comet Encke.",
      "There are two streams to the Taurids with the Southern Taurids having peaked earlier in the month.",
      "What is the Taurid meteor shower?",
      "The Taurid meteor shower is caused by the debris - ice and dust - from Comet Encke as it passes through our solar system.",
      "Each time Encke returns to the inner solar system, its nucleus sheds ice and rock into space into a vast debris stream. When Earth passes through this debris the \"comet crumbs\" heat up as they enter our atmosphere and burn up in bright bursts of light.",
      "Taurid meteors tend to be larger than other meteors and can survive for longer periods as they pass through Earth's atmosphere. They also travel relatively slowly, crossing the sky at about 17 miles (27km) per second. This is about half the speed of the Perseids.",
      "A recent theory as to why Encke has such a large debris stream is that it was once part of a larger comet that broke up about 20,000 years ago. It has the shortest orbital period of any known comet within our solar system, taking just 3.3 years to orbit the Sun.",
      "When is the peak?",
      "Encke's debris stream is so large and spread out that it takes Earth a rather long time to pass through it. This is why we experience two separate parts to the shower - the Southern Taurids and the Northern Taurids.",
      "The Southern Taurids run from about 23 September to 12 November and peaked earlier this month. Northern Taurids stem from a nearby but slightly different stream and are active from about 13 October to 2 December, peaking around 11-12 November.",
      "The Taurids are not very prolific, tending to produce only five meteors per hour but they can be very bright. The showers sometimes produce fireballs \u2013 a perfect target for astrophotography.",
      "There seems to be a seven-year cycle with these fireballs. There were lots of sightings of them in 2022 and the next best opportunity may be in 2029.",
      "How do I watch?",
      "You do not need any equipment such as telescopes or binoculars as the secret is to take in as much sky as possible and allow about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark.",
      "The best time to view is around midnight when the shower's radiant (the spot in the sky from which the meteors appear to emanate), the Taurus constellation, is high in the sky.",
      "To find Taurus, look for the constellation Orion and then peer to the north-east to find the red star Aldebaran, the star in the bull's eye. Shooting stars will be visible all over the night sky so move your gaze around the nearby constellations.",
      "Skies have been clearing over the past 24 hours, leading to improved viewing conditions.",
      "Will I be able to see them?",
      "Viewing the Taurids may be affected by the illumination of the Moon, which could obscure some of the fainter meteors. The Moon will be in a waxing gibbous phase \u2013 going from half moon to full moon.",
      "However, the weather is looking much more favourable for stargazing now. The recent blanket of cloud we have had for several weeks has moved off, leaving a clearer air mass and a much better view of the night sky.",
      "Fog patches may obscure the sky for some - especially across southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, north-west England and north Wales. Any fog will tend to sit in the valleys though, so head for higher ground in these regions to have a better chance of spotting some spectacular shooting stars.",
      "If you do miss this meteor shower you won't have long to wait until the next one, as the Leonid meteor shower is expected to peak next week on the morning of 18 November.",

      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",

There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

    "summary": "Start-up firms are looking for ways to dye clothes using less water and heat.",
    "story": [
      "In a small corner of rural Taiwan, set amongst other dye houses and small factories, the start-up Alchemie Technology is in the final phase of rolling out a project it claims will upend the global apparel industry and slash its carbon footprint.",
      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",
      "And that\u2019s just one company - there will be many, many more in need.",

      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "Leaders from nearly 100 countries will address the meeting in the coming days.",
      "COP29 had been billed as an opportunity to solve the crucial issue of getting money to poorer countries to help them deal with the impacts of climate change and help them prepare for it.",
      "But expectations for what the summit can achieve have been lowered by a Trump victory that makes Biden administration negotiators from one of the world's largest carbon emitters a lame duck in this process and unable to really promise much.",
      "However, the election wasn\u2019t the end of the struggle, Mr Podesta told reporters.",
      "He believed that as a result of the policies put in place by President Biden and with the support of states and cities, US emissions would continue their downward trajectory, albeit at a slower pace.",
      "\u201cThe fight is bigger than one election, one political cycle and one country. This fight is bigger still because we are living through a year defined by the climate crisis in every country of the world.\"",
      "As evidence that countries will continue to make progress on the issue, in the absence of leadership from the US, delegates signed off the final and most controversial component of the Paris climate agreement late on the first night of COP29.",
      "It means that a global 'carbon market' can now been established, allowing richer nations to pay for projects in developing nations that reduce emissions and use this to meet their climate obligations. Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas released by human activities.",
      "This proposal is very attractive to richer countries in Europe as it is far cheaper to pay for a wind farm somewhere in Africa, for example, than to subsidise heat pumps at home.",
      "Agreed over this had proved very tricky. There have been concerns about fraud and whether the carbon removals are real and permanent.",
      "And despite it being passed some of those concerns remain, but supporters say it could unleash a flurry of market activity, worth up to $250bn a year flowing from rich to poor.",
      "As a reminder to negotiators of the urgency of the situation there was fresh scientific gloom. The UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said in a report released to coincide with the conference's start, that 2024 is on track to be the world\u2019s warmest year on record.",
      "Its latest State of the Climate report also finds that our oceans are heating up rapidly and glacier melt is accelerating.",
      "\u201cWe are on the road to ruin,\u201d Mukhtar Babyaev, president of COP29 said in his opening remarks.",
      "He went on to list examples of climate impacts now around the world, saying \u201cthese are not future problems\u201d as rising temperatures were doing huge damage around the world right now.",

      "The mood of delegates wasn't improved by the scale of the main task facing negotiators here.",
      "Amid energy and economic crises, developed countries are expected to find billions extra in climate finance for developing nations.",
      "Richer countries are willing to increase their contributions, as long as major emerging economies like China and the Gulf states also chip in.",
      "UN climate change chief Simon Stiell said that two thirds of the world cannot afford to cut emissions quickly enough to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold alive.",
      "If they didn\u2019t get the cash to cut their carbon, everyone suffers, he said.",

      "One issue exercising the minds and pockets of attendees at this gathering is the price of food and drink in the conference centre",

      "\"It\u2019s like they are taking money from our pockets,\" one delegate told BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt as he was queuing up for food.",
      "This is a serious issue. Delegates from poorer nations often complain about how much these big conferences cost them when you add in flights and hotels and the total can come to many thousands of pounds."

      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has won a run-off vote in parliament to stay in his post, after an election setback last month that saw his coalition lose its majority in the lower house.",
      "Ishiba, 67, took over as prime minister from Fumio Kishida, who stepped down in September amid a series of scandals that rattled public trust in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) party.",
      "In an extraordinary parliament session on Monday, Ishiba defeated Yoshihiko Noda, the leader of the main opposition party Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan.",
      "Ishiba will now have to navigate hostilities within his party, economic woes and a period of flux in international relations.",
      "As the leader of a minority government, he also faces the challenge of having to heed to demands from the opposition bloc for any future bills or budget to pass -  with fears of potential political gridlock in a hung parliament.",
      "A former defence minister, Ishiba gained a reputation in Japanese politics for being openly critical of figures in his party, including Kishida and Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader Shinzo Abe. That reputation scored him points among voters, even as it ruffled feathers within his own party.",
      "Ishiba was named the leader of Japan\u2019s ruling LDP - and consequently the country\u2019s prime minister - on 1 October, following a tight race among LDP candidates.",
      "Days after taking office, he called a snap election for the parliament\u2019s lower house in an attempt to consolidate his mandate. The election gamble failed, however, as the LDP lost its parliamentary majority in its worst result in over a decade.",
      "\"The Japanese people expressed their strong desire for the LDP to do some reflection and become a party that acts in line with the people's will,\" Ishiba told national broadcaster NHK after that election.",
      "Ishiba's cabinet will mostly remain the same, but the members who have lost their seats in the election will be replaced.",
      "The long-ruling party has become increasingly unpopular as Japan finds itself in the throes of economic challenges including soaring inflation, a sluggish economy and a weak yen.",
      "In recent years, the LDP has also come under scrutiny over political scandals including its ties to the controversial Unification Church and allegations that its politicians had concealed millions of dollars in fundraiser donations. When Kishida announced in August that he would step down as prime minister, he cited both cases as reasons for the party\u2019s crisis of trust.",
      "Ishiba faces another challenge on the foreign policy front, as Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election could mean more of his protectionist policies and potential new trade tariffs, especially on Japanese steel.",
      "Ishiba previously vowed to reform the LDP, revive the economy and double defence spending. He had also voiced support for socially liberal policies, including marriage equality and allowing couples to have separate surnames - though he has since called for further discussion on the issues, in line with the LDP's more conservative stance.",

      "\u201cAmerica continues to be the beacon of the world, but we expect and must demand that our friends and allies be strong partners in the peace we seek,\" Stefanik added in a statement given to the New York Post.",
      "The New York Congresswoman has minimal experience in foreign policy and national security. She has served on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.",
      "Since Hamas's 7 October attack, she has become one of the most outspoken supporters of Israel in Congress, garnering national attention as she led congressional hearings about university presidents' handling of protests on college campuses.",

      "Soon after, she entered politics, serving as a White House domestic policy adviser under President George W Bush and eventually becoming a senior aide to Bush chief of staff Joshua Bolten.",
      "Stefanik later became a top campaign adviser for Paul Ryan when he ran for vice-president alongside Mitt Romney. When Romney lost, the then-30-year-old moved back to upstate New York and ran for Congress, flipping a Democratic-controlled seat with a win by over 20 points.",
      "Stefanik once billed herself to voters as a traditional conservative, but emerged as  one of Trump's most ardent defenders during the first impeachment trial against him in 2019. Her support for Trump has not wavered since.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud to be a top surrogate,\u201d Stefanik said earlier this year of her support for the president-elect. \u201cI would proudly serve in a future Trump administration.\u201d",
      "Her appointment would leave open the 21st Congressional District seat in New York, which would lead to a special election.",

While Joe Biden, with his working-class-friendly reputation built over half a century, won enough back to take the White House in 2020, his success proved to be only a temporary reprieve.",

      "Why Latinos flocked to Trump's coalition",
      "This year, Trump supplemented his gains with the blue-collar workers by also cutting into the Democratic margins among young, Latino and black voters. He has carved up the coalition of the ascendant.",

      "- 13% of the black vote in 2024 compared to Republican John McCain\u2019s 4% against Obama",
      "- 46% of the Latino vote this time, while McCain got 31% in 2008",

      "This week, Trump became the first Republican since 1988 to win that heavily Latino county in Florida. He also won Starr County in south Texas, with its 97% Latino population, with 57% of the vote. In 2008, only 15% of the county voted for McCain, the Republican.",
      "Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican strategist who specialises in Latino voting trends, told the BBC that the problem with \u201cdemography is destiny\u201d was that it risked treating all non-white Americans as an \u201caggrieved racial minority\u201d. \u201cBut that is not and nor has it ever been the way Latinos have viewed themselves,\u201d he added.",

He said he agreed with Republicans on some things and felt Democratic politicians took black voters for granted.",
      "With some states still tabulating their results, Trump currently has improved on his electoral margins in at least 2,367 US counties, while slipping in just 240.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just the number of counties that Trump won that made a difference, either. Kamala Harris needed to post significant margins in the cities to offset Republican strength in rural areas. She consistently fell short.",
      "In Detroit\u2019s Wayne County, for example, which the latest US Census reports is 38% black, Harris won 63% of the vote \u2013 significantly lower than Joe Biden\u2019s 68% in 2020 and Obama\u2019s 74% in 2008.",
      "Polls consistently suggested that the economy, along with immigration, were the two issues of highest importance to voters - and where polls indicated Trump had an advantage over Harris.",
      "His economic message cut across racial divides.",

      "Left-wing Senator Bernie Sanders, who twice ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, also criticised identity politics and accused the party of abandoning working-class voters.",
      "Some centrist Democrats, meanwhile, have argued that the struggle to connect with voters goes beyond the economy and immigration. They point to how the Trump campaign was also able to use a cultural message as a wedge to fracture the Democratic coalition.",

      "Who's in the frame to join Trump's new top team?",
      "Among the positions that Republicans targeted in this year\u2019s election were calls to shift funding away from law enforcement, decriminalise undocumented border-crossings and minor crimes like shoplifting, and provide greater protections for transgender Americans.",
      "Many arose after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the resulting rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as other efforts to advance social justice and acknowledge darker parts of American history.",
      "Within a few years, however, some of those positions proved a liability for Democrats when trying to win over persuadable voters and keep their coalition from fraying. Harris, for example, backed away from some positions she\u2019d taken when she first ran for president in 2019.",
      "In the last month of the presidential campaign, the Trump team made the vice-president\u2019s past support for taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for federal prisoners and detained immigrants a central focus.",
      "One advert ended with the line: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d",
      "The Trump campaign spent more than $21m on transgender issue ads in the first half of October \u2013 about a third of their entire advertising expenditures and nearly double what they spent on spots on immigration and inflation, according to data compiled by AdImpact.",
      "It\u2019s the kind of investment a campaign makes if it has hard data showing an advert is moving public opinion.",
      "After Trump\u2019s convincing win, Congressman Seth Moulton, a moderate from Massachusetts, said his party needed to rethink its approach on cultural issues.",
      "\u201cDemocrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,\u201d Moulton told the New York Times. \u201cI have two little girls, I don\u2019t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I\u2019m supposed to be afraid to say that.\u201d",
      "Progressive Democrats, meanwhile, reject that characterisation, and argue that standing up for the rights of minorities has always been a core value of the party. Congressman John Moran wrote on X in response: \"You should find another job if you want to use an election loss as an opportunity to pick on our most vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Mike Madrid, the political strategist, has a brutal assessment of where the Democratic coalition is today.",
      "\u201cThe Democratic Party was predicated on what really is an unholy alliance between working-class people of colour and wealthier white progressives driven and animated by cultural issues,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cThe only glue holding that coalition together was anti-Republicanism.\u201d",
      "Once that glue came unstuck, he said, the party was ripe for defeat.",
      "Future elections are sure to be held in a friendlier political environment for Democrats. And Trump, who has shown a unique ability to attract new and low-propensity voters to the polls, has run his last campaign.",
      "But 2024\u2019s results will provide plenty of fuel for Democratic angst in the days to come.",
      "The Harris campaign itself believes she lost to Trump because she was facing a restive public angry over the economic and social turbulence in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic.",
      "\u201cYou stared down unprecedented headwinds and obstacles that were largely out of our control,\u201d campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote in a letter to her staff. \u201cThe whole country moved to the right, but compared to the rest of the country, the battleground states saw the least amount of movement in his direction.

But when he spoke to the BBC this week, he was not so convinced the Democrats had delivered when in power - or that their message today connected with Americans like him.",

      "Justice Juan Merchan will decide by Tuesday whether to grant Trump\u2019s pre-election request to throw out his conviction. Should Justice Merchan side with Trump, it would almost wipe clean his slate of criminal woes.",
      "But should the judge uphold the conviction, he would proceed to sentencing later this month. It would likely spark even more delay attempts from Trump and open up an unprecedented new front for America\u2019s criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cThis is truly uncharted territory,\u201d said Anna Cominsky, a professor at the New York Law School.",
      "Will Trump\u2019s case get thrown out?",
      "In May, a New York jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records. The convictions stemmed from Trump\u2019s attempt to cover up reimbursements to his ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, who in 2016 paid off an adult film star to remain silent about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers argue that a recent US Supreme Court ruling granting presidents a degree of immunity from criminal prosecution applies to certain aspects of his New York case, and therefore the indictment and conviction should be tossed.",
      "During the trial, Justice Merchan dismissed attempts by Trump\u2019s lawyers to throw out the case on immunity grounds. But that was before the US Supreme Court ruled in Trump\u2019s favour this summer \u2013 and before Trump decisively won re-election.",

      "Because Trump will be tied up with a presidential transition and the legal questions about sentencing a president are so complex, some scholars see very little chance it will stay on the calendar.",
      "\u201cI think the most likely outcome in the state case is the judge putting off sentencing until after Trump's term in office,\u201d said Daniel Charles Richman, a professor at Columbia Law School.",

      "Under the law, Trump faces a range of sentences, including fines, probation and up to four years in prison. But many options are rendered impractical by his imminent return to the White House.",
      "\u201cSentencing a sitting president may be one of the most complicated, fraught sentencing decisions you can imagine,\u201d Ms Cominsky said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine what sentence could be imposed that would not impede a president\u2019s ability to do their job or compromise the president\u2019s security.\"",

    "summary": "The mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would face legal and practical challenges - and cost billions.",
    "story": [
      "US President-elect Donald Trump has doubled down on his campaign promise of the mass deportation of illegal immigrants, saying the cost of doing so will not be a deterrent.",
      "In some of his first public remarks since winning the election, Trump said his priority upon taking office in January would be to make the border \u201cstrong and powerful\".",
      "\"It\u2019s not a question of a price tag. It\u2019s not - really, we have no choice,\" Trump told NBC News.",
      "But how would Trump\u2019s campaign pledge of mass deportations of migrants actually work and what are the hurdles he may face?",
      "What are the legal challenges?",
      "The latest figures from the Department of Homeland Security and Pew Research indicate that there are around 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US, a number that has remained relatively stable since 2005.",
      "Most are long-term residents - nearly four-fifths have been in the country for more than a decade.",
      "Immigrants who are in the country without legal status have the right to due process, including a court hearing before their removal. A drastic increase in deportations would likely entail a large expansion in the immigration court system, which has been beset by backlogs.",
      "Most immigrants already in the country enter into the deportation system not through encounters with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents but through local law enforcement.",
      "However, many of the country\u2019s largest cities and counties have passed laws restricting local police co-operation with Ice.",
      "Trump has pledged to take action against these \u201csanctuary cities\u201d, but America\u2019s patchwork of local, state and federal laws further complicates the picture.",

      "These are the seven things Trump says he will do as president",
      "Analysis - Why Kamala Harris lost",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, or MPI, said that co-operation between Ice and local officials would be a \"critical\" aspect of any mass deportation programme.",
      "\"It's much easier for Ice to pick someone up from a jail if local law enforcement co-operates, instead of having to go look for them,\" she said.",
      "As an example, Ms Bush-Joseph pointed to an early August declaration from the sheriff's offices of Florida's Broward and Palm Beach counties, in which they said they would not deploy deputies to help any mass deportation plan.",
      "\"There are many others who would not co-operate with a Trump mass deportation plan,\" she said. \"That makes it so much harder.\"",
      "Any mass deportation programme is also likely to be almost immediately met with a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists.",
      "A 2022 Supreme Court ruling, however, means that courts cannot issue injunctions on immigration enforcement policies - meaning they would continue even as the challenges work their way through the legal system.",
      "But can it be done, logistically?",
      "If a US administration was able to legally move ahead with plans for mass deportations, authorities would still have to contend with enormous logistical challenges.",
      "During the Biden administration, deportation efforts have focused on migrants recently detained at the border. Migrants deported from further inland in the US, from areas not located near the border, are, overwhelmingly, those with criminal histories or deemed national security threats.",
      "Controversial raids on worksites that were carried out during the Trump administration were suspended in 2021.",
      "Deportations of people arrested in the US interior - as opposed to those at the border - have hovered at below 100,000 for a decade, after peaking at over 230,000 during the early years of the Obama administration.",
      "\"To raise that, in a single year, up to a million would require a massive infusion of resources that likely don't exist,\" Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council, told the BBC.",
      "For one, experts are doubtful that Ice's 20,000 agents and support personnel would be enough to find and track down even a fraction of the figures being touted by the Trump campaign.",
      "Mr Reichlin-Melnick added that the deportation process is long and complicated and only begins with the identification and arrest of an undocumented migrant.",
      "After that, detainees would need to be housed or placed on an \"alternative to detention\" programme before they are brought before an immigration judge, in a system with a years-long backlog.",
      "Only then are detainees removed from the US, a process that requires diplomatic co-operation from the receiving country.",
      "\"In each of those areas, Ice simply does not have the capacity to process millions of people,\" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said.",
      "Trump has said he would involve the National Guard or other US military forces to help with deportations.",
      "Historically, the US military's role in immigration matters has been limited to support functions at the US-Mexico border.",
      "Aside from the use of the military and \"using local law enforcement\", Trump has offered few specifics on how such a mass deportation plan could be carried out.",
      "In an interview with Time magazine earlier this year, the former president said only that he would \"not rule out\" building new migrant detention facilities, and that he would move to give police immunity from prosecution from \"the liberal groups or the progressive groups\".",
      "He added that there could also be incentives for state and local police departments to participate, and that those who do not \"won't partake in the riches\".",
      "\"We have to do this,\" he said. \"This is not a sustainable problem for our country.\"",
      "Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA - an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls - said that any deportation programme from the interior would only be effective if coupled with increased border enforcement.",
      "\"That has to be the priority. You're going to make very little progress in the interior if that's not the case,\" he said. \"That's what keeps people showing up.\"",
      "Additionally, Mr Ruark said that a crackdown on companies that hire undocumented migrants would also be necessary.",
      "\"They're coming for jobs,\" he said. \"And they're getting those jobs because interior enforcement has basically been dismantled.\"",
      "The financial and political costs",
      "Experts estimate that the total bill for one million or more deportations would run into tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars.",
      "The Ice budget for transportation and deportation in 2023 was $420m (\u00a3327m). In that year the agency deported slightly more than 140,000 people.",
      "Thousands of immigrants would be detained while awaiting court hearings or deportations, and the Trump campaign has envisioned building large encampments to house them all.",
      "The number of removal flights would also need to be dramatically expanded, possibly requiring military aircraft to augment current capacity.",
      "Just a small expansion in any of these areas could result in significant costs.",
      "\"Even a minor change is in the tens of millions, or hundreds of millions,\" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said. \"A significant change is in the tens or hundreds of millions.\"",
      "Those costs would be in addition to the expense of other border enforcement efforts that Trump has promised: continuing work on a southern US border wall, a naval blockade to prevent fentanyl entering the country, and moving thousands of troops to the border.",
      "Adam Isacson, a migration and border expert from the Washington Office on Latin America, said that \"nightmarish images\" of mass deportations could also cost a potential Trump administration politically from a public relations standpoint.",
      "\"Every community in the US would see people they know and love put on buses,\" Mr Isacson said.",
      "\"You'd have some very painful images on TV of crying children, and families,\" he added. \"All of that is incredibly bad press. It's family separation, but on steroids.\"",
      "Have mass deportations happened before?",
      "Under the four years of the previous Trump administration, around 1.5 million people were deported, both from the border and the US interior.",
      "The Biden administration - which had deported about 1.1 million people up to February 2024 - is on track to match that, statistics show.",
      "During the two terms of the Obama administration - when Mr Biden was vice-president - more than three million people were deported, leading some immigration reform advocates to dub Barack Obama the \"deporter-in-chief\".",
      "The only historical comparison to a mass deportation programme came in 1954, when as many as 1.3 million people were deported as part of Operation Wetback, named after a derogatory slur then commonly used against Mexican people.",
      "That figure is disputed by historians, however.",
      "The programme, under President Dwight Eisenhower, ran into considerable public opposition - partly because some US citizens were also deported - as well as a lack of funding. It was largely discontinued by 1955.",
      "Immigration experts say that the earlier operation's focus on Mexican nationals and lack of due process makes it incomparable to what a modern-day mass deportation programme would look like.",
      "\"Those [deported in the 1950s] were single, Mexican men,\" said MPI's Kathleen Bush-Joseph.",
      "\"Now, the vast majority of people coming between ports of entry are from places that are not Mexico, or even northern Central America. It makes it so much harder to return them,\" she added.",
      "\"Those are not comparable situations.\"",

      "Trump\u2019s record in office is a mixed one when it comes to the Middle East.",
      "On the one hand he pleased Israel and upset the Arab world by recognising Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital as well as Israel\u2019s annexation of the occupied Golan Heights. But he also secured the Abraham Accords in 2020 which saw the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco establish full diplomatic relations with Israel and Sudan agree to do so.",
      "Trump was, and is, hawkish on Iran.",
      "In 2018, he pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Calling it \u201cthe worst deal in history\u201d, he shared the views of many governments in the region that the deal, aimed at curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, failed to tackle Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme while enriching the Revolutionary Guards with money then used to fund proxy militias around the region.",

      "But something else has changed in the region.",

    "summary": "With swathes of South Sudan submerged, a whistleblower warns water sources are being polluted by oil.",
    "story": [
      "Herders scooping murky water from a small pond in grasslands in South Sudan are well aware of the dangers they face if they drink it.",
      "\"The water is dirty because this place has oil - it has chemicals in it,\" says their chief, Chilhok Puot.",
      "Nyatabah, a woman from this community raising cows in the heart of oil fields in Unity State, adds: \"If you drink it, it makes you pant and cough.",
      "\"We know it's bad water, but we don't have anywhere else, we're dying of thirst.\"",
      "A former oil engineer, David Bojo Leju, has told the BBC World service that flooding in the area is washing pollution into water sources.",
      "Large swathes of the state have been under water for several years after unprecedented flooding, which scientists say has been worsened by climate change.",
      "Mr Bojo Leju says the floods are a \"disaster\" and that pollution from mismanaged oil facilities is a \"silent killer\" spreading across the state.",
      "South Sudan is the world\u2019s youngest country and one of its poorest, with a government hugely dependent on oil revenue.",
      "Unity State, a major oil-producing state, has always experienced seasonal flooding. But in 2019, extreme rains brought a deluge that engulfed villages, grasslands and forests. Year after year of intense rainfall followed. The water built up, trapped on the clay soil.",
      "At the worst point in 2022, two-thirds of Unity State were submerged, according to the UN World Food Programme (WFP) - even now, it says about 40% is still under water.",
      "Mr Bojo Leju worked for eight years for the oil consortium Greater Pioneer Operating Company (GPOC), a joint venture between Malaysian, Indian and Chinese oil companies - with South Sudan\u2019s government owning 5%.",
      "After a major pipeline rupture five years ago, he started photographing and filming pools of oily water and heaps of blackened soil in locations in Unity State, including sites near Roriak, where the herders live.",
      "He says spills from oil wells and pipelines were \"a recurring situation\", and that he was involved in transporting contaminated soil away from roads, so it would not be seen.",
      "He tried to raise his concerns with company managers, but he says little was done and \"there was no treatment plan for soil\".",
      "Mr Bojo Leju also says \"produced water\" - water released from the ground when oil is extracted and often containing hydrocarbons and other pollutants - was not properly treated.",
      "There were reports of high oil content, above international standards, in the produced water \"every day in our morning meeting\", he says, \"and this water is injected back into the environment\".",
      "\"The question is where does water flow?\" he says.",
      "\"Up to the river, up to the water source where people drink, up to ponds where people catch fish.\"",
      "Mr Bojo Leju explains that \"some of the oil chemicals seeped down\" into the groundwater, where they will flow into boreholes.",
      "\"The water table is contaminated,\" he says.",
      "When intense rains began in 2019, earth dykes were put around some spilled oil \"but it was not enough to withstand the volume of water\", he adds.",
      "In Roriak, there is no data available about the quality of the water the herders drink, but they fear pollution is making their cattle sick.",
      "They say calves have been born without heads or without limbs.",
      "Unity State\u2019s agriculture minister blames the deaths of more than 100,000 cattle in the last two years on the floods combined with oil pollution.",
      "In a forest close to Roriak, a group of men and women chop down trees to make charcoal.",
      "They have walked for eight hours along dirt roads flanked by flood water to reach the forest.",
      "They say the only water they can find here is polluted.",
      "Even boiled \"it causes diarrhoea and abdominal pain\", says one woman, Nyakal.",
      "Another, Nyeda, wipes away tears, saying she needs the charcoal to sell, but is worried about her seven children, left with her mother for a week.",
      "\"She has nothing either,\" she says.",
      "Nyeda lives near the state capital, Bentiu, in a reed hut squeezed into a camp housing 140,000 people who have fled conflict or the floods. It is completely surrounded by flood water and protected only by earth dykes.",
      "There is some food aid, but many in the area survive by foraging for water lily roots and fish to supplement their rations.",
      "Safe water is scarce. Nyeda uses water from a borehole for washing and cooking, but needs money to buy drinking water.",
      "Health professionals and politicians in the area have told the BBC they fear pollution and the lack of clean water are taking a toll on human health.",
      "In a hospital in Bentiu, a mother has just given birth. Her new-born baby\u2019s nose and mouth are joined.",
      "\"They have no access to clean water,\" says Dr Samuel Puot, one of the doctors caring for the baby.",
      "\"They just drink from the river where water and oil are mixed. That might be the problem.\"",
      "He says there are \"many\" cases of children born with abnormalities, such as no limbs or a small head, in Bentiu and also Ruweng, an oil-producing area north of Unity State.",
      "They often die within days or months, he adds.",
      "Genetic testing can give clues about the causes of congenital abnormalities, but the hospital does not have the facilities, and results are often not conclusive.",
      "Dr Puot wants the government to keep a register of cases.",
      "As the data is not recorded systematically, it is not clear whether these anecdotal reports indicate an unusually high prevalence of congenital abnormalities.",
      "\"It is plausible that oil-related pollution could contribute to an increased risk of birth defects,\" says Dr Nicole Deziel, an environmental health specialist at Yale University.",
      "Environmental pollution is a risk factor for congenital abnormalities, alongside genetics, maternal age, infection and nutrition, she says.",
      "Some compounds released during the production of oil can affect foetal development, Dr Deziel adds.",
      "\"Anecdotal reports can serve as important indicators of environmental health problems,\" she says, but stresses that without systematic data collection, establishing evidence of a causal relationship is difficult.",
      "In 2014 and 2017, the German-based non-governmental organisation Sign of Hope carried out peer-reviewed studies close to other oil fields in Unity State.",
      "They found increased salinity and high concentrations of heavy metals in water nearer oil wells, as well as high concentrations of lead and barium in human hair samples.",
      "The researchers concluded these were indicators of pollution from oil production.",
      "You can watch South Sudan: Poisoned Floods on iPlayer (UK only) or on the BBC Africa YouTube channel (outside the UK)",
      "It begins the new season of the BBC World Service series Life at 50\u00b0C, which investigates climate change and the devastating effects of water insecurity in some of the hottest parts of the world.",
      "The government has commissioned an environmental audit of the impact of the oil industry, but the results are yet to be made public more than a year later than expected.",
      "Mary Ayen Majok, a senior politician from the ruling party, has been raising concerns about oil pollution for more than a decade.",
      "She is a member of the government and deputy speaker in the upper house of the South Sudanese parliament, and is from Ruweng.",
      "She says one of her own relatives has had a child \"born with deformities\" and believes many such cases are not reported because of fear of stigma or lack of access to medical facilities.",
      "Ms Majok says South Sudan \"inherited an industry that was based on bad practices\" when the country was formed in 2011 after it gained independence from Sudan.",
      "A five-year civil war broke out in 2013. For a nation facing conflict and heavily dependent on oil revenues, improving environmental responsibility has been \"at the tail of our priorities\", she says.",
      "Laws and institutions have been established but \"accountability is not that strong\", she says.",
      "\"Talking about oil is like touching the heart of the government,\" says Mr Bojo Leju.",
      "He spoke to the BBC in Sweden, where he has been granted asylum.",
      "In 2020 he was approached by South Sudanese lawyers who wanted to sue the government over oil pollution.",
      "He agreed to testify as a witness. But he says security personnel detained him, hit him on the head with a pistol and forced him to sign a document recanting his evidence.",
      "He fled the country soon afterwards. The lawyers did not pursue their case.",
      "The BBC asked the oil consortium GPOC and the South Sudanese president\u2019s office to comment on the allegations in this report, but they did not respond.",
      "Scientists are not sure whether the floods in Unity State will ever recede.",
      "Dr Chris Funk, director of the Climate Hazards Center at University of Carolina, Santa Barbara, says 2019 saw record sea surface temperatures in the west Indian Ocean, which \"would have been impossible in a world without climate change\".",
      "Warmer air can hold more moisture, and he says there was a \"strong link\" between these sea temperatures and the 2019 extreme rains over East Africa.",
      "Dr Funk says higher rainfall has continued since then over the Lake Victoria basin that feeds into South Sudan, but it is not clear whether this is a permanent new pattern.",
      "Temperatures in South Sudan have risen and are expected to rise further, he adds.",
      "This means extreme precipitation \"will be more extreme\" and, under some global warming scenarios, heat and humidity could mean some parts of the country \"would not be liveable\", he says.",
      "However, despite the floods and pollution fears, many here hope to return to a life of raising animals and living off the land.",
      "In Roriak, children fashion a miniature village out of the clay on the ground, complete with model huts and cows.",
      "And near Bentiu, an elderly woman grinds water lily roots next to the flood water. She says she would like to a have a cow again, one day.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 00:17:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The South Korean hit drama returns for a second season in December.",
    "story": [
      "When I ask the creator of the hit Korean drama Squid Game about reports that he was so stressed while shooting the first series he lost six teeth, he quickly corrects me. \u201cIt was eight or nine,\u201d he laughs.",
      "Hwang Dong-hyuk is speaking to me on set as he films the second series of his dystopian Netflix thriller, which sees hundreds of debt-laden contestants fight it out for a whopping cash prize, by playing a string of life-or-death children\u2019s games.",
      "But another series was not always on the cards. At one point, he swore against making one.",
      "Given the stress it has caused him, I ask what changed his mind.",
      "\u201cMoney,\u201d he answers, without hesitation.",
      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t fully finish the story,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first series was Netflix\u2019s most successful show to date, thrusting South Korea and its home-grown television dramas into the spotlight. Its dark commentary on wealth inequality touched a nerve with audiences around the globe.",
      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang has had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time audience expectations are sky high.",
      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",
      "\u201cNew lines are being drawn. We\u2019re in an era of us vs them. Who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d",
      "As I toured the show\u2019s playful set, with its distinctive brightly-coloured staircase, I picked up a few clues as to how the director\u2019s despair will be reflected this time around.",
      "In this series, the previous winner, Gi-hun, re-enters the game on a quest to bring it down and save the latest round of contestants.",
      "According to Lee Jung-jae, who plays the leading character, he is \"more desperate and determined\u201d than before.",
      "The floor of the dormitory, where the contestants sleep at night, has been divided in two.",
      "One half is branded with a giant red neon X symbol, the other with a blue circle.",
      "Now, after every game, the players must pick a side, depending on whether they want to end the contest early and survive, or keep playing, in the knowledge all but one of them will die. The majority decision rules.",
      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",
      "For all those who were captivated by the shocking storytelling of Squid Game, there were others who found it gratuitously violent and difficult to watch.",
      "But it is clear from talking to Hwang, that the violence is fully thought out. He is a man who thinks and cares deeply about the world and is motivated by a mounting unease.",
      "\u201cWhen making this series, I constantly asked myself \u2018do we humans have what it takes to steer the world off this downhill path?\u2019. Honestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.",
      "While viewers of the second series might not get the answers to these big life questions, they can at least be comforted that some plot holes will be filled in \u2013 like why the game exists, and what is motivating the masked Front Man running it.",
      "\u201cPeople will see more of the Front Man\u2019s past, his story and his emotions,\u201d reveals the actor Lee Byung-hun, who plays the mysterious role.",
      "\u201cI don't think this will make viewers warm to him, but it may help them better understand his choices.\u201d",
      "As one of South Korea\u2019s most famous actors, Lee admits that having his face and eyes covered and his voice distorted throughout the first series, was \u201ca little bit dissatisfying\u201d.",
      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",
      "They paid him a modest upfront amount, leaving him unable to cash in on the whopping \u00a3650m it is estimated to have made the platform.",
      "This explains the love-hate relationship South Korea\u2019s film and television creators currently have with international streaming platforms.",
      "Over the past few years, Netflix has stormed the Korean market with billions of dollars of investment, bringing the industry global recognition and love, but leaving creators feeling short-changed.",
      "They accuse the platform of forcing them to relinquish their copyright when they sign contracts \u2013 and with it, their claim to profit.",
      "This is a worldwide problem.",
      "In the past, creators could rely on getting a cut of box office sales or TV re-runs, but this model has not been adopted by streaming giants.",
      "The issue is compounded in South Korea, creators say, due to its outdated copyright law, which does not protect them.",
      "This summer, actors, writers, directors and producers teamed up to form a collective, to fight the system together.",
      "\u201cIn Korea, being a movie director is just a job title, it\u2019s not a way to earn a living,\u201d the vice-president of the Korean Film Directors Guild, Oh Ki-hwan, tells the audience at an event in Seoul.",
      "Some of his director friends, he says, work part-time in warehouses and as taxi drivers.",
      "Park Hae-young is a writer at the event. When Netflix bought her show, 'My Liberation Notes', it became a global hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been writing my whole life. So, to get global recognition when competing with creators from across the world, has been a joyful experience,\u201d she tells me.",
      "But Park says the current streaming model has left her reluctant to \u201cpour her all\u201d into her next series.",
      "\u201cUsually, I\u2019ll spend four or five years making a drama in the belief that, if it's successful, it could somewhat secure my future, that I'll get my fair share of compensation. Without that, what's the point of working so hard?\u201d",
      "She and other creators are pushing the South Korean government to change its copyright law to force production companies to share their profits.",
      "In a statement, the South Korean government told the BBC that while it recognised the compensation system needed to change, it was up to the industry to resolve the issue. A spokesperson for Netflix told us it offers \u201ccompetitive\u201d compensation, and guarantees creators \u201csolid compensation, regardless of the success or failure of their shows\u201d.",
      "Squid Game\u2019s Hwang hopes his candor over his own pay struggles will initiate that change.",
      "He has certainly sparked the fair pay conversation, and this second series will surely give the industry another bump.",
      "But when we catch up after filming has wrapped, he tells me his teeth are aching again.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen my dentist yet, but I\u2019ll probably have to pull out a few more very soon.\u201d",

    "title": "India's luxury airline Vistara flies into the sunset",
    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 03:59:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Vistara is operating its last flight on Monday as it completes its merger with Air India.",
    "story": [
      "Indian full-service carrier Vistara will operate its last flight on Monday, after nine years in existence.",
      "A joint venture between Singapore Airlines and the Tata Sons, Vistara will merge with Tata-owned Air India to form a single entity with an expanded network and broader fleet.",
      "This means that all Vistara operations will be transferred to and managed by Air India, including helpdesk kiosks and ticketing offices. The process of migrating passengers with existing Vistara bookings and loyalty programmes to Air India has been under way over the past few months.",
      "\u201cAs part of the merger process, meals, service ware and other soft elements have been upgraded and incorporates aspects of both Vistara and Air India,\u201d an Air India spokesperson said in an email response.",
      "Amid concerns that the merger could impact service standards, the Tatas have assured that Vistara's in-flight experience will remain unchanged.",
      "Known for its high ratings in food, service, and cabin quality, Vistara has built a loyal customer base and the decision to retire the Vistara brand has been criticised by fans, branding experts, and aviation analysts.",
      "The consolidation was effectively done to clean up Vistara\u2019s books and wipe out its losses, said Mark Martin, an aviation analyst.",
      "Air India has essentially been \u201csuckered into taking a loss-making airline\u201d in a desperate move, he added.",
      "\"Mergers are meant to make airlines powerful. Never to wipe out losses or cover them.\"",
      "To be sure, both Air India and Vistara\u2019s annual losses have reduced by more than half over the past year, and other operating metrics have improved too. But the merger process so far has been turbulent.",
      "The exercise has been riddled with problems \u2013 from pilot shortages that have led to massive flight cancellations, to Vistara crew going on mass sick leave over plans to align their salary structures with Air India.",
      "There have also been repeated complaints about poor service standards on Air India, including viral videos of broken seats and non-functioning inflight entertainment systems.",
      "The Tatas have announced a $400m (\u00a3308m) programme to upgrade and retrofit the interiors of its older aircraft and also a brand-new livery. They\u2019ve also placed orders for hundreds of new Airbus and Boeing planes worth billions of dollars to augment their offering.",
      "But this \u201cturnaround\u201d is still incomplete and riddled with problems, according to Mr Martin. A merger only complicates matters.",
      "Experts say that the merger strikes a dissonant chord from a branding perspective too.",
      "Harish Bijoor, a brand strategy specialist, told the BBC he was feeling \u201cemotional\u201d that a superior product offering like Vistara which had developed a \u201cgold standard for Indian aviation\u201d was ceasing operations.",
      "\u201cIt is a big loss for the industry,\u201d said Mr Bijoor, adding it will be a monumental task for the mother brand Air India to simply \u201ccopy, paste and exceed\u201d the high standards set by Vistara, given that it\u2019s a much smaller airline that\u2019s being gobbled up by a much larger one.",
      "Mr Bijoor suggests a better strategy would have been to operate Air India separately for five years, focusing on improving service standards, while maintaining Vistara as a distinct brand with Air India prefixed to it.",
      "\u201cThis would have given Air India the time and chance to rectify the mother brand and bring it up to the Vistara level, while maintaining its uniqueness,\u201d he adds.",
      "Beyond branding, the merged entity will face a slew of operational challenges.",
      "\"Communication will be a major challenge in the early days, with customers arriving at the airport expecting Vistara flights, only to find Air India branding,\" says Ajay Awtaney, editor of Live From A Lounge, an aviation portal. \"Air India will need to maintain clear communication for weeks.\"",
      "Another key challenge, he notes, is cultural: Vistara's agile employees may struggle to adjust to Air India's complex bureaucracy and systems.",
      "But the biggest task for the merged carrier would be offering customers a uniform flying experience.",
      "These are \u201ctwo airlines with very different service formats are being integrated into one airline. It is going to be a hotchpotch of service formats, cabin formats, branding, and customer experience. It will involve learning and unlearning, and such a process has rarely worked with airlines and is seldom effective,\u201d said Mr Martin.",
      "Still, many believe Vistara had to go \u2013 now or some years later.",
      "A legacy brand like Air India, with strong global recognition and 'India' imprinted in its identity, wouldn\u2019t have allowed a smaller, more premium subsidiary to overshadow its revival process.",
      "Financially too, it makes little sense for the Tatas to have two loss-making entities compete with one another.",
      "The combined strength of Vistara and Air India could also place the Tatas in a much better position to compete with market leader Indigo.",
      "The unified Air India group (including Air India Express, which completed its merger with the former Air Asia India in October) \u201cwill be bigger and better with a fleet size of nearly 300 aircraft, an expanded network and a stronger workforce\u201d, an Air India spokesperson said.",
      "\u201cGetting done with the merger means that Air India grows overnight, and the two teams start cooperating instead of competing. There will never be one right day to merge. Somewhere, a line had to be drawn,\u201d said Mr Awtaney.",
      "But for many Vistara loyalists, its demise leaves a void in India\u2019s skies for a premium, full-service carrier - marking the third such gap after the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways.",
      "It\u2019s still too early to say if Air India, which often ranks at the bottom of airline surveys, can successfully fill that void."

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:39 GMT",
    "summary": "Everything we learned on the red carpet and behind the scenes of the MTV Europe Music Awards.",
    "story": [
      "The MTV Awards came to Manchester for the first time in their 30-year history on Sunday night, but somehow didn't feel very Mancunian.",
      "There was no sign of Take That or Aitch, or Liam Gallagher - even though he won best rock star.",
      "Organisers made a few subtle nods to the city: The stage was framed in the black and yellow stripes of Factory Records, and New Order's Blue Monday pumped through the speakers every time nominees were announced.",
      "But the show took a more global perspective, highlighting acts from Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and America - including a predictable victory for Taylor Swift in the night's two biggest categories, best artist and video of the year.",
      "She only appeared by video, choosing instead to spend the night watching her boyfriend, American Football player Travis Kelce, lead the Kansas City Chiefs to victory against the Denver Broncos.",
      "But there were plenty of other stars at the show and on the red carpet. Here's some of the gossip we picked up along the way.",
      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",
      "\"You let it go, because you think you can come back to it - and now there are so many ideas that are just gone. It's so sad.\"",
      "But the singer, who won best UK artist, maintained a positive outlook.",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason. I'll have to start again and maybe it's a blessing in disguise.\"",
      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",
      "\"I went to karate school, and we illegally went into nightclubs, to make a little money break-dancing,\" he told us.",
      "\"I remember Boy George was cool, Wham was cool,\" he continued.",
      "\"But our favourite was Benny Hill. Benny Hill is still our favourite to this day. I don't think anybody has as ever been as funny or as charismatic as Benny Hill.\"",
      "So, during those halcyon days of watching smutty comedy in Morecambe, did he ever think he'd be back, winning a lifetime achievement prize?",
      "\"You can never foresee something like that,\" he said. \"When we first got involved with hip-hop, we didn't do it for none of the accolades. We just did it because we loved it.",
      "\"But with that being said, tonight is a dream come true.\"",
      "To honour that moment, he gave a nine-minute acceptance speech thanking everyone from his mother to an art teacher he'd met backstage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty four years of professionally recording [and] this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels incredible.\"",
      "3) Olly Alexander had advice for next year's Eurovision contestant",
      "Olly Alexander played a pre-show party on Saturday night, and couldn't quite believe the reception for Dizzy - the song which earned him 18th place at this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "\"That went down a lot better than it did in Eurovision,\" he laughed, shortly before Jedward invaded the stage and caused utter chaos.",
      "At the main ceremony, Alexander was there to award song of the year to Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso. But he also had a few words for anyone considering representing the UK at next year's contest.",
      "\"I would say to them, whoever it is, 'Call me, and we will have a serious conversation about it',\" he said with the haunted look of a man who has seen some things.",
      "4) Benson Boone has a new fan: Bez",
      "In addition to winning best new artist, US singer Benson Boone opened the ceremony with a spectacular performance that saw him suspended mid-air on a grand piano, before pulling off a spectacular front flip from a platform at the side of the stage.",
      "\"The insurance is always crazy,\" he laughed, \"but I love to perform.\"",
      "One person who couldn't believe his eyes was Happy Mondays star Bez, who accosted Boone during an interview with Rita Ora.",
      "\"I was so blown away by that performance, mate,\" he told the singer.",
      "\"When you came down on that shiny piano, I thought, 'Elton John is going to be so gutted.'\"",
      "5) Le Sserafim escaped to Manchester's Christmas market",
      "Manchester is home to the UK's biggest K-Pop shop and, on Sunday morning, the staff couldn't quite believe one of the genre's biggest girl bands had landed in their city.",
      "\"Le Sserafim were posting pictures from the Christmas market,\" one of them told me. \"That's only five minutes from here!\"",
      "The five-piece, who've been setting chart records over in the US, jetted in for their first-ever UK performance, a mash-up of Chasing Lightning and the 90s house banger Crazy.",
      "But they were more excited to be out on the town without being mobbed.",
      "\"It was so good, we had baklava!\" enthused singer Huh Yun-Jin; while her bandmate Sakura tucked into a portion of fish and chips.",
      "\"It was my first time,\" she said. \"I loved it.\"",
      "On stage at the EMAs, the band got one of the biggest screams of the night, despite being relatively unknown in the UK... for now.",
      "\"Coming to Europe is something that we've always dreamt of, so this is absolutely surreal,\" said Yun-Jin. \"We just want to make a good impression.\"",
      "Mission accomplished.",
      "6) Jedward spent two hours on the red carpet",
      "For absolutely no reason at all, Jedward went on a massive charm offensive for the international press.",
      "\"Oasis are back and Jedward are back!\" they declared, before racing over to baffled German and French journalists, while singing Stop Crying Your Heart Out.",
      "This went on for two deliriously brilliant hours, as the twins, who found fame on The X Factor 15 years ago, insisted that \"a lot of artists have been inspired by Jedward\".",
      "And, to be fair, they have proof. Mercury Prize nominee CMAT recently said the brothers had encouraged her to finish her second album, with a motivational voice message.",
      "\"You have to think about it, in life,\" explained John.",
      "\"Don't always think you're the main character. Reach out to other people. Serve that tennis ball and see what they do.\"",
      "\"It's always about keeping that spark alive,\" added Edward. \"We're like a support animal for all the artists.\"",
      "They were, to be honest, an absolute blast.",
      "7) The Liam Payne tribute was perfectly judged",
      "Liam Payne won 12 MTV EMAs during his time in One Direction, and later used the ceremony to launch his solo career, performing his global smash hit Strip That Down at the 2017 ceremony.",
      "It was only fitting that the event marked his death - but striking the right tone in the middle of a huge showbiz event is never easy.",
      "In the end, his friend and collaborator Rita Ora just spoke from the heart.",
      "\"There were so many ways that we were talking about honouring him,\" she said. \"But sometimes simply speaking is enough.\"",
      "Addressing the camera directly, she shared her memories of the 31-year-old, as her voice cracked.",
      "\"Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew,\" she said. \"He brought so much joy to every room he walked into. And he left such a mark on this world.\"",
      "It was sombre and restrained, yet powerfully emotional. Ora wasn't the only one crying.",
      "8) Tyla paid tribute to Aaliyah",
      "South African star Tyla, best known for her viral hit Water, clinched both the best R&B and best Afrobeats awards.",
      "The awards marked her continued ascent, after being named one of the BBC's Sounds of 2024 - but she made sure to honour her inspirations.",
      "On the red carpet, she rocked a vintage Roberto Cavalli dress with a turquoise blue zebra print.",
      "The exact same dress had previously been worn by US rapper Eve at the 2000 Soul Train Awards.",
      "And R&B legend Aaliyah wore a canary yellow version at the 2000 MTV Awards, where she won best female video for Try Again.",
      "The ceremony took place in September 2000, less than a year before Aaliyah's tragic death in an plane accident.",
      "The singer was just 22 at the time - the same age that Tyla is now."

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 04:21:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Building the link to western Europe has become more urgent as the Baltics see Russia as a threat.",
    "story": [
      "The three Baltic states came up with the idea years ago for a high-speed railway spanning 870km (540 miles) across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.",
      "Rail Baltica began as a grand project, but it has now become a strategic imperative: since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Baltics increasingly view their neighbour as an existential threat.",
      "Currently, there is no direct link that crosses the Baltics and connects with Poland.",
      "Rail Baltica will do that, cutting travel time and bringing economic and environmental benefits, but the costs of this ambitious scheme are mounting.",
      "Meanwhile, Baltic states and their Nato allies need the railway in place fast.",
      "Estonia's Infrastructure Minister Vladimir Svet said the rail link is vital amid the Russian war in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cHistory is repeating itself,\u201d he said. \u201cPutin's aggressive regime is trying to recreate an imperial project on the territory of the former Soviet bloc.\"",
      "The memory of decades of Soviet occupation is still fresh in the Baltics. Moscow deported hundreds of thousands of people from the region to Siberia.",
      "Estonia and Latvia share land borders with Russia, while Lithuania is adjacent to the Russian enclave Kaliningrad, which also shares a border with Poland, and Moscow's close ally, Belarus.",
      "About 10,000 Nato soldiers are currently stationed in the Baltics, alongside local troops. Their total number could reach 200,000 in a worst-case scenario.",
      "\u201cRail Baltica will increase military mobility and allow trains to go directly from the Netherlands to Tallinn,\u201d Cmdr Peter Nielsen, from Nato's Force Integration Unit, said.",
      "For Estonia's infrastructure minister, the railway is \u201can unbreakable link with the networks of Europe\u201d.",
      "Not far from the Estonian capital, Tallinn, at the tip of the railway, dozens of workers are welding and hammering away at the new \u00dclemiste passenger terminal.",
      "\u201cThis will be the network's most northern point, the starting point of 215km of railway in Estonia and 870km across the three Baltic States,\u201d said Anvar Salomets, CEO of Rail Baltica Estonia, stepping carefully across the embryonic platforms.",
      "Until now, the Baltics have used a Russian track width because their rail system dates back to the Soviet era.",
      "Passengers have to change trains to the European system when they get to the Polish border.",
      "The new network will use the European railway track width and connect seamlessly with railways across the EU.",
      "LISTEN: Building a geopolitical railway",
      "Baltic concerns over plans to move Russia's sea borders",
      "\u201cThe trains will run at up to 250km/h (155mph) compared with 80 or 120km/h (50 or 74mph) right now,\u201d Salomets added.",
      "That means journey times from Tallinn to the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, will be massively reduced, from at least 12 hours now to under four.",
      "\u201cIt'll be a game-changer, decreasing the environmental impact across our whole transport sector,\u201d says Salomets, who foresees big economic benefits.",
      "Recent analysis for the Rail Baltica consortium estimates the overall economic boost at \u20ac6.6bn (\u00a35.5bn).",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of studies of existing high speed rail systems show a positive economic impact,\u201d said Adam Cohen of the University of California at Berkeley.",
      "But those benefits will not appear overnight and there is growing concern at the spiralling cost. Developers' estimates have increased fourfold since 2017 and now stand at \u20ac24bn.",
      "So far, the EU has subsidised 85% of the project and has just announced another \u20ac1.1bn.",
      "Estonia and Latvia have also come under criticism for focusing on putting up the rail terminals first before they build the mainline.",
      "French engineer Emilien Dang, whose RB Rail oversees the project, blamed recent global crises for the big spike in costs: \u201cOur initial estimate hadn't taken into account the Covid pandemic and high inflation - and the situation in Ukraine has dramatically increased the cost of material.\u201d",
      "As he walked across a big new terminal in the Latvian capital Riga, he also cited cultural issues.",
      "\u201cThe view from France, wrongly, is that the Baltics are one unit.  But they are three countries, with different regulations.\u201d",
      "The Baltic states have decided to split the project into two phases. The first, costing \u20ac15bn, will have a single instead of double track laid by 2030 and focus on the most important train stops.",
      "The second track and additional train stations are to be completed as part of a second phase with no specific completion date yet.",
      "The soaring costs have prompted the states to scale back some of their ambitions.",
      "\u201cWe can further scale back the scope of phase one, for example by connecting Riga airport at a later stage,\u201d said Andris Kulbergs, who chairs a Latvian parliamentary committee investigating the project.",
      "As billions of euros for the first phase are yet to be secured, that might be necessary.",
      "Estonia's national auditor Janar Holm believes several more years of delays are likely: \u201cWe have to find the funds to build this railway now or it'll be even more expensive.\u201d",
      "The country's infrastructure minister, Vladimir Svet, insisted \"we are decreasing the budget as much as possible, we\u2019ve rationalised the public procurement process and, if necessary, we'll take on a loan.\"",
      "\u201cIf we want to preserve our culture and feel secure about our freedom, there is no other way than being in a strong EU, Nato and international community that supports international law,\u201d he added.",
      "For the three Baltic states that broke free of the Soviet Union to join the EU and Nato, Rail Baltica could serve as a lifeline - if it manages to stay on track.",
      "Mystery fires were Russian 'test runs' to target cargo flights to US",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 01:36:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Dozens of videos involving a senior civil servant in Equatorial Guinea have flooded social media, shocking people in the country.",
    "story": [
      "What the rest of the world sees as a sex tape scandal could in fact be the latest episode in the real-life drama over who will become Equatorial Guinea\u2019s next president.",
      "Over the past fortnight, dozens of videos - estimates range from 150 to more than 400 - have been leaked of a senior civil servant having sex in his office and elsewhere with different women.",
      "They have flooded social media, shocking and titillating people in the small central African country and beyond.",
      "Many of the women filmed were wives and relatives of people close to the centre of power.",
      "It appears some were aware they were being filmed having sex with Baltasar Ebang Mr Engonga, who is also known as \u201cBello\u201d because of his good looks.",
      "All this is hard to verify as Equatorial Guinea is a highly restricted society where a free press does not exist.",
      "But one theory is that the leaks were a way to discredit the man at the centre of the storm.",
      "Mr Engonga is a nephew of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema and one of those thought to be hoping to replace him.",
      "Obiang is the world\u2019s longest-serving president having been in power since 1979.",
      "The 82-year-old has overseen an economic boom that has turned to bust as a result of the now-dwindling oil reserves.",
      "There is a small, extremely wealthy elite, but many of the 1.7 million people in the country live in poverty.",
      "Obiang\u2019s administration is heavily criticised for its human rights record, including arbitrary killings and torture, according to a US government report.",
      "It has also had its fair share of scandals - including the revelations about the lavish lifestyle of one of the president's sons, now vice-president, who once owned a $275,000 (\u00a3210,000) crystal-encrusted glove worn by Michael Jackson.",
      "Despite regular elections, there is no real opposition in Equatorial Guinea as activists have been jailed and exiled and those with designs on office are closely monitored.",
      "Politics in the country is really about palace intrigue and this is where the scandal involving Mr Engonga fits in.",
      "He was the head of the National Financial Investigation Agency, and worked on tackling crimes such as money laundering.",
      "But it turned out he himself was under investigation.",
      "He was arrested on 25 October accused of embezzling a huge sum of money from state coffers and depositing it in secret accounts in the Cayman Islands. He has not commented on the accusation.",
      "Mr Engonga was then taken to the infamous Black Beach prison in the capital, Malabo, where it is alleged that opponents of the government are subjected to brutal treatment.",
      "His phones and computers were seized and a few days later the intimate videos started appearing online.",
      "The first reference the BBC has found to them on Facebook is from 28 October on the page of Diario Rombe, a news site run by a journalist in exile in Spain, which said that \u201csocial networks exploded with the leaking of explicit images and videos\u201d.",
      "A post on X the following day referred to a \u201cmonumental scandal shaking the regime\u201d as \u201cpornographic videos flood social media\u201d.",
      "But they are believed to have originally appeared one-by-one a few days earlier on Telegram, on one of the platform's channels known for publishing pornographic images.",
      "They were then downloaded on to people\u2019s phones and shared among WhatsApp groups in Equatorial Guinea, where they caused a storm.",
      "Mr Engonga was quickly identified along with some of the women in the videos, including relatives of the president and wives to ministers and senior military officials.",
      "The government was unable to ignore what was going on and on 30 October Vice-President Teodoro Obiang Mangue (once owner of the Michael Jackson glove) gave telecoms companies 24 hours to come up with ways to stop the spread of the clips.",
      "\u201cWe cannot continue to watch families fall apart without taking any action,\u201d he wrote on X.",
      "\u201cIn the meantime, the origin of these publications is being investigated to find the author or authors and make them answer for their actions.\u201d",
      "As the computer equipment was in the hands of the security forces, suspicion has fallen on someone there, who, perhaps, sought to trash Mr Engonga\u2019s reputation ahead of a trial.",
      "The police have called on women to come forward to open a case against Mr Engonga for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. One has already announced that she is suing him.",
      "What is not clear is why Mr Engonga made the recordings.",
      "But activists have put forward what could be other motives behind the explosive leak.",
      "As well as being related to the president, Mr Engonga is the son of Baltasar Engonga Edjo'o, the head of the regional economic and monetary union, Cemac, and very influential in the country.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing is the end of an era, the end of the current president, and there is a succession [question] and this is the internal fighting we are seeing,\u201d said Equatoguinean activist Nsang Christia Esimi Cruz, now living in London.",
      "Speaking to the BBC Focus on Africa podcast, he alleged that Vice-President Obiang was trying to politically eliminate \u201canyone who could challenge his succession\u201d.",
      "The vice-president, along with his mother, are suspected to be pushing aside anyone who threatens his path to the presidency, including Gabriel Obiang Lima (another son of President Obiang from a different wife), who was oil minister for 10 years and then moved to a secondary government role.",
      "Those in the elite are thought to know things about each other that they would rather was not made public, and videos have been used in the past to humiliate and discredit a political opponent.",
      "There are also frequent accusations of coup plotting, which further fuels paranoia.",
      "But Mr Cruz also alleges that the authorities want to use the scandal as an excuse to crack down on social media, which is how a lot of information about what is really going on in the country gets out.",
      "In July, the authorities temporarily suspended the internet after protests broke out on the island of Annob\u00f3n.",
      "For him, the fact that a high-ranking official was having sex outside of marriage was not surprising as it was part of the decadent lifestyle of the country\u2019s elite.",
      "The vice-president, who himself has been convicted of corruption in France and has had lavish assets seized in various countries, wants to be seen as the man cracking down on graft and wrong-doing at home.",
      "Last year, for example, he ordered the arrest of his half-brother over allegations he sold a plane owned by the state airline.",
      "But in this case, despite the vice-president\u2019s efforts to stop the spread of the clips, they continue to be viewed.",
      "This week, he tried to appear more resolute calling for the installation of CCTV cameras in government offices \u201cto combat indecent and illicit acts\u201d, the official news agency reported.",
      "Saying that the scandal had \u201cdenigrated the image of the country\u201d he ordered that any officials found engaging in sex acts at work would be suspended as this was a \"flagrant violation of the code of conduct\u201d.",
      "He was not wrong that the story has attracted a lot of outside interest.",
      "Judging by Google's data, search enquiries that include the country\u2019s name have shot up since the beginning of this week.",
      "On Monday, on X, \u201cEquatorial Guinea\u201d was one of the top trending terms in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa - surpassing at times interest in the US election.",
      "This has left some activists who have been trying to tell the world about what is really going on in the country frustrated.",
      "\u201cEquatorial Guinea has much bigger problems than this sex scandal,\u201d said Mr Cruz, who works for a rights organisation called GE Nuestra.",
      "\u201cThis sex scandal for us is just a symptom of the illness, it\u2019s not the illness itself. It just shows how corrupt the system is.\u201d",

      "Her fatal stabbing has baffled police for 15 years. Dutch cold case detectives are using the innovative technology for the first time in an effort to solve the case.",
      "The murdered teenager\u2019s image is being projected from behind a window, alongside hundreds of young women who continue to make a living in this notoriously risky industry.",

      "It was in the early hours of 19 February 2009, when two sex workers went to check on the teenage mother during a break between clients, because they realised her usual music was not playing.",
      "When they entered her brothel, a small room with a plastic-covered bed, vanity table and sink, they discovered Betty Szabo's body.",
      "She had been murdered three months after giving birth, the victim of a savage knife attack.",
      "Her baby was placed in foster care and never got to know his mother - a fact that motivates detectives.",

      "The number of volunteers will vary, depending on who has spare time that day.",
      "A civil engineer, Mr Sarfo formed the group in July 2023 with just five people. He called it Buz Stop Boys, knowing the name would resonate with the public.",
      "\"The rich and poor, everybody knows what a bus stop is,\" Mr Sarfo said.",
      "His small-scale initiative has now blossomed into a movement, with more than 40 men and women - from midwives to carpenters to military officers - joining.",
      "\"Social media has been key in getting more people to join our movement,\" Mr Sarfo said.",
      "\"Through our videos, we\u2019ve been able to change the mindset of some people, but there\u2019s still a lot of work to do.\"",
      "It also led to a group of UK students visiting Ghana during their summer break to help with a clean-up operation in Ablekuma, an area in Accra notorious for its waste disposal issues.",
      "Mr Sarfo saw their visit as an inspiration for more locals to get involved.",
      "\"Don\u2019t sit back at home and say you don\u2019t care. One thing is key, without [the] environment we are useless, we are nonentities, and we can\u2019t survive on this planet,\"  he said.",
      "Popular musician and human rights activist Sister Derby has thrown her weight behind Buz Stop Boys, praising the activists on her Instagram and X accounts.",
      "She told the BBC that she had been touched by their \"pure selflessness\", and she and her brother had one day joined them to clean a  stretch of a street market in the heart of Accra.",
      "Dancehall star and businessman Shatta Wale has also rallied behind the group, helping raise 30,000 cedis ($1,830, \u00a31,415) during a live TikTok.",
      "\"These boys are the real heroes. They are doing what most of us are too busy or too proud to do. If we all helped them, imagine how beautiful Accra would be,\" he said.",

      "Former President John Mahama - who is making a fresh bid for power by contesting elections due in December under the banner of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) -  donated 50,000 cedis, while Transport Minister Asensu Boakye - who comes from the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) - gave 10,000 cedis.",
      "Welcoming the donations, Mr Sarfo said the cash was used to fund their activities - including paying for rubbish disposal and buying fuel for their tricycle to transport rubbish to a refuse site.",
      "Politically non-partisan, the Buz Stop Boys' sole focus is on realising their vision of a cleaner Ghana - one street at a time.",
      "\"Individuals should take up initiatives because waiting for government hasn't worked over the decades and the records also show that in the event of an environmental disaster we as citizens suffer the most,\" Mr Sarfo said.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 10:06:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Cheers\" actor's new series is the Netflix comedy \"A Man on the Inside,\" in which he plays a retired widower-turned-investigator who goes undercover in a nursing home.",
    "story": [
      "Sitting down to talk about his new TV show, Ted Danson admits he is nervous. Why? \"Because I want people to see it, I really do,\" he said. \"I think it's an important conversation.\"",
      "It's strange to think of Danson as nervous about anything, but in this case, it's not hard to see why: his latest project means a lot to him, about a subject that touches everyone. In the new Netflix series \"A Man on the Inside,\" Danson is a recently-retired widower without much to do, until he answers an ad from a private investigator, and becomes a mole inside a nursing home.",
      "Like a lot of TV series, the premise seems a little far-fetched, but this one's true: it's based on \"The Mole Agent,\" a 2020 documentary about a real-life 83-year-old who goes undercover in a Chilean nursing home looking for signs of patients being mistreated. What the documentary found was a group of elderly people fighting loneliness and loss with heart and humor.",
      "\"A Man on the Inside\" is no different, says series creator Mike Schur. \"I would say the purpose of this show is simply to discuss a subject that very few people discuss, which is aging,\" said Schur. \"It's this subject that we just don't like to talk about. It's thought of in this country (I think more than other countries) as something almost shameful or embarrassing.\"",
      "\"If you're dying, you somehow made a mistake,\" said Danson.",
      "\"You screwed up! Yeah, you screwed up, you got old, you know?\" Schur said. \"And I think that's weird, because this is what happens if we're lucky. If we're lucky, we get old!\"",
      "At 76, Danson himself is aging gracefully, with an attitude inspired by a Hollywood legend: Jane Fonda. \"She was turning 80, and at 70 I was starting to go, 'Well, I'd better look for a nice place to land, you know, this life plane,' or whatever,\" he said. \"And I looked at her and it was like, no. She has her foot on the gas pedal! She's, like, doing a 12-hour day, shooting her show, jumping on a bus to go, you know, support the service industry in Sacramento with a handful of women.",
      "\"Don't slow down, just keep going, keep living your life. I think that's one of the things our elders can pass on to us. This is how you live life right up until the end.\"",
      "Seems like Danson's elders set a good example: his parents wouldn't allow a TV in their home. \"My mother didn't like them,\" he said. \"She'd rather you read, or go out and play, or be creative.\"",
      "But then, Danson got famous, on TV. \u00a0His parents finally got one. \"But they put kind of this beautiful tapestry over the front of it, so when you walked in their house, you didn't see a TV, you saw this beautiful tapestry with a candle on top, and they would take it off and watch 'Cheers,'\" he said.",
      "Danson still credits his success today to that one show about a Boston bar. But since he hung up his bartender apron in 1993, he's been in hit after hit. He was the title character in \"Becker.\" In \"Damages,\" he held his own with Glenn Close. He went to heaven and hell in \"The Good Place.\" And he's even played himself in \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"",
      "Along the way Danson has used his fame to draw attention to his passion project, Oceana, an organization dedicated to preserving the world's oceans. Asked if he feels they have made progress, he replied, \"Yes. I mean, our focus is fishing, over-fishing, making sure that the fisheries of the world are healthy. Because if done right, you could feed a billion people a fish meal every day.\"",
      "That sounds a little like a miracle \u2013 something he touches on in his new show, and something he says he lives with every day.",
      "Asked what are the miracles in his life, Danson replied, \"Mary Steenburgen is, you know, literally heaven-sent. I did some work on myself for about a year before I met her, after 'Cheers,' becoming emotionally mature and real. And I worked hard at it. And then along came Mary Steenburgen. \u2026 We are so blessed. To love somebody and to be loved, is just one of those heaven-on-earth miracles, you know? And that came with Mary.\"",
      "And the idea Ted Danson is hoping to share with his latest project is that miracles can be found in any life, right up until the very end. \"This is your life,\" he said, \"not just up to, you know, 65 and then you retire and are going down. No, you get to live right up until you don't live. And it's your life. It's such a gift. Explore it, and be excited about it. Yes, it hurts. Yes, it's sad. Yes, there's grief. Yes, there's all of that. But embrace it. Embrace it, is kind of what I think the message of the show is. It's what I hope I live with.\"",

      "The investigation included nine raids on homes in the region and dozens of interviews with hotel staff, Payne's family and friends and experts in the fields of medicine, biochemistry and psychiatry, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators also reviewed more than 800 hours of video footage from the hotel and public roads and conducted a forensic analysis of Payne's cell phone to review his digital footprint in the period leading up to his death.",
      "An autopsy was also conducted. After that, Payne's body was returned to his father, Geoff Payne, who had been in Argentina since the day after his son's death.",

      "All of the information gathered by investigators was summarized into a 180-page report presented to Judge Laura Bruniard, who oversees criminal cases. Bruniard approved the charges against the three people, but the investigation will continue, the prosecutor's office said, as investigators continue to try to access Payne's other personal devices.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 13:30:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",
      "Making the enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over 10 years,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CBO.",

      "Dr. Shai Efrati runs this clinic, where they're treating up to 350 patients a day, and are on the forefront of this sort of medicine. \"What we are doing is actually tricking the body,\" Efrati said. \"Hypoxia, lack of oxygen, is the most powerful trigger to induce all the repair mechanism cascade.\"",
      "Efrati says they're inducing repair mechanisms in the body and brain inside these pressurized chambers, where it feels like you're scuba diving down to 30 feet. Patients breathe in pure oxygen, which under such high-pressure conditions the body can absorb at up to 16 times the normal level. Then, masks are removed for five-minute intervals.",
      "Efrati said, \"The decline from very high back to the normal is being interpreted at the similar level as hypoxia, as lack of oxygen. That causes the body to trigger the stem cells, and for the first time even in humans, we can see generation of new neurons, generation of new blood vessels in the brain. And this is mind-blowing.\"",
      "The treatment has been described as \"unapproved\" and \"not proven.\" \"When we speak about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, this is how it should look like,\" Efrati said.",
      "\"You're saying there are a lot of frauds out there?\" asked Doane.",
      "\"Indeed. And this is not only not good, it can be even dangerous.\"",
      "Dr. Efrati is constantly experimenting with new ways to use this treatment. At his clinic near Tel Aviv, we got to see how they're catering hyperbaric medicine to athletes (\"If we can shorten the recovery period, you can push harder doing the exercises\"), and helping patients with brain injuries regain movement through the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain.",
      "\"It's not that we are fixing his running,\" Efrati said about one athlete's performance. \"We are fixing the brain.\"",
      "They've published several studies, looking at PTSD in veterans. One, out today, found that 68% of patients showed significant improvement. Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",
      "For Mizrhai, the treatment changed everything:\" \"It's the first time that I was feeling again. I begin to sleep at night, I was less afraid. It's make me feel alive again. \u2026 I was a dying man, and after this, I'm a living man.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Congressman and medical doctor Greg Murphy said, \"If it's being offered in Israel and they're getting such good results, why the hell are we not offering it in the United States?\"",
      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",
      "In 2023 he introduced the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act. \"We just basically want the VA to do a pilot study within their own confines to see whether they show that hyperbaric oxygen works or not,\" he said.",
      "And what is he hearing from the VA? \"They just don't want to do anything; it's just hands up,\" he said. \"The reasons that we've heard is, 'Well, the results are mixed.' Fine. Look at the results in the last 15 years. Look at the studies in Israel. We are seeing an absolute effect in this, and other disorders, for Parkinson's, migraines, some even MS, neurological disorders.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" requested an interview with the Department of Veterans Affairs, but they declined to comment.",
      "In Salt Lake City, Utah, we met Dr. Lin Weaver, who runs Hyperbaric Medicine at Intermountain Health. They treat about 20 patients a day, which puts into perspective the huge numbers - 350 daily \u2013 being treated in Israel. \u00a0He says they use their hyperbaric chambers for PTSD patients rarely, because it is expensive, but he has seen positive results: \"I've had patients that I've treated. Every one has got surprisingly better,\" Weaver said.",
      "But insurance companies say there is not enough proof it works for PTSD. And in the U.S., out-of-pocket costs soar above $50,000.",
      "\"What's necessary is like a drug trial,\" Weaver said. \"But these trials take years to accomplish. It all rests with, 'Is there an initiative? And is there a funding source?'\"",
      "Doane asked, \"But if doctors like you feel so strongly that this works, why isn't there enough push coming from folks like you to say, 'Prove this'?\"",
      "\"Well, believe me, we've tried,\" Weaver replied. \"I have submitted proposals to extramural funding agencies. So far, they haven't accepted them.\"",
      "Doane asked Dr. Efrati, \"You are out on the frontier here of medicine. Is there a danger in that?\"",
      "\"As a scientist, I will always tell you I need more study, I need more data,\" he replied. \"But as a physician, when I'm sitting in front of you looking at your eyes, you have a problem now. This is our job as a physician.\"",
      "Idit Negrin says this treatment is giving her hope she can move past that nightmare at the Nova Music Festival. She hopes, with the therapy, she can move on with her life.",
      "But she wears a reminder \u2013 a Nova necklace \u2013 while she gets treatment. \"I don't get her off my neck,\" she said.",
      "Her progress is motivation for Dr. Efrati to keep innovating, thinking about the future so his patients can process the past.",
      "Doane said, \"Some people are gonna listen to this and say it sounds too good to be true.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I know,\" said Negrin. \"But it's fact.\"",

    "summary": "Republicans' newly won control of the Senate may have buoyed Kennedy's odds of a role in the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",
      "As one example, podcast host Joe Rogan initially voiced support for Kennedy and his ideas before later endorsing Trump.",
      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",
      "Other potential HHS secretary picks",
      "However, Kennedy is not the only name that has been floated by Republicans for the top job at HHS.",
      "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suggested Wednesday his top health official, state surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo, could be a candidate. Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",
      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",
      "But people close to the campaign say few Trump surrogates and supporters have spent as much time with the president-elect as Kennedy or plotted as ambitious an agenda.",
      "The two spent hours flying together in the final stretch of the campaign. Kennedy was also in Florida after the election, huddling with the president-elect's top ranks to weigh potential candidates to fill the administration.",
      "\"He's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,\" Trump said on Wednesday morning after the election.",
      "Trump has previously said he's been friends with Kennedy \"for a long time\" and would let him \"go wild\" on many of his policy priorities, except for curbing fossil fuels.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,\" Trump said in New York on Oct. 27.",
      "Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform",
      "Kennedy's nomination would come at a key time for many of the issues he campaigned on, which he says underpin \"the chronic-disease crisis.\"",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of \"aggressive suppression\" of a range of products, including psychedelics \u2014 after MDMA failed to earn the agency's approval earlier this year \u2014 and raw milk, which officials have discouraged amid the ongoing bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",
      "His call for stopping water fluoridation comes as the Environmental Protection Agency is now facing a court order to take action against the practice.",
      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",
      "But were he to end up HHS secretary, some of Kennedy's aims would fall outside of his jurisdiction, like the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other responsibilities under the broad HHS umbrella could consume much of Kennedy's time, some allies worry, distracting from his priorities.",
      "\"Bobby is very action-oriented, brilliant, an excellent communicator, has a great grasp of details, and is a transformational leader. He is not, his skillset is not, as a bureaucrat administrator,\" said Dr. Robert Malone, a longtime Kennedy ally who was with him and Trump on election night.",
      "Malone said he had spoken with many of the aides from some of the \"at least four different HHS transition teams\" under Trump, but not personally with Kennedy, in recent weeks about the future of the department.",
      "He said he thought Kennedy would likely do better in a role at the White House, serving as a czar who could target specific issues across different departments.",
      "\"Make no mistake, what is being discussed is a major reimagining of the entire federal health research and promotion and protection infrastructure. That includes very significant reforms and changes in business practice,\" said Malone.",

With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 14:43:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Measure that would repeal so-called \"government pensions offset\" has been gaining support in House.",
    "story": [
      "The House is expected to try to pass a Social Security-related bill this week to ensure benefits for workers who are also eligible for other pensions, despite a surprise move by hard-right Freedom Caucus leaders to derail the effort.",
      "It's a quick turnaround to salvage what had been a bipartisan effort to pass the bill, called the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, during what's now the lame-duck post-election period of the Congress.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal the so-called \"government pensions offset,\" or GPO, which reduces Social Security spousal or widow(er) benefits for those who receive noncovered pensions, according to the Social Security Administration's\u00a0website.",
      "The summary also says the bill also eliminates the so-called \"windfall elimination provision\" that \"in some instances reduces Social Security benefits for individuals who also receive a pension or disability benefit from an employer that did not withhold Social Security taxes.\"",
      "Such pensions are paid by employers \u2014 typically, state and local governments or non-U.S. employers \u2014 that do not withhold Social Security taxes from employee salaries.",
      "\"The GPO reduces the spousal or widow(er) benefit by two-thirds of the monthly non-covered pension and can partially, or fully, offset an individual's spousal/widow(er) benefit, depending on the amount of the non-covered pension,\" according to SSA.gov.",
      "The bill would repeal the GPO provision and reinstate full Social Security benefits.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, an individual with a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security, who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension, would see their Social Security benefit reduced by $667, or two-thirds the non-covered pension amount. That leaves them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit.",
      "If the GPO measure is repealed, the same individual would be entitled to the entire $900 spousal benefit amount without an offset reduction.",
      "Does the bill have bipartisan support?",
      "Yes, the bill was introduced by a Republican, Rep. Garrett Graves of Louisiana, and a Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and it has gained support in the House. A robust 300 lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have signed on to it.",
      "Other groups have also supported the bill, such as the National Association of Counties, which represents county governments. That group says that eliminating the GPO would help county governments recruit workers at a time when many are facing labor shortages.",
      "What happened next to the bill?",
      "To force the legislation forward, the sponsors of the bill, Rep. Graves and Rep. Spanberger, this fall used a rarely successful process called a discharge petition.",
      "They collected the minimum 218 signatures needed from House lawmakers to dislodge the bill from committee and send it to the floor for a vote.",
      "The move is often seem as an affront to House leaders, particularly the House speaker and the majority leader who determine the floor schedule.",
      "But Spanberger and Graves \u2014 who both did not seek reelection \u2014 had little to lose. Besides, Johnson backed the bill before becoming speaker.",
      "Did the House Freedom Caucus block the Social Security bill?",
      "Two leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus intervened when the rest of Congress was away from Capitol Hill, mostly in home states for Election Day.",
      "The Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., and former chair Rep. Bob Goode, R-Va., used a routine pro forma session of the House on November 5 to swiftly table part of the measure.",
      "The Freedom Caucus tends to block new spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add some $196 billion to the federal deficit over a decade.",
      "Graves said that's the amount people are missing out on without reinstating full Social Security benefits.",
      "But in tabling the legislation the conservatives actually set back its procedural rule, but not the bill itself.",
      "The legislation is expected to move forward with a House vote anyway, possibly in the week ahead.",
      "Could the Social Security Fairness Act still pass?",
      "Yes, but that said, passage will now be tougher, requiring a supermajority threshold rather than a simple majority as had been planned under the rule that the Freedom Caucus leaders turned back.",
      "If it passes the House, it's unclear if the bill has enough support to clear the Senate. But the wide margin in the House indicates potentially broad support.",
      "It would then go to President Joe Biden's desk. If signed into law, the summary says the changes are effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 13:30:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",
      "Making the enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over 10 years,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CBO.",

      "\"We have been planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly,\" CEO Edward Rosenfeld told analysts on the call. \"We've worked hard over a multiyear period to develop our factory base and our sourcing capability in alternative countries, like Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, etc.\"",
      "The company started implementing the plan Wednesday, Rosenfeld said. Currently, more than 70% of Steve Madden U.S.'s imports are from China. Rosenfeld aims to cut that figure by 40%-45%, up from a target of 10%.",
      "Trump has proposed a 60% tax on imports from China, plus a universal tariff of 10%-20% on imports from all foreign countries.",
      "If imposed, the proposed tariffs on imports could lead to consumers paying $6.4 billion to $10.7 billion more for footwear, according to a\u00a0new analysis\u00a0from the National Retail Federation.

He also called for an investigation from \"the appropriate authorities\" into \"market manipulators or short sellers,\" whom executives at the company and shareholders have previously blamed for volatility in the stock, which trades under the ticker symbol DJT.",
      "DJT shares jumped shortly after Trump's post, gaining as much as 16% on Friday. The stock rose $3.15, or 11.4%, to $30.84 in early afternoon trading, partly reversing a 23% plunge on Thursday that had trimmed some of the company's gains in the run-up to the November 5 election.",
      "Trump, who is the biggest shareholder of Trump Media with a 57% stake, said the business has been the target of \"probably illegal rumors and/or statements\" that he said allege he plans to sell shares of the company, which owns the Truth Social platform. In September, Trump had vowed not to sell his stake after a lock-up period expired for Trump Media insiders, allowing them to sell for the first time since the stock went public in March.",
      "Trump Media, whose DJT ticker is the same as Trump's initials, has seen extreme volatility on Nasdaq, with its shares swinging wildly on news related to the president-elect. That has prompted comparisons of DJT with meme stocks, or companies that trade on social media buzz rather than financial fundamentals such as revenue and profit growth.",
      "Trump's call for an investigation into trading of the stock highlight potential conflicts of interest between his role as the nation's chief executive and his business interests, with his holdings in the company valued at $3.6 billion as of Friday afternoon.

A blind trust is managed by an independent trustee, and the president or other official who created the trust isn't allowed to advise or consult with the trustee on business decisions.",

(Weisselberg was\u00a0released from jail\u00a0in July after pleading guilty to giving false testimony about the size of Trump's triplex apartment as part of a civil fraud trial.)",

      "\"Obviously, investors believe there is going to be a significant increase in opportunity for both of these firms under the Trump administration,\" Noble Capital Markets analyst Joe Gomes told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Geo Group executives acknowledged on the company's third-quarter earnings call Thursday that it expects the incoming administration to enact stricter border security policies and that the company stands \"ready to provide additional resources to help ICE meet future needs.\"",
      "CoreCivic executives also said they believe the election result will drive demand for its services.",
      "ICE is biggest customer",
      "During Trump's first term in office, from 2017-2021, immigration detention expanded at record levels, according to an ACLU report. In 2019, ICE detained an average of over 50,000 people each day. At times, that number exceeded 56,000 \u2014 about 50% more than peak levels during the Obama administration, according to the report. During his first term in office, Trump expanded the federal government's use of private prison companies to detain immigrants.",
      "As of January 2020, 81% of people detained in ICE custody across the U.S. were held in facilities owned or managed by private prison corporations, according to the ACLU report.",
      "In his second term, President-elect Trump promises a radical shift in policy at the U.S.-Mexico border from his predecessor. That includes a pledge to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history, which could bring significantly more business to CoreCivic and Geo Group.",
      "For the first nine months of 2024, ICE accounted for 30% of each company's revenue.",
      "Both Geo Group and CoreCivic said they currently have excess capacity to accommodate a larger population of detainees. CoreCivic executives noted that they're taking steps to prepare to activate additional capacity to meet ICE's needs. That could include reconfiguring facilities to accommodate a bigger intake area, they noted.",
      "\"There is room for an uptick in occupancy from a capacity standpoint and both companies expect an ask from the Trump administration for more beds. The question is how much, and we just don't know right now,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Brian Violino told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Monitoring",
      "Geo Group also provides monitoring services for ICE under its Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), a monitoring program using wearable technology that serves as an alternative to detention.",
      "\"If there is a finite number of beds and a significant number of people are detained, which Trump is discussing in his plans, there could be an increased usage in this alternative to detention,\" Violino said.",
      "Geo Group executives said they have the necessary technology and staffing resources to scale up the contract to more than several million participants, if necessary.",
      "Funding from Congress",
      "The degree to which ICE expands its contracts with the two largest private prison companies depends on how big of an increase in funding Congress authorizes. While Republicans won the Senate majority in Tuesday's election, it remains to be seen which party will obtain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "\"That's a big part of the story, and if it's a Republican sweep, it will be easier for Trump to get funding from Congress to support this operation he's looking to do,\" Violino said.",

    "story": [
      "Between finding openings, sending out your resume and interviewing, looking for a job is tough. Now a growing trend of\u00a0scammers\u00a0impersonating recruiters is making it even harder.",
      "In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised.",
      "Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.",
      "\"We've really seen tremendous growth in job scams,\" Velasquez said. \"I think that's just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.\"",
      "It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.",
      "After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she'd need for the job.",
      "A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That's when she learned the job was a scam.",
      "\"I'm a little traumatized,\" said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.",
      "If you're a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers:",
      "Job scams are a type of\u00a0impersonation scam.",
      "Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.",
      "\"They're going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,\" she said. \"And they're often saying it's a 100% remote position because that's so appealing to people.\"",
      "Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver's license details.",
      "The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.",
      "Other details don't generally need to be shared with an employer until after you've gotten an offer.",
      "Whether you're replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn't initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.",
      "Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.",
      "Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:",
      "\u2014 Don't respond to the message right away.",
      "\u2014 Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.",
      "\u2014 Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.",
      "\u2014 If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.",
      "If you receive a message from a recruiter, it's best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.",
      "In Islam's case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.",
      "A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\"If you deposit a check and it's fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,\" Puig said.",
      "So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.",
      "When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.",
      "\"Don't let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,\" Velasquez said.",
      "After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter's email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.",
      "\"This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can't just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,\" Islam said.",
      "If you or a family member is a victim of a scam, it's good practice to report it on the\u00a0FTC's website.",

    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 13:41:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election is likely to have a major impact on the economy. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the November 5 election highlights the frustrations of millions of voters, with many Americans noting in\u00a0exit polls on Tuesday that they're still hurting from the highest inflation in 40 years and dissatisfied with the nation's economic trajectory.",
      "Trump ran on a campaign that vowed to tackle those issues, pledging to end the \"inflation nightmare\"\u00a0and to bring prices down \"very quickly.\" He also offered a myriad of tax cuts to various groups, ranging from senior citizens to homeowners, as well as to finance some of those cuts through new tariffs on imports from China and other nations and to\u00a0deport millions of undocumented immigrants.",
      "In the aftermath of Trump's win, economists and policy experts are assessing how those policies might impact the economy as well as consumers' wallets. Already, Wall Street is predicting that his policies could boost corporate growth, sending the S&P 500 higher by as much as 2.2% on Wednesday.",
      "But some experts note Trump's plans may also boost inflation, potentially hurting consumers who are hoping for relief at the checkout counter.",
      "\"The devil will be in the details,\" Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at investment bank Raymond James, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump tax, trade, tariff and immigration agenda could have significant economic impacts and raise concerns about a second wave of inflation.\"",
      "However, compromises or alterations to his plans \"could mitigate the impact,\" Mills added.",
      "To be sure, whether Trump can respond to voters' most pressing economic issues isn't certain, especially if the House of Representatives flips to Democratic control, which could stymie his plans to extend tax cuts that were enacted in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA) as well as to enact other changes.",
      "Here are five ways Trump's policies could impact the economy and your money.",
      "Your money under Trump's tax plans",
      "The core of Trump's tax plan is to extend the provisions in the TCJA that are set to expire at the end of 2025. These include the law's lowered tax brackets and expanded standard deduction.",
      "Trump also wants to provide deeper tax cuts for some individuals and businesses, with his campaign proposing lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%. He's floated the idea of eliminating personal income taxes on many types of earnings, from tips to Social Security benefits, but has yet to offer details.",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts, would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "If Trump is able to enact these tax code changes, personal income taxes would decline for all income groups. But the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model (That research assesses Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.)",
      "That means a middle-class family with earnings of about $80,000 a year would get a tax break of about $1,740 in 2026, the analysis found. Top-earning households, with incomes of more than $14 million, would see their taxes reduced by $376,910, according to Penn Wharton.",
      "What could happen with inflation?",
      "Consumers rank inflation as one of their biggest economic concerns, with many still feeling impact of soaring prices during the pandemic. Although the U.S. inflation rate has now fallen close to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal, many Americans still describe it as high because prices haven't come down; rather, prices are simply rising more slowly than they did during the pandemic.",
      "Economists have cautioned that Trump's plans could reignite inflation. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by American consumers, rather than the countries that export goods to the U.S. On top of that, Trump's plan to deport millions of immigrants could also boost inflation as employers would likely face higher wages due to a labor crunch.",
      "\"Two main pillars of his policy proposals, tariffs and mass deportations, are likely to cause prices to rise as they will make it more difficult for businesses to produce goods,\" Jacob Channel, chief economist at LendingTree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Trump's plan to levy a 10% tariff on all imports and 60% or more on Chinese goods shipped to the U.S. could add $1,700 a year in additional costs for a typical middle-class household, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump's plans could boost the inflation rate by as much 1 percentage point, bringing it to an annual rate of about 3.4% \u2014 above the Fed's 2% goal \u2014 according to Andrzej Skiba of RBC Global Asset Management.",
      "\"If you add 1% to next year's inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts,\" Skiba said.",
      "Could the economy grow faster?",
      "The economy could initially grow slightly faster under Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes, but that impact could fade over time, especially due to the impact of deporting millions of immigrants, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Real GDP growth could be 0.3 percentage points higher in 2026 than if current economic policies continued, wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a November 6 research note.",
      "But, he added, GDP growth could eventually fall to 0.6 percentage points lower in 2028 than earlier projections due to the impact of deportations and higher tariffs.",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Probably not, according to Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant.",
      "First, if Trump's plans reignite inflation as some economists are forecasting, the Federal Reserve may not continue lowering its benchmark rate. Without further cuts in borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, mortgage rates aren't likely to fall, she added.",
      "Second, deporting millions of undocumented immigrants could impact the housing sector \u2014 which already faces a severe shortage of homes \u2014 because it relies on these workers to build new homes, Sturtevant said.",
      "\"His mass deportation proposal would have a chilling effect on the construction industry, shrinking the already constrained labor force and stalling badly needed new housing construction,\" she said. \"At the same time, proposed tariffs will increase building costs.\"",
      "Will Trump's policies help your 401(k)?",
      "Possibly, given that Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts and support for lighter regulations on businesses, if enacted, could bolster company profits and lift the stock market.",
      "On Wednesday, indices including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average,\u00a0soared on Wall Street optimism for stronger corporate growth.",
      "\"Lower corporate taxes and/or deregulation of the energy and financial sectors under a Trump administration could provide additional support,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Other financial instruments could also get a boost, including cryptocurrencies, due to Trump's pledge to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "At the same time, much of these forecasts depend on Trump pushing through changes to the tax code, regulations and other laws, Channel noted.",
      "\"Virtually all of these policies will be tough to implement, even with Republican control over the House, the Senate and the presidency,\" he said. \"With that in mind, we might not see much change at all in the broader economy.\"",
      "He added, \"Inaction from the next Trump administration could mean that the economy continues to chug along its current course.\"",

      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",

      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",

After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",

    "story": [
      "As President-elect Donald Trump readies to return to the Oval Office, U.S. retailers that depend on foreign suppliers are prepared to pass along the cost of his proposed import tariffs to consumers, potentially leading to higher prices for a range of products.",
      "Americans stand to lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods due to the new tariffs, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released Monday.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said\u00a0in a statement. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",

      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy - and your money",
      "For example, a $40 toaster oven would retail for $48 to $52 after the tariffs, while a $50 pair of running shoes would jump to to $59 to $64, according to the industry trade group. A $2,000 mattress and box spring set would cost $2,128 to $2,190, the NRF said.",
      "During President-elect Trump's first term in office, his administration imposed tariffs of up to 25% on more than $360 billion in products from China. President Joe Biden's White House kept most of those tariffs and added more onto goods including Chinese electric cars and microchips.",
      "Now, Trump has said he plans to impose a 60% tax on goods from China and a 10% to 20% levy on all of the $3 trillion in foreign goods the U.S. imports annually. Such sweeping tariffs would reignite inflation, as they would mostly be paid by U.S. consumers, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, offering a general view widely\u00a0shared by\u00a0other economists on both sides of the political aisle.",
      "\"A consistent theoretical and empirical finding in economics is that domestic consumers and domestic firms bear the burden of a tariff, not the foreign country,\" the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University stated in an\u00a0analysis published in mid-October.",
      "Trump has repeatedly contended that foreign companies would foot the bill, telling a gathering last month at the Economic Club of Chicago that \"the countries will pay\" the tariffs. In reality, American importers pay the tariffs to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency when their goods cross the border.",
      "\"These policy steps would amount to regressive tax cuts, only partially paid for by regressive tax increases,\" and cost a typical middle-income household about $1,700 in increased taxes a year,\" according to economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The proposed tariffs would shift tax burdens from the well-off to lower-income Americans, the nonprofit also stated in a policy\u00a0brief\u00a0published in August.",
      "For now, it is unclear when the new Trump regime could seek to stiffen tariffs. The process to complete legislation required to raise the levies could take nearly a year, so any adverse impact might not be felt until 2026, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Harvard University professor and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers questioned the wisdom of taxing imports, noting the potential impact on prices. \"For parents, we're coming up on the holiday season and most of our toys are imported from China,\" Summers tweeted on Thanksgiving Day.",
      "Trump has argued that tariffs compel American companies to make goods on U.S. soil rather than purchasing from foreign suppliers.",
      "But some companies have other plans.",
      "\"If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer,\" Philip Daniele, CEO of vehicle parts supplier AutoZone,\u00a0told\u00a0Wall Street analysts in an earnings call in late September. \"We'll generally raise prices ahead of \u2014 we know what the tariffs will be \u2014 we generally raise prices ahead of that,\" Daniele said.",
      "Major suppliers to AutoZone include companies based in China, India and Germany, according to the company.",
      "Stanley Black & Decker CEO Donald Allan Jr.\u00a0said\u00a0last week his tool-producing company has been planning for the possibility of additional tariffs on imports since the spring. \"Obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we [would] put into the market.\"",
      "Allan downplayed the idea of moving manufacturing back to the U.S., saying it would not be cost-effective. The company's options could include \"moving production and aspects of the supply chain to different parts of the world,\" including from China to other parts of Asia and possibly Mexico, the executive said.",
      "Such a shift has already been made by Shelton, Connecticut-based Acme United, which now has its Westcott brand products like rulers made in Thailand and the Philippines, avoiding the tariffs targeting China, CEO Walter Johnsen said in an October earnings call.",
      "Acme has switched production of certain medical products to India, Egypt and U.S. plants in Florida, North Carolina and Washington state, the executive said.",
      "Businesses have also stocked up, placing bigger-than-usual import orders ahead of new tariffs taking hold, as the U.S. imported 11% more Chinese products in July and August than they did during the same two-month period a year ago, according to the Census Bureau.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Senate Republicans prepare to vote Wednesday on new leadership for the upcoming Congress, President-elect Donald Trump is already weighing in with demands for the new majority leader regarding his Cabinet.",
      "After a decisive victory in the 2024 elections, Trump is returning to the White House with a GOP-led Senate at his side. Senate Republican leaders are expected to ease the way for the president-elect's agenda and his Cabinet and judicial nominees. Trump has made it clear that he'd like his nominees to be installed immediately, suggesting that he may want the option to bypass the Senate's advice and consent role entirely.",
      "Trump weighs in on recess appointments",
      "Perhaps the biggest factor remaining in the leadership race is whether Trump himself weighs in on the candidates. On Sunday, he stepped into the conversation, demanding in a Truth Social post that anyone seeking the position as leader \"must agree to Recess Appointments.\"",
      "Recess appointments enable a president to temporarily install nominees without the Senate confirmation process. Trump argued in a post on social media that without recess appointments, \"we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner.\"",
      "\"We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\" the president-elect said.",
      "The Constitution's Recess Appointment Clause grants presidents the ability to \"fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate.\" The maneuver is considered to be a way to make swift appointments during the Senate's absence, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service, which notes that recess appointments have also been used for political reasons \u2014 for instance, to make an appointment on a temporary basis for an individual who would not be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "With a GOP majority of at least 52 seats, Trump shouldn't have too much difficulty getting his nominations through the chamber through the regular process. But pushback from a handful of Republicans like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Todd Young of Indiana or Sen.-elect John Curtis of Utah could imperil some of his more controversial picks. The process could also be delayed by Democrats in the minority, who could rely on procedural maneuvers to extend the time it takes for Trump's Cabinet to be confirmed.",
      "But the recess appointment maneuver is a controversial one that both parties have combated in recent years. Recess appointments are allowed only when the Senate is out of session for 10 days. For the last decade, both chambers have headed off recess appointments by going into pro-forma sessions even when lawmakers are in recess. And a Supreme Court decision in 2014 gave the Senate more authority to prevent the maneuver, after controversial recess appointments by President Barack Obama.",
      "If Trump were to make an appointment during a recess in the first session of the new Congress, the appointment could last for almost two years, after which the individual could be appointed again through a recess appointment or the regular process, according to the CRS report. But without the Senate's approval, the appointee would not be paid.",
      "Should Republicans force a change to procedure in the upper chamber, they would do so with the risk that Democrats will take the same steps in their favor when they regain the majority. Still, all three candidates for GOP leader threw their support behind Trump's demand for recess appointments on Sunday.",
      "The candidates for Senate majority leader",
      "Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, are considered the front-runners in the race to replace Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. But Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has seen a surge of support from members of Trump's orbit \u2014 from Tucker Carlson to Elon Musk \u2014 that has drawn increased attention to the race.",
      "Thune, 63, is currently the No. 2 Republican and considered by some to be the favorite in the race. He's been in the Senate since 2004 and served as GOP whip since 2021. But he hasn't always had a strong relationship with Trump, and initially backed Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina for president in the GOP primaries.",
      "Cornyn, 72, has been in the Senate since 2002 and previously served as the Republican whip from 2013 to 2019. His fundraising chops have made him a top candidate in the Senate leadership race. But like Thune, he's previously distanced himself from Trump \u2014 a gap both senators have sought to close in recent months.",
      "Meanwhile, Scott has been angling for the position. The Florida Republican challenged McConnell for the role after the midterm elections in 2022, when he earned the support of just 10 members of his conference. Scott is similarly expected to find support from some of the conference's conservative members in this year's contest, and the outside endorsements from those who claim Cornyn and Thune are too close to McConnell could be a boon.",
      "Electing the \"next generation of leadership\"",
      "The leadership election comes after McConnell's decision to step away after 17 years at the helm, becoming the longest serving Senate leader in history.",
      "McConnell's decision to step aside and welcome \"the next generation of leadership\" teed up a high-stakes race for leader that has been shaking out behind the scenes since February. After Republicans flipped the Senate, the leadership race took on even greater importance.",
      "\"I had really hoped I'd be able to hand over to my successor the majority,\" McConnell told reporters at a news conference last week. \"I've been the majority leader, I've been the minority leader \u2013 majority's a lot better.\"",
      "Outside influence and endorsements",
      "The race, nine months in the making, has begun to draw input from outsiders in recent days. Tucker Carlson, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are among the Trump loyalists who have weighed in to back Scott, urging that he is best suited to carry out the president-elect's agenda.",
      "How the input from prominent outsiders weighs on the race remains to be seen. Senate Republicans will meet behind closed doors to elect the new leader, casting secret ballots, which make senators less likely to be swayed by external pressures.",
      "For months, the three candidates have been working behind the scenes to persuade their colleagues to back them for the chamber's top post. And so far, just a small portion of the Republican conference has shared publicly who they plan to support.",
      "Thune has the backing of Sens. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, along with Steve Daines of Montana, who chaired the GOP campaign arm, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, this cycle and may have valuable sway with new members whose races he buoyed. Meanwhile, Cornyn has the support of Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. And Scott has the backing of Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. In recent days, he also earned endorsements from Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee \u2014 two senators who have been floated as possible picks for Trump's cabinet.",
      "The bulk of the conference has yet to weigh in publicly, and likely won't be swayed by outsiders on a decision that will guide how the chamber operates for the next two years. But an endorsement of a candidate from Trump himself, who will work with the leader going forward, could change the dynamic.",
      "Whether Trump endorses a particular candidate remains to be seen. Thune acknowledged on CNBC last week that Trump can \"exert a considerable amount of influence\" on the leadership race, but he cautioned him against doing so, saying, \"I think my preference would be, and I think it's in his best interest, to stay out of that.\"",
      "\"He's got to work with all of us when it's all said and done,\" Thune said. \"But whatever he decides to do, that's going to be his prerogative, as we know.\"",

She's likely to be confirmed by the new, GOP-led Senate when the president-elect takes office in January, which will set up a race not only to fill Stefanik's seat in the lower chamber, but also to succeed her as chair of the Republican conference.",
      "\"I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,\" Trump said in a statement to CBS News. \"Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.\"",
      "Here is what to know about the New York Republican.",
      "Stefanik's record in Congress",
      "Stefanik was elected to represent New York's 21st Congressional District in 2014 and at the age of 30, became the youngest woman elected to Congress. Currently in her fifth term, she cruised to reelection in November, defeating Democrat Paula Collins with more than 62% of the vote.",
      "Stefanik serves on the Armed Services, Education and Workforce, and Intelligence Committees. She also is a member of the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, which was created in 2023 when Republicans took control of the House. The weaponization panel was a nod to what many Republicans believed was federal investigators' unfair treatment of Trump.",
      "The New York Republican is the highest-ranking woman in the House, serving in leadership as the GOP conference chair. She replaced former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming in the post after Cheney was ousted for her criticisms of Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Stefanik has been one of Trump's staunchest defenders in the House, having emerged as a crucial ally during his first impeachment proceedings in 2019. She also introduced a nonbinding resolution last year that sought to \"expunge\" both of Trump's impeachments by the House.",
      "During this Congress, Stefanik made headlines for her grilling of university presidents during a hearing about their response to antisemitic incidents following the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks on Israel by Hamas. The presidents of Harvard, Stefanik's alma mater, and the University of Pennsylvania resigned following the hearing.",
      "While Stefanik supported earlier packages sending assistance to Ukraine, she voted against a plan to send $60.8 billion to aid Ukraine in its war against Russia in April.",
      "Stefanik and the 2020 election",
      "The congresswoman was among a group of more than 100 House Republicans who signed onto a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the Supreme Court after the 2020 election in a longshot bid to overturn the election results in four battleground states. She also joined GOP lawmakers in objecting to certifying Pennsylvania's election results.",
      "\"Tens of millions of Americans are concerned that the 2020 election featured unconstitutional overreach by unelected officials and judges, ignoring state election laws,\" Stefanik said during a speech on the House floor after the Capitol attack. \"We can and we should peacefully discuss these concerns.\"",
      "But the congresswoman also condemned the violence of Jan. 6 during the same speech, calling it a \"truly tragic day\" for the country.",
      "\"We all join together in fully condemning the dangerous violence and destruction that occurred today in our nation's Capitol,\" she said. \"Americans will always have the freedom of speech and the Constitutional right to protest, but violence in any form is absolutely unacceptable, it is anti-American, and must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Stefanik would not commit to certifying the results of the election, telling NBC News in January it would depend on whether \"this is a legal and valid election.\"",
      "Stefanik before Congress",
      "Stefanik graduated from Harvard University and worked in the White House for President George W. Bush on the Domestic Policy Council and in the chief of staff's office. She also was an adviser to former House Speaker Paul Ryan during the 2012 presidential campaign, when he was the Republican vice presidential nominee.",
      "Stefanik and her husband, Matt, have one son, Sam.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 10:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Tom Homan, Trump's newly-named \"border czar,\" recently told CBS how he'd carry out a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.",
    "story": [
      "Tom Homan, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to be his incoming administration's \"border czar,\" is a veteran immigration official and immigration hawk whose law enforcement career spans decades.",
      "Once a police officer in New York state and Border Patrol agent, the Obama administration tapped him to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch in 2013. During Homan's time at ICE under President Obama, the agency carried out record numbers of formal deportations. Obama gave Homan a Presidential Rank Award, the highest civil service recognition.",
      "Trump early in his first term named Homan acting director of ICE. He quickly generated controversy when he suggested undocumented immigrants \"should be afraid\" under the Trump administration.",
      "Homan was one of the masterminds of the first Trump administration's infamous \"zero tolerance\" policy, which led to the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents. The parents were prosecuted for illegal entry, while the children were sent to shelters for unaccompanied minors \u2014 without a plan to reunite them. He was one of the three officials who signed the policy memo that then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen approved to greenlight the separations. He left ICE in June 2018.",
      "During an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" last month, Homan outlined how the U.S. government would carry out the largest deportation operation in American history, one of Trump's signature pledges on the campaign trail.",
      "\"It's not threatening to the immigrant community,\" Homan said of Trump's campaign promise. \"It should be threatening to the illegal immigrant community. But on the heels of [a] historic illegal immigration crisis. That has to be done.\"",
      "He suggested to CBS News correspondent Cecilia Vega that he would target criminals and national security threats first, and then seek to deport non-criminal migrants who are in the country illegally and are ordered deported. That would require reversing Biden administration rules that currently instruct ICE to focus on arresting and deporting serious criminals, national security threats and recent border crossers and that effectively shield undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for a long time without committing serious crimes from deportation.",
      "Homan also indicated he would revive large-scale immigration arrests at workplaces, which the Biden administration discontinued in 2021. \"That's gonna be necessary,\" he said of worksite immigration enforcement.",
      "But Homan said the deportation operation would not involve \"concentration camps\" or a \"mass sweep of neighborhoods.\"",
      "Asked if mass deportations could be carried out without separating families, Homan said, \"Of course there is. Families can be deported together.\" One study shows roughly 4 million U.S. citizen children live with an undocumented parent.",

      "The young family traveled from southern Mexico to the House of Mercy and All Nations shelter in the northern Mexican border city of Nogales, joining other migrants from across Latin America. Half of them are children. All of them have one objective: finding work and safety in the U.S.",
      "Castro Santos, 22, said he and his wife, Fatima Gonzalez Hernandez, 19, decided to leave Guerrero, Mexico, because of \"the crime and the risk to the children\" there. \"To protect them,\" he added in Spanish, looking at his young children.",
      "Tens of thousands of migrants are estimated to be in Mexico, hoping to enter America, including through a program that allows them to use a smartphone app to request a time to be vetted, processed and admitted by American border officials. The system was established by the Biden administration to dissuade migrants from crossing the border illegally, but many are now worried that President-elect Donald Trump will make it much harder for them to make it into the U.S. at all.",

If allowed into the U.S., he said his family would like to settle in Houston, where his sister lives. He said he would like to learn how to cook and work in a restaurant.",

      "U.S. officials worry that Trump's election will end the months-long lull in illegal border crossings, which plunged this year following an aggressive effort by Mexican officials to interdict migrants and President Biden's move in June to make most of those crossing into the country illegally ineligible for asylum. Larger numbers of migrants, officials have said, could be incentivized to cross into the U.S. unlawfully in the coming weeks, before Trump takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Alba Jaramillo, a Tucson-based immigration attorney, said Trump's win and the potential end to the CBP One system, could prompt more migrants to cross the southern border without authorization, including along dangerous parts of the Arizona desert where some perish trying to make it into the U.S.",

      "For Tom Barrett, a military veteran who won a competitive race for a vacated seat in the Michigan 7th Congressional District, it has been impossible to simply open all of the text messages.",
      "Barrett told CBS News, \"I can't even tell you how many phone calls I've received in the last couple of days. I probably received 1,000 text messages just on election night. I haven't read them all.\"",
      "Barrett, a Michigan state senator from the Lansing area, bested a Democratic challenger in one of the most heated and expensive House races in the Midwest. Barrett said he is hesitant to make any demands of his new colleagues.",
      "\"I joked to House Speaker Mike Johnson that as long as my seat is on the floor \u2014 and not in the upper Gallery \u2014 I won't complain,\" Barrett said.",

      "After an exhausting campaign in which he and his campaign volunteers touted that they knocked on 200,000 doors, Democrat Josh Riley said he was looking forward to one quiet, post-election night with his 4-year-old son.",
      "\"He's getting an apple juice, I'm getting a beer and we're going to watch a Cornell hockey game,\" Riley said.",
      "Riley won one of the most expensive House races in the nation, defeating first-term Republican Marc Molinaro in an 11-county swath of upstate New York, spanning from Cooperstown to Binghamton and the distant New York City exurbs.",
      "Arriving at a tumultuous moment in Washington, Riley said he will not try to compete with Trump or his powerful colleagues for a spotlight.\u00a0 Riley told CBS News, \"I'm not searching for a way to stand out. If I do this job successfully, people in upstate New York will have more job opportunities and good wages.\"",

      "Bresnahan edged a veteran House Democrat to secure the seat representing the Scranton area of Pennsylvania. He leads an electrical and construction business, while also working in real estate development.\u00a0 His introduction to politics included an unexpected stress: Bresnahan said his fianc\u00e9e, a local television news anchor, worked as the same broadcast outlet on which his opponent aired attack ads against him.",
      "\"I give her so much credit for being able to, you know, watch the horrible things that were being said about me,\" Breshnahan said.",
      "Bresnahan was one of two Republicans to oust Democratic House incumbents in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Those victories gave Republicans an edge in securing a majority control of the House, which could turbocharge Trump's legislative agenda in 2025.",

      "\"If you want lasting change, you have to do it in a bipartisan fashion,\" he said. \"If you change something and it's unpalatable to the other side, they're just going to come and kick it out next time. And then the pendulum swings back and forth.\"",
      "Mackenzie, 42, is one of dozens of Members of Congress-elect who will represent politically-purple congressional districts, in which the opposing party is likely to muster a well-funded challenger in 2026.",
      "He will begin his new job, with an immediate potential political target on his back. \tMackenzie said his successful challenge to Wild was an expensive and grueling battle.",
      "\"In a close and competitive district, it was never going to be a blowout,\" he said. \"That's not the reality of this district. So we always knew it was going to be close, always competitive.\"",
      "Mackenzie has served in the Pennsylvania state legislature, focusing on financial services and banking issues, and would seek similar committee work next year in the House.

      "\"National conversation about Trump-this and Trump-that\"",
      "Kristen McDonald Rivet capped her victorious election week with a Friday trek to a cellphone store. Her 15-year-old son needed a cellphone repair, which was joking referred to as a \"national emergency.\"",
      "The mother of six already repaired some of the damage her party suffered Tuesday. McDonald Rivet, a state legislator in Michigan, won a competitive race for Michigan's 8th Congressional District in the Flint area. Trump prevailed in the 8th Congressional District and Democrats worried about their prospects there, because of the retirement of longtime Democratic Representative Dan Kildee, the latest in a family dynasty that's held the seat for decades.",
      "\"Here's the thing: My district voted for Donald Trump,\" McDonald Rivet told CBS News by phone, after returning from the cellphone store repair mission. \"There is a lot of national conversation about Trump-this and Trump-that.\u00a0 When we're working on things like prescription drugs, the cost of housing and lowering the cost of groceries, then I'm on board.I'm not going to get involved in the yelling and screaming and the stuff that makes politics awful.\"",
      "She paused a moment, relating to CBS News that it really is striking just how many groceries a 15-year-old son can consume. (She correctly fact-checked that the CBS News reporter's 14-year-old son was also prodigious at eating high volumes of food)",
      "McDonald Rivet arrives in Washington with years of experience in Michigan's state legislature in Lansing. \u00a0 \"I've spent my life working on issues, like creating economic security for families, particularly for kids. \u00a0 I started my career in Head Start.\u00a0 These issues are top of mind, including expansion of the child tax credit.\"",

    "summary": "Rep. Ro Khanna said Democrats \"need to be emphasizing the economic issues\" after bruising defeats in the 2024 election.",
    "story": [
      "Rep. Ro Khanna said Democrats \"need to be emphasizing the economic issues\" in the wake of the 2024 election, which delivered bruising blows to the party \u2014 and prompted a reckoning on the path forward.",
      "\"We did not have a compelling enough economic vision,\" Khanna, a California Democrat, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President-elect Donald Trump won a decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris last week, as the Democrats lost support from key demographic groups from the 2020 election. Khanna, a member of the party's progressive wing, attributed the fracturing among the Democratic coalition to the shortcomings in the party's economic message.",
      "\"The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans,\" Khanna said. \"Not just working-class Americans \u2014 a large slice of Americans who feel the American Dream has slipped away for their families and their kids.\"",
      "Khanna said new voices in Congress, like Reps. Pat Ryan, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Chris Deluzio, have encouraged that Democrats need to tell a \"better economic story,\" emphasizing a vision of raising the minimum wage, addressing child care and building new factories.",
      "\"I think that can unify our party \u2014 moderates and progressives \u2014 and it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, Black voters, White working class voters,\" Khanna said. \"And we have a better vision than Donald Trump on that.\"",
      "In the days since the election, some Democrats have expressed that the economic message should have been front and center in the campaign, while arguing that the party had a focus on identity politics. But Khanna said that while he's been clear on the importance of economic issues, \"I don't think we should run away\" from issues like standing up for transgender rights and equal rights.",
      "Khanna urged Democrats not to \"shy away from your convictions,\" adding that with the issues, along with a focus on the economy, the party can still be successful.",
      "\"I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us on a particular social issue,\" Khanna said.",
      "In Michigan, Harris lost key support in Arab American areas amid Israel's war in Gaza. Khanna said he believes that Harris would have won Michigan \"if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza.\" He added that he has seen that even \"beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives.\"",
      "Amid the hand wringing over the election, Democrats have also pointed to President Biden's late decision to leave the race and endorse Harris, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Khanna said while he has a \"lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi,\" he's \"chuckled\" at the idea.",
      "\"The day he got out, we had Democrats with the most over-the-top superlatives, comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing,\" Khanna said. \"So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory.\"",
      "Khanna said Harris' was a \"winnable campaign,\" adding that \"anyone who is saying now 'this was not a winnable campaign' didn't say that back in August.\"",
      "\"The reason we didn't win, ultimately, is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground\" on emphasizing economic issues, Khanna said. \"The reason I'm hopeful for the future is we have the substance.\"",

      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "As we wrap up campaign 2024, the scope of Republican control in Washington over the next few years is coming into focus. Overnight, CBS projected Donald Trump the winner in Arizona, giving him a complete electoral vote sweep of the seven battleground states.",
      "With a final tally of 312 electoral votes, Republicans scored their biggest White House win in 36 years. Republicans will also control the Senate with at least 52 seats, and there are two races that have not yet been called by CBS News. Control of the House is still to be determined with a few contests outstanding, but CBS News rates it as leaning Republican at this point.",

      "ROBERT COSTA: Great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "In recent days, I have spoken to president-elect Trump, called him up on the phone, along with his top advisers and allies. And what's notable about this transition is that, unlike in 2016, when he was elected as a Washington outsider, now he knows all the players in Washington.",
      "And he alone, more than any other aid, is evaluating the personnel and possibilities around him. And he reflected in one of our conversations about how he sees his mandate, that he has a movement and a base and now a party that's fully behind him. And he wants to make sure that anyone who comes on board has his same vision for that mandate and for his perceived level of support.",
      "And you have seen in recent days people around Trump in the wider orbit are trying to recommend a lot of names, but it's Trump himself who's saying to his top aides like Susie Wiles, his incoming chief of staff, that he wants to make sure that this is not a chaotic process and it's reflective of where he wants to go, more than any other kind of counsel.",
      "And on foreign policy, for example, you see names like Senator Bill Hagerty, Senator Marco Rubio, former Ambassador Ric Grenell, all people who identify with Trump's vision. But those who have had issues with Trump in the past about how he perceives foreign policy, like, for example, former Ambassador Nikki Haley or former Secretary Mike Pompeo, are now out of the process.",
      "And it's not because of any personal trouble with Trump, I'm told. It's because, at the end of the day, Trump wants to make sure things are moving along smoothly on ideological and policy lines come January.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do we know what it was with Mike Pompeo, who served him quite loyally for four years as CIA director and secretary of state? Was it his support, for example, of Ukraine?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: It's just a different orbit around Trump right now. The president-elect has people like Donald Trump Jr., Elon Musk. He has Steve Bannon on the outside advising him.",
      "These are people who are noninterventionists. These are people who aren't traditional Republican hawks. That's not to say some hawks won't end up in this administration or some Wall Street figures might end up in this administration as well.",
      "I'm told by my sources that the president-elect is not ruling out mainstream Republicans or more centrist Republicans from joining his team. But, at this point, he's moving quickly to make sure his base, his party, and his image is reflected in the personnel picks fully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What are his priorities for the 1st 100 days? Or is that too traditional a way of thinking about it?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: No, they have a real agenda this time. You remember, in 2017, it was somewhat sporadic in how they moved and navigated on health care and taxes.",
      "They are moving quickly already behind the scenes to expand the Trump tax cuts, to institute sweeping tariffs across the board. They're also going to try to, on foreign policy, begin negotiations with Ukraine and Russia sometime early next year. And you have mass deportations, more than anything, galvanizing the Trump people behind the scenes.",
      "Of course, they know it's going to be controversial. To remove undocumented migrants in a big way across the country could be logistically difficult and politically challenging, but they're moving ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bob Costa, thank you.",

      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: It's good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Donald Trump has this sweeping mandate, as do Republicans. Do you see this as an unrestrained presidency?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Oh, I think this is a presidency that has a mandate like we haven't seen, as you mentioned, in 36 years. The American public has spoken loud and clear. And",
      "I think if you go back to your interview with Bob, there are a number of places where Washington has been out of touch with the American people. You mentioned Ukraine. I think that's a great example. The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation.",
      "You think about it, we've sent $175 billion of U.S. aid to Ukraine. That's more than three times the entire annual budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. I have been one of the few senators in the United States Senate who has voted and has opposed every cent of this Ukraine aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I have been listening to the American people. We need to focus on our own issues first.",
      "And I have taken a lot of heat over it from Mitch McConnell, from \"The Wall Street Journal.\"",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: But this is what the American people spoke up and want us to do. We should never have been in Ukraine. It's a result of failed policies, failed energy policies, the failure in Afghanistan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's no U.S. presence in Ukraine. Are you talking about\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: No, but our funds. I'm talking about the vast amount of funds, again, $175 billion.",
      "That's a tremendous amount, as I said, more than three times the budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. The American people want to focus on fixing our problems here. And with the border's collapse, with crime in the cities, we've got to pay attention to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So does that mean just cuts to U.S. military aid to all countries?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: What it means is that we need to take a very deliberate focus on America first.",
      "But we need to be leading from a position of strength, Margaret. As I said, we would not be in this position. Now what we have is an administration that's allowing Russia to sell at a $60-a-barrel cap. The argument they make, that reduces Russia's profits.",
      "What it does, actually, is it subsidizes China to compete again unfairly against us with an energy cost advantage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And we keep Vladimir Putin fully funding this war in Ukraine. We need to stop that. We need to go back to producing our own energy and take Russia out.",
      "Interestingly, interestingly, I will call this the Trump effect. But just in the past 72 hours, what we've seen is the E.U. say, maybe we should replace Russian LNG with U.S. LNG. You've seen in New York City\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that \u2013 that's been talked about for some time.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 we're not going to issue debit cards to illegal immigrants anymore. Migrant caravans are being broken up below the border and turned around.",
      "The U.K. has said, we're going to step our defense budget up to about 2.5 percent, all since President Trump was elected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of that was \u2013 was in process already, but let me ask you specifically on Ukraine.",
      "So Hungary's Prime Minister has said that Donald Trump has told him he will cut off support to Ukraine. You are saying here, I think, in the new Congress, there will be no more aid to Ukraine.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I have certainly not voted for any aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you haven't, but is that \u2013 is that the mandate?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And I think President Trump will find \u2013 President Trump will find a way to deal with this. I'm not going to get ahead of him. I'm certain that he's going to find a way to navigate this that's in the interest of the American people and will stop the carnage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, but\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Look, what's happened in Ukraine is terrible. People are dying.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They continue to die. But we need to stop this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 but here's the thing, we also are seeing this alignment of like an axis of adversaries, right? You have Iranian equipment. You have Chinese equipment.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Deeply concerning, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You have North Korean personnel on the battlefield.",
      "So this idea that Ukraine is somehow divorced from the rest of geopolitics doesn't seem to be bearing out. It's of deep concern to some of our Asian allies, Japan, South Korea. So how are you going to be able to do this without complicating the chessboard?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I think it's become complicated because America has not been standing in a position of strength. The reason is that Russia has been fully funded because of the policies that allow them to sell energy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are extensive sanctions on Russia, whether or not they're\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Iran, we had them shut down. Iran was broke. Now they're able to fund terror all over the world. We had a maximum pressure campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In part because they have all these other adversaries that they're doing business with, right? China.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They were not able to do that under the Trump administration. That's why we saw peace breaking out in the Middle East. Without Iran being shut down, which is what we did under the maximum pressure campaign \u2013 President Trump led this.",
      "We were able to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Everybody said it couldn't happen. It did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: The Abraham Accords. Peace was breaking out in the Middle East because Iran could not fund terror.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: As soon as the Biden administration came in, they stopped enforcing\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There were attacks by Iran during the Trump administration.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Nothing to the level that we've seen here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the assassination of Qasem Soleimani.",
      "But, on the Middle East. Israel's Prime Minister said this morning that he spoke to President Trump three times in recent days, and they discussed Iran and they discussed a peace plan. Do you know what the content of those conversations was?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: No. And, if I did, I wouldn't discuss them here, because that has to be navigated very carefully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the reasons I ask is, we do have this this mid-November deadline that the State Department, the Pentagon have set for Israel to improve the flow of aid to Gaza's two million residents. The U.N. says there is famine already, or on the verge of famine.",
      "If it is found that Israel is indeed violating. U.S. law, would you hold them accountable? Should there be consequences? Because they are recipients of U.S. aid.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I have had huge disagreements with this administration in terms of how they've administered their entire policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is U.S. law. It's not just this administration. It's humanitarian law.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Yes. Well, I think what we've seen just break out again in the past 70-plus hours since President Trump won the election, Hamas is now looking for total peace. So I think the environment has totally changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They've announced they'd like to see peace. They like to see peace in Gaza. Let's see where that leads.",

      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I would like to see what \u2013 I would like to see what Hamas means by this statement. But it seems that the entire environment is shifting right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Because they see new leadership coming in. And I'm encouraged by that, and I think we'll have new opportunities to \u2013 again, President Trump was able to deliver peace through strength.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think that's on the way, and I'm optimistic what it might lead to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the interesting dynamics we saw in this election was that Mr. Trump was able to, in some ways, successfully campaign and peel off Muslim voters, Arab voters. Certainly, in the state of Michigan, you saw some of that.",
      "Do you think \u2013 and they were frustrated by the carnage in Gaza. As a result, do you think Mr. Trump ends up with more wiggle room here to perhaps hold the Israeli prime minister to account, or does he just give a green light?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think what President Trump is going to do is focus on the root cause, to borrow a term that was used a great deal in the last administration.",
      "He's going to focus on Iran, because the cause of this is the Iranian funding and training\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 of Hamas, of Hezbollah, of the Houthis. That would have never happened\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 except for the fact that they released the enforcement of sanctions\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 upholding international law and U.S. legal standards to recipients of U.S. military aid, do you think he will stick by that?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: President Trump is certainly going to uphold U.S. law, but he is also going to make certain that our allies are properly cared for and that our adversaries are dealt with accordingly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you this, because you know Asia really well, but five of America's seven treaty commitments are in that Asia-Pacific.",
      "The U.S. has exposure there in a tremendous way. The last time Donald Trump was president, he talked about pulling U.S. troops out of Japan, pulling them out of South Korea. Is that a priority now, reducing the military footprint in Asia?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think that comes back again to the failure of the elite here in Washington, Margaret, to understand how a businessperson negotiates.",
      "Everybody has got to sit down and talk about what the options are. We have been supporting military presence in that area ever since World War Two, ever since the Korean War, a significant investment on behalf of the American people.",
      "Those investments were made at a time when these economies were collapsed. They were developing countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Today, they are fully developed countries. It's entirely relevant and I think appropriate for President Trump to discuss, within the level of support\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of signaling strength, saying we might ditch our allies isn't exactly a positive message, right?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think the message should be that our allies can and should step up to the extent possible to strengthen their own capabilities. We're seeing it happen. We're seeing it happen in Japan.",
      "They've agreed to double their defense budget from 1 percent to 2 percent of GDP. That's a positive development.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They're trying to work more closely with us. I think, in President Trump's administration, they definitely will.",
      "This is the direction that we need to go. Same for South Korea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, you are on a number of powerful Senate Committees. Do you think you're more useful to Mr. Trump in the Senate, or would you join his Cabinet, if asked?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I will just say this.",
      "I was privileged to have a tremendous career in business, but one of the greatest honors in my life was to represent the United States, the greatest country in the world, in President Trump's administration overseas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: It's also been one of the greatest honors in my life to represent the people of Tennessee serving in the United States Senate.",
      "In whatever role I hold going \u2013 going forward, it's going to be advanced - - it's going to be advancing the positions that President Trump has articulated that the American people overwhelmingly supported.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And I will do that in whatever role necessary, but we are going to see America strong again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Hagerty, thank you for your time today.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Thank you so much, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.",
      "Jake, good to have you here.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN (U.S. National Security Adviser): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we know President Biden and president-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday.",
      "There are a lot of fires around the world. What is it that President Biden wants to deliver in terms of a focus and message?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, the first and most important message will be that President Biden is committed to the peaceful transfer of power and to a responsible handoff from one president to the next, which is in the best tradition of our country and has been for the last 240 years.",
      "And then they will go through the top issues, both domestic and foreign policy issues, including what is happening in Europe and Asia and the Middle East. And the president will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these \u2013 these issues when he takes office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's go to Ukraine, because we just heard from Senator Hagerty that world view from that portion of the Republican Party right now.",
      "We know the war is expanding there. The North Korean troops seem to have entered the fight. You have all these adversaries all in on Russia winning there. What can you do in the remaining 70 days to sort of change what's happening on the ground or Trump-proof the strategy, so to speak?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, look, our approach remains the same as it's been for the last 2.5 years, which is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position on the battlefield, so that it is ultimately in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.",
      "And it should be up to Ukraine to decide, for its own sovereignty and its own territorial integrity, when and how it goes to the negotiating table. It should be up to the United States and a coalition of nations that we have built to continue to supply Ukraine with the means to defend itself against brutal Russian aggression.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got, like, what, $6 billion in money left that's already\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And President Biden made clear when President Zelenskyy was here in Washington a couple of months ago that we would spend all of the resources that were provided to us by the Congress on time and in full, meaning that, by January 20, we will have sent the full amount of resources and aid to Ukraine the Congress has authorized.",
      "And, of course, President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe.",
      "And, ultimately, as the Japanese Prime Minister said, if we walk away from Ukraine in Europe, the question about America's commitment to our allies in Asia will grow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you mean President Biden is going to ask Congress to pass more money for Ukraine before he leaves office?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal.",
      "But President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term, because the threat to Ukraine will remain no matter what exactly happens on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, and the United States should not walk away from its commitment, either to Ukraine or to 50 nations that we have rallied in defense of Ukraine in both Europe and Asia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, U.S. intelligence assessed that Russia favored Donald Trump in this election, that Russia interfered in a fairly dramatic and visible fashion with these fake videos.",
      "What consequence are they going to pay, if any, for doing that?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first, let's not forget that we are currently helping Ukraine fight Russia in Ukraine\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: \u2026 in the most dramatic and full-throated way one could \u2013 could imagine. So we are already doing a substantial number of things to impose costs on Russia.",
      "We have also passed the most sweeping sanctions on Russia that we have seen against a major economy in the world\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Senator Hagerty was saying it's \u2013 Russia's doing fine even with those sanctions.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first of all, you can see in many different ways, whether it's inflation in Russia, whether it's their ability over time to actually grow their economy, their technology, their capacity to invest in new sources of energy going down the line, that the picture for Russia looks increasingly bleak as time goes on, and that the sanctions are biting.",
      "They have not stopped, obviously, Russia from being able to carry out its military operations in Ukraine today, but they have painted a darker picture for Ukraine \u2013 for Russia tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what Russia is giving North Korea's Kim Jong-un in exchange for the men he is sending to fight on the battlefield in Ukraine?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: We don't know for sure.",
      "And, frankly, I think Vladimir Putin doesn't know for sure. I think he probably hasn't decided exactly what he's going to do for North Korea on a going-forward basis.",
      "But I will tell you this. Kim Jong-un expects that he's going to get something significant, probably in the form of military and technology support from Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For its nuclear program?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And that's a distinct possibility. I can't say exactly what will happen, but we have already heard the Russians come out and say that North Korea's nuclear program should be looked at differently today than it was five or 10 years ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: So the concern about the relationship between Russia and North Korea in both directions is very real and something that all of the nations of the free world need to pay attention to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Prime Minister Netanyahu said he spoke to Donald Trump three times in the past few days. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, is coming to the White House. That was just announced.",
      "What makes you think in these final days of the Biden administration that Benjamin Netanyahu would agree to peace in Gaza or agree to peace in Lebanon and not hold on to that political capital for the new president?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Prime Minister Netanyahu will make his decisions, and \u2013 and he'll speak to his decisions.",
      "Here's what I see. First, in Gaza, it really today is not Israel that is standing in the way of a cease-fire and hostage deal. It is Hamas. Israel has said it's prepared to do a temporary cease-fire for a number of hostages and then try to build on that to get all of the hostages home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Hamas has said no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 Mr. \u2013 Senator Hagerty was talking about on that with Hamas?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: I don't know about the particular statement he made.",
      "What I will tell you is, whatever Hamas is saying publicly, what they are communicating to the mediators is, no, we will not do a cease-fire-and- hostage deal at this time.",
      "So what we need to do is get the rest of the world to continue to increase pressure on Hamas to come to the table to do a deal in Gaza, because the Israeli government has said it's prepared to take a temporary step in that direction.",
      "And then, when it comes to Lebanon, we have been actively engaged in discussions with the Israeli government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Those should remain behind closed doors.",
      "But we do believe that, at some point, the Israeli government wants to do a deal that gets its citizens back home. I don't think it's doing that deal for American politics. I think it's doing that deal to try to secure Israel. And I expect that, in the coming weeks, we will see progress in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you hold Israel to account?",
      "Because the secretaries of state and defense have sent letters saying that they're not allowing in aid to the degree they should, and that there are possibly forced displacements from Northern Gaza. On this program, you have said that was essentially a red line.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: So, basically, what you have seen from Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken is a letter to their Israeli counterparts that says\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: \u2026 here is a set of steps we expect you to take, and we are going to measure you against the progress you are making towards those steps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: This week, we will make our judgments about what kind of progress they have made. And then Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, the president will make judgments about what we do in response, and I'm not going to get ahead of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, President Xi and President Biden will be in the same place at these summits in the next few days. Will the president confront him about this pervasive and massive hacking of telecom companies known as Salt Typhoon?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: President Biden, every time he sees his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, speaks to him about cyber- enabled espionage, about cyberattacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a significant attack.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Yes, it is. It is an absolutely significant attack. It's something that the FBI, our Department of Homeland Security, and our entire national security enterprise is digging into in a big way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And, of course, it will be on the agenda between every American official and every Chinese official in the weeks ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake Sullivan, a lot happening in the world. Thank you for coming in and talking to us.",
      "We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Stay tuned across CBS News for all the latest news on president-elect Donald Trump's transition plans and how his new policies will impact Americans. You can watch live or on demand on Paramount+ or on our CBS News app.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with California Congressman Ro Khanna.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna. He's in California this morning.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "This was a rough week for Democrats. I don't have to tell you that. But, Congressman, I mean, just to level with the American people, Democrats and the Harris campaign told them that the fate of democracy itself was at stake. Was that a cynical, political tactic, or, if it's reality, what is the plan now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, Margaret, I think what was at stake is the degradation of American democracy. The course of this, a political discourse. The idea that you have people who are undocumented, 12 million, who may be subject to a violation of their rights. The issues is about climate and the reversal on that. I've never said that you weren't going to have future elections. And I was never one of these people who said you're not going to have 2026 or 2028. In one or two years, Donald Trump is going to be a lame duck.",
      "But I do think that we need to make sure we stand up for people's rights in this country and are looking forward and what we can do to win back the House and the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at CBS polling, when you compare Harris in 2024 to Biden in 2020, you see clearly that the Democratic coalition lost support among Latino voters, young voters, women. Republicans really made gains here with men of color as well. Why do you think there is this fracturing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We did not have a compelling enough economic vision. The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans, not just working class Americans, a large slice of Americans who feel the American dream has slipped away for their families and their kids. And you have new voices, Congress people like Pat Ryan, Mary - Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Chris Deluzio, who are saying, look, we need to have a vision on building new factories, on helping raise minimum wage, on dealing with child care, and emphasize that our party has a better economic story. I think that can unify our party, moderates and progressives, and it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, black voters, white working class voters. And we had a better vision than Donald Trump on that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting, in this Monday morning quarterbacking that's happening, to hear from so many Democrats now who are saying that they think that economic message should have been front and center, but that they felt constrained somehow by this focus on identity politics. Tom Suozzi of New York brought that up, talking about Republicans being able to weaponize anarchy on college campuses, defunding the police, and gender questions and girls sports. Do you think this, you know, movement, woke politics, really was incredibly damaging to the left? Because a large part of that came from the progressive wing in - on which you are a member.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, I have always said that we need to be emphasizing the economic issues. But I don't think we should run away for standing up for trans rights, for standing up for equal rights for people, for teaching American history responsibly. You can be true to your values with two things, Margaret. One, if someone disagrees with you, we need to respect that disagreement, not cancel or shame them. Don't shy away from your convictions, but have a reasonable conversation. I did that with Megyn Kelly on a podcast on trans rights. I stuck to my position, but we had a reasonable conversation.",
      "The second thing is, if we emphasize the economic hardships people are facing. I've got $12 trillion in my district in Silicon Valley while towns like Johnstown (ph) were hollowed out. Galesburg, Illinois, were hollowed out. We can build new factories. We can build new industry. We can create new economic opportunity. We have a vision of how to do that. Joe Biden - President Biden started it. I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us, on a particular social issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you specifically about your district, since you just mentioned it. Silicon Valley was thought of as reliably blue, but particularly in this election you saw money going towards Donald Trump. You've seen some very prominent tech names, Elon Musk significantly. And J.D. Vance, the vice presidential candidate, he really reached out into that tech community as part of that campaign.",
      "What is the thing that Silicon Valley thinks it's going to get from a Trump administration? Is it - is it no taxes on capital gains? Is it not regulating crypto? What is it that the people in your district think they're getting from Donald Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, first of all, Margaret, 70 percent of Silicon Valley still supported Vice President Harris and Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: But you're right that we had slippage, and probably now 20 percent, 30 percent support Donald Trump. They have different reasons for doing it. Some of them want more free speech. Some of them want deregulation. Some of them want tax cuts. Some of them want AI not to be regulated. Some of them were concerned on crypto.",
      "But I think what the Democrats need to remind folks of, and I reminded Elon of this, is that Tesla got funding from President Obama. SpaceX got started because Ash Carter, under President Obama, helped Elon get that facility. The Democrats are the party that has invested in the science and technology to help build Silicon Valley. And we can be the party that helps AI and robotics build new factories, build new industry in different parts of the country.",
      "When we argue policy, we have a better vision for how to get Americans and prosperity in a modern economy. And if we focus on that, I believe we will win back the majority and win back in 2028.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Pelosi told \"The New York Times\" there were messaging errors, yes, but she also said, there should have been an open primary system here, and that President Biden's decision to endorse Vice President Harris immediately made it impossible.",
      "Do you agree with her?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, look, I have a lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi, but I've sort of chuckled with people have said this about President Biden because the day he got out we had Democrats with the most over the top superlatives, comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing. So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory.",
      "I think this was a winnable campaign, even when he got out. Vice President Harris was five points up in some of the polls. Anyone who is saying now this was not a winnable campaign didn't say that back in August. The reason we didn't win ultimately is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground. People like Chris Deluzio, Pat Wright (ph), who were saying, talk about the economy. Talk about people's economic struggles. Have - convince people you have the better policies and better vision.",
      "The reason I'm hopeful for the future is, we have the substance. We actually - you can't build new factories just with tariffs and tax cuts. You need federal financing. We have actual investment in apprenticeships. And I think over the long run, the American people will see the truth of the policy ideas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were a surrogate for Joe Biden. You were then a surrogate for Kamala Harris. And on this program you defended both many times. One place you did create space was on the issue of Gaza. You said when you were going to college campuses, when you were talking to progressives, when you were talking to voters of color, not just Arabs and Muslims, you heard there was a problem here.",
      "Do you think that the numbers you saw, particularly in Michigan, vindicated your point of view, or was there just a greater force at work?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I think she would have certainly won Michigan if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza. And that wasn't my point of view. That was the point of view of a lot of people I was hearing on the ground.",
      "I also think, beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives.",
      "Now, my hope is, because President Trump got some of the votes from the Muslim and Arab community, I was just on a bipartisan CODEL in Saudi Arabia, they have said that if the president wants a deal with Saudi Arabia that the Palestinian state and a two-state solution has to be front and center, and I hope we can work towards actually doing that after the war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ro Khanna. Congressman, thank you very much for your time today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy and Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari. He joins us now.",
      "Neel, good morning to you.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI (Minneapolis Federal Reserve President): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, right after the election, another big event was the Federal Reserve moving on interest rates, cutting them for the second time so far this year. That seemed to indicate that you believe inflation is being defeated here.",
      "Can you tell us your assessment of how stable the economy is and how confident you are that we are on a glide path that will avoid recession?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we've made a lot of progress in bringing inflation down, and the economy has remained remarkably strong. We keep getting revisions to GDP that are - show that the economy is growing even faster than we had appreciated, and the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent. So, right now, the economy is in a good place. Inflation is still running around 2.5 percent or so. So, we're not all the way home. We need to finish the job. But so far so good. I mean I don't want to declare victory yet. We need to finish the job. But we're on a good path right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Finish the job. Are - you're - it sounds like you're expecting another rate cut?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we want to have confidence that inflation is going to go all the way back down to our 2 percent target. So, if you look at the - what we call the summary of economic projections, which are the forecast that my colleagues and I put out, the expectation is that we would do another interest rate cut in December. We need to actually see what the data looks like before reaching any conclusions. And that's six weeks from now. But I think another rate cut is certainly possible.",
      "But ultimately, if the economy continues to perform well, a strong economy, a strong labor market, that's going to - that's the outcome that we're all trying to achieve. And I don't think that that's a partisan view. I think everybody's on board with trying to achieve that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed is apolitical. But we are looking at promises of major changes in this new administration. One of them is mass deportations.",
      "When you were last here in June, we talked about the impact of immigration on inflation. You said, in some ways it helps lower it by filling jobs. At the same time you said it may contribute to it because it creates more demand for goods.",
      "How long before we would see the economic impact of say a mass deportation plan?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's a great question, Margaret. I mean I think - if you just assume that people are working, either working in farms or working in factories, and then those businesses now lose employees, that would probably cause some disruption for those businesses as they try to respond to that. And so the implications for inflation are not entirely clear to me. I think ultimately it's going to be between the business community and Congress and the executive branch to figure out what \u2013 you know, how they would adjust to that and how - how long it would take and how disruptive it would be.",
      "I don't have any insight into that. I'm not sure what the inflation implications would be. I think it's a big question of how long it would take, how many new immigrants were coming in. There's just so much uncertainly about what the actual policies will be, what will get passed through the Congress, how it will be implemented. We, at the Fed, will simply wait. We have to wait and see what the rest of the government decides to do before we analyze what it means for the economy going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know you don't control fiscal policy, but the president-elect has unveiled a plan that estimates say would add $8 trillion to the deficit. How concerned are you about rising deficits?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, if you look over the long-term, if you look at, for example, at the Congressional Budget Office forecast of debts and deficits, they grow to the moon. They grow unsustainably. So, at some point, those have to be addressed. And that is purely the domain of the Congress and the executive branch to negotiate how to do that. At some point they have to be addressed. And so our focus is, whatever Congress and the administration decide to do, we have our goals. Our goals are 2 percent inflation and a strong labor market, maximum employment, and we will adjust our monetary policies to try to achieve that.",
      "But, you're right, over the long run, it's clear that the deficit needs to be addressed. But that is also, as I said, the domain of Congress and the executive branch to sort out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Goldman Sachs analysts were out this week with a report saying that the last time we saw Trump tariffs, it - the cost was passed along to consumers. They estimate every 5 percent increase in the tariff rate would reduce corporate earnings per share by 1 to 2 percent because it would pull back consumer spending, possibly trigger retaliatory tariffs and increased uncertainty. How much of a downside risk is there if we get into this business of tariffs?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, from an inflation perspective, it's pretty easy to model a one-time tariff. So, if somebody imposed a 1 percent tariff or a 10 percent tariff, you would think that that would increase prices of those goods either 1 percent or 10 percent. That's pretty easy to model and it shouldn't have an effect long-run on inflation.",
      "The challenge becomes if there's a tit for tat and it's one country imposing tariffs and then responses and it's escalating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: That's where it becomes more concerning, and, frankly, a lot more uncertain.",
      "So I think, again, with - as is with fiscal policy, we'll have to wait and see what actually gets implemented and then how other countries might respond to that. It's just - right now we're just all guessing what will actually happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's safe to say that the new president will take office with what appears to be the economy trending upwards?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: The economy is strong. You know, when I reach out to business and labor unions all around my region it's one of cautious optimism, that the economy is doing well, there are jobs available. And we want to keep the economy doing well. We want to keep that growth going while we get inflation all the way back down to 2 percent. And so, right now, I would say, we have a strong economy, and that's a really good thing. And our objective is to keep it there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chair Powell was asked this week at a press conference if he would resign if asked. He made clear he does not think that the law would require that. And, in fact, it would violate the law.",
      "But there is a broader conversation right now about political influence on the Fed. Are you concerned about it?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: I'm not. My colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are totally committed to the dual mandate goals of 2 percent inflation and maximum employment that Congress has assigned us. That's what's driving the decisions that we've been making. And that will continue to do so.",
      "And there are also structural elements that are designed by Congress to provide continuity. So, the governors at the board of governors in Washington serve up to 14-year terms. The presidents of the reserve banks are independent. These are structures that Congress put in place to provide continuity. Between that and, I think, bipartisan support, that we all want to get inflation back down to 2 percent and we want to keep the economy strong, I'm confident that we will continue to focus on our economic jobs, and that's what should be dictating what we're doing, and that is what's dictating what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Neel Kashkari, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by Dame Karen Pierce, the U.K.'s ambassador to the United States.",
      "Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE (British Ambassador to the United States): Thank you very much, Margaret. Nice to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Ambassador, after this election there was a lot of chatter in Europe about Europe needing to act alone, or at least without as much of an American support mechanism there. The French president said, \"Europe needs to take back control.\" Italy's prime minister said, \"don't ask what the U.S. can do for you, ask what Europe should do for itself.\"",
      "What do you think Trump's return will mean for Europe?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I think in all my experience, Margaret, when America and Europe work together, that's when you get success. That's when you get coherence in policy. We saw that in the Balkans. We've seen it at every conflict since the 1990s. It's great that Europe wants to do more. We want to be a part of that. We've got a lot of burden sharing going on in Europe on Ukraine. I think perhaps it's not well understood in America, if I may say so, quite how much Europe is doing for Ukraine, and we want to talk about that with the incoming administration, as well as work with the Biden team to help Ukraine even further.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom, of course, has provided a tremendous amount of weaponry and support to Ukraine.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: That's exactly right. I think we're over $16 billion all in. We provided the first tanks. We provided the first anti-tank weapons. We have trained Ukrainian pilots. We're going to go on supporting Ukraine for as long as they need us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you do that if the United States cuts off financial and military aid to Ukraine?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, we obviously hope that doesn't happen and we're going to be wanting to have lots of conversations with the outgoing and incoming administrations on just how best to support Ukraine. I think we all want the same thing. We want a stable, secure, peaceful Euro-Atlantic area. And if Putin is allowed to succeed in Ukraine, that threatens all of us, including the U.S., and it certainly emboldens China. And I don't think anyone in the U.S. wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on Friday, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, who is a problematic NATO ally, he's friends with Vladamir Putin and Donald Trump, he said, \"the situation on the front is obvious. There's been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.\" He's talking about Ukraine.",
      "Do you think Mr. Trump is persuadable on this issue?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, I don't think it's for any single European leader to say what President Trump might do. I think we need to hear from President Trump after inauguration on what the new administration plans are. But certainly, I know they share our goal of wanting to have security and stability, and we'll be talking to them and the outgoing Biden administration to see how best we can support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Orban does speak with Donald Trump, but you don't get the sense that he is reflecting what's next?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We speak to Donald Trump. The prime minister spoke to him very recently on the Wednesday after, the day after the election.",
      "In my experience, President Trump is his own person. He'll listen to a lot of advice, some of it solicited, some of it unsolicited, and he'll weigh the pros and cons and he'll come to his own decision. But I have always found him and his team very willing to listen to our point of view.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on the trade front, there's also concern in Europe, as I understand it, about what may be coming with tariffs. The Trump campaign has proposed a 10 percent across the board tariff on Europe. Goldman Sachs projects it will be perhaps a little bit more limited and focused on auto exports. Do you have a sense that the U.K. may be able to avoid this kind of financial penalty, essentially?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We would very much hope so, as the U.K. You know, we've got free trade in our DNA, as it were. We don't believe in tariffs as an instrument of trade. We have a slightly different approach for many American trade specialists on that. And I think the last thing the world needs at the moment is a tariff war. That doesn't help anybody. Trade and investments is a hugely important part of what we do with America. Something like a trillion dollars goes backwards and forwards across the Atlantic in trade and investment each year. Let's not put that at risk. Let's try and find out how we can work together to increase investment in trade. And there's also the really important issue of economic security that's now come onto the agenda. And we'll be wanting to talk to the incoming administration about that also.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you served here in Washington during the first Trump administration. You know many of these players. The current U.K. government is a different one, of course, from that period of time, with the Labour Party in charge. I have to ask you about that direct relationship, because the top diplomat, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, years ago, and you know this quote, wrote, \"Trump is not only a woman-hating, neo-Nazi sympathizing sociopath, he's a profound threat to the international order.\"",
      "Are you concerned that those past statements, and the ideological differences, will be a problem in what has been a special relationship?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I don't think the past statements will be a problem, to be absolutely honest, Margaret. Politicians say a lot of things on both sides. And even in America, some people who are now in the Trump administration, or will be in the Trump administration, like the vice president-elect, have also said critical things about President Trump.",
      "In my experience, politicians kind of absorb those sorts of comments as part of the wear and tear of political life. What's important is the relationship now. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, had a very warm dinner with President Trump in September. He very graciously invited them to his private home in Trump Tower. We discussed a huge range of issues.",
      "You're right that they come from different political philosophies. I won't call them ideological. I don't think Keir Starmer is ideological. And I don't think President Trump is. It's about finding out how we can work together. What they do have in common is this desire to get the economies moving, to get growth for the ordinary citizen, to make sure things are better for the ordinary citizen. And we had a very good conversation about that with President Trump in September.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it. Thank you for watching. Happy birthday, Marines!",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 10, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna. He's in California this morning. Good morning to you. This was a rough week for Democrats. I don't have to tell you that, but Congressman, I mean, just to level with the American people, Democrats and the Harris campaign told them that the fate of democracy itself was at stake. Was that a cynical political tactic, or, if it's reality, what is the plan now?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, Margaret, I think what was at stake is the degradation of American democracy, the coarseness of political discourse, the idea that you have people who are undocumented, 12 million, who may be subject to a violation of their rights. The issues about climate and the reversal on that. I've never said that you weren't going to have future elections, and I was never one of these people who said you're not going to have 2026 or 2028 in one or two years, Donald Trump is going to be a lame duck. But I do think that we need to make sure we stand up for people's rights in this country and are looking forward and what we can do to win back the House and the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at CBS polling, when you compare Harris in 2024 to Biden in 2020 you see clearly that the Democratic coalition lost support among Latino voters, young voters, women. Republicans really made gains here with men of color as well. Why do you think there is this fracturing?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: We did not have a compelling enough economic vision. The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans, not just working class Americans, a large slice of Americans who feel the American Dream has slipped away for their families and their kids, and you have new voices Congress, people like Pat Ryan, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Chris Deluzio, who are saying, look, we need to have a vision on building new factories, on helping raise minimum wage, on dealing with child care, and emphasize that our party has a better economic story. I think that could unify our party, moderates and progressives. And it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, Black voters, white working class voters, and we have a better vision than Donald Trump on that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting in this Monday morning quarterbacking that's happening to hear from so many Democrats now, who are saying that they think that economic message should have been front and center, but that they felt constrained somehow by this focus on identity politics. Tom Suozzi of New York brought that up talking about Republicans being able to weaponize anarchy on college campuses, defunding the police and gender questions and girls sports. Do you think this, you know, movement \"woke\" politics really was incredibly damaging to the left, because a large part of that came from the progressive wing in, of which you are a member.",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, I have always said that we need to be emphasizing the economic issues, but I don't think we should run away for standing up for trans rights, for standing up for equal rights for people, for teaching American history responsibly. You can be true to your values with two things, Margaret. One, if someone disagrees with you, we need to respect that disagreement, not cancel or shame them. Don't shy away from your convictions, but have a reasonable conversation. I did that with Megyn Kelly on a podcast on trans rights. I stuck to my position, but we had a reasonable conversation. The second thing is, if we emphasize the economic hardships people are facing, I've got $12 trillion in my district in Silicon Valley, while towns like Johnstown were hollowed out. Galesburg, Illinois were hollowed out. We can build new factories. We can build new industry. We can create new economic opportunity. We have a vision of how to do that. Biden -President Biden started it. I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us on a particular social issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you specifically about your district. Since you just mentioned it, Silicon Valley was thought of as reliably blue, but particularly in this election, you saw money going towards Donald Trump. You've seen some very prominent tech names, Elon Musk, significantly. And JD Vance, the vice-presidential candidate. He really reached out into that tech community as part of that campaign. What is the thing that Silicon Valley thinks it's going to get from a Trump administration? Is it, is it no taxes on capital gains? Is it not regulating crypto? What is it that the people in your district think they're getting from Donald Trump?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, first of all, Margaret, 70% of Silicon Valley still supported Vice President Harris and Democrats --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Yes",
      "REP. KHANNA: But you're right that we had a slippage and probably now 20-30% support Donald Trump. They have different reasons for doing it. Some of them want more free speech. Some of them want deregulation. Some of them want tax cuts. Some of them want AI not to be regulated. Some of them were concerned on crypto. But I think what the Democrats need to remind folks of, and I've reminded Elon of this, is that Tesla got funding from President Obama. SpaceX got started because Ash Carter, under President Obama, helped Elon get that facility. The Democrats are the party that has invested in the science and technology to help build Silicon Valley, and we can be the party that helps AI robotics, build new factories, build new industry in different parts of the country. When we argue policy, we have a better vision for how to get Americans prosperity in a modern economy. And if we focus on that, I believe we will win back the majority and win back in 2028.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Pelosi told The New York Times there were messaging errors, yes, but she also said there should have been an open primary system here, and that President Biden's decision to endorse Vice President Harris immediately made it impossible. Do you agree with her?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, look, I have a lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi, but I've sort of chuckled when people have said this about President Biden, because the day he got out, we had Democrats with the most over the top superlatives comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing. So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory. I think this was a winnable campaign. Even when he got out, Vice President Harris was five points up in some of the polls. Anyone who is saying now, this was not a winnable campaign, didn't say that back in August. The reason we didn't win, ultimately, is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground, people like Chris Deluzio, Pat Ryan, who were saying, talk about the economy, talk about people's economic struggles. Have- convince people you have the better policies and better vision. The reason I'm hopeful for the future is we have the substance. We actually- you can't build new factories just with tariffs and tax cuts. You need federal financing. We have actual investment in apprenticeships. And I think over the long run, the American people will see the truth of the policy ideas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were a surrogate for Joe Biden. You were then a surrogate for Kamala Harris, and on this program, you defended both. Many times, one place you did create space was on the issue of Gaza. You said, when you were going to college campuses, when you were talking to progressives, when you were talking to voters of color, not just Arabs and Muslims. You heard there was a problem here. Do you think that the numbers you saw, particularly in Michigan, vindicated your point of view, or was there just a greater force at work?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: I think she would have certainly won Michigan if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza. That wasn't my point of view. That was the point of view of a lot of people I was hearing on the ground. I also think beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives. Now my hope is because President Trump got some of the votes for the Muslim and Arab community. I was just on a bipartisan CODEL in Saudi Arabia. They have said that if the President wants a deal with Saudi Arabia, that the Palestinian state and a two state solution has to be front and center. And I hope we can work towards actually doing that after the war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ro Khanna, Congressman, thank you very much for your time today. We'll be right back."

      "SEN. BILL HAGERTY: \u2013Yes Margaret",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During the first Trump administration. It's good to have you here.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: It's good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Donald Trump has this sweeping mandate, as do Republicans. Do you see this as an unrestrained presidency?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think this is a presidency that has a mandate like we haven't seen, as you mentioned, in 36 years. The American public has spoken loud and clear. And I think if you go back to your interview with Bob, there are a number of places where Washington has been out of touch with the American people. You mentioned Ukraine, I think that's a great example. The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation. You think about it, we've sent $175 billion of U.S. aid to Ukraine. That's more than three times the entire annual budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. I've been one of the few senators in the United States Senate who has voted and has opposed every cent of this Ukraine aid. I've been listening to the American people. We need to focus on our own issues first. And I've taken a lot of heat over it, from Mitch McConnell from the Wall Street Journal, but this is what the American people spoke up and want us to do. We should never have been in Ukraine. It's a result of failed policies, failed energy policies, the failure in Afghanistan\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013there's no U.S. presence in Ukraine",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: No but our funds. I'm talking about the vast amount of funds, again, $175 billion. That's a tremendous amount, as I said, more than three times the budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. The American people want to focus on fixing our problems here, and with the borders collapse, with crime in the cities, we've got to pay attention to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So does that mean just cuts to U.S. military aid to all countries?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: What it means is that we need to take a very deliberate focus on America first. But we need to be leading from a position of strength, Margaret. As I said, we would not be in this position. Now what we have is an administration that's allowing Russia to sell at a $60 a barrel cap. The argument they make that reduces Russia's profits. What it does actually, is it subsidizes China to compete again, unfairly against us, with an energy cost advantage. And we keep Vladimir Putin fully funding this war in Ukraine. We need to stop that. We need to go back to producing our own energy and take Russia out. Interestingly, interestingly, I'll call this the Trump effect. But just in the past 72 hours, what we've seen is the EU say, \"Maybe we should replace Russian LNG with U.S. LNG. You've seen in New York City\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well that's been talked about for some time--",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: We're not going to issue debit cards to illegal immigrants anymore. Migrant caravans are being broken up below the border and turned around. The UK has said we're going to step our defense budget up to about 2.5% all since President Trump was elected",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of that was- was in process already, but let me ask you specifically on Ukraine. So Hungary's Prime Minister has said that Donald Trump has told him he will cut off support to Ukraine. You are saying here, I think, in the new Congress, there will be no more aid to Ukraine.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I've certainly not voted for any aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you haven't, but is that the mandate?",
      "SEN. HAGARTY:\u00a0 And I think President Trump will find- President Trump will find a way to deal with this. I'm not going to get ahead of him. I'm certain that he's going to find a way to navigate this that's in the interest of the American people and will stop the carnage. Look what's happened in Ukraine is terrible. People are dying. They continue to die. But we need to stop this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But here's the thing, we also are seeing this alignment of like an axis of adversaries, right? You have Iranian equipment, you have Chinese equipment\u2013",
      "SEN. HAGARTY: -- Deeply concerning, yes--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You have North Korean personnel on the battlefield. So this idea that Ukraine is somehow divorced from the rest of geopolitics doesn't seem to be bearing out. It's of deep concern to some of our Asian allies, Japan, South Korea. So how are you going to be able to do this without complicating the chess board?",
      "SEN. HAGARTY: Well, I think it's become complicated because America has not been standing in a position of strength. The reason is that Russia has been fully funded because of the policies that allow them to sell energy\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 on Russia whether or not they're--",
      "SEN. HAGARTY: Iran we had them shut down. Iran was broke, whether or not they're now they're able to fund terror all over the world, we had a maximum pressure \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 In part because they have all these other adversaries that they're doing business with, right? China \u2013",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: They were not able to do that under the Trump administration. That's why we saw peace breaking out in the Middle East. Without Iran being shut down, which is what we did under the maximum pressure campaign. President Trump led this. We're able to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Everybody said it couldn't happen. It did the Abraham Accords. Peace was breaking out in the Middle East because Iran could not fund terror. As soon as the Biden administration came in, they stopped enforcing--",

Do you know what the content of those conversations was?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: No, and if I did, I wouldn't discuss them here, because that has to be navigated very carefully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the reasons I ask is we do have this this mid-November deadline that the State Department- the Pentagon have set for Israel to improve the flow of aid to Gaza's two million residents. The UN says there is famine already, or on the verge of famine. If it is found that Israel is indeed violating. U.S. law, would you hold them accountable? Should there be consequences? Because they are recipients of U.S. aid.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: Well I've had huge disagreements with this administration in terms of how they've administered their entire policy \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is U.S. law, it's not just this administration. It's humanitarian law.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think what we've seen just break out again in the past 70 plus hours since President Trump won the election, Hamas is now looking for total peace. So I think the environment has totally changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: They've announced they'd like to see peace. They like to see peace in Gaza. Let's see where that\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe- you believe that there will be a hostage deal negotiated under President Trump?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I'd like to see what, I'd like to see what Hamas means by this statement. But it seems that the entire environment is shifting right now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah--",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: -- Because they see new leadership coming in. And I'm encouraged by that, and I think we'll have new opportunities to, again, President Trump was able to deliver peace through strength. I think that's on the way, and I'm optimistic what it might lead to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the interesting dynamics we saw in this election was that Mr. Trump was able to, in some ways, successfully campaign and peel off Muslim voters, Arab voters, certainly in the state of Michigan, you saw some of that. Do you think- and they were frustrated by the carnage in Gaza. As a result, do you think Mr. Trump ends up with more wiggle room here to perhaps hold the Israeli prime minister to account, or does he just give a green light?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think what President Trump is going to do is focus on the root cause. To borrow a term that was used a great deal in the last administration. He's going to focus on Iran because the cause of this is the Iranian funding and training of Hamas, of Hezbollah, of the Houthis. That would have never happened--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014 but in terms of \u2014",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: \u2014 Except for the fact that they released- the enforcement of sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014 Upholding international law and U.S. legal standards to recipients of US military aid, do you think he will stick by that?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: President Trump is certainly going to uphold U.S. law, but he is also going to make certain that our allies are properly cared for and that our adversaries are dealt with accordingly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you this, because you know Asia really well, but five of America's seven treaty commitments are in that Asia-Pacific. The U.S. has exposure there in a tremendous way. The last time Donald Trump was president, he talked about pulling US troops out of Japan, pulling them out of South Korea. Is that a priority now, reducing the military footprint in Asia?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think that comes back again to the failure of the elite here in Washington, Margaret, to understand how a business person negotiates. Everybody has got to sit down and talk about what the options are. We have been supporting military presence in that area ever since World War Two, ever since the Korean War. A significant investment on behalf of the American people. Those investments were made at a time when these economies were collapsed. They were developing countries today. They are fully developed countries. It's entirely relevant, and I think appropriate for President Trump to discuss within the level of support--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014 But in terms of signaling strength, saying we might ditch our allies isn't exactly a positive message, right?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think the message should be that our allies can and should step up to the extent possible. To strengthen their own capabilities. We're seeing it happen. We're seeing it happen in Japan, they've agreed to double their defense budget from 1% to 2% of GDP. That's a positive development. They're trying to work more closely with us. I think in President Trump's administration, they definitely will. This is the direction that we need to go. Same for South Korea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go. You are on a number of powerful Senate Committees. Do you think you're more useful to Mr. Trump in the Senate, or would you join his cabinet if asked?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I'll just say this, I was privileged to have a tremendous career in business, but one of the greatest honors in my life was to represent the United States, the greatest country in the world, in President Trump's administration overseas. It's also been one of the greatest honors in my life to represent the people of Tennessee, serving the United States Senate. In whatever role I hold going- going forward, it's going to be advanced. It's going to be advancing the positions that President Trump has articulated, that the American people overwhelmingly supported, and I'll do that in whatever role necessary, but we are going to see America strong again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Hagerty, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: Thank you so much, Margaret."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Neel Kashkari, Minneapolis Federal Reserve president, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 10, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy and Minneapolis Federal Reserve President, Neel Kashkari, he joins us now. Neel, good morning to you.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Good morning. Margaret,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So right after the election, another big event was the Federal Reserve moving on interest rates, cutting them for the second time so far this year. That seems to indicate that you believe inflation is being defeated here. Can you tell us your assessment of how stable the economy is and how confident you are that we are on a glide path that will avoid recession?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we've made a lot of progress in bringing inflation down, and the economy has remained remarkably strong. We keep getting revisions to GDP that are- show that the economy is growing even faster than we had appreciated, and the unemployment rate is 4.1% so right now, the economy is in a good place. Inflation is still running around 2.5% or so, so we're not all the way home. We need to finish the job, but so far so good. I mean, I don't want to declare victory yet. We need to finish the job, but we're on a good path right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Finish the job. It sounds like you're expecting another rate cut.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we want to have confidence that inflation is going to go all the way back down to our 2% target. So if you look at the what we call the summary of economic projections, which are the forecast that my colleagues and I put out. The expectation is that we would do another interest rate cut in December. We need to actually see what the data looks like before reaching any conclusions, and that's six weeks from now. But I think another rate cut is certainly possible. But ultimately, if the economy continues to perform well, a strong economy, a strong labor market that's going to that's the outcome that we're all trying to achieve. And I don't think that that's a partisan view. I think everybody's on board with trying to achieve that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed is apolitical but we are looking at promises of major changes in this new administration. One of them is mass deportations. When you were last here in June, we talked about the impact of immigration on inflation, you said, in some ways, it helps lower it by filling jobs. At the same time, you said it may contribute to it because it creates more demand for goods. How long before we would see the economic impact of, say, a mass deportation plan?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's a great question. Margaret, I mean, I think if you just assume that people are working, either working in farms or working in factories, and then those businesses now lose employees, that would probably cause some disruption for those businesses as they try to respond to that. And so the implications for inflation are not entirely clear to me. I think ultimately it's going to be between the business community and Congress and the executive branch to figure out what you know, how they would adjust to that, and how, how long it would take, and how disruptive it would be. I don't have any insight into that. I'm not sure what the inflation implications would be. I think it's a big question of how long it would take, how many new immigrants were coming in. There's just so much uncertainty about what the actual policies will be, what will get passed through the Congress, how it will be implemented. We at the Fed will simply wait. We have to wait and see what the rest of the government decides to do before we analyze what it means for the economy going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know you don't control fiscal policy, but the President Elect has unveiled a plan that estimates say would add 8 trillion to the deficit. How concerned are you about rising deficits?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well if you look over the long term, if you look at, for example, at the Congressional Budget Office forecast of debts and deficits, they grow to the moon. They grow unsustainably, so at some point, those have to be addressed, and that is purely the domain of the Congress and the executive branch to negotiate how to do that. At some point they have to be addressed. And so our focus is whatever Congress and the administration decide to do, we have our goals. Our goals are 2% inflation and a strong labor market, maximum employment, and we will adjust our monetary policies to try to achieve that, but you're right. Over the long run, it's clear that the deficit needs to be addressed, but that is also, as I said, the domain of Congress and the executive branch to sort out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Goldman Sachs analysts were out this week with a report saying that the last time we saw Trump tariffs, the cost was passed along to consumers. They estimate every 5% increase in the tariff rate would reduce corporate earnings per share by one to two percent because it would pull back consumer spending, possibly trigger retaliatory tariffs and increased uncertainty. How much of a downside risk is there if we get into this business of tariffs?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, from an inflation perspective, it's pretty easy to model a one time tariff, so if somebody imposed a 1% tariff or a 10% tariff, you would think that that would increase prices of those goods either 1% or 10%. That's pretty easy to model, and it shouldn't have an effect long run on inflation. The challenge becomes, if there's a tit for tat. And it's one country imposing tariffs and then responses, and it's escalating, that's where it becomes more concerning, and, frankly, a lot more uncertain. So I think again, with, as is with fiscal policy, we'll have to wait and see what actually gets implemented, and then how other countries might respond to that. It's just right now we're just all guessing what will actually happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's safe to say that the new president will take office with what appears to be the economy trending upwards?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: The economy is strong. You know, when I reach out to businesses and labor unions all around my region, it's one of cautious optimism that the economy is doing well. There are jobs available, and we want to keep the economy doing well. We want to keep that growth going while we get inflation all the way back down to 2% and so right now, I would say we have a strong economy, and that's a really good thing, and our objective is to keep it there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chair Powell was asked this week at a press conference if he would resign if asked, he made clear he does not think that the law would require that, and in fact, it would violate the law. But there is a broader conversation right now about political influence on the Fed. Are you concerned about it?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: I'm not. My colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are totally committed to the dual mandate goals of 2% inflation and maximum employment that Congress has assigned us. That's what's driving the decisions that we've been making, and that will continue to do so. And there are also structural elements that are designed by Congress to provide continuity. So the governors at the Board of Governors in Washington serve up to 14 year terms. The presidents of the Reserve Banks are independent. These are structures that Congress put in place to provide continuity between that and I think, bipartisan support that we all want to get inflation back down to 2% and we want to keep the economy strong. I'm confident that we will continue to focus on our economic jobs, and that's what should be dictating what we're doing, and that is what's dictating what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Neel Kashkari, thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 10, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Jake, good to have you here.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we know President Biden and President elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday. There are a lot of fires around the world. What is it that President Biden wants to deliver in terms of a focus and message?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, the first and most important message will be that President Biden is committed to the peaceful transfer of power and to a responsible handoff from one president to the next, which is in the best tradition of our country and has been for the last 240 years. And then they will go through the top issues, both domestic and foreign policy issues. Including what is happening in Europe and Asia and the Middle East. And the President will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand and and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these- these issues when he takes office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's go to Ukraine, because we just heard from Senator Hagerty that world view from that portion of the Republican Party right now. We know the war is expanding there. The North Korean troops seem to have entered the fight. You have all these adversaries all-in on Russia winning there. What can you do in the remaining 70 days to sort of change what's happening on the ground, or Trump-proof the strategy, so to speak?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, look, our approach remains the same as it's been for the last two and a half years, which is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position on the battlefield, so that it is ultimately in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table. And it should be up to Ukraine to decide, for its own sovereignty and its own territorial integrity, when and how it goes to the negotiating table. It should be up to the United States and a coalition of nations that we have built to continue to supply Ukraine with the means to defend itself against brutal Russian aggression.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got like, what, $6 billion in money left that's already--",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: --And President Biden made clear when President Zelensky was here in Washington a couple of months ago that we would spend all of the resources that were provided to us by the Congress on time and in full. Meaning that by January 20, we will have sent the full amount of resources and aid to Ukraine the Congress has authorized. And of course, President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe. And ultimately, as the Japanese Prime Minister said, If we walk away from Ukraine in Europe, the question about America's commitment to our allies in Asia will grow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you mean President Biden is going to ask Congress to pass more money for Ukraine before he leaves office?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal. President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term, because the threat to Ukraine will remain no matter what exactly happens on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, and the United States should not walk away from its commitment, either to Ukraine or to 50 nations that we have rallied in defense of Ukraine in both Europe and Asia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So U.S. intelligence assessed that Russia favored Donald Trump in this election, that Russia interfered in a fairly dramatic and visible fashion with these fake videos. What consequence are they going to pay, if any, for doing that?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first, let's not forget that we are currently helping Ukraine fight Russia in Ukraine in the most dramatic and full throated way one could- could imagine. So we are already doing a substantial number of things to impose costs on Russia. We have also passed the most sweeping sanctions on Russia that we have seen against a major economy in the world--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Hagerty was saying it's- Russia's doing fine even with those sanctions.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first of all, you can see in many different ways, whether it's inflation in Russia, whether it's their ability over time to actually grow their economy, their technology, their capacity to invest in new sources of energy going down the line, that the picture for Russia looks increasingly bleak as time goes on, and that the sanctions are biting, they have not stopped, obviously, Russia from being able to carry out its military operations in Ukraine today, but they have painted a darker picture for Ukraine- for Russia tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what Russia is giving North Korea's Kim Jong Un in exchange for the men he is sending to fight on the battlefield in Ukraine?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: We don't know for sure, and frankly, I think Vladimir Putin doesn't know for sure. I think he probably hasn't decided exactly what he's going to do for North Korea on a going forward basis. But I will tell you this, Kim Jong Un expects that he's going to get something significant, probably in the form of military and technology support from Russia--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For its nuclear program?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: And that's a distinct possibility. I can't say exactly what will happen, but we have already heard the Russians come out and say that North Korea's nuclear program should be looked at differently today than it was five or ten years ago. So the concern about the relationship between Russia and North Korea, in both directions, is very real and something that all of the nations of the free world need to pay attention to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Prime Minister Netanyahu said he spoke to Donald Trump three times in the past few days. The Israeli President Isaac Herzog is coming to the White House. That was just announced. What makes you think in these final days of the Biden administration that Benjamin Netanyahu would agree to peace in Gaza or agree to peace in Lebanon and not hold on to that political capital for the new president?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Prime Minister Netanyahu will make his decisions, and he'll speak to his decisions. Here's what I see. First in Gaza, it really, today, is not Israel that is standing in the way of a cease fire and hostage deal. It is Hamas. Israel has said it's prepared to do a temporary cease fire for a number of hostages and then try to build on that to get all of the hostages home--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what--",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: --Hamas has said no",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Senator Hagerty was talking about on that with Hamas?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: I don't know about the particular statement he made. What I will tell you is, whatever Hamas is saying publicly, what they are communicating to the mediators is no, we will not do a cease fire and hostage deal at this time. So what we need to do is get the rest of the world to continue to increase pressure on Hamas to come to the table, to do a deal in Gaza, because the Israeli government has said it's prepared to take a temporary step in that direction. And then when it comes to Lebanon, we have been actively engaged in discussions with the Israeli government. Those should remain behind closed doors, but we do believe that at some point the Israeli government wants to do a deal that gets its citizens back home. I don't think it's doing that deal for American politics. I think it's doing that deal to try to secure Israel, and I expect that in the coming weeks, we will see progress in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you hold Israel to account? Because the Secretaries of State and Defense have sent letters saying that they're not allowing in aid to the degree they should, and that there are possibly forced displacements from Northern Gaza. On this program, you have said that was essentially a red line.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: So basically what you have seen from Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken is a letter to their Israeli counterparts that says, here is a set of steps we expect you to take, and we are going to measure you against the progress you are making towards those steps. This week, we will make our judgments about what kind of progress they have made. And then Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, the President will make judgments about what we do in response, and I'm not going to get ahead of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, President Xi and President Biden will be in the same place at these summits in the next few days. Will the President confront him about this pervasive and massive hacking of telecom companies known as 'Salt Typhoon?'",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: President Biden, every time he sees his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, speaks to him about cyber-enabled espionage, about cyber attacks--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a significant attack.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Yes, it is. It is an absolutely significant attack. It's something that the FBI, our Department of Homeland Security, our entire national security enterprise is digging into in a big way. And of course, it will be on the agenda between every American official and every Chinese official in the weeks ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Jake Sullivan, a lot happening in the world. Thank you for coming in and talking to us. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by Dame Karen Pierce, the UK's ambassador to the United States. Welcome back to Face The Nation.",
      "AMBASSADOR DAME KAREN PIERCE: Thank you very much. Margaret, nice to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Ambassador, after this election, there was a lot of chatter in Europe about Europe needing to act alone, or at least without as much of an American support mechanism there. The French president said \"Europe needs to take back control.\" Italy's Prime Minister said, \"Don't ask what the US can do for you, ask what Europe should do for itself.\" What do you think Trump's return will mean for Europe?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I think in all my experience Margaret, when America and Europe work together, that's when you get success. That's when you get coherence in policy. We saw that in the Balkans. We've seen it at every conflict since the 1990s. It's great that Europe wants to do more. We want to be a part of that. We've got a lot of burden sharing going on in Europe on Ukraine, I think perhaps it's not well understood in America, if I may say so, quite how much Europe is doing for Ukraine, and we want to talk about that with the incoming administration, as well as work with the Biden team to help Ukraine even further.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom, of course, has- has provided a tremendous amount of weaponry and support to Ukraine.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: That's exactly right. I think we're over $16 billion all-in. We provided the first tanks. We provided the first anti-tank weapons. We have trained Ukrainian pilots. We're going to go on supporting Ukraine for as long as they need us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you do that if the United States cuts off financial and military aid to Ukraine?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, we obviously hope that doesn't happen, and we're going to be wanting to have lots of conversations with the outgoing and incoming administrations on just how best to support Ukraine. I think we all want the same thing. We want a stable, secure, peaceful, Euro-Atlantic area. And if Putin is allowed to succeed in Ukraine, that threatens all of us, including the US, and it certainly emboldens China, and I don't think anyone in the US wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on Friday, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is a problematic NATO ally. He's friends with Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, he said \"The situation on the front is obvious. There's been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.\" He's talking about Ukraine. Do you think Mr. Trump is persuadable on this issue?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, I don't think it's for any single European leader to say what President Trump might do. I think we need to hear from President Trump after inauguration on what the new administration's plans are. But certainly I know they share our goal of wanting to have security and stability, and we'll be talking to them and the outgoing Biden administration to see how best we can support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Orban does speak with Donald Trump, but you don't get the sense that he is reflecting--",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: -- We speak to Donald Trump, the Prime Minister spoke to him very recently, on the Wednesday after- the day after the election. In my experience, President Trump is his own person. He'll listen to a lot of advice, some of it solicited, some of it unsolicited, and he'll weigh the pros and cons, and he'll come to his own decision. But I have always found him and his team very willing to listen to our point of view.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on the trade front, there's also concern in Europe, as I understand it, about what may be coming with tariffs. The Trump campaign has proposed a 10% across the board tariff on Europe. Goldman Sachs projects it will be perhaps a little bit more limited and focused on auto exports. Do you have a sense that the UK may be able to avoid this kind of financial penalty, essentially?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We would very much hope so. As- as the UK, you know, we've got free trade in our DNA, as it were. We don't believe in tariffs as an instrument of trade. We have a slightly different approach from many American trade specialists on that. And I think the last thing the world needs at the moment is a tariff war. That doesn't help anybody. Trade and investments are hugely important part of what we do with America, something like a trillion dollars goes backwards and forwards across the Atlantic in trade and investment each year. Let's not put that at risk. Let's try and find out how we can work together to increase investment and trade. And there's also the really important issue of economic security that's now come onto the agenda, and we'll be wanting to talk to the incoming administration about that also.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you served here in Washington during the first Trump administration. You know many of these players. The current UK Government is a different one, of course, from that period of time with the Labor Party in charge. I have to ask you about that direct relationship, because the top diplomat, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, years ago, and you know this quote, wrote \"Trump is not only a woman hating neo-Nazi sympathizing sociopath, he's a profound threat to the international order.\" Are you concerned that those past statements and the ideological differences will be a problem in what has been a special relationship?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I don't think the past statements will be a problem, to be absolutely honest, Margaret. Politicians say a lot of things on both sides. And even in America, some people who are now in the Trump administration, or will be in the Trump administration, like the Vice President-Elect, have also said critical things about President Trump. In my experience, politicians kind of absorb those sorts of comments as part of the wear and tear of political life. What's important is the relationship now. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, the Prime Minister Keir Starmer, had a very warm dinner with President Trump in September. He very graciously invited them to his private home in Trump Tower. We discussed a huge range of issues. You're right that they come from different political philosophies. I wouldn't call them ideological. I don't think Keir Starmer is ideological, and I don't think President Trump is. It's about finding out how we can work together. What they do have in common is this desire to get the economies moving, to get growth for the ordinary citizen, to make sure things are better for the ordinary citizen. And we had a very good conversation about that with President Trump in September.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the UK politicians who was at Mar-a-Lago and celebrating on election night was Nigel Farage. He's known for his anti-immigrant stance. There has been, not just in the US, but also in Europe, around the world, this backlash against immigrants and migration, and that has really impacted a lot of politics here. I'm wondering what your thoughts are, more broadly, about what kind of political force and factor that is in the world we're in now? It's a big question, but it does seem like there's something global happening.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I'd agree with you, Margaret, there's something very important for a lot of electorates 'round the world about the subject of immigration. But I don't want to give the impression that in the west or in the UK we are not generous to people in need. We took a lot of Syrians, a lot of Afghans, a lot of Ukrainians. Economic migration is the thing we're all very worried about. And although the problem manifests itself differently in the UK from in the US, I think you're right. It is something that voters care about. It is something that the British Government is committed to tackling. The Prime Minister is very interested in how you act against the criminal gangs who foster this sort of migration, and actually are the ones exploiting people who come across in small boats or whatever conveyance they use. It's about stopping the gangs and stopping the traffickers, and we'll need a lot of international coordination to make that happen.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump's decisive victory is, to say the least, a turning point in the American story.",
      "For Trump and his 74 million supporters, it's a dramatic comeback \u2013 a rebuke of an establishment many of them detest, and an affirmation of his agenda, which includes the mass deportations of undocumented migrants; sweeping tariffs; and deregulating federal agencies, as favored by campaign benefactors like Elon Musk.",
      "But for those who backed Vice President Kamala Harris, it is a crushing loss to a man who attempted to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "In her concession speech, Harris said, \"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results \u2026. At the same time, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States.\"",
      "This week, President Joe Biden and Trump are scheduled to meet in the Oval Office.",
      "\"It's a pivotal moment to see Trump return to office,\" said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. \"The simplest story we have right now \u2013 which may be the correct one \u2013 is that there was a kind of incumbent backlash against the Biden administration and against the Democratic Party. And Kamala Harris couldn't separate herself from it.\"",
      "Nyhan says Trump's victory is part of a broader trend \u2013 a rejection of incumbents: \"Around the world, the parties that have held power during COVID performed very poorly at the polls. It may just be very difficult to hold power after a bout of inflation. Everyone feels inflation. It's not the same as unemployment, where it's only a subset of folks who are directly affected.",
      "\"What's striking, though, about this situation is that by many, not all, objective measures, the American economy has recovered quite well, in some ways better than many of our counterparts,\" Nyhan said.",
      "Of course, the election was about more than the economy. According to professor Dianne Pinderhughes, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame, race, gender, and class were all factors in this election.",

      "After Harris entered the race this summer for a dash to the finish, Democrats were hopeful she could finally break that glass ceiling.",
      "Is that promise of a female president still there? \"I think a lot of people feel that it's not there,\" Pinderhughes said, \"that we have a long way to go, given the contest between two candidates where one is a convicted felon.",
      "\"The fact that people that look at those two candidates and see a credible possibility of Donald Trump being president again was just hard to process,\" she said.",
      "For now, Trump is working to staff his cabinet and inner circle. A top campaign advisor, Susie Wiles, will become the first female White House chief of staff. And, unlike in 2016, when he was an outsider, Trump returns as leader of a party that has remade itself in his image.",
      "Nyhan said, \"He has transformed the Republican Party permanently. And I think the people who hoped that they could just go back to the way things were will finally and fully have to admit defeat.",
      "\"People vote on policy; people vote on party; and they vote on the state of the country,\" Nyhan said. \"In some ways, that's good. But it means we're vulnerable when conditions are unfavorable. And that's brought Donald Trump back from the political dead.\"",

      "Here's what the exit polls tell us about voters who \"split their ticket:\"",
      "Voters favored abortion rights but the economy mattered more",
      "Most people who voted \"yes\" on abortion-related measures \u2014 Proposition 139 in Arizona and Question 6 in Nevada \u2014 also voted for Kamala Harris, but about a quarter of these voters backed Donald Trump.",

And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia.

Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",

      "While the presumably minor medical issue remains a mystery, the crew shared highlights of their stay in space, including details about a water leak during preparations for a June spacewalk that triggered a blizzard in the space station's airlock.",

      "\"It was not a trivial leak,\" Barratt reflected Friday. \"Anybody who was watching NASA TV at the time could see there was basically a snowstorm, a blizzard spewing from the air lock, because we already had the hatch open. We were seeing flakes of ice in the air lock. Tracy was seeing a lot of them on her helmet, on her gloves, whatnot.",
      "\"So it was...dramatic is the right word, to be real honest. I think literally, Tracy's actions were nowhere short of a heroic to be able to re-mate that umbilical with her hands covered with ice and kind of being vision impaired and getting the air lock closed.\"",
      "Barratt said he grabbed her space-suited legs so Dyson could \"lever that thing closed, and she just made it happen. So yeah, there was a bit of drama. Everything worked out fine. And again, normal processes and procedures saved our bacon.\"",
      "NASA plans to resume spacewalks in January, and Barratt said the suits will be in good shape.",
      "\"I think we're leaving them a brand new umbilical, a really clean interface on that side where we had the problem and the suits are charged and really ready to go,\" he said. \"So I think we are more than ready for the next EVA campaign. I just wish we were doing it.\"",

The ISS is routinely re-boosted by Russian Progress freighters and Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ships, but Friday's test will be a first for SpaceX.",
      "The California rocket builder is under contract to NASA to build a powerful space tug of sorts that can be used to safely drive the ISS back into the atmosphere when the lab complex is retired in the 2030 timeframe. The vehicle is needed to make sure the station breaks up over a stretch of ocean well away from populated areas and shipping lanes.",
      "During the test Friday, the Cargo Dragon's aft thrusters will fire for about 12 minutes.",
      "\"The data that we're going to collect from this reboost and attitude control demonstration will be very helpful, informing SpaceX analyses on how the system performs,\" said Jared Metter, SpaceX director of flight reliability. \"This data is going to lead to future capabilities, namely the US de-orbit vehicle.\"",
      "Reboost aside, the Cargo Dragon is loaded with slightly more than 6,000 pounds of equipment and supplies, including 2,022 pounds of science gear, 2,119 pounds of crew clothing, food and other supplies, 377 pounds of spacewalk equipment, 525 pounds of space station hardware and 44 pounds of computer equipment.",
      "One of the more unusual payloads: Lignosat, a small wooden satellite using a framework of magnolia panels built by researchers at Kyoto University in Japan and the Tokyo-based logging company Sumitomo.",
      "\"While some of you might think that wood in space seems a little counterintuitive, researchers hope that this investigation demonstrates that a wooden satellite can be more sustainable and less polluting for the environment than conventional satellites,\" said Meghan Everett, the ISS deputy project scientist.",
      "\"The main objective here is to determine whether wood can be used in space, and to do this, researchers will measure the temperature and strain of the wooden structure and see how it might change in the vacuum environment of space with atomic oxygen and radiation conditions as well.\"",
      "As with all station-bound Dragon cargo ships, the crew supplies include fresh food and special treats for holiday meals.",
      "Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager, said the \"food kit\" includes \"citrus, apples, sweet onions, blueberries, radishes, etc,\" along with lobster, crab and quail for holiday meals. A variety of cheeses is on board as well as fresh coffee and personal items requested by each crew member.",
      "Mounted in the Dragon's unpressurized trunk section is the Coronal Diagnostic Experiment, or CODEX, an instrument that will be mounted outside the space station to learn more about how charged particles in the solar wind are heated to millions of degrees and accelerated to enormous velocities, affecting Earth's space environment and the rest of the solar system.",
      "Inside the station, the astronauts will have a variety of new experiments and instruments to operate and monitor, including one called ARTEMOSS that will examine how Antarctic moss tolerates the space radiation and microgravity environment to learn more about how plants might be used in future life support systems.",
      "The European Space Agency is sending up a space exposure experiment to learn more about how high-tech materials respond to prolonged exposure to the weightless environment and another experiment to study how organic samples degrade when exposed to unfiltered ultraviolet light from the sun.",
      "And in an experiment that could be particularly useful to future astronauts, a small device known as Nanolab Astrobeat, provided by the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology, will test cold welding technology that could prove useful for repairing leaks or other damage from inside a spacecraft.",
      "The Cargo Dragon is expected to remain docked at the space station for about a month before it returns to Earth with station components needing refurbishment, trash and other no-longer-needed items.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 18:24:33 -0500",
    "summary": "As votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle.",
    "story": [
      "By the time the polls opened on Election Day, baseless claims of voter fraud had been building on social media for months, fueling doubts about the integrity of the election.",
      "Posts proliferated on X and other platforms pointing to hiccups like technical issues with voting machines, power outages and spelling errors on ballots as examples of a supposedly brewing conspiracy. And at 4:30 p.m. on Election Day, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that there was \"a lot of talk about massive cheating\" in Pennsylvania \u2014 which officials said had \"no factual basis whatsoever.\"",
      "But as the votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to a decisive victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle, researchers say.",
      "\"I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,\" said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. \"And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they're not pushed anymore.\"",
      "The shift was stark in Elon Musk's \"Election Integrity Community,\" a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner's political action committee encouraging members to report \"voter fraud or irregularities.\"",
      "The group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",
      "Read's team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.",
      "Danielle Lee Tompson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.",
      "\"On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,\" Tompson said. \"The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.\"",
      "While the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead.",
      "Meanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million \"missing votes.\" On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it's grounds for a recount.",
      "But the volume of posts questioning Harris's loss was nowhere near the \"Stop the Steal\" efforts that followed Trump's 2020 election loss, according to both Tompson and Read's research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.",
      "\"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,\" Harris said. \"And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.\"",

    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",
      "Most social media companies have policies that bar children under the age of 13 from setting up accounts, but a 2022 study conducted by the U.K.'s media regulator Ofcom found that nearly 80% of children in the country had social media accounts by the age of 12.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 15:15:12 -0500",
    "summary": "A kayaker reported missing from Green Lake, Wisconsin, in August is now thought to have faked his own disappearance and fled the country to Europe.",
    "story": [
      "Authorities in Wisconsin believe a kayaker missing since August did not actually vanish while out on a lake, instead faking his own disappearance and fleeing the country. The discovery came after search teams had probed the deep waters of central Wisconsin's Green Lake for 54 days in hopes of locating 45-year-old Ryan Borgwardt, said Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll at a news conference Friday that was streamed by CBS News affiliate WFRV-TV.",
      "Borgwardt was initially reported missing Aug. 12, according to the sheriff. Authorities who responded to the report found the man's car and trailer parked on the bank of the lake, and a capsized kayak that apparently belonged to him in an area where the water was about 220 feet deep.",
      "Keith Cormican, of a nonprofit search-and-rescue organization called Bruce's Legacy, helped multiple law enforcement agencies over the course of several months to try and find Borgwardt. Cormican had searched essentially every corner of the western part of Green Lake by early October, and although he told the sheriff he was not prepared to give up, Podoll recalled regrouping with his detectives on Oct. 7 and deciding to take the investigation in \"a different direction.\"",
      "They learned shortly afterward that Canadian authorities had checked Borgwardt's name on Aug. 13, according to the sheriff and\u00a0WFRV-TV.",
      "\"That was something we didn't expect,\" Podoll told reporters Friday.",
      "Partnering with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in addition to state and local investigators in Wisconsin, the Green Lake sheriff said authorities began to uncover evidence suggesting Borgwardt may not have drowned in the lake at all. A forensic analysis of a laptop that Borgwardt's wife had given to investigators raised suspicions he had engineered the disappearance in order to flee to some place in Europe.",
      "Analysts determined Borgwardt had replaced the laptop's hard drive before he vanished and cleared its browsing history on the day of the fated kayaking trip, after syncing the laptop's contents to the Cloud on Aug 11. He had also photographed his passports and taken out a $375,000 life insurance policy in the months leading up to his disappearance.. Authorities also said Borgwardt had moved funds into a foreign bank, changed his email address and was communicating with a woman in Uzbekistan prior to going missing.",
      "\"Due to these discoveries of new evidence, we were sure that Ryan was not in our lake,\" said Podoll. \"The expertise of Kieth Cormican of Bruce's Legacy cannot be overstated. His dedication and persistence in searching efforts was remarkable, and initially his confidence that he could not find a body in the western part of our lake drew us in a direction that we were not looking.\"",
      "Podoll asked the public to report any information they may have on Borgwardt's disappearance to the Green Lake Sheriff's Office or the local Crime Stoppers line. He told reporters it was too early to comment on any charges that could potentially be brought against Borgwardt and anyone who might have helped him, if he is found, although the sheriff emphasized that recovering the expenses used to search for him would be a priority.",
      "\"Ryan, if you are viewing this, I plead that you contact us or your family,\" Podoll said. \"We understand that things can happen but there is a family that wants their daddy back.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 14:43:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Measure that would repeal so-called \"government pensions offset\" has been gaining support in House.",
    "story": [
      "The House is expected to try to pass a Social Security-related bill this week to ensure benefits for workers who are also eligible for other pensions, despite a surprise move by hard-right Freedom Caucus leaders to derail the effort.",
      "It's a quick turnaround to salvage what had been a bipartisan effort to pass the bill, called the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, during what's now the lame-duck post-election period of the Congress.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal the so-called \"government pensions offset,\" or GPO, which reduces Social Security spousal or widow(er) benefits for those who receive noncovered pensions, according to the Social Security Administration's\u00a0website.",
      "The summary also says the bill also eliminates the so-called \"windfall elimination provision\" that \"in some instances reduces Social Security benefits for individuals who also receive a pension or disability benefit from an employer that did not withhold Social Security taxes.\"",
      "Such pensions are paid by employers \u2014 typically, state and local governments or non-U.S. employers \u2014 that do not withhold Social Security taxes from employee salaries.",
      "\"The GPO reduces the spousal or widow(er) benefit by two-thirds of the monthly non-covered pension and can partially, or fully, offset an individual's spousal/widow(er) benefit, depending on the amount of the non-covered pension,\" according to SSA.gov.",
      "The bill would repeal the GPO provision and reinstate full Social Security benefits.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, an individual with a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security, who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension, would see their Social Security benefit reduced by $667, or two-thirds the non-covered pension amount. That leaves them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit.",
      "If the GPO measure is repealed, the same individual would be entitled to the entire $900 spousal benefit amount without an offset reduction.",
      "Does the bill have bipartisan support?",
      "Yes, the bill was introduced by a Republican, Rep. Garrett Graves of Louisiana, and a Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and it has gained support in the House. A robust 300 lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have signed on to it.",
      "Other groups have also supported the bill, such as the National Association of Counties, which represents county governments. That group says that eliminating the GPO would help county governments recruit workers at a time when many are facing labor shortages.",
      "What happened next to the bill?",
      "To force the legislation forward, the sponsors of the bill, Rep. Graves and Rep. Spanberger, this fall used a rarely successful process called a discharge petition.",
      "They collected the minimum 218 signatures needed from House lawmakers to dislodge the bill from committee and send it to the floor for a vote.",
      "The move is often seem as an affront to House leaders, particularly the House speaker and the majority leader who determine the floor schedule.",
      "But Spanberger and Graves \u2014 who both did not seek reelection \u2014 had little to lose. Besides, Johnson backed the bill before becoming speaker.",
      "Did the House Freedom Caucus block the Social Security bill?",
      "Two leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus intervened when the rest of Congress was away from Capitol Hill, mostly in home states for Election Day.",
      "The Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., and former chair Rep. Bob Goode, R-Va., used a routine pro forma session of the House on November 5 to swiftly table part of the measure.",
      "The Freedom Caucus tends to block new spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add some $196 billion to the federal deficit over a decade.",
      "Graves said that's the amount people are missing out on without reinstating full Social Security benefits.",
      "But in tabling the legislation the conservatives actually set back its procedural rule, but not the bill itself.",
      "The legislation is expected to move forward with a House vote anyway, possibly in the week ahead.",
      "Could the Social Security Fairness Act still pass?",
      "Yes, but that said, passage will now be tougher, requiring a supermajority threshold rather than a simple majority as had been planned under the rule that the Freedom Caucus leaders turned back.",
      "If it passes the House, it's unclear if the bill has enough support to clear the Senate. But the wide margin in the House indicates potentially broad support.",
      "It would then go to President Joe Biden's desk. If signed into law, the summary says the changes are effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",

    "summary": "As Senate Republicans prepare to vote Wednesday on a new majority leader, Trump is already weighing in with demands for recess appointments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Senate Republicans prepare to vote Wednesday on new leadership for the upcoming Congress, President-elect Donald Trump is already weighing in with demands for the new majority leader regarding his Cabinet.",
      "After a decisive victory in the 2024 elections, Trump is returning to the White House with a GOP-led Senate at his side. Senate Republican leaders are expected to ease the way for the president-elect's agenda and his Cabinet and judicial nominees. Trump has made it clear that he'd like his nominees to be installed immediately, suggesting that he may want the option to bypass the Senate's advice and consent role entirely.",
      "Trump weighs in on recess appointments",
      "Perhaps the biggest factor remaining in the leadership race is whether Trump himself weighs in on the candidates. On Sunday, he stepped into the conversation, demanding in a Truth Social post that anyone seeking the position as leader \"must agree to Recess Appointments.\"",
      "Recess appointments enable a president to temporarily install nominees without the Senate confirmation process. Trump argued in a post on social media that without recess appointments, \"we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner.\"",
      "\"We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\" the president-elect said.",
      "The Constitution's Recess Appointment Clause grants presidents the ability to \"fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate.\" The maneuver is considered to be a way to make swift appointments during the Senate's absence, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service, which notes that recess appointments have also been used for political reasons \u2014 for instance, to make an appointment on a temporary basis for an individual who would not be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "With a GOP majority of at least 52 seats, Trump shouldn't have too much difficulty getting his nominations through the chamber through the regular process. But pushback from a handful of Republicans like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Todd Young of Indiana or Sen.-elect John Curtis of Utah could imperil some of his more controversial picks. The process could also be delayed by Democrats in the minority, who could rely on procedural maneuvers to extend the time it takes for Trump's Cabinet to be confirmed.",
      "But the recess appointment maneuver is a controversial one that both parties have combated in recent years. Recess appointments are allowed only when the Senate is out of session for 10 days. For the last decade, both chambers have headed off recess appointments by going into pro-forma sessions even when lawmakers are in recess. And a Supreme Court decision in 2014 gave the Senate more authority to prevent the maneuver, after controversial recess appointments by President Barack Obama.",
      "If Trump were to make an appointment during a recess in the first session of the new Congress, the appointment could last for almost two years, after which the individual could be appointed again through a recess appointment or the regular process, according to the CRS report. But without the Senate's approval, the appointee would not be paid.",
      "Should Republicans force a change to procedure in the upper chamber, they would do so with the risk that Democrats will take the same steps in their favor when they regain the majority. Still, all three candidates for GOP leader threw their support behind Trump's demand for recess appointments on Sunday.",
      "The candidates for Senate majority leader",
      "Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, are considered the front-runners in the race to replace Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. But Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has seen a surge of support from members of Trump's orbit \u2014 from Tucker Carlson to Elon Musk \u2014 that has drawn increased attention to the race.",
      "Thune, 63, is currently the No. 2 Republican and considered by some to be the favorite in the race. He's been in the Senate since 2004 and served as GOP whip since 2021. But he hasn't always had a strong relationship with Trump, and initially backed Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina for president in the GOP primaries.",
      "Cornyn, 72, has been in the Senate since 2002 and previously served as the Republican whip from 2013 to 2019. His fundraising chops have made him a top candidate in the Senate leadership race. But like Thune, he's previously distanced himself from Trump \u2014 a gap both senators have sought to close in recent months.",
      "Meanwhile, Scott has been angling for the position. The Florida Republican challenged McConnell for the role after the midterm elections in 2022, when he earned the support of just 10 members of his conference. Scott is similarly expected to find support from some of the conference's conservative members in this year's contest, and the outside endorsements from those who claim Cornyn and Thune are too close to McConnell could be a boon.",
      "Electing the \"next generation of leadership\"",
      "The leadership election comes after McConnell's decision to step away after 17 years at the helm, becoming the longest serving Senate leader in history.",
      "McConnell's decision to step aside and welcome \"the next generation of leadership\" teed up a high-stakes race for leader that has been shaking out behind the scenes since February. After Republicans flipped the Senate, the leadership race took on even greater importance.",
      "\"I had really hoped I'd be able to hand over to my successor the majority,\" McConnell told reporters at a news conference last week. \"I've been the majority leader, I've been the minority leader \u2013 majority's a lot better.\"",
      "Outside influence and endorsements",
      "The race, nine months in the making, has begun to draw input from outsiders in recent days. Tucker Carlson, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are among the Trump loyalists who have weighed in to back Scott, urging that he is best suited to carry out the president-elect's agenda.",
      "How the input from prominent outsiders weighs on the race remains to be seen. Senate Republicans will meet behind closed doors to elect the new leader, casting secret ballots, which make senators less likely to be swayed by external pressures.",
      "For months, the three candidates have been working behind the scenes to persuade their colleagues to back them for the chamber's top post. And so far, just a small portion of the Republican conference has shared publicly who they plan to support.",
      "Thune has the backing of Sens. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, along with Steve Daines of Montana, who chaired the GOP campaign arm, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, this cycle and may have valuable sway with new members whose races he buoyed. Meanwhile, Cornyn has the support of Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. And Scott has the backing of Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. In recent days, he also earned endorsements from Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee \u2014 two senators who have been floated as possible picks for Trump's cabinet.",
      "The bulk of the conference has yet to weigh in publicly, and likely won't be swayed by outsiders on a decision that will guide how the chamber operates for the next two years. But an endorsement of a candidate from Trump himself, who will work with the leader going forward, could change the dynamic.",
      "Whether Trump endorses a particular candidate remains to be seen. Thune acknowledged on CNBC last week that Trump can \"exert a considerable amount of influence\" on the leadership race, but he cautioned him against doing so, saying, \"I think my preference would be, and I think it's in his best interest, to stay out of that.\"",
      "\"He's got to work with all of us when it's all said and done,\" Thune said. \"But whatever he decides to do, that's going to be his prerogative, as we know.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 13:30:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",
      "Making the enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over 10 years,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CBO.",

She's likely to be confirmed by the new, GOP-led Senate when the president-elect takes office in January, which will set up a race not only to fill Stefanik's seat in the lower chamber, but also to succeed her as chair of the Republican conference.",
      "\"I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,\" Trump said in a statement to CBS News. \"Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.\"",
      "Here is what to know about the New York Republican.",
      "Stefanik's record in Congress",
      "Stefanik was elected to represent New York's 21st Congressional District in 2014 and at the age of 30, became the youngest woman elected to Congress. Currently in her fifth term, she cruised to reelection in November, defeating Democrat Paula Collins with more than 62% of the vote.",
      "Stefanik serves on the Armed Services, Education and Workforce, and Intelligence Committees. She also is a member of the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, which was created in 2023 when Republicans took control of the House. The weaponization panel was a nod to what many Republicans believed was federal investigators' unfair treatment of Trump.",
      "The New York Republican is the highest-ranking woman in the House, serving in leadership as the GOP conference chair. She replaced former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming in the post after Cheney was ousted for her criticisms of Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Stefanik has been one of Trump's staunchest defenders in the House, having emerged as a crucial ally during his first impeachment proceedings in 2019. She also introduced a nonbinding resolution last year that sought to \"expunge\" both of Trump's impeachments by the House.",
      "During this Congress, Stefanik made headlines for her grilling of university presidents during a hearing about their response to antisemitic incidents following the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks on Israel by Hamas. The presidents of Harvard, Stefanik's alma mater, and the University of Pennsylvania resigned following the hearing.",
      "While Stefanik supported earlier packages sending assistance to Ukraine, she voted against a plan to send $60.8 billion to aid Ukraine in its war against Russia in April.",
      "Stefanik and the 2020 election",
      "The congresswoman was among a group of more than 100 House Republicans who signed onto a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the Supreme Court after the 2020 election in a longshot bid to overturn the election results in four battleground states. She also joined GOP lawmakers in objecting to certifying Pennsylvania's election results.",
      "\"Tens of millions of Americans are concerned that the 2020 election featured unconstitutional overreach by unelected officials and judges, ignoring state election laws,\" Stefanik said during a speech on the House floor after the Capitol attack. \"We can and we should peacefully discuss these concerns.\"",
      "But the congresswoman also condemned the violence of Jan. 6 during the same speech, calling it a \"truly tragic day\" for the country.",
      "\"We all join together in fully condemning the dangerous violence and destruction that occurred today in our nation's Capitol,\" she said. \"Americans will always have the freedom of speech and the Constitutional right to protest, but violence in any form is absolutely unacceptable, it is anti-American, and must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Stefanik would not commit to certifying the results of the election, telling NBC News in January it would depend on whether \"this is a legal and valid election.\"",
      "Stefanik before Congress",
      "Stefanik graduated from Harvard University and worked in the White House for President George W. Bush on the Domestic Policy Council and in the chief of staff's office.

      "During an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" last month, Homan outlined how the U.S. government would carry out the largest deportation operation in American history, one of Trump's signature pledges on the campaign trail.",

      "He suggested to CBS News correspondent Cecilia Vega that he would target criminals and national security threats first, and then seek to deport non-criminal migrants who are in the country illegally and are ordered deported. That would require reversing Biden administration rules that currently instruct ICE to focus on arresting and deporting serious criminals, national security threats and recent border crossers and that effectively shield undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for a long time without committing serious crimes from deportation.",
      "Homan also indicated he would revive large-scale immigration arrests at workplaces, which the Biden administration discontinued in 2021. \"That's gonna be necessary,\" he said of worksite immigration enforcement.",
      "But Homan said the deportation operation would not involve \"concentration camps\" or a \"mass sweep of neighborhoods.\"",
      "Asked if mass deportations could be carried out without separating families, Homan said, \"Of course there is. Families can be deported together.\" One study shows roughly 4 million U.S. citizen children live with an undocumented parent.",

      "\"Mushrooms have become my passion, I eat a lot of mushrooms, grow mushrooms for farmer markets and restaurants,\" he said. Farming and being around agriculture \"just gives me life, gives me energy \u2014 and gives me hope.\"",

      "Veterans like Robinson are steadily flocking to agriculture, a field historically intertwined with the military \u2014 1 in every 6 farms has a producer who is currently serving or who has served in the military. However, in recent years, the number of military farmers has dropped. In 2022, the U.S. had 305,753 producers who had served or were serving in the military, according to a Department of Agriculture census, declining 18% from 2017.",
      "To help stem the decline, provide career opportunities and attract a changing veteran demographic, training programs focused on bringing veterans back to the fields have been launched. Robinson sees himself as part of a new crop of farmers, a city dweller who grew up in Philadelphia and New Jersey and returned from war to an urban environment.",
      "A Black veteran, Robinson envisions helping others in his community learn about the opportunities he says abound in farming even in the city \u2014 and there are resources and opportunities available for people \"who might look different.\"",
      "From the battlefield to urban fields",
      "Robinson couldn't have envisioned his journey when he signed up for the military during his freshman year in college, right after the Sept. 11 attacks.",
      "\"It brought the country together,\" said Robinson.",
      "His father served in the Navy and the Air Force, so it seemed like a natural fit.\u00a0 He was commissioned as an officer in 2003, but before he finished his four-year degree, he was deployed to Iraq in 2005.",

      "He left military service in 2010 and, like many other veterans, didn't know what to do next.

      "As the number of veterans living in the U.S. declines, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, its demographics are also shifting. Population models show women, Hispanics, Blacks and adults under 50 will make up a large proportion of the veteran population by 2048, according to a 2023 study from Pew Research Center, shifting the needs of veterans interested in farming. The Department of Agriculture's census found Black farmers with military service also increased accounting for 2.5% of producers with military service, compared to 1.2% of all U.S. producers.",
      "\"We must do more to support apprenticeships and train the next generation of farmers,\" Sen. Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican, wrote in a report on the county's rapidly aging farmers. Americans are more likely to meet a farmer over the age of 65 than under the age of 44, and with a global increase of 2 billion people expected by 2050 - there needs to be enough farmers to grow food. \"The food supply, select manufacturing industries, and even national security hinge on the future of farming,\" said Braun.",

      "On Mondays, the veterans enrolled in the program received a crash course in \"Agriculture 101\" and on Tuesdays, they had hands-on work on different farms and visits to learn about farming operations.",
      "Because he lives in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which has cold winters, Robinson thought it was important to learn hydroponic farming, which regulates the growing environment and allows a lot of control over what has been grown and how.",
      "\"It's very consistent, too,\" he said.",
      "Robinson started farming microgreens, which he said doesn't take a lot of up-front investment and can grow within 10-14 days. He soon expanded his microgreen offerings to include lettuce, herbs and mushrooms, which are easier to grow in an urban environment. He sells them to restaurants and at farmers' markets and to consumers.",

      "Urban agriculture has its limitations, with research showing, half of urban farms surveyed in 2013 had sales of around $10,000 and had to have another form of income to survive. Urban farms often don't have the scale to grow large amounts of food and instead focus on selling niche products to low-volume customers, emphasizing quality and price over quantity, research found.",
      "Robinson said regardless of challenges he's committed to growing his business because it's not just about money, but also personal fulfillment. Learning to farm has completely changed his perspective and life over the past two years and he doesn't struggle as he used to.",
      "\"When you are connected to the earth, you are grounded to the earth,\" said Robinson. \"I feel like you get all that from farming.\"",

    "title": "China building prototype nuclear reactor for new aircraft carrier, AP says",
    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 12:24:53 -0500",
    "summary": "\"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join,\" says a researcher behind the analysis of satellite images and government documents.",
    "story": [
      "Bangkok \u2014 China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press. China's navy is already the world's largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \"blue-water\" force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States.",
      "\"Nuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\" said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \"For China's leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country's global image as a leading power.\"",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",
      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China's Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\"The reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\"",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen's complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China's 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \"intended for installation on a large surface warship\" under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project's \"national defense designation\" helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \"national defense-related construction project\" that is classified \"secret.\"",
      "\"Unless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\" researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \"convincing argument.\"",
      "\"From the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\" she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \"carefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\"",
      "\"Given the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\" said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury's research.",
      "China's first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \"ski-jump\" type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn't even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China's People's Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \"soon be announced,\" but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once - one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 - something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \"incremental improvements.\"",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \"have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\"",
      "\"For now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\"",
      "Eventually, however, \"larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\" Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\"As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\" Childs said.",
      "\"Much will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China's carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy's carriers.\"",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \"with greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\" said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\"These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military's ability to 'intervene' in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\" Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \"first-class\" navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country's rejuvenation.",
      "The country's most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \"speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\"",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world's largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China's shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China's rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \"growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\" the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \"growing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China's shore,\" the report said.",

      "As delegates from nearly 200 countries gather for a major international summit on addressing the threat of climate change, they're confronting a new era of uncertainty for the United States' climate commitments in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election victory.",
      "Trump has said that in a second term, he would again exit the Paris Climate Agreement, an accord signed in 2016 aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The U.S. formally withdrew during Trump's first term, but then rejoined under President Biden.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Trump transition office for more information about his plans.",
      "The United States joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, an international treaty, in 1992 and has attended its conferences \u2014 known as COP, for \"Conference of Parties\" \u2014 in many years since, most recently last year's COP28 in Dubai.",
      "Project 2025, the conservative blueprint drawn up by the Heritage Foundation for the next GOP administration \u2014 which the president-elect has endeavored to distance himself from \u2014 calls for the U.S. to withdraw from both the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.",
      "What is COP29?",
      "This year's United Nations Climate Change Conference \u2014 called COP29, since it's the 29th Conference of Parties \u2014 kicks off Monday in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, and runs through Nov. 22.",
      "The annual summit, which is held in a different location every year, brings together world leaders and thousands of other representatives of nations that are party to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Their goal is to take stock of the progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0 \u2014 each country sets it own targets and action plan \u2014 and limiting global warming.",
      "So far, the world is falling far short of meeting these climate goals.",
      "Overall,\u00a02023 had the highest greenhouse gas emissions ever recorded, although here are currently 42 countries\u00a0where emissions are decreasing, including the United States, China, Russia and in the European Union.",
      "Without greater reductions over the next few years, the world is on a path to see a temperature increase of more than 3 degrees Celsius, according to an October U.N. report, which warned such an outcome \"would bring debilitating impacts to people, planet and economies.\"",
      "Under the Paris Agreement, countries update their targets for emission cuts (known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs) every five years. The next update is due in February.",
      "Who's going to COP29?",
      "This year, President Biden is sending a delegation that includes John Podesta, the senior presidential adviser for international climate policy, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Ali Zaidi, the White House national climate adviser. Vice President Kamala Harris represented the U.S. at last year's conference.",
      "The gathering in Baku will be smaller than some previous summits for several reasons, including fewer attendance passes and hotel spaces, and concerns over Azerbaijan's human rights record and its oil-production-based economy.",
      "A number of other world leaders have opted not to attend this year, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. California Gov. Gavin Newsom isn't going either, although California often has a strong presence at the conference.",
      "Among the thousands who will attend are delegates from the Taliban government of Afghanistan, the Associated Press reported, citing the country's national environment agency. Though the regime is not internationally recognized, Afghanistan is considered one of the nations most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, with severe drought,\u00a0flooding, and a great need for financial assistance.",
      "Higher attendance is expected at next year's COP30 in Brazil, whose president shown a greater commitment to tackling emissions and climate finance.",
      "What is expected to happen at COP29?",
      "Countries will share updated national climate action plans on how to reduce emissions. The current administration is expected to submit its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) before President Biden leaves office, but whether the commitments will be upheld under the Trump administration seems unlikely.",
      "Attendees will also be discussing climate financing. Developed nations, which are most responsible for climate change, are expected to provide funding to developing nations for climate adaptation and green energy projects. Amnesty International projects that trillions of dollars will be needed to get developing countries up to speed.",
      "What will a Trump presidency mean for U.S. involvement in global climate efforts?",
      "Experts say that withdrawing from major climate agreements has the potential to isolate the U.S. in global climate negotiations, damage its reputation as a leader and encourage other high-emitting nations like China to deprioritize their emissions reductions. Leaving the Paris Agreement would mean the U.S. does not have to report on its emissions each year, and it would have weaker legal responsibilities to provide climate finance to developing countries.",
      "But while exiting these global commitments would be a major setback in the eyes of climate advocates, it wouldn't stop state and local governments, businesses or nonprofits from stepping up.",
      "In the wake of Trump's victory, several climate advocacy organizations released a flurry of statements reiterating their commitment to clean energy investments, carbon emission reduction and environmental protection. States and local governments are also expected to continue investing in initiatives like cap-and-invest programs, carbon neutrality, and infrastructure improvements.",
      "Other countries are also not likely to throw away their climate commitments.",
      "\"I am struck by the last time this happened, even with the shock, not a single other country followed the United States in withdrawing from the agreement,\" said Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and a former special envoy for climate change at the State Department.",
      "Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement would take at least a year to complete, and a future president would have the power to rejoin if they so choose \u2014 just as President Biden did after Trump exited the agreement during his first term.",
      "A withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, on the other hand, could have an even greater long-term impact. Exiting the global treaty would remove the U.S. from the international stage of climate discussions and could hamper the country's ability to participate in negotiations in the future. The U.S. Senate ratified joining the UNFCCC in 1992, which legal experts say could make withdrawal a more complex process.",
      "If the U.S. does withdraw, the rest of the world will continue to negotiate even in its absence. The void left by America will likely be filled by another country, like China, which could negotiate deals that fall in its favor.",
      "\"Leaving the Framework Convention doesn't provide a lot of benefit to a Trump administration,\" said David Waskow, director of International Climate Action at the World Resources Institute, on a call with reporters. \"It actually brings a lot of harm to the U.S. in terms of reputational impacts and the ability to work with other countries on shaping the clean energy economy.\"",

      "the 350 trucks the U.S. government said must be rolling into Gaza to meet the urgent needs of the enclave's 2 million-plus people.",
      "United Nations humanitarian agencies have said in recent days that far from a dramatic increase, even less food and other aid are reaching Palestinian civilians in Gaza due to ongoing Israeli restrictions and evacuation orders and ramped-up offensives in the north and center of the territory, along with chaos created by the lack of any law enforcement presence in the enclave.",

      "Forty-seven years later, Perigo got his ring back. The surprise reunion unfolded thanks to Alex Davis, a professional freediver who recently discovered the jewelry while using an underwater metal detector. There were three clues inscribed on the ring -- the name of the school, the year 1965 and the initials FMP, Davis told the university.",
      "\"[It's] not surprising the gold has tarnished around the stone setting and the stag emblem is a bit worn down but overall it's in great condition,\" Davis said.",

The crowds caused gridlock and prompted bike-sharing companies to lock down their services, CBS News partner network BBC News reported.",
      "The idea for the event was sparked by four college students who took the same roughly 30-mile trip over the summer to get soup dumplings. It appears to have grown out of a trend that's seen young people struggling with China's difficult job market seek out inexpensive travel options.",

      "Emperor penguins are among the species directly threatened by the rising temperature of the oceans and seas across the world. According to The World Wildlife Foundation, about three-quarters of the world's breeding colonies of emperor penguins are vulnerable to fluctuations in the annual sea ice cover in the Antarctic, which have become far more erratic due to climate change.",

At his clinic near Tel Aviv, we got to see how they're catering hyperbaric medicine to athletes (\"If we can shorten the recovery period, you can push harder doing the exercises\"), and helping patients with brain injuries regain movement through the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain.",
      "\"It's not that we are fixing his running,\" Efrati said about one athlete's performance. \"We are fixing the brain.\"",
      "They've published several studies, looking at PTSD in veterans. One, out today, found that 68% of patients showed significant improvement. Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",
      "For Mizrhai, the treatment changed everything:\" \"It's the first time that I was feeling again. I begin to sleep at night, I was less afraid. It's make me feel alive again. \u2026 I was a dying man, and after this, I'm a living man.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Congressman and medical doctor Greg Murphy said, \"If it's being offered in Israel and they're getting such good results, why the hell are we not offering it in the United States?\"",
      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",
      "In 2023 he introduced the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act. \"We just basically want the VA to do a pilot study within their own confines to see whether they show that hyperbaric oxygen works or not,\" he said.",
      "And what is he hearing from the VA? \"They just don't want to do anything; it's just hands up,\" he said. \"The reasons that we've heard is, 'Well, the results are mixed.' Fine. Look at the results in the last 15 years. Look at the studies in Israel. We are seeing an absolute effect in this, and other disorders, for Parkinson's, migraines, some even MS, neurological disorders.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" requested an interview with the Department of Veterans Affairs, but they declined to comment.",
      "In Salt Lake City, Utah, we met Dr. Lin Weaver, who runs Hyperbaric Medicine at Intermountain Health. They treat about 20 patients a day, which puts into perspective the huge numbers - 350 daily \u2013 being treated in Israel. \u00a0He says they use their hyperbaric chambers for PTSD patients rarely, because it is expensive, but he has seen positive results: \"I've had patients that I've treated. Every one has got surprisingly better,\" Weaver said.",
      "But insurance companies say there is not enough proof it works for PTSD. And in the U.S., out-of-pocket costs soar above $50,000.",
      "\"What's necessary is like a drug trial,\" Weaver said. \"But these trials take years to accomplish. It all rests with, 'Is there an initiative? And is there a funding source?'\"",
      "Doane asked, \"But if doctors like you feel so strongly that this works, why isn't there enough push coming from folks like you to say, 'Prove this'?\"",
      "\"Well, believe me, we've tried,\" Weaver replied. \"I have submitted proposals to extramural funding agencies. So far, they haven't accepted them.\"",
      "Doane asked Dr. Efrati, \"You are out on the frontier here of medicine. Is there a danger in that?\"",
      "\"As a scientist, I will always tell you I need more study, I need more data,\" he replied. \"But as a physician, when I'm sitting in front of you looking at your eyes, you have a problem now. This is our job as a physician.\"",
      "Idit Negrin says this treatment is giving her hope she can move past that nightmare at the Nova Music Festival. She hopes, with the therapy, she can move on with her life.",
      "But she wears a reminder \u2013 a Nova necklace \u2013 while she gets treatment. \"I don't get her off my neck,\" she said.",
      "Her progress is motivation for Dr. Efrati to keep innovating, thinking about the future so his patients can process the past.",
      "Doane said, \"Some people are gonna listen to this and say it sounds too good to be true.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I know,\" said Negrin. \"But it's fact.\"",

    "story": [
      "Chef Robert Irvine of the Robert Irvine Foundation speaks with Fox News Digital about the importance of supporting veterans and first responders this Veterans Day and some unique ways to do so.",
      "Cyberscammers are some of the most heartless people out there. They don\u2019t even spare our military heroes.",
      "Last year, these criminals stole $477 million from veterans, military personnel and their spouses, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). That\u2019s a $63 million jump from 2022, showing that the military community is a big target for scammers. The number of military members who lost money to these attacks went up by 7% to 30,948, per the FTC\u2019s latest data.",
      "These scammers use all kinds of tricks to get veterans to hand over personal info or hard-earned cash, including veterans' benefit scams and IRS scams. I break down five of the most common scams targeting our military heroes and how to stay safe from them.",

      "Image of military personnel (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Romance scams",
      "Romance scams have become an increasingly painful reality for veterans, as scammers target them through fake online relationships to exploit their emotions and financial stability. Often, these scammers pose as attractive, understanding individuals on dating apps, social media platforms or even support forums specifically tailored for veterans. They\u2019ll build a relationship over weeks or months, using flattery and fabricated stories to create a strong emotional connection with their target.",
      "Once the scammer believes they\u2019ve gained enough trust, they\u2019ll ask for money, typically by inventing a sudden, urgent situation. It might be a \"medical emergency,\" a supposed travel expense to come to visit or even a claim that they need help with a legal matter. The requests start small but can quickly escalate as the scammer continues to manipulate the victim's emotions.",
      "This continues to be the most common fraud targeting veterans, costing them and their families over $40 million in 2020, according to Aura. Among all romance scam victims, those ages 50-69 were hit the hardest, losing $179.65 million in just the first three quarters of 2022. That figure has almost certainly surged in 2024.",

      "Veterans benefit scams",
      "Some scammers pretend to offer help with veterans' benefits. They promise to help increase benefits or expedite claims, but they\u2019re really after personal information or a fee. A scammer might claim you\u2019re eligible for new or additional benefits, contacting you by phone, email or text. When dealing with unsolicited advice, remember that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Phishing scams from fake government agencies",
      "Phishing scams are a social engineering trick where scammers send emails that look like they\u2019re from official places, like the government or your bank. These legit-looking emails act as bait, but the real goal is to grab your banking or credit card info.",
      "Sometimes, these scam emails will ask you to click a link or download an attachment, which can install malware on your device. Scammers are also known to send phishing links through LinkedIn, Facebook or other social media.",
      "One classic example is the IRS scam. Though it targets everyone, military members are prime targets. Scammers pretend to be IRS agents, threatening jail time, fines or other penalties if they don\u2019t get immediate payment. They even spoof IRS caller IDs to make their calls look real.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Rental property scams",
      "Rental property scams are a common way scammers try to exploit people looking for a place to rent. In these scams, fraudsters often post fake listings for apartments or houses on popular rental websites or social media platforms. The listing might look too good to be true, like a beautiful place at an unbelievably low price.",
      "The scammer will usually claim to be out of town or unavailable to meet in person, asking potential renters to send a deposit or rent payment upfront to \"secure\" the property. In some cases, they may even send fake lease agreements or claim that the property is already rented, but they can still \"help\" find a similar place.",
      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "Car sales and financing scams",
      "Car sales and financing scams targeting veterans are unfortunately common. Scammers know that veterans may have limited experience with certain financial deals, so they exploit that by offering unrealistic car sales or financing options. These scams can take various forms, and the result is often financial loss and stress.",
      "Image of military personnel honoring our troops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways veterans can protect themselves from scams",
      "1) Be cautious with unsolicited offers: Whether it\u2019s a phone call, email or text, if someone claims to offer help with veterans' benefits or promises something too good to be true, don\u2019t take the bait. Verify the legitimacy of any offer directly through official channels like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or trusted veteran organizations.",
      "2) Watch out for emotional manipulation in online relationships: Romance scammers often prey on veterans' emotions. Avoid sharing personal or financial details with people you meet online, especially if the relationship feels rushed or too perfect. If someone asks for money after just a few weeks or months, it\u2019s likely a scam.",
      "3) Verify government communications: Scammers often impersonate government agencies like the IRS or VA. If you get a message that threatens penalties or asks for personal information, don\u2019t respond. Instead, contact the agency directly using official contact details to confirm whether the message is legitimate.",
      "4) Be skeptical of rental or car sale deals that seem too good to be true: If a rental listing or car sale seems too cheap or perfect to be true, it probably is. Always visit the property or dealership in person, and never send money upfront without seeing the product or having a signed agreement.",
      "5) Protect your personal information: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Scammers use phishing emails and fake websites to steal personal and financial information. Ensure your devices have updated security software and be extra cautious when handling sensitive data online.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6)\u00a0Invest in data removal services: Consider using data removal services to protect your personal information from being harvested by scammers. These services can help remove your data from public databases and people-search websites, reducing the risk of identity theft and unwanted solicitations.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers rely on misinformation to trick you. However, by staying informed and being extra careful when navigating the internet, you can stay safe. These bad actors are constantly finding new ways to target veterans, from romance scams to fake government offers. Being cautious, verifying offers and keeping your data secure are the best ways to avoid falling victim to these heartless fraudsters.",

The most effective solution seems to be using Siri Shortcuts or Voice Control, as these methods create unique commands that are less likely to be misinterpreted across devices. It's worth noting that voice assistant technology is continually improving. In the future, we may see more sophisticated context recognition that can better distinguish between similar names on different devices.

      "A woman using a VPN on a tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A VPN, or virtual private network, is a service that encrypts your internet connection, ensuring that your online activities remain private and secure. By routing your internet traffic through a secure server, VPNs mask your IP address, making it difficult for hackers and malicious entities to track your online behavior.",
      "A VPN being used on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "CAN YOU BYPASS VPN BLOCKS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY?",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms \u2014 IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from its server network, effectively preventing websites and cybercriminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",

So, how can a VPN prevent identity theft? By encrypting your internet connection, VPNs protect against data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information, especially on unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi.

      "Online transactions are vulnerable to interception by cybercriminals looking to steal financial information such as credit card numbers and banking credentials. A VPN can be used as a shield for financial data. VPNs ensure that all data exchanged during online transactions is encrypted, making it nearly impossible for hackers to access sensitive financial information. When using public Wi-Fi networks, which are often targeted by cybercriminals, a VPN provides an additional layer of security by encrypting all data transmissions.",

      "ChatGPT is an amazing tool, and its developer, OpenAI, keeps adding new features from time to time.",
      "Recently, the company introduced a new memory feature in ChatGPT, which essentially enables it to remember things about you. For example, it can recall your age, gender, philosophical beliefs and pretty much anything else.",
      "These memories are meant to remain private, but a researcher recently demonstrated how ChatGPT's artificial intelligence memory features can be manipulated, raising questions about privacy and security.",

      "ChatGPT introduction screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ChatGPT's Memory feature?",
      "ChatGPT\u2019s memory feature is designed to make the chatbot more personal to you. It remembers information that might be useful for future conversations and tailors responses based on that information, even if you open a different chat. For example, if you mention that you\u2019re vegetarian, the next time you ask for recipes, it will provide only vegetarian options.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "You can also train it to remember specific details about you, such as saying, \"Remember that I like to watch classic movies.\" In future interactions, it will tailor recommendations accordingly.

      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The security vulnerability in ChatGPT",
      "As reported by\u00a0Arstechnica, security researcher Johann Rehberger found that it\u2019s possible to trick the AI into remembering false information through a method called indirect prompt injection. This means the AI can be manipulated into accepting instructions from unreliable sources like emails or blog posts.",
      "For instance, Rehberger demonstrated that he could trick ChatGPT into believing a certain user was 102 years old, lived in a fictional place called the Matrix and thought the Earth was flat. After the AI accepts this made-up information, it will carry it over to all future chats with that user. These false memories could be implanted by using tools like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive to store files, upload images or even browse a site like Bing \u2014 all of which could be manipulated by a hacker.",
      "Rehberger submitted a follow-up report that included a proof of concept, demonstrating how he could exploit the flaw in the ChatGPT app for macOS. He showed that by tricking the AI into opening a web link containing a malicious image, he could make it send everything a user typed and all the AI's responses to a server he controlled. This meant that if an attacker could manipulate the AI in this way, they could monitor all conversations between the user and ChatGPT.",
      "Rehberger's proof-of-concept exploit demonstrated that the vulnerability could be used to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. The attack isn't possible through the ChatGPT web interface, thanks to an API OpenAI rolled out last year. However, it was still possible through the ChatGPT app for macOS.",
      "When Rehberger privately reported the finding to OpenAI in May, the company took it seriously and mitigated this issue by ensuring that the model doesn\u2019t follow any links generated within its own responses, like those involving memory and similar features.",

      "CYBER SCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "OpenAI\u2019s response",
      "After Rehberger shared his proof of concept, OpenAI engineers took action and released a patch to address this vulnerability. They released a new version of the ChatGPT macOS application (version 1.2024.247) that encrypts conversations and fixes the security flaw.",
      "So, while OpenAI has taken steps to address the immediate security flaw, there are still potential vulnerabilities related to memory manipulation and the need for ongoing vigilance in using AI tools with memory features. The incident underscores the evolving nature of security challenges in AI systems.",
      "The company says, \"It\u2019s important to note that prompt injection in large language models is an area of ongoing research. As new techniques emerge, we address them at the model layer via instruction hierarchy or application-layer defenses like the ones mentioned.\"",
      "How do I disable ChatGPT memory?",

      "1. Regularly review privacy settings:\u00a0Stay informed about what data is being collected. Periodically check and adjust privacy settings on AI platforms like ChatGPT and others to ensure you\u2019re only sharing information you\u2019re comfortable with.",
      "2. Be cautious about sharing sensitive information:\u00a0Less is more when it comes to personal data. Avoid disclosing sensitive details such as your full name, address, or financial information in conversations with AI.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid reusing them across different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your ChatGPT and other AI accounts.\u00a0By requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "5. Keep software and applications up to date:\u00a0Stay ahead of vulnerabilities.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered threats, so enable automatic updates whenever possible.",
      "6. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0 In an age where AI is everywhere, protecting your data from cyber threats is more important than ever. Adding strong antivirus software to your devices adds a critical layer of protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "7. Regularly monitor your accounts:\u00a0Catch issues early. Frequently check bank statements and online accounts for any unusual activity, which can help you identify potential\u00a0breaches quickly.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "As AI tools like ChatGPT get smarter and more personal, it's pretty interesting to think about how they can tailor conversations to us. But, as Johann Rehberger\u2019s findings remind us, there are some real risks involved, especially when it comes to privacy and security. While OpenAI is able to mitigate these issues as they arise, it also shows that we need to keep a close eye on how these features work. It's all about finding that sweet spot between innovation and keeping our data safe.",

      "Data theft and ransomware attacks against health care and critical third-party providers are still happening at an alarmingly high rate in 2024, which is shaping up to be as severe as last year, the worst on record for health care breaches.",

      "Impact of ransomware on health care",
      "Microsoft points out that beyond the financial risk to health care organizations, ransomware attacks can have life-threatening consequences. When health care providers lose access to diagnostic equipment or patient records due to ransomware, patient care is severely disrupted. For example, stroke code activations are nearly double during hospital attacks, with confirmed strokes increasing by 113.6%, and cardiac arrest cases rise by 81% and survival rates drop from 40% to just 4.5%.",
      "Health care facilities near hospitals hit by ransomware attacks also feel the impact, facing a surge in patients needing urgent care that they may not be equipped to handle. As a result, patients often face longer wait times.",
      "What\u2019s more troubling is that these attacks aren\u2019t limited to urban areas. Rural health clinics are also prime targets for cyberattacks. These facilities are particularly vulnerable to ransomware because they often lack the resources to prevent or respond to security incidents. And since these clinics are the only health care option within miles, a successful attack can be devastating for many rural communities.",

      "HEALTH CARE RANSOMWARE ATTACK EXPOSES PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION OF OVER 100 MILLION",
      "Why health care is the prime target?",
      "Ransomware attacks on health care have shot up 300% since 2015, making it one of the top 10 most targeted industries in the second quarter of 2024. This rise is mostly because health care organizations store extremely sensitive data, and hackers know there\u2019s big money to be made. With lives on the line, hospitals can\u2019t risk poor patient outcomes if their systems go down or the exposure of patient data if they don\u2019t pay. This reputation for paying ransoms just makes health care an even bigger target.",
      "Some of the blame also falls on health care organizations. They tend to have lower cybersecurity budgets compared to other industries, making it harder to defend against these kinds of attacks. Many facilities don\u2019t have staff dedicated to cybersecurity; some don\u2019t even have a chief information security officer or a security operations center. Instead, cybersecurity often gets lumped in with regular IT duties. Plus, doctors, nurses and other health care staff might not get any cybersecurity training, so they might not even recognize a\u00a0phishing email when they see one.",

      "5. Be vigilant against phishing: Cyberattacks often result in a spike in phishing emails and calls as attackers exploit the situation. Protect yourself by using strong antivirus software on all your devices, which can help block malicious links and detect phishing emails.

      "Even though it is more difficult to penetrate the iPhone, it doesn\u2019t mean it is impossible. In fact, some hackers watch for particular vulnerabilities in iOS to launch their attacks. If you see such warnings, it\u2019s best to ignore them and avoid clicking on any links or downloading any suggested software. Below are several key steps you can take to secure your iPhone.",
      "1) Keep your iPhone up to date: Occasionally, Apple releases new iOS updates to address known vulnerabilities. When possible, it is best to\u00a0update the iOS so that your iPhone is safe from known vulnerabilities.",
      "2) Install and run strong antivirus software: An antivirus software actively running on all of your devices can help keep them all safe, including your iPhone. With iPhones, strong antivirus software will prevent you from clicking on any malicious links that may then install malware onto your devices, which can potentially extract personal information from your device. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These can be phishing attempts designed to steal your personal information.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Download apps only from the App Store: Stick to downloading apps from the official Apple App Store. Apps on the App Store are vetted by Apple for security, reducing the risk of downloading malicious software.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security to your Apple ID can help protect your personal information. With\u00a02FA, even if someone gets your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without the second factor.",
      "5) Use strong passwords: Ensure that your passwords are strong and unique for different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them.",
      "6) Monitor app permissions: Regularly check the\u00a0permissions granted to your apps and revoke any that seem unnecessary. This can help prevent apps from accessing more information than they need.",

      "While most iPhone users rest easy knowing that the iOS keeps most common viruses and malware at bay, they are still susceptible to scammers trying to work around the closed code and scaring people into making bad choices that endanger their phones and data. Because Apple never sends out alerts about viruses or malware on your iPhone, it should be the first clue of a scam. Even if it looks official, iPhone users do not get alerts from Apple about viruses or malware. If you do install a good antivirus program, that will be the only program notifying you that there is anything amiss with your iPhone. Understanding these scams can go a long way in keeping you calm and your phone safe.",

      "Common misconceptions",
      "Opening emails can instantly infect your device: One common myth is that simply opening an email can automatically infect your device with malware. In reality, modern email systems (such as Gmail, Outlook, etc.) generally prevent this from happening. The real danger comes from interacting with the content inside the email, such as clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.",
      "Plain text emails are always safe: While emails in plain text format are generally safer than HTML-based emails, they can still pose a risk if they contain malicious links. Phishing attacks can appear in plain text emails, luring you to dangerous websites.",
      "Emails from known contacts are always safe: Even if an email appears to come from someone you know, that doesn\u2019t always mean it's safe. Attackers can spoof email addresses or hack accounts, so always be cautious about unexpected or unusual messages from known contacts, especially those containing links or attachments.",
      "Spam filters catch all malicious emails: Spam filters are highly effective but not perfect. Some sophisticated phishing and malicious emails can bypass these filters and land in your inbox. This is why it\u2019s important to stay vigilant, even with emails that seem to have passed your email service\u2019s security checks.",
      "Previewing emails is always safe: Most modern email clients use a \"preview\" pane for quick reading. While the risk of malware through previews is significantly reduced in up-to-date systems, embedded trackers or other forms of data collection can still occur, confirming your activity to the spammer. Always disable automatic image loading or other active content features in your email client\u2019s settings to minimize exposure.",

      "What to watch out for",
      "As mentioned already, generally, simply opening an email is not enough to cause harm. However, there are some important points to consider:",
      "1) Embedded trackers: Some spam or\u00a0phishing emails contain trackers that can notify the sender when the email is opened. This can confirm to the spammer that your email address is active, potentially leading to more spam.",
      "2) Malicious links and attachments: The real danger lies in clicking on links or downloading attachments within the email. These can lead to malicious websites or download malware onto your device.",
      "3) HTML emails: Emails that contain HTML content can sometimes execute scripts when opened. While modern email clients have protections against this, it\u2019s still a potential risk.",
      "4) Phishing attempts: Even if you don\u2019t click on anything,\u00a0phishing emails can be designed to look very convincing and may trick you into providing personal information if you respond.",

      "3) Enable email filtering: Turn on spam filters to reduce the number of unsolicited or potentially dangerous emails reaching your inbox. This reduces your exposure to phishing attempts. Most email platforms these days automatically filter out what they assume to be \"junk\" into their own folder. If you notice the amount of spam getting through to your inbox increasing, you may want to consider a\u00a0Spam Filter.\u00a0There are free options for different email providers. For Gmail, try\u00a0Mailwasher. For Outlook and Windows Mail, try\u00a0Spam Bully, which costs an annual fee of $29.95.",
      "4) Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your email client and operating system to stay protected from the latest security vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit.",
      "5) Consider data removal services: Use data removal services to ensure your personal information is less accessible to potential scammers. This reduces your risk of being targeted in the first place.",

      "Top signs someone might be using your Social Security number",
      "Are you concerned that your Social Security number may have gotten into the wrong hands? Check below to see if you are experiencing any of these signs:",
      "Americans are granted free credit reports every 12 months from the three major consumer reporting companies. Regularly culling through these reports can help you spot potential fraud, which might signal that your Social Security number has been compromised. Any hard inquiries you didn\u2019t request on your credit report are a strong indicator that someone tried to open a credit card or another line of credit with your SSN.",
      "While most people know they should check their credit report and scores, you can see your Social Security statement by creating an account on the official Social Security Administration website. Because only one account can be created per SSN, it is safer if you claim it so that no one else can by piecing together your personal information (along with your SSN) to claim it fraudulently. Make sure it is connected to a secure email account that you check frequently. This account also provides up-to-date data on earnings and benefit distributions so you can see if anything is \"off.\"",
      "You can see your Social Security statement by creating an account on the official Social Security Administration website. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "While it might seem natural to toss a pile of \"junk\" mailers or ignore calls from random debt collectors or advertisers, it may be an indicator that someone has gotten a hold of your Social Security number and has begun opening accounts under your number. It\u2019s important to make note of the patterns and follow up with these collectors should it become more and more apparent that your SSN might have been misused. Oftentimes, consumers start getting more credit offers when new credit cards are opened. Additionally, if you start receiving bills under someone else\u2019s name at your address, it might be time to follow up with these notices.",
      "If you start receiving notices about your Social Security number being used to file someone else\u2019s taxes or inappropriately use your health insurance, it is definitely a sign that someone may have compromised your SSN. While receiving a notice from the IRS or Medicare can feel scary, it is imperative that you reach out to the corresponding agency to notify them of the fraudulent activity so that you can stop further damage.",
      "Beware of new notices from the IRS or other governmental agencies. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Top ways to keep your Social Security number safe",
      "Go to the official Social Security Administration website to create an account,\u00a0if you haven\u2019t already.",
      "Put your Social Security number card in a very safe place, such as a safe, bank safe or a filing cabinet that can be locked. Because it is used so frequently, those nine digits are worth memorizing. If your wallet is lost or stolen, and you keep your SSN card in there, it will be messier than losing just money or your ID. Don\u2019t carry your Social Security card in your wallet or purse.",
      "Skip jotting down your Social Security number on in-person forms. When your SSN is jotted down on paper, it is hard to control how the information gets used or disposed of. If you can submit forms online, you can skip the risk of having your SSN getting into the wrong hands. If you mail in forms that denote your SSN, you risk having that piece of mail stolen or lost.",
      "Even though your SSN is requested on some forms, it is not always necessary. If a future employer is requesting your SSN, double-check why they need it. They would most likely need it to run a background check, which you should know about anyway. Additionally, some establishments allow you to provide the last four digits of your SSN until you are finalizing a screening process, etc.",
      "Open accounts for your children's Social Security numbers because you want to claim them for them early and be able to monitor any movement related to their SSN.",
      "Some records that contain your Social Security number are important to keep on hand, such as income tax filings. If they are kept digitally, encrypt and or password-protect the document or folder, especially if it is uploaded to the cloud. Keep offline documents with SSNs in a safe or shred instead of throwing them away.",
      "Remember you (usually) only get one SSN in a lifetime, it is important to safeguard that data with your \"life.\"",
      "Removing your personal information from the internet, given the increasing privacy concerns about artificial intelligence, is essential. Data removal services can help protect your Social Security number by systematically erasing your details from websites, thus reducing the risk of identity theft.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "To further protect your tax returns from identity theft, the IRS offers an identity protection PIN (IP PIN). This is a six-digit number that prevents someone else from filing a tax return using your Social Security number or individual taxpayer identification number. The IP PIN is known only to you and the IRS, adding an extra layer of security to your tax filings.",

      "Former Geary, Oklahoma, Police Department Chief Alicia Ford says the entire department resigned last month after they were refused help from city leaders.",
      "An entire city's leadership has crumbled after the failure of political leaders to meet the police department's needs, its former chief said.",
      "The entire Geary Police Department in Oklahoma \u2014 including Chief Alicia Ford \u2014 resigned on Oct. 31. City Council members Rocky Coleman and Kristy Miller resigned shortly afterward, as FOX 25 Oklahoma City first reported. Mayor Waylan Upchego then resigned, the Watonga Republican reported.",
      "\"The reason that prompted the entire resignation was: it was just a continued failure from the mayor to make change that would affect the department and make it more effective for the community,\" Ford told Fox News Digital. \"It was just an ongoing issue. He consistently refused to keep his word to us, and that was something that we held him to. When you're a mayor, you're [supposed] to lead the city and what's best for the city and the departments within.\"",
      "Ford said she had gone to Upchego and the city council requesting their help to address the overworked and understaffed police department, plus budget cuts that had recently impacted pay and bonuses for officers, on top of some other administrative issues. Nobody stepped up, according to the former police chief.",

      "\"They cut the jail. They cut our dispatch, and that put strain on us. But we found we went to another agency, and they have done excellent and accommodating us with that dispatch,\" Ford explained. \"[The mayor] consistently refused to keep his word when it came to basic needs of equipment and the safety issues within our department. We talked about the budget cuts that caused hardships for these officers and myself that were unnecessary.\"",
      "Hope added that she knows that police departments across the country have dealt with staffing shortages and budget cuts, but her six-person department had recently dwindled to four, with herself doing administrative chief work, one officer stationed at the local high school, and two officers working extremely long shifts doing regular daily police work.",
      "\"Who wants to do that for extremely low pay?\"",
      "\"So that would lead two officers to do basically 24 hours . . . five to seven days a week. That's not realistic,\" she said. \"But honestly, who wants to do that for extremely low pay? I mean, they did it. And honestly, I don't ever really remember these two officers complaining about it.\"",

I've taken several roles in law enforcement, but never that type of administrative, high . . . role,\" she explained. \"It was great. . . . Geary, Oklahoma, was an amazing community. They were very accepting of me.\"",

      "\"I have tried to be a voice of reason. Unfortunately, I was just one voice. The City Council and administration should not allow personal goals or agendas to affect the city. Decisions should be made only to benefit the city,\" he wrote, adding that council members lacked communication and were frequently left in the dark about agenda items.",
      "\"Transparency is also crucial for communication. I would love to see more communication online, not just in person. For example, the financial reports should be posted for the community to read. I have never shied away from explaining the state of the finances to any citizen who has asked. When people are informed, they are more likely to understand that we have a failing infrastructure and why rate increases must happen. I have repeatedly asked that we be more proactive instead of reactive. We should be prepared for the worst and not hoping for the best.\"",

      "The trauma associated with being Jewish in Chicago goes back far longer than Oct. 26 for Reich, who described how a growing contingent of activists with Students for Justice in Palestine would \"be aggressive to the Hillel table\" when she attended Illinois Institute of Technology over a decade ago.",
      "The attacks of Oct. 7 heightened that feeling of hate even further. With all the anti-Israel activity in the city over the past year, Reich reports that she is \"always worried if my husband goes downtown,\" and that she doesn\u2019t \"go to Northwestern anymore, to walk around their lakefront area.\"",

      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \"intended for installation on a large surface warship\" under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \"national defense designation\" helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \"national defense-related construction project\" that is classified \"secret.\"",
      "\"Unless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\" researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \"convincing argument.\"",
      "\"From the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\" she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \"carefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\"",
      "\"Given the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\" said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "Pursuit of a nuclear-powered carrier",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \"ski-jump\" type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \"soon be announced,\" but so far it has not been.",

(Pu Haiyang/Xinhua via AP)",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \"incremental improvements.\"",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \"have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\"",
      "\"For now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\"",
      "CHINA OFFICIALLY 'DOESN'T CARE' ABOUT TRUMP WIN; UNOFFICIALLY, EXPERTS SAY BEIJING IS RATTLED",
      "Eventually, however, \"larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\" Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\"As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\" Childs said.",
      "\"Much will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\"",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \"with greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\" said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\"These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\" Zhao said.",
      "U.S.-China rivalry",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \"first-class\" navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \"speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\"",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, China's third conventionally powered aircraft carrier, the Fujian, conducts a maiden sea trial on May 7, 2024. (Ding Ziyu/Xinhua via AP, File)",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \"growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\" the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",

      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",

      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "The first sample alone is not enough and additional small-scale sampling missions will be necessary in order to obtain more data, TEPCO spokesperson Kenichi Takahara told reporters Thursday. \"It may take time, but we will steadily tackle decommissioning,\" Takahara said.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the. plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor.

      "That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",

      "\"We\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\" Hallan said.",

      "But it\u2019s far from clear that the campaign will succeed. The Senate is a famously insular body that is relatively detached from populist fervor, giving members six-year terms and usually operating on seniority. It would be unusual for Scott to leapfrog two colleagues who have served much longer, cultivated deeper relationships and have each paid their dues in pursuit of the job.",
      "Most importantly, the election will be held by secret ballot. Unlike votes on legislation and nominations \u2014 as well as the vote for speaker of the House \u2014 votes for Senate leadership are anonymous.

      "Most notably, Trump himself hasn\u2019t weighed in as all three candidates seek to show their pro-Trump bona fides.",
      "Scott called Trump in May to ask him for his support in the leadership race, which he said he would appreciate, and his goal is to pressure Trump into announcing his support ahead of Wednesday\u2019s election, according to two people with knowledge of his thinking.",

      "Even before last week's elections, Scott had sought to become a bridge between House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his Senate GOP conference and push Mitch McConnell out of relevancy. And with Republicans on track to hold on to a narrow House majority, Scott sees his bond with the Louisianan as an edge in the leadership race.",
      "A handful of sitting senators have publicly backed him: Sens. Ron Johnson, R-Wis.; Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn.; and Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala. Some of them, like Rubio, Hagerty and Tuberville, have been floated for senior positions in the Trump administration.",

      "The interview and MAGA online campaign were intentional moves to project a flood of support for the newly re-elected Floridian and put pressure on Thune, who is considered the frontrunner.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve spent eight months carefully listening to my colleagues about their vision for the next chapter of the Senate Republican Conference, especially as we hit the ground running with President Trump,\u201d Thune said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cOne thing is clear: We must act quickly and decisively to get the president\u2019s cabinet and other nominees in place as soon as possible to start delivering on the mandate we\u2019ve been sent to execute, and all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments. We cannot let Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats block the will of the American people.\u201d",
      "Cornyn vowed that if Democrats block Trump\u2019s nominees, \u201cwe will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent. Additionally, the Constitution expressly confers the power on the President to make recess appointments.\u201d",

      "But even before the new Congress is sworn in next January, the outcome of the Pennsylvania race could have implications for the Senate leadership elections Wednesday.",

      "Without a clear winner yet in Pennsylvania, though, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is waiting to invite either McCormick or Casey to Congress this week for orientation and Wednesday's vote \u2014 a move that has angered Republicans.",
      "Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who is running to be the GOP leader, said on X that \u201cthe idea that Schumer would not allow him to participate in Senate orientation is beyond unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., called Schumer's move to hold off on inviting McCormick a \"shameful, election-denying decision\" in a post on X.",

      "\"With over 100,000 ballots left to be counted in Pennsylvania, the race has not been decided,\" spokesperson Alex Nguyen said. \"As is custom, we will invite the winner once the votes are counted.\"",
      "Similarly, Arizona Democratic Senate candidate Ruben Gallego was also not invited to the orientation as his race against Republican Kari Lake is too close to call, according to an NBC News projection. He leads by 2 percentage points with 91% of the expected vote in.",
      "Provisional ballots were a contentious issue in Pennsylvania even before Election Day. Pennsylvanians can cast provisional ballots when officials are unclear about their eligibility or there were issues with their returned mail-in ballots. In the days after an election, officials work to determine whether such voters are eligible to cast ballots, and if they are, their votes will be counted.",
      "In the days before Election Day, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to allow Pennsylvania voters who sent mail ballots that were flagged as potentially defective to submit separate provisional in-person ballots, rejecting a lawsuit from Republicans.",
      "McCormick\u2019s campaign filed\u00a0two lawsuits\u00a0Friday challenging an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 provisional ballots in Philadelphia that may have issues, such as missing signatures. Philadelphia is a deep-blue area, and the results in the county so far have leaned heavily in Casey\u2019s favor.",
      "The court dismissed the issue for the time being.",
      "As of Sunday, the Casey campaign was still expressing optimism about overcoming its vote deficit, pointing to the roughly 76% of provisional ballots that favored Democrat John Fetterman over Republican Mehmet Oz in 2022.",
      "\"We don\u2019t believe we need to reach Fetterman\u2019s percent breakdown in order to win. What\u2019s more, there are thousands of ballots that are supportive of Casey that are being cured,\" said a person close to the Casey campaign, referring to the processing of addressing minor mistakes on mail ballots, such as signature issues.",
      "At the presidential level, NBC News projected that Trump won Pennsylvania. He leads Vice President Kamala Harris by about 2 percentage points."

    "story": [
      "Red Lobster\u2019s new CEO is attempting to revive the seafood chain, which has been a staple of the casual dining industry for more than half a century, with millennial mojo.",
      "\u201cWe want to make the restaurants more fun,\u201d Damola Adamolekun, 35, said. \u201cWe want to make this more energetic.\u201d",
      "Red Lobster is turning to millennial leadership to bring in younger guests, which the chain needs after closing more than 100 of its 640 restaurants earlier this year. Visits to Red Lobster were down more than 43% in October compared to the same time last year, according to data from Placer.ai, a location analytics company.",
      "Red Lobster has since emerged from bankruptcy, ushering in a new era for the once-major seafood chain. Fortress Investment Group is kicking in $60 million toward reshaping the brand\u2019s value offerings, service and atmosphere.",
      "On Monday, Adamolekun, who\u2019s been in the job since late August, announced a brand-new menu. He\u2019s introducing nine new items \u2014 and bringing back old favorites like hush puppies.",
      "\u201cThere should be some equal rejoicing on social media once you bring those back,\u201d Adamolekun said.",
      "He also plans to freshen up locations by fine-tuning lighting and decor, while creating new music playlists. With 40% of his guests over the age of 55, Adamolekun wants his improvements to appeal to all generations.",
      "\u201cYou have to strike a balance,\u201d he said.",
      "Red Lobster\u2019s problems mirror many of the difficulties plaguing casual restaurant chains.",
      "Overall visits to full-service restaurants were down 2% in the third quarter of this year. TGI Fridays recently closed 50 restaurants and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after foot traffic was down more than 35% from this time last year, according to Placer.ai. Breakfast chain Denny\u2019s is expected to close 150 stores soon.",
      "Higher food costs and scarce labor took a toll, according to R.J. Hottovy, Placer.ai\u2019s head of analytical research. As prices crept up at these restaurants, which are intended to provide an affordable night out for families, consumers instead opted to stay home or dine at restaurants offering value deals.",
      "\u201cSome brands like Olive Garden have driven increases in visitation trends through value-oriented promotions like the Never-Ending Pasta Bowl and other menu innovations,\u201d Hottovy said.",
      "Red Lobster infamously tried the promotion route in summer 2023, when it made its trademark $20 endless shrimp meal deal permanent in a bid to lure inflation-weary customers. But the deal was costly for Red Lobster \u2014 the company lost $11 million from that promotion alone, according to court documents.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to offer value, there needs to be a hook to bring the consumer in, but you can only give away so much food before you stop making money,\u201d said Jim Salera, a restaurant industry analyst at Stephens.",
      "Adamolekun criticized Thai Union, the global seafood giant that became Red Lobster\u2019s primary shareholder in 2020, for what he called its mismanagement of the company and for pushing the permanent endless shrimp deal, which Adamolekun said pushed the company into bankruptcy faster.",
      "\u201cIt changes the experience for your core customer, and I think you lost a lot of them,\u201d he said.",
      "Thai Union announced in January that it would begin a complete exit from Red Lobster. Fortress later appointed Adamolekun, who previously ran restaurant chain P.F. Chang's, to lead Red Lobster after bankruptcy.",
      "Now, Red Lobster is trying to balance keeping its loyal customers while trying to shake its stodgy image to attract younger ones. Its new menu still offers value, featuring new pastas for around $15 and three variations of shrimp for $20. But Adamolekun said he is also prioritizing the dining experience, investing in new technology to measure inventory and calculate table wait times, to make it more in tune with millennial expectations.",
      "\u201cEverybody knows Red Lobster,\u201d he said. \u201cBut how do you translate awareness to relevance?\u201d",
      "It will be an uphill battle, said Caitlin Daniel, a sociologist who studies food choice at Harvard University. Nostalgia isn\u2019t always enough to carry a chain like Red Lobster, she said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the question of being able to compete with other places that would provide a more compelling alternate experience,\u201d she said.",
      "That\u2019s why Adamolekun hopes his changes will also give younger customers the experience they\u2019re looking for.",
      "\u201cIf you want to have a future, then you need to engage younger guests,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to be here in 20, 30 years, you need millennials.\u201d"

      "Chiles originally finished fifth in the floor exercise event at the Paris Olympics in August. Her coach, Cecile Landi, saw that judges had erred in evaluating the degree of difficulty for an element of her routine and her score was corrected, landing her up to third place.",
      "However on the last day of the Games the International Olympic Committee announced it would abide by a\u00a0Court of Arbitration for Sport\u00a0ruling that Landi made the protest 64 seconds after scores were posted \u2014 four seconds have the 1-minute deadline.

      "\u201cIt was like a cherry on top. My redemption tour going into Paris was 'Yes.' Coming back with a gold, coming back with the understanding that I was able to go out there and be the best version of myself,\u201d she said. \u201cWith this floor medal it was like 'Wow, I never expected myself to make a floor final.'\"",
      "\"Plus it was an all Black podium. That was history being made. I was very glad to be a part of,\" she added.",
      "Ultimately, Chiles said she sees this as an opportunity to overcome the hurdles that come her way.",

      "When asked about competing in the Los Angeles Summer Olympics in 2028, Chiles said: \u201cLA is in and out of my mind. I think right now, I\u2019m just trying to take in what\u2019s happened from Paris and just take day by day.\""

    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 Lawmakers in Japan voted Monday to retain the embattled Shigeru Ishiba as prime minister despite his long-governing party\u2019s dismal showing in parliamentary elections last month.",
      "Ishiba, 67, became prime minister of the key U.S. ally on Oct. 1 shortly after winning the leadership race for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II. But his future in the role was in question after the party suffered its worst election defeat in more than a decade, losing support from voters angry about corruption scandals and the rising cost of living.",
      "That left the LDP without a parliamentary majority, but Ishiba was nonetheless able to retain his hold on power and will rule with a minority government. He must now face the challenges of a weakened and unpopular governing party as well as a possible shift in approach from Washington after the victory of President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Ishiba, a straight-talking former defense minister, received 221 votes compared with 160 for Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party. Other candidates received a total of 84 votes.",
      "Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, \u201cis faced with the most severe and complicated security environment in the postwar era,\u201d Ishiba said Saturday at an annual troop review at a Japanese military base outside Tokyo, vowing to strengthen the country\u2019s diplomatic efforts as well as its defense capabilities.",
      "He cited violations of Japanese airspace in August and September by China and Russia, as well as a Chinese aircraft carrier entering Japan\u2019s contiguous waters for the first time in September. Japan and other countries around the world are also concerned by accelerated weapons testing in nuclear-armed North Korea, which this year signed a mutual defense pact with Russia.",
      "The U.S.-Japan alliance is the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of Japan\u2019s diplomacy and security, said Ishiba, who said he and Trump had pledged to \u201cwork together to take the Japan-U.S. alliance to new heights\u201d in a phone call after Trump\u2019s election victory last week.",
      "Japan has a lot to worry about from a second Trump presidency, Koichi Nakano, a visiting scholar at Harvard\u2019s Weatherhead Program on U.S.-Japan Relations, told NBC News in an interview before the U.S. election last week.",
      "Many Japanese officials assume Trump is going to be \u201cmore straightforwardly anti-China,\u201d and that Japan will be \u201csomehow miraculously left off the hook,\u201d he said. But they are \u201cmisreading\u201d the U.S. president-elect, he said, despite his famous friendship with the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.",
      "Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs should be taken \u201cvery seriously,\u201d Nakano said, considering Japan\u2019s widening trade surplus with the U.S., its top export destination. They could have \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences for a country already wrestling with rising costs and a \u201cvery low\u201d currency, he said.",
      "Japan can also expect pressure from the Trump administration to spend more on defense, David Boling, director of Japan and Asian trade at the New York-based consulting firm Eurasia Group, said in a briefing after the U.S. election last week.",
      "Though Japan has already pledged to double\u00a0defense spending\u00a0to\u00a02% of gross domestic product by\u00a02027, \u201cthat\u2019s probably not going to be enough to satisfy Trump,\u201d Boling said.",
      "There is also strong U.S. opposition to Japanese company Nippon Steel\u2019s $14.9 billion bid to acquire Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. President Joe Biden, Trump and his Democratic rival in the U.S. presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris, had all come out against the deal.",
      "\u201cIt looks pretty dead,\u201d Boling said. The only way to revive it, he said, is for Nippon Steel to reach an agreement with United Steelworkers, a Pittsburgh-based union that has vocally opposed the takeover.",
      "Takahiro Mori, vice chairman of Nippon Steel, told reporters last week that the company hoped to close the deal by the end of the year, before Trump takes office.",
      "Much will come down to interpersonal relations. While Abe was \u201cextraordinarily skillful\u201d in dealing with Trump, Ishiba has a different personality, Boling said.",
      "Ishiba \u201cis more of a deep thinker type,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s known to be something of a defense intellectual, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to work that well with Trump.\u201d",
      "Japan does have a few things working in its favor, Boling said. It is unlikely to be at the top of Trump\u2019s \u201ctrade target list,\u201d and would do well to remind him that it is the top source of foreign direct investment in the United States.",
      "The U.S. also \u201crecognizes that Japan has really become an indispensable ally in the Indo-Pacific region, and that for Washington to have an effective policy on economic policy or national security policy directed towards China, it really needs Japan on its team,\u201d Boling said.",
      "Still, Trump\u2019s second term could be challenging for Japan, where many see him as a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d in terms of security and the global economy, Jeff Kingston, professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, said in an interview before the U.S. election.",
      "\u201cCertainly, I don\u2019t think Trump would be a welcome partner. They saw how disastrous it was last time around,\u201d Kingston said. \u201cBut Japan will adjust because the security environment is quite risky and they need the American security umbrella.\u201d",
      "Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo, and Jennifer Jett and Peter Guo reported from Hong Kong."

      "\u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d is looming over the domestic box office in its third weekend of release. The third and final installment in Sony\u2019s comic book trilogy has added $16.2 million from 3,905 North American theaters, down 37% from the prior frame and enough to lead over two newcomers, A24\u2019s horror thriller \u201cHeretic\u201d and Lionsgate\u2019s family friendly \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever.\u201d",
      "Although those new releases weren\u2019t able to topple \u201cVenom 3\u201d from No. 1, they opened on the higher end of expectations, thanks to word-of-mouth and the otherwise desolate movie theater landscape. Hollywood mostly avoided the post-election weekend out of concern that people wouldn\u2019t be paying attention to anything other than the presidential race. As a result, overall domestic box office revenues remain down more than 11% from 2023 and nearly 27% from 2019, according to Comscore.",
      "\u201cHeretic,\u201d featuring \u201cNotting Hill\u201d star Hugh Grant playing against type as a villain, notched third place with $11 million from 3,221 venues. The cat-and-mouse thriller follows two young Mormon missionaries (Sophie Thatcher and\u00a0Chloe East) who make the grave mistake of knocking on the door of a reclusive Englishman (Grant). Critics dug the film, which holds a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, and its \u201cC+\u201d grade on CinemaScore isn\u2019t all that surprising for a horror story with a divisive ending.",
      "\u201cThis is a very good opening for an original horror film,\u201d says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. \u201c2024 isn\u2019t the strongest year at the box office, but the horror genre is alive and fully engaging its young audience.\u201d",
      "A very different kind of religious parable, \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever\u201d\u00a0opened at No. 2 with $11.1 million from 3,020 locations. However, this number is skewed because it includes $2.2 million from last week\u2019s one-night-only sneak preview screening. The low-budget, faith-based film about six naughty siblings who take over the local church holiday pageant and learn the true meaning of Christmas has been roundly embraced by critics and audiences. \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever,\u201d directed by Dallas Jenkins (\u201cThe Chosen\u201d) and starring Judy Greer, Pete Holmes and Lauren Graham, received an 89% average on Rotten Tomatoes and \u201cA\u201d grade on CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cTwo-and-a-half weeks before Thanksgiving, the film is getting a jump on the other broad-appeal holiday releases,\u201d Gross says, referring to Amazon\u2019s Christmas comedy \u201cRed One,\u201d with Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson playing Santa\u2019s head of security, on Nov. 15, followed by Paramount\u2019s \u201cGladiator II\u201d and Universal\u2019s \u201cWicked\u201d on Nov. 22, and Disney\u2019s \u201cMoana 2\u201d on Nov. 27. \u201cWith support, [\u2018The Best Christmas Pageant Ever\u2019] has a chance of holding its own heading into strong Thanksgiving competition.\u201d",

      "Elsewhere at the domestic box office, Universal and DreamWorks Animation\u2019s \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d dropped to fourth place with $6.6 million from 3,051 theaters in its seventh weekend on the big screen. The well-reviewed family film has endured at the box office with minimal week-to-week drops (this weekend was down only 11%), earning $130.2 million domestically and $292 million worldwide so far.",
      "Paramount\u2019s pop star parable \u201cSmile 2\u201d rounded out the top five with $5 million from 2,822 locations, declining just 26% from the prior weekend. After four weekends on the big screen, the R-rated sequel to 2022\u2019s thriller \u201cSmile\u201d has generated $60.5 million in North America and $123.6 million worldwide. It cost $28 million and will become profitable, but the original was bigger with $105 million in North America and $217 million globally.",
      "Also of note, \u201cHere,\u201d a fantasy drama that uses AI so Tom Hanks and Robin Wright can play younger (and older) versions of themselves, stumbled to the No. 8 spot with $2.4 million its second weekend of release. Ticket sales declined 52% from its soft $5 million debut, bringing the Robert Zemeckis-directed film to $9.3 million domestically. \u201cHere,\u201d produced and financed by Miramax and distributed by Sony,\u00a0cost $45 million and needs a long life in theaters to justify that price tag.",
      "Meanwhile, the Ralph Fiennes-led thriller \u201cConclave\u201d enjoyed another strong showing with $4.1 million from 2,283 theaters, enough for sixth place on domestic charts.

      "Char Bar, a kosher restaurant in D.C., was vandalized by having two of its windows smashed on Saturday, police say.",
      "No one broke into the establishment. Since the incident, the restaurant\u2019s windows have been boarded up.",
      "\u201cJust the idiocy of people \u2014 that was my first reaction,\u201d said Michael Chelst, the owner of Char Bar. \u201cLike, really? You don\u2019t have anything better to do with your lives than to waste energy and time and people\u2019s money to do what? We\u2019re just a restaurant here.\u201d",
      "Chelst said what was most concerning to him was when the crime happened.",
      "The vandalism comes on the 86th anniversary of Kristallnacht.",
      "Kristallnacht is called the \u201cnight of broken glass\u201d because thousands of Jewish homes, businesses and places of worship were destroyed by German Nazis. Around 90 Jewish people were killed and around 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps.",
      "NBC Washington reached out to D.C. police to see if this is being investigated as a possible hate crime. So far in the investigation, there is no information or evidence that the vandalism was motivated by hate or bias, but that\u2019s something that could potentially change as more information comes to light.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a disappointing thing to hear because it\u2019s pretty clear that it\u2019s a hate crime,\u201d Chelst said. \u201cThere\u2019s seven other places with glass on this street and they didn\u2019t hit any of those.\u201d",
      "Despite the vandalism, customers continued to come to the restaurant, with many saying they decided to dine there as a way to support business.",
      "An online fundraiser was also created to help pay for repairs, which Chelst estimates could cost close to $10,000. He said he\u2019s appreciative of the support.",
      "\u201cWhatever type of hate is out there, we all need to do our part to try and help not let that happen and be supportive of it, and in the meantime, we\u2019re going to go on and we\u2019re going to live our lives and not let people like this change our mission, which is to support our community,\u201d Chelst said."

      "Six years later, \u201cYellowstone\u201d is set to air its final episodes, but without the show's favorite land magnate, John Dutton, played by Kevin Costner. His last appearance on the show was during the first part of Season 5, which\u00a0was released in 2022.",

      "What happens in first episode of Season 5, Part 2 of 'Yellowstone'?",
      "The first episode finds viewers in the middle of major drama as emergency services and caution tape surround John Dutton\u2019s mansion. As Beth Dutton (Kelly Reilly) runs to the house with Kayce Dutton (Luke Grimes) not far behind her, it becomes imminently clear that something is wrong with their father.",
      "As the siblings enter the home, viewers find that Governor Dutton has supposedly died by suicide. Beth immediately accuses Jamie (Wes Bentley) of having killed their father. While this opener is a jarring way to start off the second half of Season 5 \u2014 the episode quickly pivots to another scene.",

      "As the first episode unravels, viewers quickly learn that John Dutton's death was not in fact suicide. Rather, it was a murder-for-hire scheme set forth by Sarah Atwood (Dawn Olivieri) who was in cahoots with Jamie Dutton. Sarah, a lawyer who has been an issue for John in previous episodes, says that she and Jamie agreed on the plan, but Jamie says he wasn't on board.",

      "An Israeli airstrike killed at least 23 people in the village of Aalmat, north of Beirut and far from the areas in southern and eastern Lebanon where the militant Hezbollah group has a major presence. Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry said a further six people were wounded. There was no immediate Israeli comment.",
      "In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people, according to the director of a nearby hospital that received the bodies.",
      "Dr. Fadel Naim, director of the Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, said the dead include nine women, and that the toll was likely to rise as rescue efforts continue.",
      "The Israeli military said it targeted a site where militants were operating in Jabaliya, without providing evidence. It said the details of the strike are under review.",
      "A separate strike on Sunday hit a house in Gaza City, killing Wael al-Khour, a minister in the Hamas-run government, as well as his wife and three children, according to the Civil Defense, a first responders organization that operates under the government.",
      "Israeli forces have encircled and largely isolated Jabaliya and the nearby towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun for the past month, allowing in\u00a0only a trickle of humanitarian aid. Hundreds of people have been killed since the offensive began on Oct. 6, and tens of thousands of people have fled to nearby Gaza City.",
      "On Friday, experts from a panel that monitors food security said\u00a0famine is imminent in the north\u00a0or may already be happening. The growing desperation comes as\u00a0the deadline approaches\u00a0for an ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel to raise the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or\u00a0risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding.",
      "The northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel\u2019s ground invasion and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the 13-month-old war, which was triggered by Hamas\u2019 attack into southern Israel. As in other areas of Gaza, Israel\u00a0has sent forces back in after repeated operations, saying Hamas has regrouped.",
      "The military says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians in homes and shelters. Israeli strikes often kill women and children.",
      "On Sunday, the Israeli military released what it said was video footage of Hamas abusing detainees. The soundless footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, appears to show detainees with hoods over their heads chained up in stress positions. In some of the clips, men beat or poke them with batons.",
      "It was not possible to independently verify the videos, which the military said it had recovered during operations in Gaza.",
      "Rights groups\u00a0have long accused\u00a0the Hamas-run government in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank of abusing detainees and violently quashing dissent.\u00a0Israel has been accused of similar abuses, especially since the start of the war. Israeli prison authorities say they follow relevant laws and investigate any allegations of wrongdoing.",
      "Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel after war broke out in Gaza in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed militant group Hamas.",
      "Israel retaliated, and a series of escalations over several months led to all-out war in September, when Israel carried out a wave of heavy strikes and\u00a0killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as most of his top commanders.",
      "Since then, Israel has struck areas deeper and deeper inside Lebanon, while Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire from northern to central Israel. The fighting has killed over 3,000 people in Lebanon, according to the Health Ministry, and more than 70 people in Israel.",
      "In videos purporting to show the aftermath of Sunday\u2019s strike in Aalmat, some 25 miles north of Beirut, people were seen pulling the body of a little girl out of the rubble. The house had been flattened, and several cars nearby were also damaged.",
      "The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants blew holes in the border fence and stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250.\u00a0Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities who do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count but say over half the fatalities were women and children.",
      "Israeli bombardment and ground invasions\u00a0have left vast areas of Gaza in ruins\u00a0and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people,\u00a0often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people are living in crowded tent camps with few if any public services and no idea of\u00a0when they might return to their homes or rebuild.",
      "Cease-fire talks mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled since the start of the year, as have parallel efforts by the U.S. and others to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "Qatar, which has served as a key mediator with Hamas, said over the weekend that\u00a0it had suspended its efforts\u00a0and would only resume them when \u201cthe parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war and the ongoing suffering of civilians.\u201d"

      "Qatar has halted its mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas, citing a lack of willingness from both sides to engage constructively, according to a diplomatic source briefed on the matter.",
      "Qatar\u2019s participation hinged on both parties demonstrating real interest in resolving the conflict, according to the diplomat. Qatari officials, however, concluded that recent negotiation efforts have been more focused on optics than peace efforts.",
      "The diplomat noted that Qatar may resume its role if both sides reach an impasse and show genuine intent to negotiate.",
      "Under U.S. pressure, Qatari officials had warned Hamas\u2019 political bureau earlier that it was no longer welcome in the country amid frustration over stalled hostage and cease-fire negotiations with Israel, according to a senior U.S. administration official and two diplomats briefed on the matter.",
      "\u201cHamas has been told that if this continues then Qatar cannot continue to host them,\u201d they said.",
      "\u201cQatar has become increasingly frustrated with a lack of progress toward a cease-fire by both Hamas and Israel,\u201d one of the diplomats told NBC News Saturday morning.",
      "Later, a diplomat added that Qatar had informed the Israelis and Hamas that \u201cas long as there is a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith, they cannot continue to mediate. As a consequence, the Hamas political office no longer serves its purpose.\u201d",
      "The officials did not say whether Hamas had been given a deadline, how its diplomats had responded to the warning to leave, or where they would go.",
      "The move is one of multiple indications that the Biden administration is intensifying efforts to achieve a Gaza cease-fire and hostage deal before leaving office.",
      "The U.S. asked Qatar to kick out Hamas about two weeks ago when the group rejected another hostage proposal after Israel killed Hamas\u00a0leader Yahya Sinwar, the senior U.S. administration official told NBC News late Friday.",
      "Qatar agreed and told Hamas\u2019 political leaders about the decision about 10 days ago, the U.S. official said.",
      "\u201cHamas is a terrorist group that has killed Americans and continues to hold American hostages,\u201d the official said. \u201cAfter rejecting repeated proposals to release hostages, its leaders should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner.\u201d",
      "According to one of the diplomats briefed on the matter, once the Qataris had made their decision, they notified Israel and Hamas as well as the U.S. administration.",
      "\u201cAll sides were given no advance warning and were informed after the decision was made,\u201d they said.",
      "A Hamas official contacted for comment did not respond. Israeli officials were not immediately available for comment.",
      "A spokesperson for Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Majed bin Mohammed Al Ansari, said on X that reports about the Hamas office in Doha were \"inaccurate,\" adding that the office's purpose is to be a \"channel of communication between the concerned parties.\" He characterized Qatar's efforts to mediate between the parties as \"currently stalled.\"",
      "Since the start of the war in Gaza, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani has played a key role in mediating talks between Hamas and Israel, alongside Egypt and the U.S.",
      "While housing Hamas representatives in Qatar has long been considered an advantage by negotiators, the country is under growing pressure from the U.S., with the outgoing Biden administration anxious to force Hamas and Israel into a deal before leaving office.",
      "Meanwhile, Qatari leaders face the prospect of a hawkish Trump presidency and more powerful Republican lawmakers with little tolerance for rounds of unsuccessful talks or patience with the kingdom\u2019s role as a go-between for militants.",
      "The U.S. request to oust Hamas came partly because of the death of American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin and it coincided with the unsealing of indictments for Hamas leaders, including Khaled Meshal, who is known to be living in Qatar, according to the U.S. official.",
      "The official said the U.S. is still trying to secure the release of hostages \u2014 and that the administration believes that expelling Hamas from Doha will place more pressure on the organization.",
      "\u201cQatar has played an invaluable role in helping to mediate a hostage deal and was instrumental in securing the release of nearly 200 hostages last year,\u201d the senior U.S. official said. \u201cHowever, following Hamas\u2019 repeated refusal to release even a small number of hostages, including most recently during meetings in Cairo, their continued presence in Doha is no longer viable or acceptable.\u201d",
      "About 250 people were taken hostage during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack, which killed around 1,200. Of those, about 100 remain in captivity, with a third believed to be dead. More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the ensuing war, and Israeli forces have destroyed much of the blockaded enclave.",
      "The two diplomats told NBC News that Hamas was also asked to leave Qatar and relocate to Turkey in April. But after officials there failed to compel Hamas to agree to a hostage deal, that decision was quickly reversed, they said.",
      "\u201cThe Biden Administration and the Israeli government asked Qatar to bring them back to Qatar because they needed to continue the talks and couldn\u2019t do it while in Turkey,\u201d one diplomat said.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who is running to be Senate leader, co-sponsored a bill this year calling on the U.S. to reconsider Qatar\u2019s Major Non-NATO Ally Status.",
      "\u201cQatar has not been a good ally or partner to the United States for years,\u201d Scott said at the time.\u00a0\u201cIts recent behavior dealing with Hamas is telling.\u201d",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have also criticized Qatar for not forcing Hamas into an agreement.",
      "Earlier this year, Qatar defended its role in negotiations, with its embassy in Washington issuing a statement saying that Doha\u2019s capacity as mediator \u201cexists only because we were asked by the United States in 2012 to play this role.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlaming and threatening the mediator is not constructive, especially when the target is a friend and a Major Non-NATO Ally that presently hosts 10,000 U.S. troops and America\u2019s largest military presence in the Middle East,\u201d it added.",
      "Qatar has housed Hamas\u2019 political bureau for over 20 years, and before the war, provided the group with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual assistance, with the knowledge and cooperation of the Israeli government, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank.",
      "Hamas\u2019 leadership is divided between a military wing, based in Gaza, and the political bureau, whose top officials have been based in Qatar. That included Ismail Haniyeh, who led Hamas\u2019 political bureau from 2017 to July 2024, when he was killed while on a diplomatic visit to Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, in an assassination believed to have been carried out by Israel.Where Hamas would relocate is not clear, but Iran might be one option.",
      "Hamas met with Iran\u2019s president in Doha last month. The \u201cZionist entity today in Gaza and Lebanon pierce the heart of every human being,\u201d President Masoud Pezeshkian said at the time. \u201cThis pain is even greater for those of us who consider the oppressed Palestinian people as our brothers in faith.\u201d"

      "While Biden's policies and weapons provisions have consistently supported Israel, his relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has at times been strained, including by some efforts to restrain Israel or nudge the country toward compliance with international law.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has staunchly supported Israel's \u201cright to win its war on terror,\u201d and Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have greeted his election with enthusiasm.

      "It also said that 713 aid trucks were brought into northern Gaza since the beginning of October.",

      "Pompeii's victims were later immortalized by archaeologists who used plaster to fill the voids left by their bodies and observers have long created stories based on these casts, one of which was long assumed to be a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they died.",

      "Amnesty and the SRA said they had evaluated the human rights strategies proposed by the bidding countries and concluded in a new report that neither bid adequately outlined how they would meet the human rights standards required by FIFA.",
      "They said the risks were far greater in Saudi Arabia and hosting the tournament in the Gulf country would lead to \u201csevere and widespread\u201d human rights violations.",
      "\u201cThere will be a real and predictable human cost to awarding the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia without obtaining credible guarantees of reform,\u201d Steve Cockburn, Amnesty\u2019s head of labour rights and sport, said in a statement.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump has tapped House Republican Conference chair and longtime ally Rep. Elise Stefanik, of New York, to serve as ambassador to the United Nations, a Trump transition official confirmed to NBC News on Monday.",
      "Stefanik is Trump's first Cabinet pick for his second term in the White House.",
      "\u201cI am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,\u201d\u00a0Trump said in a statement.",
      "The news was first reported by CNN. NBC News has reached out to Stefanik's office for comment.",
      "Stefanik, 40, has been a staunch defender of Israel in its response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks and has been outspoken over the last year about antisemitism on college campuses. A day before last week's election, Stefanik reiterated her call for the defunding of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency\u00a0for Palestine Refugees in the Near East because she alleges it has been infiltrated by Hamas.",

Stefanik has served in the House since 2015 and represents New York's 21st Congressional District, which covers upstate New York, bordering Vermont and Canada.",
      "Any appointments by Trump that lead to vacancies in the House could prove problematic for House Republicans. While they could maintain control of the lower chamber, an election outcome that NBC News has not yet called, their margin will be slim, and they struggled throughout the last Congress to maintain effective control of the body with few votes to spare."

    "summary": "Lawmakers in Japan voted Monday to retain Shigeru Ishiba as prime minister despite his long-governing party\u2019s poor showing in parliamentary elections last month.",
    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 Lawmakers in Japan voted Monday to retain the embattled Shigeru Ishiba as prime minister despite his long-governing party\u2019s dismal showing in parliamentary elections last month.",
      "Ishiba, 67, became prime minister of the key U.S. ally on Oct. 1 shortly after winning the leadership race for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II. But his future in the role was in question after the party suffered its worst election defeat in more than a decade, losing support from voters angry about corruption scandals and the rising cost of living.",
      "That left the LDP without a parliamentary majority, but Ishiba was nonetheless able to retain his hold on power and will rule with a minority government. He must now face the challenges of a weakened and unpopular governing party as well as a possible shift in approach from Washington after the victory of President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Ishiba, a straight-talking former defense minister, received 221 votes compared with 160 for Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party. Other candidates received a total of 84 votes.",
      "Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, \u201cis faced with the most severe and complicated security environment in the postwar era,\u201d Ishiba said Saturday at an annual troop review at a Japanese military base outside Tokyo, vowing to strengthen the country\u2019s diplomatic efforts as well as its defense capabilities.",
      "He cited violations of Japanese airspace in August and September by China and Russia, as well as a Chinese aircraft carrier entering Japan\u2019s contiguous waters for the first time in September. Japan and other countries around the world are also concerned by accelerated weapons testing in nuclear-armed North Korea, which this year signed a mutual defense pact with Russia.",
      "The U.S.-Japan alliance is the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of Japan\u2019s diplomacy and security, said Ishiba, who said he and Trump had pledged to \u201cwork together to take the Japan-U.S. alliance to new heights\u201d in a phone call after Trump\u2019s election victory last week.",
      "Japan has a lot to worry about from a second Trump presidency, Koichi Nakano, a visiting scholar at Harvard\u2019s Weatherhead Program on U.S.-Japan Relations, told NBC News in an interview before the U.S. election last week.",
      "Many Japanese officials assume Trump is going to be \u201cmore straightforwardly anti-China,\u201d and that Japan will be \u201csomehow miraculously left off the hook,\u201d he said. But they are \u201cmisreading\u201d the U.S. president-elect, he said, despite his famous friendship with the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.",
      "Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs should be taken \u201cvery seriously,\u201d Nakano said, considering Japan\u2019s widening trade surplus with the U.S., its top export destination. They could have \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences for a country already wrestling with rising costs and a \u201cvery low\u201d currency, he said.",
      "Japan can also expect pressure from the Trump administration to spend more on defense, David Boling, director of Japan and Asian trade at the New York-based consulting firm Eurasia Group, said in a briefing after the U.S. election last week.",
      "Though Japan has already pledged to double\u00a0defense spending\u00a0to\u00a02% of gross domestic product by\u00a02027, \u201cthat\u2019s probably not going to be enough to satisfy Trump,\u201d Boling said.",
      "There is also strong U.S. opposition to Japanese company Nippon Steel\u2019s $14.9 billion bid to acquire Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. President Joe Biden, Trump and his Democratic rival in the U.S. presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris, had all come out against the deal.",
      "\u201cIt looks pretty dead,\u201d Boling said. The only way to revive it, he said, is for Nippon Steel to reach an agreement with United Steelworkers, a Pittsburgh-based union that has vocally opposed the takeover.",
      "Takahiro Mori, vice chairman of Nippon Steel, told reporters last week that the company hoped to close the deal by the end of the year, before Trump takes office.",
      "Much will come down to interpersonal relations. While Abe was \u201cextraordinarily skillful\u201d in dealing with Trump, Ishiba has a different personality, Boling said.",
      "Ishiba \u201cis more of a deep thinker type,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s known to be something of a defense intellectual, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to work that well with Trump.\u201d",
      "Japan does have a few things working in its favor, Boling said. It is unlikely to be at the top of Trump\u2019s \u201ctrade target list,\u201d and would do well to remind him that it is the top source of foreign direct investment in the United States.",
      "The U.S. also \u201crecognizes that Japan has really become an indispensable ally in the Indo-Pacific region, and that for Washington to have an effective policy on economic policy or national security policy directed towards China, it really needs Japan on its team,\u201d Boling said.",
      "Still, Trump\u2019s second term could be challenging for Japan, where many see him as a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d in terms of security and the global economy, Jeff Kingston, professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, said in an interview before the U.S. election.",
      "\u201cCertainly, I don\u2019t think Trump would be a welcome partner. They saw how disastrous it was last time around,\u201d Kingston said. \u201cBut Japan will adjust because the security environment is quite risky and they need the American security umbrella.\u201d",

      "For decades, successive Australian governments forcibly removed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families as part of an assimilation policy.",

      "\u201cThis trivialization\u00a0is both culturally insensitive and harmful,\" it said. The book also contained errors made by mixing different Indigenous languages, which NATSIEC said reinforced the \"harmful stereotype that Indigenous peoples are a homogenous group.\"",

While the Houthis did not claim the attack, at least one Houthi official praised it as being \u201cthe beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. warplanes carried out new strikes targeting Houthi positions that lasted into early Sunday morning, the American military said. The strikes come after\u00a0the militants likely shot down yet-another American reconnaissance drone\u00a0over the country.",
      "The attack on the Saudi troops took place Friday night in Seiyun, a city some 310 miles east of Sanaa. As troops worked out at a Saudi-led base there, the soldier opened fire, killing an officer and a noncommissioned officer, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said, citing a military statement.",
      "\u201cThe Joint Forces Command underscores that this \u2018Lone Wolf\u2019 cowardly attack does not represent the honorable members of the Yemeni Ministry of Defense,\u201d the statement added. The dead and the other wounded Saudi solider have been brought back to the kingdom, it added.",
      "Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the leader of Yemen\u2019s successionist Southern Transitional Council, identified the soldier who carried out the attack as belonging to the First Military Region, which is based out of Seiyun.",
      "Police in the area published pictures of the soldier, saying there was a 30-million-Yemeni-rial reward for information leading to the soldier\u2019s arrest. That\u2019s worth around $15,000 on the black market.",
      "Authorities offered no motive for the attack. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the militant group\u2019s Yemen branch, long has operated around Hadramawt. However, the group did not immediately claim the attack. A recent United Nations expert report has said that the al-Qaida group and the Houthis have begun to \u201ccoordinate operations directly with each other.\u201d",
      "The Houthis meanwhile did not claim the attack either. However, Houthi official Hamid Rizq praised the attack in a message on the social platform X, claiming it came from \u201cthe feeling of oppression\u201d over Saudi troops being stationed in the area.",
      "\u201cThe heroic operation is the beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders,\u201d Rizq wrote.",
      "Yemen has been mired in a decadelong war since the Houthis swept into Sanaa from their northern strongholds in September 2014. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war on behalf of Yemen\u2019s exiled government in 2015. The war further internationalized, with Iran backing the Houthis with weapons and support that cemented the conflict into a yearslong stalemate.",
      "The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.\u00a0A cease-fire that expired in October 2022 largely has held in the time since, however, even as the Houthis have seized on\u00a0the Israel-Hamas war\u00a0in the Gaza Strip and Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon.",
      "On Saturday night, Houthi-run media reported U.S. airstrikes targeting areas around Sanaa. The airstrikes continued into Sunday morning and also included sites in Amran province just outside of the capital, the Houthis said. The rebels offered no immediate damage assessment from the strikes.",
      "The U.S. military later told The Associated Press on Sunday it conducted airstrikes \u201con numerous Iran-backed Houthi weapons storage facilities within Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.\u201d It described the sites as housing advanced conventional weapons used to target military and civilian ships in the Red Sea corridor, but offered no other immediate details.",
      "The U.S. military has targeted radar stations,\u00a0military bases\u00a0and drone and missile launch sites since beginning its ongoing airstrike campaign against the Houthis in January.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s state TV on Sunday reported that chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, met his Saudi counterpart, Gen. Fayyad bin Hamid Al-Ruwaili, in Tehran \u2014 the latest sign of warming ties between the two regional rivals.",
      "It reported that Al-Ruwaili arrived in Tehran earlier in the day, leading a high-ranking delegation of Saudi Arabian military officials, and that the development of defense diplomacy and expansion of bilateral cooperation were key topics of discussion during the meeting.",
      "Iran and Saudi Arabia resumed full diplomatic relations in 2023 after seven years, facilitated by China\u2019s mediation."

      "LONDON \u2014 King Charles III led Remembrance Day commemorations in London on Sunday as the\u00a0United Kingdom remembered British and Commonwealth servicemen and women who have lost their lives to conflict.",
      "After a two-minute silence observed across the nation at 11 a.m. local time, the king\u00a0laid the first wreath at the foot of the capital\u2019s Cenotaph war memorial. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and conservative opposition leader Kemi Badenoch also laid wreaths.",
      "Charles was joined by Prince William and Princess Kate, who has slowly returned to public duties this year following treatment for cancer. She watched from the balcony of the U.K.\u2019s foreign office.",
      "Queen Camilla missed the occasion after falling ill with a chest infection that forced her to withdraw from public duties this week.",
      "The wreaths were adorned by poppies, a symbol of remembrance also worn on lapels by many across the U.K. in the lead-up to Remembrance Day.",
      "Poppies were a common sight on the battle-scarred lands of Europe during World War I. The lime in the rubble left behind after artillery bombardments helped fertilize the plants, which flourished across Belgium and northern France during the war, then largely disappeared once the lime was gone.",
      "Lt. Col.\u00a0John McCrae, a Canadian who served as a brigade surgeon in the war, made the poppy a famous symbol of the conflict with his poem \u201cIn Flanders Field,\u201d where he channeled the voice of fallen soldiers buried beneath the poppies.",
      "Remembrance Day was originally intended to commemorate the victims of World War I, when some 9.7 million military personnel from more than two dozen countries lost their lives, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, as well as 6.8 million civilians, who died from causes like starvation and genocide.",
      "Princess Kate\u00a0was\u00a0also in attendance at Saturday\u00a0evening\u2019s Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall, her first major public appearance\u00a0since finishing chemotherapy.",
      "She watched a commemorative concert from the royal box alongside William and other members of the royal family, as singer Tom Jones performed for the crowd alongside the Royal Air Force band.",
      "Both events form part of the United Kingdom\u2019s Remembrance Day commemorations as the nation pays tribute to those whose lives were affected by World War I and remembers those who died.",
      "Services will be held in almost every town and city across the U.K.",
      "Charles, who has also received treatment for cancer this year, received a standing ovation from the audience when he arrived at the\u00a0Royal Albert Hall.",
      "Prince William said the past year has been \u201cbrutal\u201d as his wife and father announced their diagnoses with cancer at the beginning of the year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been dreadful. It\u2019s probably been the hardest year in my life,\u201d William told NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News in Cape Town, South Africa, last week."
