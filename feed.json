      "Lidia Bastianich is highlighting community togetherness in her 14th TV special",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lidia Bastianich grew up in a small town in Italy where neighbors were like extended family. If kids came home from school and mom was out, they went to the neighbors for a snack. If someone had a problem with a sibling, they went next door.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning TV host, author and restaurateur remembers her grandmother making an extra pot for lunch and sending young Lidia next door with it to feed her blind, elderly neighbor, along with a glass of wine.",
      "That sense of community is not specific to Italy, of course. \u201cIt exists in America in smaller situations, but we need to nurture that ever more,\u201d Bastianich says.",
      "She's hoping to spotlight and cultivate togetherness with her 14th TV special, \u201cLidia Celebrates America: A Nation of Neighbors,\u201d which premieres Nov. 25 on PBS and streams on PBS.org.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my way of really thanking America. I think that there\u2019s no better place in the whole world than the United States of America and somehow it\u2019s been maligned,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I know is that out there, in the midst of America, there\u2019s a lot of good American people.\u201d",
      "Bastianich travels to wildfire-scarred neighborhoods outside Los Angeles, a pay-how-you-can caf\u00e9 in Denver, a Japanese-American community center in Portland, Oregon, and a first-of-its-kind free grocery market in San Francisco. At every stop, there are hands reaching out to help.",
      "\u201cThat connection makes you feel good, it makes you feel more of a human being. And it gives you back that kind of desire to live on positively,\u201d she says.",
      "The hourlong special starts in Altadena, California, hurting from the recent wildfires. Bastianich joins volunteers making 175 five-course meals that are delivered to victims. One of the volunteers is someone himself living out of his car because the flames had made him homeless.",
      "\u201cI got the shivers. I just needed to hug him,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI know that he needed that. I know he was in his car by himself, and yet he found it within him to give. That takes fortitude. It takes character.\"",
      "She also meets self-taught cook Kiki Ruff in Porter County, Indiana. Ruff hosts a viral TikTok series that helps families struggling with food insecurity stretch their groceries, using recipes from the Depression, recessions and wartime.",
      "In Denver, Bastianich visits a restaurant \u2014 SAME, which stands for So All May Eat \u2014 where guests can offer money, produce or volunteer their time in exchange for a meal.",

      "\u201cYou could pay for dinner or lunch and that goes to subsidizing the whole thing. But if you have a garden and you grow certain things and have excess, you can bring in vegetables or fruit and you get a meal,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cOr you can work, you can go behind and begin to pack vegetables or whatever. But it doesn\u2019t only get you a meal. It gets you interacting with other people and giving.\u201d",
      "Another spot she visits is a Portland community hub for Japanese-American elders that offers meals, tai chi, and connection for seniors and families.",
      "Bastianich, whose latest book is \u201cLidia\u2019s The Art of Pasta: An Italian Cookbook,\u201d with her daughter, Tanya Bastianich-Manuali, has herself benefited from community aid. She was born in 1947 in Istria, an Italian territory ceded to Yugoslavia after World War II. She spent the first years of her life under communist rule, then fled with her family across the border to Italy. There, they lived in a refugee camp for two years until an aid organization helped bring them to New York in 1958.",
      "Bastianich's last stop is in San Francisco, home of the nation\u2019s first legislatively supported free grocery market, which serves thousands of residents. Shoppers there find shelves full and are free to pick what they want.",
      "\u201cIt was not like just a handout or a box of food. These people came in and they felt good,\u201d Bastianich says. \u201cThey had integrity in going in and choosing what they\u2019re going to eat, not just accepting what was given to them.\u201d",
      "What Bastianich found on her travels is that small gestures of kindness to someone in your community can do wonders not just for them \u2014 but also for you.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give big checks or anything. Do something for your neighbor,\u201d she says. \u201cThat connection makes you feel good. It makes you feel more of a human being. And it sort of gives you back that desire to live on positively.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "George Clooney stars in \"Jay Kelly,\" a film by Noah Baumbach that blurs reality and fiction, says Associated Press critic Mark Kennedy",
      "During his glittering career, George Clooney has played a casino thief, a Batman,a chain-gang convict, an assassin and a high-flying layoff artist. This fall, he's stretching even more, playing an utterly charming and gorgeous movie star. Kidding!",
      "Reality and fiction beautifully weave in and out in \u201cJay Kelly,\u201d director Noah Baumbach's love letter to Hollywood that, in other hands, could so easily have become just a love letter to Clooney.",
      "The script by Baumbach and Emily Mortimer finds Clooney \u2014 sorry, Jay Kelly \u2014 in a sort of midlife funk. He's 60, a universally beloved, deeply earnest movie hunk who has worked his way to the top and found, well, artifice.",
      "\u201cMy life doesn't really feel real,\u201d he says at one point, an actor trained in pretending going meta playing an actor trained in pretending. In another scene he muses: \u201cAll my memories are movies.\u201d",
      "A chance meeting with an old acting partner \u2014 a brilliant Billy Crudup, whose character was betrayed by Kelly years ago \u2014 reveals some unpleasant truths. \u201cIs there a person in there? Maybe you don\u2019t actually exist,\u201d he asks the star, sending Kelly on a journey of self-discovery that just so happens to lead to one of Clooney's favorite places, Italy.",
      "Kelly's careful facade \u2014 the stories he tells about himself \u2014 soon gets chipped away. On his way up the hills of Hollywood, he apparently left some personal carnage behind. \u201cJay Kelly\u201d is about those who sacrificed to get him there.",
      "Adam Sandler and Laura Dern play Kelly's long-suffering manager and publicist, respectively, while his resentful adult daughters are portrayed by Grace Edwards and Riley Keough. Kelly, we learn, put career first and that meant walking away from things like his daughters' school recitals and making his staff miss things like their daughters\u2019 school recitals. \u201cHe's not our family or our friend,\u201d Dern's character screams in despair. \u201cWe're not to him what he is to us.\u201d",
      "You'd expect Clooney to not have to shift out of second gear for this, but he gives a soulful performance, charming enough that his Kelly seduces a trainful of strangers in Italy with his aw-shucks charisma and yet also bristles when his oldest daughter makes him confront her abandonment issues.",
      "\u201cDo you know how I knew you didn't want to spend time with me?\u201d his daughter asks him, before answering in a line that will land like a gut punch with any parent: \u201cBecause you didn't spend time with me.\u201d Another killer: \u201cI wish you were the man I thought you were.\u201d",

There are jokes made about the Method school of acting and being a Dior ambassador, but this is ultimately about mortality and life choices, with one scene actually ending in a cemetery, a little too on the nose.",
      "Kelly melts into past vignettes like watching his own long-ago breakout drama audition and his kids' joyous household revelry. It reaches for the surreal in a mist-filled forest and finds redemption in, of course, a movie theater. A retrospective montage uses such real Clooney roles like \u201cCombat Academy\u201d and \u201cUp in the Air,\u201d further blurring the line between fact and fiction.",

There emerges an off-putting, in-his-own-world Jay Gatsby vibe to him, alluded to by his first name and the name of one of his daughters, Daisy.",
      "We see his cluelessness up close when he won't actually listen to his assistants or thoughtlessly tosses away a gift of a neckerchief from a dead colleague's son. He reveals his vanity when he tries to hide his age with a black Sharpie on his eyebrows.",

      "The petition for habeas corpus filed with California's 2nd District Court of Appeal argues that lawyer Philip Cohen did not represent Masterson properly at the 2023 retrial that ended with the actor being convicted of raping two women at his Los Angeles home in 2003. He was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.",
      "The petition also argues that the trial judge demonstrated a bias against the Church of Scientology, allowing an \u201cunconstitutional intrusion\u201d into the church's doctrine and a misinterpretation of its scripture.",
      "Masterson is a member of the church, whose practices were a major issue at his trial, and the women are former members.",
      "The petition says that Cohen spoke to only two of the 20 potential witnesses brought to his attention by his co-counsel and an investigator. It says the witnesses included some who would have testified that the women spoke favorably of the sexual relationships they had with Masterson. And they included psychological and pharmacological experts who would have testified about the effects of alcohol and drugs on memory.",
      "The court filing says there was \u201cunexpected and unreasonable failure of trial counsel to present any of the mountain of exculpatory evidence\u201d that had been amassed by Masterson's pretrial attorney Shawn Holley, and the result was a violation of his constitutional rights.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charlaine F. Olmedo declined to delay Masterson\u2019s first trial to accommodate Holley\u2019s representation of former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer against his own allegations of sexual misconduct. Cohen then took over as lead attorney.",
      "Masterson's first trial ended in a mistrial with a jury unable to reach consensus on any of three rape counts against him. He was promptly retried, and a jury found him guilty of two counts while failing to reach a verdict on the third.",

      "The Metropolitan Museum of Art has announced its next spring fashion exhibit",
      "NEW YORK -- If there's been one uniting theme of all the blockbuster fashion exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it\u2019s the simple idea that fashion is art.",
      "\u201cCostume Art,\u201d announced Monday as the next big show at the museum\u2019s Costume Institute \u2014 launched by the starry Met Gala in 2026 \u2014 aims to make that connection more literal than ever, pairing garments with objects from across the museum to show how fashion has long been intertwined with different art forms.",
      "Max Hollein, CEO and director of the Met, said in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement that he hopes the exhibit will take visitors to the New York museum on a (very fashionable) journey through art history, where they will see connections throughout.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a show that can really live in fascinating ways at the museum and can pull from all different areas of our collection \u2014 paintings, sculpture, drawings,\u201d Hollein said.",
      "\u201cI hope we all agree that fashion is art,\u201d Hollein added. \u201cBut actually I think the exhibition \u2026 will make it obvious how fashion is actually happening, so to say, all across the museum and in all different mediums already.\u201d",
      "The new show will examine the dressed body, and will be organized thematically by different body types, according to the Costume Institute's curator in charge, Andrew Bolton. It will include the \u201cNaked Body\u201d and the \u201cClassical Body,\u201d for example, but also less expected themes like the \u201cPregnant Body\u201d and the \u201cAging Body.\u201d",
      "The connections that will be drawn between artworks and garments will range, curators said in a statement, \u201cfrom the formal to the conceptual, the aesthetic to the political, the individual to the universal, the illustrative to the symbolic, and the playful to the profound.\u201d",
      "One example: in the \u201cNaked Body\u201d section, a 1504 print from German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer will be paired with spandex bodysuits by Belgian designer Walter Van Beirendonck from a 2009 collection that revisits the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Tom Cruise, at 63 still the biggest movie star in a room full of them, finally got to hold his own Oscar on a Hollywood stage on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cMaking movies is not what I do, it's who I am,\u201d said Cruise. He was composed as always, but at moments seemed near tears as he spoke, grasping the gold honorary statuette that celebrated his more than 40 years at the apex of the industry at the film academy's annual Governors Awards.",
      "\u201cIn that theater we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together,\u201d he said after a two-minute ovation.",
      "Production designer Wynn Thomas and choreographer and actor Debbie Allen were also selected by the academy's board of governors to be honored for their storied careers, and an absent Dolly Parton was honored for a lifetime of philanthropy at the ceremony at the Ray Dolby Ballroom in Los Angeles.",
      "A competitive Oscar has eluded Cruise, who's been nominated four times: as an actor for 1989\u2019s \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d 1996\u2019s \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia,\u201d and as a producer for 2022\u2019s \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d",

      "It was fitting that the Governors Awards aren't televised. Tom Cruise doesn't do TV, and he's been among the biggest champions of the theatergoing experience over streaming.",
      "\u201cI will always do everything I can to help this art form,\u201d Cruise said. \u201cTo support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful. Hopefully without too many more broken bones.\u201d",
      "Oscar-winning director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu presented Cruise the award. The two have spent several months shooting a film in London set for release in 2026. The collaboration suggests that Cruise, who has stuck to blockbuster franchise fare in recent years, might not be done trying to win an Academy Award the old-fashioned way.",
      "\u201cThis may be his first Oscar,\u201d I\u00f1\u00e1rritu said, \u201cbut from what I have seen and experienced, this will not be the last.\u201d",

      "His record label said Saturday in a statement posted to his social media accounts that Snider died Friday.",

Someone who could almost always find the humor in this crazy ride on Planet Earth.\u201d",
      "Snider's family and friends had said in a Friday statement that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia at a hospital in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and that his situation had since grown more complicated and he was transferred elsewhere. The diagnosis came on the heels of the cancellation of a tour after Snider had been the victim of a violent assault in the Salt Lake City area, according to a Nov. 3 statement from his management team.",

      "The scrapped tour was in support of his most recent album, \u201cHigh, Lonesome and Then Some,\u201d which released in October. Snider combined elements of folk, rock and country in a three-decade career. In reviews of his recent albums, The Associated Press called him a \u201csinger-songwriter with the persona of a fried folkie\u201d and a \u201cstoner troubadour and cosmic comic.\u201d",
      "He modeled himself on \u2014 and at times met and was mentored by \u2014 artists like Kris Kristofferson, Guy Clark and John Prine.

      "WASHINGTON -- The White House Historical Association has reclaimed a series of sketches by American painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell, spending a whopping $7.25 million at auction on Friday.",
      "The four 1940s-era sketches titled \u201cSo You Want to See the President!\u201d were displayed in the West Wing for years, but were removed in 2022 after a family dispute over who owned them.",
      "The sketches show a variety of people \u2014 journalists, military officers and even a Miss America Pageant winner and her publicist \u2014 seated on plush-looking red chairs as they waited to meet President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They were put up for sale by a grandson of the White House official who had received them as a gift from Rockwell.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how personally thrilled I am that the White House Historical Association preserved this piece of White House history,\u201d said Anita McBride, who sits on the association\u2019s board of directors.",
      "The White House Historical Association's winning bid was $5.8 million. It's total cost to reclaim the art, including the buyer's premium paid to the auction house, was $7.25 million.",
      "The price tag is by far the most ever paid by the association, which holds a vast collection of art, furniture and other items as part of its mission to help the White House collect and display artifacts that represent American history and culture.",
      "Before Friday, the most the association had paid for an artifact was $1.5 million for \u201cThe Builders,\u201d by African American artist Jacob Lawrence, in 2007, McBride said. That work depicts hard-working men in orange, red and brown tones, and hangs in the White House Green Room.",
      "The sketches sold Friday are Rockwell\u2019s only known collection of four interrelated paintings that he conceived to tell a story, according to Heritage Auctions, the Dallas-based auction house that sold them. The series was created in 1943 and published in the Saturday Evening Post.",

      "\u201cPalm Royale\u201d made a splash in its first season with a starry cast, high production values, and its ubiquitous grasshopper cocktail",
      "NEW YORK -- When Kristen Wiig steps out of a vintage Rolls-Royce in the opening scene of Season 2 of \u201cPalm Royale,\u201d she\u2019s sporting a tall, yellow, fringed hat, gold platform sandals and sunny bell bottoms, with fabric petals that sway with every determined step. It\u2019s the first clue that the costumes on the female-driven comedy are taking center stage.",
      "The Apple TV show made a splash in its first season with the starry cast, high production values and ubiquitous grasshopper cocktail. Wiig\u2019s character, Maxine, tries to break into Palm Beach high society in 1969 and bumps heads with co-stars Carol Burnett, Allison Janney, Leslie Bibb and Laura Dern. But also playing a starring role are the vintage designer frocks that reflect each character.",
      "For Season 2, which premiered this week, Emmy-winning costume designer Alix Friedberg says she and her team coordinated \u201cthousands\u201d of looks that reflect the characters\u2019 jet-setting style. She says 50-60% of the brightly colored and graphic print costumes are original vintage designer pieces, sourced by shoppers and costume designers.",
      "\u201cThe looks are so iconic. Sometimes Kristen will walk in in something, and it brings tears to my eyes,\u201d Kaia Gerber \u2014 who plays Mitzi \u2014 told The Associated Press in a recent interview.",
      "If not original vintage, Friedberg\u2019s team builds the costumes, and if a character has to wear an outfit in multiple scenes or in big dance numbers, the team may create duplicates to preserve continuity. Friedberg says she was lucky to find so many vendors with vintage designer pieces in great condition.",
      "\u201c(Bibb\u2019s character) Dinah wears a few original Oscar de la Renta pieces that are really so perfect. Bill Blass was a big one, Oleg Cassini,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThere\u2019s a dress that (Janney\u2019s character) Evelyn wears that's this all emerald green jersey, it\u2019s an original Halston and it\u2019s so stunning on her and it really does sort of evoke what\u2019s to come in the '70s.\u201d",
      "Janney calls Friedberg \u201cbrilliant\u201d and marveled at her talent at finding pieces that are like works of art. Some of her favorites were the characters\u2019 apr\u00e8s-ski looks in the Swiss Alps \u2014 but she finds it hard to pick an ultimate favorite.",
      "\u201cAll of them just make me feel divine. And the hair is just a masterpiece, and the makeup \u2014 it all goes together to just create Evelyn and I barely have to do anything,\u201d Janney says.",
      "The costumes also help heighten the comedy. Friedberg says Evelyn\u2019s stoic and deadpan character elicits laughs with some of her over-the-top getups.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s delivering this dialogue, these lines with, like, seven wigs on top of her,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThe absurdity comes out really in how these women present themselves time and time again. \u2026 It was just so much fun to get to laugh and wink at the audience.\u201d",
      "Burnett called costume fittings on the show \u201cgreat fun\u201d and said they helped her find her character, the scheming Norma. \u201cI work from the outside in. I have to know what I\u2019m going to look like,\u201d she says.",

      "The costumes also help set the tone for the female empowerment theme that permeates this season. \u201cEvelyn wore a lot more pants \u2014 which seems ridiculous to say today \u2014 but back then that was a real power move,\u201d Friedberg says.",

      "The costumes may be eye candy, but Friedberg says each look also carries deeper meaning.",
      "\u201cMaxine wears this dress that was an original Oscar de la Renta dress,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cIt\u2019s very much something that Norma would wear, and it is saying to the audience without saying to the audience that she\u2019s arrived, it\u2019s her time, it\u2019s time for her to rule.\u201d",

      "Since it was established more than a century ago, Britain's public broadcaster has been no stranger to controversy.

      "Pressure on the broadcaster has been growing since the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper published parts of a dossier compiled by the BBC's adviser on standards and guidelines on Nov. 3.",
      "As well as criticizing the BBC\u2019s coverage of transgender issues and raising concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service, the dossier said that an edition of the BBC\u2019s flagship current affairs series \u201cPanorama\" \u2014 titled \u201cTrump: A Second Chance?\u201d \u2014 broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election was misleading.",
      "Specifically, it showed how the third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the Jan. 6, 2021 speech into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "By doing so, it made it look like Trump was giving the green light to his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.",
      "The outcry from opponents of the BBC \u2014 and there are many both in the U.K. and abroad \u2014 was immediate and vociferous.",
      "The broadcaster, which is funded by an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all U.K. households who watch live TV or any BBC content, was accused of bias against Trump, symptomatic of they say an inherent liberal bias within the organization.",
      "For days, the BBC said very little, saying it did not report to leaked reports. Many thought that was a misjudgement as it allowed the narrative around the edit to be led by its opponents.",

      "It was also revealed that Trump was demanding a retraction, apology and compensation over the sequence. \u201cI guess I have to,\u201d Trump said when asked about whether he would go through with his legal threat. \u201cBecause I think they defrauded the public and they\u2019ve admitted it.\u201d",

Roosevelt. They were put up for sale by a grandson of the White House official who received them as a gift from Rockwell after a court battle over their ownership was settled.",
      "The sketches are set to be sold by a Dallas-based auction house Friday. In keeping with its mission to help the White House collect and display artifacts that represent American history and culture, including the history of the White House, the association hopes to prevail.

      "\u201cThey\u2019re so different from any of the other art that was exhibited in the West Wing,\u201d said Anita McBride, who sits on the association's board of directors.",
      "McBride remembers seeing the drawings in 1981 when she went to work in Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration. They were a \u201cfocal point\u201d when staffers took visitors on tours, she said. \u201cPeople just loved seeing\u201d the \u201cwide array and depiction of Americans that have access to their president.\u201d",
      "The series, created in 1943 and published in the Saturday Evening Post during World War II, \u201coffers an intimate and deeply human portrayal of American democracy in action,\u201d according to a description on the Heritage Auctions website.",
      "The sketches show a variety of people \u2014 journalists, military officers and even a Miss America Pageant winner and her publicist \u2014 waiting on plush-looking red chairs in the West Wing lobby as they waited to meet Roosevelt. A Secret Service agent stands watch in one of the scenes.",

      "The sketches are Rockwell\u2019s only known collection of four interrelated paintings that he conceived to tell a story, the auction house said.",
      "Rockwell gave the original drawings to Stephen Early, who was Roosevelt's longtime press secretary, seen in a drawing smoking a pipe as reporters huddle around him. A family member turned them over to the White House in 1978, and they were on display throughout the West Wing for more than four decades, sometimes in a hallway between the press offices that are mere steps from the Oval Office.",

That work depicts hard-working men in orange, red and brown tones, and hangs in the White House Green Room.",

      "Sofia Coppola has been honored at the Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit in New York for her filmmaking achievements",
      "NEW YORK -- When Sofia Coppola was 20 years old and figuring out who she wanted to be in the world, Angelica Huston offered some advice: \u201cNot everyone\u2019s going to love you. Don\u2019t waste your time on the people who don\u2019t,\u201d Coppola recalled Wednesday night in New York at the Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit, where she was being honored for her films.",
      "Coppola was surrounded by family, friends and collaborators like Bill Murray, Josh Hartnett and Elle Fanning for the Chanel-presented event, which helps raise funds for the museum\u2019s film collection and preservation efforts.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s not just the daughter of a great filmmaker,\u201d Murray said. \u201cShe\u2019s a great filmmaker.\u201d",
      "But it's a distinction that was hard earned. Just over 27 years after her father Francis Ford Coppola encouraged her to make her first short film, Coppola reflected on starting a filmmaking career at a time when she was thought of as \u201ca nepo baby before they were charming\u201d and \u201cthe amateur actress who had single-handedly ruined \u2018The Godfather\u2019 films.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost people didn\u2019t think I had something to say that mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I found a few who did.\u201d",
      "Since making her feature debut with \u201cThe Virgin Suicides,\u201d Coppola has written and directed seven narrative features and one documentary, about Marc Jacobs, that A24 plans to release next year. She's been both celebrated, winning an Oscar for writing \u201cLost in Translation,\u201d which also earned her a best director nomination, and dismissed. \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d was infamously booed at Cannes, but over the next 20 years would become beloved and celebrated.",
      "Fanning remembered meticulously planning her outfit to meet Coppola for the first time at age 11, where she would go on to be cast as the daughter of a famous movie star in \u201cSomewhere.\u201d A few years prior she had convinced her grandmother to take her to see \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d and she immediately became a fan.",
      "\u201cLiving in that cinema, in Sofia\u2019s world for a few hours, it would change my girlhood forever,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cIt was the place that I felt safe and seen, and I wanted to live in it a hundred times over.\u201d",
      "On \u201cSomewhere,\u201d Coppola made Fanning feel like an equal on set and saw beauty in things like her glasses and retainer and made them \u201ccool\u201d through her approval. At 18, she\u2019d reunite with Coppola to play the \u201cbad girl\u201d in the Civil War era film \u201cThe Beguiled.\u201d",
      "Hartnett also thanked Coppola for giving him one of his first big roles as a teenage heartthrob in \u201cThe Virgin Suicides.\u201d He recalled being in awe of her, the mixtapes she made for the cast and her \u201cincredible chill\u201d under the immense pressure of directing her first feature at only 26.",

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker Lotfy Nathan has turned the apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Thomas into a supernatural thriller called \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son,\u201d starring Nicolas Cage",
      "LOS ANGELES -- In the second century, as the canonical Gospels were being copied and circulated throughout the Roman Empire, another text about the life of Jesus was simultaneously spreading. Although the Infancy Gospel of Thomas didn\u2019t make it into the New Testament, it remained popular among Christians for centuries.",
      "When filmmaker Lotfy Nathan was introduced to the apocryphal text about Jesus\u2019 childhood by his history-loving father, he immediately began poring over it as a springboard for what would eventually become \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son,\u201d the supernatural thriller starring Nicolas Cage and opening in theaters Friday.",
      "\u201cThe thought gave me chills,\u201d recalled the writer and director, who was raised Coptic Orthodox. \u201cThe novelty of this, in a way, being an origin story that hadn\u2019t been told before.\u201d",
      "The film, which stars FKA twigs and Noah Jupe alongside Cage, follows Jesus as a young boy being tempted by Satan to rebel against his father, Joseph (Cage). The film\u2019s source material is established with an opening title card. \u201cBased on the Infancy Gospel of Thomas,\u201d it reads. But Nathan concedes he couldn\u2019t rely solely on the text and had to fill in narrative gaps, as with a storyline involving Satan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s written like a laundry list of events. It doesn\u2019t really have an arc, so to speak,\u201d he said of the apocryphal account of Jesus\u2019 life from ages 5 to 12. \u201cI had a historian pull a lot of research for me before I wrote the first draft.\u201d",
      "As fate would have it, Cage had already read the Infancy Gospel of Thomas years ago, during a period in his life of deep philosophical curiosity and reflection. When Nathan came to the Oscar winner with the script, Cage said he saw a through line to a type of story he\u2019s long been attracted to.",
      "\u201cFamily dramas, it\u2019s no secret, is one of my favorite subject matters or genres. I couldn\u2019t think of a more compelling family dynamic than the Nativity,\u201d Cage told The Associated Press. \u201cAs I read it and thought about it, I never thought of it as a horror film per se. I saw it as a family drama about an existential crisis.\u201d",
      "The Infancy Gospel of Thomas might seem novel and obscure for some contemporary audiences, but history attests to both its popularity and longevity, according to Tony Burke, a professor at York University in Toronto whose specialties include early Christian apocrypha.",
      "Stories within it permeated ancient Christian lore, art and even some medieval plays. One account from the text about Jesus giving life to clay birds even made its way into the Quran.",
      "Also referred to as the Paidika \u2014 a nod to its original Greek title, \u201cPaidika Iesou,\u201d which translates to \u201cThe Childhood Acts of Jesus\u201d \u2014 the Infancy Gospel of Thomas often surprises modern readers.",
      "\u201cThis is not the Jesus that they expect \u2014 a Jesus that kills a boy in the marketplace or strikes down his teacher,\u201d Burke said, though he argues that Christian audiences during that time wouldn\u2019t have been bothered by this characterization. \u201cIn the ancient world, it was not that uncommon to tell stories of revered holy men cursing as well as blessing.\u201d",

      "The Paidika is one of two primary infancy gospels from that time \u2014 the other being the Infancy Gospel of James \u2014 that were popular among early Christians. \u201cThey never became canonical in the strict sense, but they were always kind of something on the periphery,\u201d Burke said.",
      "Although Jesus movies aren't often described as horror films or supernatural thrillers, the second century text upon which \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d is based is \u201cquite disturbing,\u201d argues Joan E. Taylor, a professor of early Christianity at King\u2019s College London. She recently wrote \u201cBoy Jesus: Growing Up Judaean in Turbulent Times.\u201d",
      "\u201cJesus is portrayed as having these powers but not really having the moral compass in terms of how he uses his powers, or at least not the moral compass we would expect from, say, the Gospel of Luke,\u201d she said of the Paidika. \u201cYou have this child who has these supernatural powers and punishes those who come in his way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d isn\u2019t the only recent film to reimagine the apocryphal gospel. \u201cThe Young Messiah,\u201d the 2016 drama based upon Anne Rice's novel \u201cChrist the Lord: Out of Egypt,\u201d also pulls from the Paidika.",
      "Both films reinterpret some of the aspects of the text that are ostensibly at odds with the Jesus of the canonical Gospels. In \u201cThe Young Messiah,\u201d for example, it\u2019s Satan who kills the boy in the marketplace, then frames Jesus. That encounter is left out of \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d entirely.",
      "Despite their popularity, telling any story about Jesus on-screen is tricky, especially when filmmakers veer into territory outside of the canonical Gospels. Cage recalled seeing \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ,\u201d Martin Scorsese\u2019s notoriously controversial 1988 drama starring Willem Dafoe as Jesus, in theaters when it first came out.",
      "\u201cI was in line to get my tickets and I remember there were the picketers and they were angry. And I said, \u2018Well have you seen the movie?\u2019 And they said no,\u201d Cage recalled. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you should see it before you make a statement about it or judge it?\u201d",
      "Still, he\u2019s cognizant of the fact that any film tackling subjects sacred to people is vulnerable to critique. The American Family Association, a conservative Christian advocacy group, has denounced the film and urged people to sign a petition blocking its release.",
      "\u201cNobody wanted to offend anybody in the making of this movie,\u201d Cage said emphatically. \u201cIf anyone does go to this movie, they would see that everyone treated it with love and not with any approach of mockery or contempt. It was all about love.\u201d",

      "Fans of Danmei same-sex romance stories in China say the government is cracking down harder than ever on the popular genre",
      "For Cindy Zhong, like many young Chinese women, a relaxing night used to mean curling up with a steamy story about two men in love. Then her favorite authors, and their tales, started disappearing.",
      "Fans of the popular Danmei same-sex romance genre, written and read mainly by straight women, say the Chinese government is carrying out the largest crackdown yet on it, effectively neutering the enjoyment.",
      "In the vast world of fantasy, Danmei is relatively straightforward: Two men stand in for idealized relationships, from chaste to erotic. Some scholars believe the stories appeal to Chinese women as a way to sidestep the country\u2019s conservative gender values and imagine relationships on a more equal footing.",
      "\"Women turn to Danmei for pure love, especially as they face pressure from families, peers and society to get married and have kids,\u201d said Aiqing Wang, a senior lecturer at the University of Liverpool who studies Chinese popular culture and internet literature.",
      "The once-niche Chinese literary subculture has seen a boom in recent years, with novels adapted into blockbuster television series and translated into Western languages.",
      "Danmei \u2014 also known as \u201cBoys Love\u201d in English \u2014 has also caught the eye of Chinese authorities. At least dozens of writers have been interrogated, arrested and charged with producing and selling obscene materials in China in the past year, according to media reports and witness accounts online.",
      "Some writers have stopped publishing or taken work offline. Websites have shut down or removed many stories, leaving the tamest behind.",
      "\u201cChinese female readers can no longer find a safe, uncensored space to place our desires,\u201d said Zhong, an educator in her 30s.",
      "Writers have said they enjoy directing lives that aren\u2019t their own.",
      "\u201cWhen I was writing, I felt so powerful that I could create a world,\u201d said Zou Xuan, a teacher who used to write Danmei for fun and has been reading them for a decade.",
      "China\u2019s government has been tightening its grip on the LGBTQ+ community, shutting down rights groups and social media accounts, despite removing homosexuality from its list of mental illness in 2001. Same-sex relationships are not criminalized.",
      "Even though China\u2019s censorship apparatus has long disapproved of same-sex love stories, the most popular Danmei stories have become bestselling books and been adapted into cartoons, video games and TV series. Adaptations often get around censorship by changing the characters to a heterosexual couple or presenting the relationship between male leads as an intense \u201cfriendship.\u201d",
      "The stories, usually published online by amateurs, are some of the most widely read fiction in China. Ranging from the flowery to the heavily erotic, they can include scenes of men fighting with a sword and a flute in ethereal ancient costumes or sex scenes in nature after rainfall.",
      "Danmei is \u201ca utopian existence,\u201d said Chen Xingyu, a 32-year-old freelance teacher living in the southwestern city of Kunming. \u201cI would be less happy without it.\u201d",
      "Some of the most popular stories, such as Heaven Official\u2019s Blessing and Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation, have been translated into English, building a global fan base and cracking The New York Times paperback bestseller list.",

      "After a disruptive U.S. government shutdown, federal SNAP food assistance is again flowing to low-income households. But in the months ahead, many participants will have to abide by new work requirements.",
      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides monthly benefits \u2014 averaging around $190 per person \u2014 to about 42 million people nationwide. During the first couple weeks of November, many of those recipients missed their regular allotments as President Donald Trump's administration battled in court over whether tap into reserves to fund the program while the government was shut down.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about SNAP:",
      "For the first part of the month, the situation was chaotic after the federal government said SNAP would not be funded because of the government shutdown.",
      "Some states replenished the electronic benefit cards used in the program either fully or partially, using their own funds or federal dollars that were part of court orders. Others didn't.",
      "Most states boosted food charities, but lines were long and some shelves were empty.",
      "As soon as the government reopened on Nov. 12, many states rushed to get out benefits.",
      "By Tuesday, all states either had loaded full November benefits onto people\u2019s electronic spending cards or were working on it, according to an Associated Press review. Participants should receive December SNAP benefits according to their normal schedule.",
      "A massive tax and spending bill signed into law in July by Trump expanded requirements for many adult SNAP recipients to work, volunteer or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don\u2019t are limited to three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The work requirements previously applied to adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents. The new law also applies those requirements to those ages 55 through 64 and to parents without children younger than 14. It repeals work exemptions for homeless individuals, veterans and young adults aging out of foster care. And it limits the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas lacking jobs.",
      "The Trump administration waived the work requirements in November, but the three-month clock on work-free SNAP benefits will be in full force in December.",

      "Rollins suggested that everyone who receives SNAP be required to reapply. But it\u2019s not clear whether Rollins was suggesting an additional requirement or referring to the current one that mandates people to periodically recertify their income and other information.",

      "But states can require more frequent eligibility verifications. Last year, 27 states required at least some households to be fully recertified every four to six months, depending on their household circumstances, according to a USDA report.",

      "Between the end of February and mid-August, funding ceased for 383 studies that were testing treatments for conditions including cancer, heart disease and brain disease. The cuts disproportionately impacted efforts to tackle infectious diseases like the flu, pneumonia and COVID-19, researchers found.",

      "At the halfway point of annual United Nations climate negotiations in Brazil, it appears the talks may do more than just focus on implementing past promises, as some observers had expected",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren\u2019t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on \u201cimplementation\u201d of past promises not yet kept.",
      "Throw that out the window.",
      "The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action \u2014 on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more \u2014 including from Brazil President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2014 the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he'll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqu\u00e9, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.",
      "\u201cI think things have changed, which is a very good thing,\u201d said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there\u2019s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say that what\u2019s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you\u2019re looking at an ambition gap,\u2033 said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of expectation, there\u2019s a lot of excitement here, but there\u2019s also a lot of political signals that\u2019s been sent by President Lula.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It\u2019s almost like a staring contest,\u201d Inventor said. \u201cBut next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.\u201d",
      "Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.",
      "Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.",
      "In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn\u2019t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth's warming.",
      "Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.",
      "So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what\u2019s planned in national pledges and what\u2019s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.",
      "That's not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year\u2019s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.",
      "So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.",
      "On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.",
      "\u201cThe parties will decide how they want to proceed,\u201d do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.",

      "But they gradually drifted apart after Austin's family moved to Germany before the girls started high school. Decades passed before they recently reconnected as grown women.",
      "\u201cStrong friendships really do stay for the long haul,\" Austin, 51, said. \"Even if there are pauses in between and they fade, that doesn\u2019t mean they completely dissolve or they go forgotten. They\u2019re always there kind of lingering like a little light in the back.\u201d",

      "The company that makes OxyContin, members of the Sackler family who own it and many groups that sued over its role in the opioid crisis are asking a judge to approve a settlement plan",
      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers representing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, branches of the Sackler family that own it, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others across the U.S. are expected to deliver a nearly unanimous message for a bankruptcy court judge Friday: Approve a plan to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against the company.",
      "If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane abides, it will close a long chapter \u2014 and maybe the entire book \u2014 on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.",
      "Closing arguments were expected Friday in the third day of a hearing over a bankruptcy plan for the company, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.",
      "The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.",
      "This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote.",
      "A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable \u2014 something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing.",
      "A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn't enough.",

      "A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.",

None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week's hearing.",
      "The company would get a name change and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis.",
      "There are also some non-financial provisions. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries.",

      "And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.",
      "Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue\u2019s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.",
      "About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue\u2019s opioids and will receive nothing. Lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000. Legal fees would reduce what people actually receive.",

      "Synthesized peptides are not new. Some doctors have prescribed them for decades off-label, or for unapproved uses, in patients with gastric ulcers, nervous system disorders and other conditions.",
      "In recent years, peptides have become a focus for wellness gurus and other public figures with large online followings.

      "Vice President JD Vance has praised Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for questioning established science and embracing nontraditional voices in health care",
      "WASHINGTON -- Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday praised Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s willingness to question established science and embrace nontraditional voices in the health care space, saying that often throughout history, \u201call the experts were wrong.\u201d",
      "In remarks in a fireside chat between the two men at a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d summit in the nation's capital, Vance also propped up Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, saying it has been \u201ca critical part of our success in Washington.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s words show how Kennedy, whose wrecking-ball approach to public health agencies and longstanding vaccine skepticism have made him a polarizing figure among the public and in Congress, has been embraced by the White House as a needed force for change.",
      "\u201cOf all the specific initiatives that you guys have worked on effectively, the most important thing is that your team is willing to ask questions that people in government haven't been asking in a long time,\u201d Vance told Kennedy onstage.",
      "The Vance-Kennedy event was livestreamed, but the summit was otherwise off limits to the press.",
      "Even as President Donald Trump and Kennedy have disagreed on issues from COVID-19 vaccines to abortion, the White House this year has largely left Kennedy alone as he has made sweeping changes to the agencies he leads, including laying off thousands of workers, firing science advisers and remaking vaccine guidelines.",
      "The Trump administration has touted Kennedy's efforts to phase out artificial dyes in foods, wage war on ultra-processed foods and update the national dietary guidelines. As health secretary, he has said he wants to find the root causes of chronic disease and help Americans reduce their exposure to toxins.",
      "Critics, including some of the country's leading medical associations, say that Kennedy\u2019s disregard for established science is fomenting public distrust in mainstream medicine and that his views, once considered fringe, are being amplified from his perch as health secretary.",
      "\u201cThis closed-door convention is nothing more than an ego-stroking symposium of \u2018wellbeing influencers\u2019 and \u2018MAHA moms\u2019 whose rejection of scientific expertise puts our public health at risk,\u201d said Erik Polyak, executive director of the progressive political action committee 314 Action, which works to elect Democratic scientists to office.",
      "Kennedy and his allies dispute that their agenda is anti-science.",
      "Vance nodded to the fact that many in Kennedy\u2019s network don\u2019t come from conventional medical circles, and some have more experience in business than in health. In fact, many of the health secretary's close allies and new hires have outright rejected medical consensus on topics including vaccines and how to heal chronic disease.",

      "President Donald Trump has signed a government funding bill that ends a record 43-day shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed a government funding bill Wednesday night, ending a record 43-day shutdown that caused financial stress for federal workers who went without paychecks, stranded scores of travelers at airports and generated long lines at some food banks.",
      "The shutdown magnified partisan divisions in Washington as Trump took unprecedented unilateral actions \u2014 including canceling projects and trying to fire federal workers \u2014 to pressure Democrats into relenting on their demands.",
      "The Republican president blamed the situation on Democrats and suggested voters shouldn\u2019t reward the party during next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "\u201cSo I just want to tell the American people, you should not forget this,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen we come up to midterms and other things, don\u2019t forget what they\u2019ve done to our country.\u201d",
      "The signing ceremony came just hours after the House passed the measure on a mostly party-line vote of 222-209. The Senate had already passed the measure Monday.",
      "Democrats wanted to extend an enhanced tax credit expiring at the end of the year that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. They refused to go along with a short-term spending bill that did not include that priority. But Republicans said that was a separate policy fight to be held at another time.",
      "\u201cWe told you 43 days ago from bitter experience that government shutdowns don\u2019t work,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \"They never achieve the objective that you announce. And guess what? You haven\u2019t achieved that objective yet, and you\u2019re not going to.\u201d",
      "The frustration and pressures generated by the shutdown was reflected when lawmakers debated the spending measure on the House floor.",
      "Republicans said Democrats sought to use the pain generated by the shutdown to prevail in a policy dispute.",
      "\u201cThey knew it would cause pain and they did it anyway,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said.",
      "Democrats said Republicans raced to pass tax breaks earlier this year that they say mostly will benefit the wealthy. But the bill before the House Wednesday \u201cleaves families twisting in the wind with zero guarantee there will ever, ever be a vote to extend tax credits to help everyday people pay for their health care,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass.",
      "Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats would not give up on the subsidy extension even if the vote did not go their way.",
      "\u201cThis fight is not over,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d",
      "The House had not been in legislative session since Sept. 19, when it passed a short-term measure to keep the government open when the new budget year began in October. Johnson sent lawmakers home after that vote and put the onus on the Senate to act, saying House Republicans had done their job.",
      "The legislation is the result of a deal reached by eight senators who broke ranks with the Democrats after reaching the conclusion that Republicans would not bend on using a government funding to bill to extend the health care tax credits.",
      "The compromise funds three annual spending bills and extends the rest of government funding through Jan. 30. Republicans promised to hold a vote by mid-December to extend the health care subsidies, but there is no guarantee of success.",
      "The bill includes a reversal of the firing of federal workers by the Trump administration since the shutdown began. It also protects federal workers against further layoffs through January and guarantees they are paid once the shutdown is over. The bill for the Agriculture Department means people who rely on key food assistance programs will see those benefits funded without threat of interruption through the rest of the budget year.",

      "The language seems aimed at helping Republican senators pursue damages if their phone records were analyzed by the FBI as part of an investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. The provisions drew criticism from Republicans as well. Johnson said he was \u201cvery angry about it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was dropped in at the last minute, and I did not appreciate that, nor did most of the House members,\u201d Johnson said, promising a vote on the matter as early as next week.",
      "The biggest point of contention, though, was the fate of the expiring enhanced tax credit that makes health insurance more affordable through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.",
      "\u201cIt's a subsidy on top of a subsidy. Our friends added it during COVID,\u201d Cole said. \u201cCOVID is over. They set a date certain that the subsidies would run out. They chose the date.\"",
      "Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the enhanced tax credit was designed to give more people access to health care and no Republican voted for it.",
      "\u201cAll they have done is try to eliminate access to health care in our country. The country is catching on to them,\u201d Pelosi said.",
      "Without the enhanced tax credit, premiums on average will more than double for millions of Americans. More than 2 million people would lose health insurance coverage altogether next year, the Congressional Budget Office projected.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the parties will find any common ground on health care before the December vote in the Senate. Johnson has said he will not commit to bringing it up in his chamber.",
      "Some Republicans have said they are open to extending the COVID-19 pandemic-era tax credits as premiums will soar for millions of people, but they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies. Some argue that the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals rather than go directly to insurance companies.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Monday that she was supportive of extending the tax credits with changes, such as new income caps. Some Democrats have signaled they could be open to that idea.",

      "Mount Semeru in East Java province unleashed avalanches of searing clouds of hot ash and a mixture of rock, lava and gas that traveled up to 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) down its slopes several times since midday to dusk, while a thick column of hot clouds rose 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) into the air, Indonesia\u2019s Geology Agency said in a statement.",
      "The eruption throughout the day blanketed several villages with falling ash and forcing authorities to raise the volcano\u2019s alert level twice, from the third-highest level to the highest, the agency said. No casualties have been reported.",
      "More than 300 residents in the three villages most at risk in the district of Lumajang had been evacuated to government shelters, said National Disaster Mitigation Agency's spokesperson Abdul Muhari.",

      "A massive illegal trash dump near Oxford has sparked outrage in England",
      "LONDON -- A mountain of illegally dumped trash near a river in the country outside Oxford was visible from space but few on Earth seemed to notice the mess.",
      "Hidden behind a thick row of trees from the busy highway next to it, the pile grew to the length of three Olympic-sized swimming pools and reached up to the roof of a two-story house as motorists unknowingly sped past.",
      "How the garbage got there and how long the massive pile had been growing remains a mystery, but its recent discovery has caused an outcry about a brewing environmental crisis and drawn attention to England's uphill battle to tackle criminal gangs suspected of illegally dumping waste.",
      "\u201cHow they managed to escape the eyes is quite shocking,\u201d said Liz Gyekye of Thames 21, an environmental charity. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that these perpetrators are caught swiftly and punished for their crimes. This is an environmental catastrophe unfolding at the doorstep of one of our nation\u2019s most treasured rivers.\"",
      "With winter rains coming and the trash sitting in a floodplain, there are concerns it will be swept into the adjacent River Cherwell, which meanders downstream through the Oxford University campus before meeting the River Thames that eventually flows to London and then out to sea.",
      "Although it was only reported in the news last week, the Environment Agency in England said it identified the area as a high-risk illegal waste site after becoming aware of it in July and issued a cease-and-desist order. The agency obtained a court order last month to shut down the area after learning about the continued dumping, which is now being investigated as a crime.",
      "When the dumping began is unclear, but satellite footage obtained by Thames21 showed verdant fields in April 2024 and what appeared to be a whiteish streak of the garbage between two rows of trees in July this year.",
      "Weeks before the public became aware of the dump alongside the A34 highway near the village of Kidlington, the government came under fire from a Parliamentary committee for being slow to act on a problem the agency said costs England's economy 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) annually.",
      "Enough garbage is illegally dumped each year to fill the 90,000-seat Wembley Stadium 35 times, the Environment and Climate Change Committee in the House of Lords said in a recent report. The committee urged the government to get tough on the organized crime groups suspected to be behind the problem.",
      "\u201cDespite the scale and seriousness of the crimes, raised by the members of the public in many cases, we have found multiple failings by the Environment Agency and other agencies, from slow responses to repeated public reports (as in the case of Hoads Wood, Kent) through to a woeful lack of successful convictions,\u201d said Shaista Ahmad Sheehan, the committee chair.",
      "The scourge of everything from bags of household waste to appliances and furniture being dumped in cities and countryside is a growing problem.",
      "\u201cFly-tipping,\u201d as it's known in the U.K., is a combination of the word for dumping while doing it on the fly, often from a moving vehicle. The practice is a source of angst for landowners and local government and an eyesore for a nation proud of its natural beauty.",

      "In June, the Environment Agency began overseeing a lengthy cleanup of a similarly giant dump in Hoads Wood, a protected ancient woodland south of London in Kent. Rogue haulers cleared trees there in 2023 and spent six months dumping 30,000 metric tons (33,069 tons) of household and construction debris up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) high.",

      "\u201cThe government is aware of the appalling case of illegal dumping,\" Hardy said in response to Miller's comments about the Oxfordshire dump. \"I absolutely share his constituents\u2019 anger as I too have seen the photographs and videos and it is no wonder that he feels moved to bring this urgent question today.\u201d",

      "China is rapidly replacing its aging diesel trucks with electric models, signaling a major shift in the world\u2019s largest vehicle market",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- China is replacing its diesel trucks with electric models faster than expected, potentially reshaping global fuel demand and the future of heavy transport.",
      "In 2020, nearly all new trucks in China ran on diesel. By the first half of 2025, battery-powered trucks accounted for 22% of new heavy truck sales, up from 9.2% in the same period in 2024, according to Commercial Vehicle World, a Beijing-based trucking data provider. The British research firm BMI forecasts electric trucks will reach nearly 46% of new sales this year and 60% next year.",
      "Heavy trucks carry the lifeblood of modern economies. They also contribute significantly to global emissions of carbon-dioxide: In 2019, road freight generated a third of all transport-related carbon emissions.",
      "Trucking has been considered hard to decarbonize since electric trucks with heavy batteries can carry less cargo than those using energy-dense diesel. Proponents of liquefied natural gas have viewed it as a less polluting option while technology for electric heavy vehicles matures.",
      "Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid fuel for easy storage and transport.",
      "China\u2019s trucking fleet, the world\u2019s second-largest after the U.S., still mainly runs on diesel, but the landscape is shifting. Transport fuel demand is plateauing, according to the International Energy Agency and diesel use in China could decline faster than many expect, said Christopher Doleman, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "Electric trucks now outsell LNG models in China, so its demand for fossil fuels could fall, and \"in other countries, it might never take off,\u201d he said.",
      "The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World.",
      "While electric trucks are two to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle\u2019s lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,\u201d Doleman said.",
      "Early sales were buoyed by generous government incentives like a 2024 scheme for truck owners to trade in old vehicles. Owners can get up to about $19,000 to replace older trucks with newer or electric models.",
      "Investments in charging infrastructure are also boosting demand for electric trucks.",
      "Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes.",
      "CATL, the world\u2019s largest maker of electric vehicle batteries, launched a time-saving battery-swapping system for heavy trucks in May and said it plans a nationwide network of swap stations covering 150,000 kilometers (about 93,000 miles) out of China's 184,000 kms (about 114,000 miles) of expressways.",
      "The surge in sales of electric trucks is cutting diesel use and could reshape future LNG demand, analysts say.",
      "Diesel consumption in China, the second-largest consumer of the fuel after the U.S., fell to 3.9 million barrels per day in June 2024, down 11% year-on-year and the largest drop since mid-2021, partly reflecting the shift to LNG and electric trucks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "\u201cThe rise of China\u2019s electric truck sector is one of the more under-reported stories in the global energy transition, especially given its potential impact on regional diesel trade flows,\u201d said Tim Daiss of APAC Energy Consultancy.",

      "History's first American pope was asked about the \u201cspecial message\u201d the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops adopted during the bishops' general assembly last week. The text criticized the Trump administration's mass deportation of migrants and the \u201cvilification\u201d of them in the current migration debate. It lamented the fear and anxiety immigration raids have sown in communities, and the denial of pastoral care to migrants in detention centers.",

      "Speaking to reporters as he left the papal country house south of Rome, Leo acknowledged there are problems in the U.S. migration system. But he stressed that no one has said the U.S. should have open borders, and that every country has the right to determine who can enter and how.",
      "\u201cBut when people are living good lives, and many of them for 10, 15, 20 years, to treat them in a way that is extremely disrespectful to say the least \u2014 and there\u2019s been some violence unfortunately \u2014 I think that the bishops have been very clear in what they said,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI would just invite all people in the United States to listen to them.\u201d",
      "The bishops' \u201cspecial message\u201d was rare, the first time since 2013 the bishops had penned such a single-issue statement at one of their meetings. It was accompanied by an Instagram video of individual bishops reading the text on camera, to hammer home its message.",

      "Along with those four issues is a push by scores of countries, rich and poor, for a detailed road map on how to phase out fossil fuels.

      "In 2020, nearly all new trucks in China ran on diesel. By the first half of 2025, battery-powered trucks accounted for 22% of new heavy truck sales, up from 9.2% in the same period in 2024, according to Commercial Vehicle World, a Beijing-based trucking data provider. The British research firm BMI forecasts electric trucks will reach nearly 46% of new sales this year and 60% next year.",

      "While electric trucks are two to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle\u2019s lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,\u201d Doleman said.",

      "\u201cRemember years ago there was Nancy Pelosi who was the bogeyman for Republicans,\u201d said Rob Bluey, president and executive editor of the Daily Signal. \u201cI think Mamdani is probably going to be the new person. I think that\u2019s why you see a lot of emphasis on him in conservative media.\u201d",
      "In the Washington Examiner, editor-in-chief Hugo Gurdon saw ominous signs in Mamdani's election night victory speech. \u201cHe was downright sinister, glorying not just in his achievement but in having laid low his vanquished enemies and stuck it to others besides. He took off his smiling campaign mask and revealed his venomous self,\u201d Gurdon wrote.",
      "Newsmax's Rob Schmitt called Mamdani the \u201cmayor for the foreign-born. We have flooded the country with diversity, and diversity delivered us Zohran.\" In an interview, Schmitt said he wasn't quite ready to anoint Mamdani as a deliberate target for the conservative media.",
      "\u201cA go-to bogeyman makes it sound like it's manufactured,\u201d he told The Associated Press, \u201cwhereas we are just appropriately concerned about people that are spewing or trying to push an ideology that is destined to not work.\u201d",
      "The Post recognized Mamdani as a target of interest well before the election. Between Oct. 27 and Nov. 5, he was the subject of seven of the tabloid's covers. One, headlined \u201cMam-Child,\" depicted Mamdani in a little boy's overalls to illustrate a column warning that the city wasn't a toy to hand to a \u201cbaby like Zohran.\u201d Another front page blared \u201cNot Zo Fast\u201d to herald a tightening race in the polls. Election Day's lead headline was \u201cTrump to New York: Keep the Commie Out.\u201d",
      "Mamdani reached out to the White House post-election for a meeting with Trump and the president said Sunday that \u201cwe'll work something out.\u201d",
      "Mamdani\u2019s status as a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and his Muslim background are behind many of the conservative media attacks.",
      "Asked on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this spring whether he was a communist, Mamdani said, \u201cNo, I am not.\u201d Webster's defines socialism as a political theory where the community or government owns and controls the production and distribution of goods. Communism, advanced by revolutionary Karl Marx, is considered a step beyond, where private property and capitalism no longer exist.",

      "\u201cEmirates now has a total of 375 units of the latest wide-body aircraft on its order book,\u201d Sheikh Ahmed said. \"This is a massive investment in our future, the future of flying better for our customers, as well as the future of aviation in terms of job and value creation.\u201d",

      "The flight disruptions during the record government shutdown have inspired a rare act of bipartisanship",
      "The flight disruptions during the record government shutdown that ended last week inspired a rare act of bipartisanship in Washington on Tuesday, when congressional representatives from both parties introduced legislation that would allow air traffic controllers to get paid during future shutdowns.",
      "The bill proposes funding salaries, operating expenses and other Federal Aviation Administration programs by tapping into a little-used fund with $2.6 billion that was created to reimburse airlines if the government commandeers their planes and they are damaged. The bill's sponsors, which include four of the top Republicans and Democrats on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, hope that relying on the fund might make their bill more attractive than other proposals because it would limit the potential cost of dolling out paychecks.",
      "U.S. Rep. Sam Graves of Missouri, the GOP chairman of the committee, said in a statement that the bill would help keep the traveling public safe during future shutdowns. The other sponsors include Democratic U.S. Reps. Rick Larsen of Washington and Andre Carson of Indiana, along with Republican U.S. Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas, who leads the aviation subcommittee.",
      "\u201cWe all saw that the system can be vulnerable when Congress can\u2019t get its job done,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThis bill guarantees that controllers, who have one of the most high-pressure jobs in the nation, will get paid during any future funding lapses and that air traffic control, aviation safety, and the traveling public will never again be negatively impacted by shutdowns.\u201d",
      "The bill\u2019s introduction comes ahead of a scheduled hearing Wednesday by a Senate subcommittee to examine the impacts of the 43-day shutdown on aviation.",
      "But it's not clear whether this bill \u2014 or any similar proposals that have been floating around Congress since the 2019 shutdown \u2014 will have a chance to get approved before the next government funding deadline at the end of January. Nearly all the other proposals, including one from U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, would rely on the aviation trust fund that collects money from fees the airlines pay, and the Congressional Budget Office has given those bills a much higher price tag.",
      "Over the years, lawmakers have tried a handful of fixes for a long-term solution to keep air traffic controllers and other essential aviation workers paid during funding lapses. The proposals often gained bipartisan attention, especially after the 35-day shutdown that ended in 2019 during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, but none made it over the finish line.",
      "Moran's bill, known as the Aviation Funding Stability Act, for example, is a recurring proposal in Congress that would allow the FAA to tap into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Lawmakers in both chambers have reintroduced versions of it over the years, including in 2019 and 2021.",
      "The legislation resurfaced in March when Moran, the Republican chairman of the Senate subcommittee on Aviation, Space, and Innovation, put it forward. It came up again in September, weeks before the shutdown began, when Carson and U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, also a Democrat, introduced it in the House.",
      "The new bill introduced Tuesday would cut off the money if the insurance fund dips below $1 billion. But Transportation Committee staffers estimate that would still provide enough funding to keep FAA operating for four to six weeks.",
      "The issue gets so much attention because of all the flight delays and cancellations that happen during a shutdown as more air traffic controllers call out of work. The existing shortage of controllers is so severe that just a few absences in an airport tower or other FAA radar facilities can cause problems.",

      "The delays got so bad during the latest shutdown that the government ordered airlines to cut some of their flights at 40 busy airports nationwide, in what the FAA said was an unprecedented but necessary move to relieve pressure on the system and controllers. Thousands of flights were canceled before the FAA lifted the order entirely and airlines were able to resume normal operations Monday.",

      "The loan is in line with the priorities of President Donald Trump's administration, including bolstering nuclear power and artificial intelligence.",
      "For Constellation Energy, which owns Three Mile Island's lone functioning nuclear power reactor, the federal loan will lower its financing cost to get the mothballed plant up and running again. The 835-megawatt reactor can power the equivalent of approximately 800,000 homes, the Department of Energy said.",
      "The reactor had been out of operation for five years when Constellation Energy announced last year that it would spend $1.6 billion to restart it under a 20-year agreement with Microsoft to buy the power for its data centers.",
      "Constellation Energy renamed the functioning unit the Crane Clean Energy Center as it works to restore equipment including the turbine, generator, main power transformer and cooling and control systems. It hopes to bring the plant back online in 2027.",
      "The loan is being issued under an existing $250 billion energy infrastructure program initially authorized by Congress in 2022. Neither the department nor Constellation released terms of the loan.",
      "The plant, on an island in the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, was the site of the nation\u2019s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. The accident destroyed one reactor, Unit 2, and left the plant with one functioning reactor, Unit 1.",

      "In a set of sweeping changes, the principles call for bank examiners to focus on material financial risks and to \u201cnot become distracted from this priority by devoting excessive attention to processes, procedures, and documentation.\" The guidelines are set out in a memo originally distributed to Fed employees Oct. 29 but released Tuesday.",
      "Michelle Bowman, the Fed's vice chair for supervision, said the principles will \u201csharpen\u201d the central bank's focus and build \u201ca more effective supervisory framework.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy anchoring our work in material financial risks, we strengthen the banking system\u2019s foundation while upholding transparency, accountability, and fairness,\" Bowman said in a written statement. Bowman was named vice chair by President Donald Trump in March.",
      "Since Trump took office, federal bank regulators have been rolling back regulations that govern the nation\u2019s banking system and other financial services companies. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created after the 2008 financial crisis, is effectively not operating presently and has negated several of the regulations it put into place under President Joe Biden.",
      "Also Tuesday, Fed governor Michael Barr, who preceded Bowman as the vice chair for supervision, sharply criticized the changes in banking oversight at the Fed and at other agencies this year.",
      "\u201cWe are now, I believe, at a moment of inflection in the regulatory and supervisory approaches that help keep banks healthy,\u201d Barr said in a speech. \u201cThere are growing pressures to weaken supervision ... in ways that will make it harder for examiners to act before it is too late to prevent a build-up of excessive risk.\u201d",

      "The announcement by the Fed matches a similar move by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which also loosened how it measures risk among the banks it supervises as well as removed issues like reputational risk from how examiners look at the banks.",
      "Under the Fed\u2019s new rules, banks can only be tested for material risks to their businesses or balance sheets, such as bad loans or unsound business practices. Banks will also able to self-certify on certain risk and supervision issues. These changes have been among the top priority for the banking industry since President Trump was elected into office.",
      "\u201cBanks are most resilient when their examiners prioritize material financial risks, not check-the-box compliance exercises,\u201d said Greg Baer, president and CEO of the Bank Policy Institute.",
      "Under the new framework, the Fed will also defer to other major bank regulators, including the OCC and state-level regulators, when it comes to who should supervise and examine these institutions.",
      "Bowman has also moved to reduce the Fed's regulatory staffing by about 30%, mostly through attrition, a step Barr also criticized Tuesday.",
      "The cuts \u201cwill impair supervisors\u2019 ability to act with the speed, force, and agility appropriate to the risks facing individual banks and the financial system,\u201d Barr said. \u201cSuch a drastically reduced staff will slow response time for the public and the banks themselves, limit supervisory findings and enforcement actions, and erode supervisors\u2019 ability to be forward-looking.\u201d",

      "President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Para state Gov. Helder Barbalho, Belem Mayor Igor Normando, and several lawmakers have pushed back against Merz, who traveled to Brazil earlier in November to discuss climate measures with other leaders.",
      "Upon his return to Germany, Merz said at a trade conference in Berlin that he was happy to leave the city. He said in his speech that his country's prosperous and free environment should be celebrated.",
      "\u201cWe live in one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Last week I asked some journalists who were with me in Brazil: Which of you would like to stay here? No one raised their hand,\u201d Merz said. \"They were all happy that, above all, we returned from this place to Germany in the night from Friday to Saturday.\u201d",
      "Late on Tuesday, Germany's chancellery did not reply to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Brazil's foreign office declined to make public comments since Sunday, when news of Merz's speech quickly spread in the country's social media. Lula finally addressed them during a speech at the unveiling of a new bridge in the southern part of the Amazon.",
      "\u201cThe German chancellor complained these days: \u2018I went to Belem, but I came back quickly because I actually like Berlin.\u2019 He should have gone to a pub, he should have danced, he should have tried the food in the state of Para. He would then notice that Berlin doesn't give him 10% of the quality offered by Para state and the city of Belem,\u201d the Brazilian president said.",
      "Germany is a key donor of the Amazon Fund, a Brazilian government initiative to combat deforestation. Merz pledged on Nov. 7 in Belem to make a \u201cconsiderable\u201d investment in an initiative named the Tropical Forests Forever Fund, crafted by Lula's administration, aiming to support more than 70 developing countries that commit to preservation.",
      "Barbalho, the Para state governor, used his social media channels to say Merz had made \u201ca prejudiced speech that shows more about the one who gave it than about its topic.\u201d",

      "In several speeches in the past week, some policymakers have registered greater concern over persistent inflation in an echo of the \u201caffordability\u201d concerns that played a large role in elections earlier this month.",
      "At the same time, another camp is much more concerned about meager hiring and the threat that the \"low-hire, low-fire\u201c job market could worsen into one where layoffs become more widespread.",
      "The turmoil on the Fed's 19-member interest-rate setting committee reflects a deeply uncertain economic outlook brought about by multiple factors, including tariffs, artificial intelligence, and changes in immigration and tax policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s reflective of a ton of uncertainty,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at M&T Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising at all that there\u2019s a wide divergence of opinions.\u201d",
      "Fewer rate cuts by the Fed could leave borrowing costs for homes and cars elevated. More expensive mortgages and auto loans contribute to the widespread view, according to polls, that the cost of living is too high.",
      "Some Fed watchers say that an unusually high number of dissents are possible at the December 9-10 meeting, regardless of whether the central bank reduces rates or not. Krishna Guha, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said a decision to cut could lead to as many as four or five dissents, while a decision to keep rates unchanged could produce three.",
      "Four dissenting votes would be highly unusual, given the Fed\u2019s history of seeking consensus. The last time four officials dissented was in 1992, under then-Chair Alan Greenspan.",
      "Fed governor Christopher Waller on Monday noted that critics of the Fed often accuse it of \u201cgroup think,\u201d since many of its decisions are made unanimously.",
      "\u201cPeople who are accusing us of this, get ready,\" Waller said Monday in remarks in London. \"You might see the least group think you\u2019ve seen ... in a long time.\u201d",
      "The differences have been exacerbated by the government shutdown's interruption of economic data, a particular challenge for a Fed that Chair Jerome Powell has often described as \u201cdata dependent.\u201d The government's last jobs report was for August, and inflation for September.",
      "September jobs data will finally be published Thursday, and are expected to show a small gain of 50,000 jobs that month and an unchanged unemployment rate at a still-low 4.3%.",
      "For now, Wall Street investors put the odds of a December rate cut at 50-50, according to CME Fedwatch, down sharply from nearly 94% a month ago. The decline has contributed to the stock market's drops this week.",

      "And speeches last week by a raft of regional Fed officials pushed the market odds of a December cut even lower. Susan Collins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said, \u201cin all of my conversations with contacts across New England, I hear concerns about elevated prices.\"",
      "Collins said that keeping the Fed's key rate at its current level of about 3.9% would help bring inflation down. The economy \u201chas been holding up quite well\u201d even with interest rates where they are, she added.",
      "Several other regional presidents voiced similar concerns, including Raphael Bostic of the Atlanta Fed, Alberto Musalem of the St. Louis Fed, and Jeffrey Schmid at the Kansas City Fed. Musalem, Collins, and Schmid are among the 12 officials who vote on policy this year. Schmid dissented in October in favor of keeping rates unchanged.",
      "\u201cWhen I talk to contacts in my district, I hear continued concern over the pace of price increases,\u201d Schmid said Friday. \u201cSome of this has to do with the effect of tariffs on input prices, but it is not just tariffs \u2014 or even primarily tariffs \u2014 that has people worried. I hear concerns about rising health care costs and insurance premiums, and I hear a lot about electricity.\"",
      "On Monday, however, Waller argued that sluggish hiring is a bigger concern, and renewed his call for a rate cut next month.",
      "\u201cThe labor market is still weak and near stall speed,\u201d he said. \u201cInflation through September continued to show relatively small effects from tariffs and support the hypothesis that tariffs ... are not a persistent source of inflation.\u201d",
      "Waller also dismissed the concern \u2014 voiced by Schmid and others \u2014 that the Fed should keep rates elevated because inflation has topped the Fed's 2% target for five years. So far that hasn't led the public to worry that inflation will stay elevated for an extended period, Waller noted.",

      "There could be consensus for an interest rate cut if, say, new data for October and November show the economy shedding jobs, according to Esther George, the former president of the Kansas City Fed.",
      "It's also worth noting that many economists had expected multiple dissents in September, but instead only Stephen Miran, a governor appointed that month by President Donald Trump, voted against the rate cut decision, in favor of an even bigger reduction.",
      "\u201cRegistering a dissent is a hard decision, and I think you\u2019re going to find people that are speaking today that wouldn\u2019t follow through with a vote in that direction,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to find enough consensus, whichever way they go.\"",

      "Amazon\u2019s Zoox will start giving free robotaxi rides through parts of San Francisco as it accelerates its attempt to challenge Waymo\u2019s early lead in the race to transport passengers cities in self-driving vehicles",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Amazon's Zoox will start giving free robotaxi rides through parts of San Francisco as it accelerates its attempt to challenge Waymo's early lead in the race to transport passengers in self-driving vehicles.",
      "The expansion announced Tuesday will be confined to a few major San Francisco neighborhoods and limited to people who signed up on a waiting list to ride in Zoox's gondola-shaped robotaxis, which have no steering wheel. The San Francisco launch comes less than three months after the Amazon-owned robotaxi company launched its first ride-hailing service along the Las Vegas strip.",
      "But Zoox still doesn't charge people to ride in its robotaxis, something Waymo has been doing since its debut in Phoenix five years ago. The free rides are the next major milestone before charging fares like Waymo and traditional ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft, as Amazon tried to make inroads in autonomous driving \u2014 a journey that began in 2020 when the e-commerce Goliath bought Zoox for $1.2 billion.",
      "California regulators still have to approve Zoox's application to charge for rides in San Francisco \u2014 a clearance that Waymo received in August 2023 after overcoming safety concerns raised by city officials. Since then, Waymo's robotaxis have become a familiar sight throughout San Francisco, where some tourists now make a point of hitching a ride in a self-driving car along with hopping on one of the city's fabled cable cars that have been operating for 152 years.",

In another sign of Waymo's accelerating growth, its robotaxis began extending their routes beyond city streets and onto highways in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix.",
      "Just as Waymo has already been doing, Amazon is gearing up to bring Zoox's robotaxis to other major cities, including Austin and Miami. To help Zoox realize its ambitions, Amazon converted a former bus factory into a high-tech robotaxi plant in Hayward, California \u2014 about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of San Francisco. Zoox eventually hopes to make as many as 10,000 robotaxis annually at the plant.",

      "\u201cBut of course, there\u2019s always people who may be well outside of a traditional bell curve. And in those cases, if you disagree with the estimate that comes back, then you can provide an ID or use parental consent in order to correct that,\u201d he said.",

      "A new report says China funneled billions in hidden loans to U.S. companies over the past quarter century, some targeting industries key to national security",
      "WASHINGTON -- For years, Washington has been warning others not to trust loans from Chinese state banks fueling its rise as a superpower. But a new report reveals an ironic twist: The United States is the biggest recipient of all \u2014 by far. And the security and technology implications have yet to be fully understood.",
      "China\u2019s state lenders have funneled $200 billion into U.S. businesses for a quarter of a century, but many of the loans have been kept secret because the money was first routed through shell companies in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Delaware and elsewhere that helped obscure their origins, according to AidData, a research lab at the College of William & Mary in Virginia.",
      "More alarming, much of the lending was to help Chinese companies buy stakes in U.S. businesses, many tied to critical technology and national security, including a robotics maker, a semiconductor company and a biotech firm.",
      "The report found a far more widespread and sophisticated lending network than previously thought \u2014 a web of financial obligations extending beyond developing countries to rich ones, including the U.K., Germany, Australia, the Netherlands and other U.S. allies.",
      "\u201cChina was playing chess while the rest of us were playing checkers,\u201d said former White House investment adviser William Henagan, who worries the hidden lending has given China a chokehold on technologies. \u201cWars will be won or lost based on whether you can control products critical to running an economy.\"",
      "While the U.S. still welcomes most foreign investment \u2014 and President Donald Trump has courted it \u2014 money from China has drawn particular scrutiny as the world's two biggest economies with opposing ideologies battle for global supremacy.",
      "Deals financed by China\u2019s state-owned banks, the ones studied in the AidData report, are especially problematic. The lenders are controlled by China's central government and the Communist Party's Central Financial Commission, and they are directed to advance China\u2019s strategic goals.",
      "In total, the AidData report found China lent more than $2 trillion from 2000 through 2023 around the world, double the highest previous estimates and a surprise to even longtime analysts of China's rise. And much of the lending to wealthy countries was focused on critical minerals and high-tech assets \u2014 rare earths and semiconductors needed for fighter jets, submarines, radar systems, precision-guided missiles and telecom networks.",
      "\u201cThe U.S., under both (former President Joe) Biden and Trump, have been beating this drum for more than a decade that Beijing is a predatory lender,\u201d said Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. \u201cThe irony is very rich.\u201d",
      "Until now, a full accounting of China's state lending has never been published because much of the financing is buried beneath layers of secrecy, masked by Western-sounding shell companies and mislabeled by international databases as ordinary private financing.",
      "\u201cThere is a complete lack of transparency that speaks to the lengths to which China goes, whether through shell companies or confidentiality agreements or redactions, to make it extremely difficult to come up with this full picture,\u201d said Scott Nathan, the former head of the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., an agency set up in the first Trump term to invest in foreign projects deemed in the U.S. national interest.",
      "Since the report\u2019s last documented loan in 2023, U.S. scrutiny has gotten better. Screening mechanisms, such as the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., got beefed up in 2020 to protect sensitive sectors in the economy.",
      "But China has gotten better, too, in part by setting up banks and branches overseas \u2014 more than 100 in recent years \u2014 that then lend to offshore entities, further clouding the origins of the money.",
      "\u201cIn places where there are more cops on the beat,\" Parks said, \u201cit has found ways to work around barriers to entry.\u201d",

      "Chinese state bank financing has touched projects across the U.S., particularly in the Northeast, the Great Lakes region, the West Coast and along the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump has renamed the Gulf of America. Many loans targeted critical high-tech industries, according to the report.",
      "\u2014 In 2015, for instance, Chinese state-owned banks lent $1.2 billion to a private Chinese business to buy an 80% stake in Ironshore, a U.S. insurer whose clients included the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation officials and undercover agents who might need help paying legal bills in case they got into trouble in their jobs.",
      "U.S. regulators were unaware of the Chinese government involvement because the financing was funneled through a Cayman Island business with no obvious ties to China, according to the report. U.S. officials later realized the Chinese government could access information and ordered the Chinese buyer to divest.",
      "\u2014 That same year, the Chinese government published \u201cMade in China 2025,\" a list of 10 high-tech areas, such as semiconductors, biotechnology and robotics, where it wanted to reach 70% self-sufficiency within a decade. The next year, in 2016, the Export\u2013Import Bank of China, a policy bank, provided $150 million in loans to help a Chinese company buy a robotics equipment company in Michigan.",
      "After China\u2019s adoption of the manufacturing master plan, the percentage of projects targeting sensitive sectors such as robotics, defense, quantum computing and biotechnology rose from 46% to 88% of China\u2019s portfolio for cross-border acquisition lending, according to AidData.",
      "\u2014 In 2017, a Delaware private equity firm using a Cayman Islands company tried to buy a U.S. chip maker; the deal was blocked when investigators discovered both companies were owned by a Chinese state-owned enterprise. That same Delaware company successfully bought a U.K. semiconductor maker that had to be divested when British authorities found out.",
      "\u2014 And in 2022, the U.K. forced a Chinese company to divest another sensitive British firm in the industry, a designer of chips in Apple phones but potentially adaptable for military systems. The Chinese company had bought it through a company in the Netherlands that they owned. That Dutch firm is now accused of withholding semiconductors vital to automakers in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "To trace China's hidden lending, AidData dug through regulatory filings, private contracts and stock exchange disclosures in more than 200 countries written in multiple languages.",
      "The effort to track China's state loans and investment started more than a decade ago when Beijing launched its Belt & Road Initiative to build infrastructure in developing countries. The project expanded sharply three years ago when the AidData team, which eventually grew to 140 researchers, realized many of the loans were landing in advanced economies such as the U.S., Australia, the Netherlands and Portugal, where acquisitions could allow it to access technology that Beijing considers essential to its global rise.",
      "The report says the findings show a shift in the use of state credit from promoting economic development and social welfare to gaining geo-economic advantages.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s global concern that this is part of a concerted effort to gain control over economic chokepoints and use this leverage,\u201d said Brad Setser, an adviser to the U.S. Trade Representative in the Biden administration. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we understand what they\u2019re doing, and they don\u2019t make it easy.\u201d",

      "Roger Federer has been elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility",
      "Well, this will come as no surprise to anyone who's paid any attention over the past quarter-century: Roger Federer was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, the Rhode Island-based Hall announced Wednesday.",
      "The first man to win 20 Grand Slam singles titles, and part of an era of unprecedented greatness with rivals Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic \u2014 during what Federer termed \u201ca golden time for tennis\u201d \u2014 he was the only candidate to receive enough support in the player category for the Hall's class of 2026. The Hall does not reveal voting results.",
      "TV announcer and journalist Mary Carillo, who also was a player, was elected in the contributor category. The induction ceremony is in August.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always valued the history of tennis and the example set by those who came before me,\u201d Federer said. \u201cTo be recognized in this way by the sport and by my peers is deeply humbling.\u201d",
      "He is one of eight men with a career Grand Slam, collecting eight championships at Wimbledon, six at the Australian Open, five at the U.S. Open and one at the French Open.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t predict I was going to have this many majors,\u201d Federer once said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI was hoping to maybe have one, to be quite honest, at the very beginning of my career.\u201d",
      "Federer's first Slam title came at the All England Club in 2003, and he broke Pete Sampras\u2019 then-record for a male of 14 major titles by winning Wimbledon in 2009, defeating Andy Roddick 16-14 in the fifth set of the final. Federer claimed his 20th at the 2018 Australian Open.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really feel like I\u2019m playing for the records,\u201d Federer once told the AP. \u201cI play this game because I love it.\u201d",
      "His Grand Slam count eventually was surpassed by Nadal, who got to 22 before retiring last year at age 38, and Djokovic, who has 24 and is still active at 38.",
      "With a terrific forehand and serve, an attacking, all-court style and footwork that made everything seem so effortless, Federer won 103 tournaments and 1,251 matches in singles, totals eclipsed in the men's game only by Jimmy Connors in the Open era, which began in 1968.",
      "Federer finished five years at No. 1 in the ATP rankings, spent a record 237 consecutive weeks and a total of 310 in the top spot, led Switzerland to the 2014 Davis Cup title and teamed with Stan Wawrinka for a doubles gold medal at the 2008 Olympics.",
      "An ambassador for the game who often answered questions in English, French and Swiss German at news conferences, Federer played his last match at Wimbledon in 2021. He was a month shy of 40 at the time.",

      "\u201cThe elegance he has shown on court, off the court \u2014 how he treated people, everyone; a really humble guy \u2014 everything he does, he does with elegance,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cI appreciate that. He took the game to another level ... that's what I admire the most.\u201d",
      "At the height of his powers, Federer reached a record 10 consecutive Grand Slam finals from 2005-07, winning eight. That dominance extended to appearing in 18 of 19 Slam finals; he also put together streaks of 23 semifinals and 36 quarterfinals at majors.",
      "Djokovic has called those \u201cresults that didn\u2019t seem human.\u201d",
      "According to the Hall, Carillo was the first woman to regularly commentate on tennis broadcasts and was a correspondent for HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Sports.\u201d She won six Emmy Awards and three Peabody Awards and was inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 2018.",

      "The president of Cyprus says some of the estimated 20 trillion cubic feet of natural gas discovered in waters off the island nation could reach European markets as soon as 2027",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Some of the estimated 20 trillion cubic feet of natural gas discovered in waters off Cyprus could reach European markets as soon as 2027, the Cypriot president said Wednesday, as Europe looks for more ways to wean itself off Russian energy.",
      "President Nikos Christodoulides said that the first quantity of natural gas that could be exported abroad will come from the so-called Cronos deposit, which is operated by a consortium made up of Italian company Eni and French firm TotalEnergies.",
      "Christodoulides told an energy conference that the consortium would make its final decision to move ahead with the project next year, with Cronos gas potentially reaching a processing plant in the Egyptian port city of Damietta for liquefaction and transportation to European markets by ship in 2027.",
      "\u201cCyprus is part of the energy solutions for energy security in the eastern Mediterranean and like I said, it\u2019s an important objective to align your interests with those of powerful states and to act as an alternative energy corridor for Europe,\u201d Christodoulides said.",
      "Speaking at the same conference, Cypriot Energy Minister George Pananastasiou said that natural gas from the Cronos deposit could reach markets the quickest, because it can be connected to infrastructure already in place conveying gas from Egypt\u2019s huge Zor deposit around 80 kilometers (50 miles) away.",
      "Papanastasiou said that a late 2027 target date for Cronos gas to reach market is \u201coptimistic but doable.\u201d",

      "The processed gas will reach a facility near Egypt\u2019s Port Said and will either be utilized for domestic Egyptian consumption or liquefied for export to Europe, depending on what will be decided in further consultations between Cyprus and the deposit\u2019s operator, a partnership between Chevron, Shell and Israeli company NewMed Energy.",
      "Christodoulides said that he would travel to Lebanon next week to exclusively discuss Cyprus\u2019 energy plans. Cyprus shares maritime borders with Lebanon, but the Lebanese government hasn\u2019t fully ratified an agreement delineating the exclusive economic zones of the two countries. That has prevented Cyprus from opening up areas abutting Lebanese waters for hydrocarbons exploration.",

      "A museum dedicated to the Shroud of Turin has opened at the Christ Cathedral campus in Garden Grove, California",
      "GARDEN GROVE, Calif. -- An interactive museum dedicated to the Shroud of Turin, which some say was Jesus\u2019 burial cloth, opens its doors to the public Wednesday at the Christ Cathedral campus in Southern California.",
      "\u201cThe Shroud of Turin: An Immersive Experience,\u201d a $5-million exhibit in Garden Grove featuring 360-degree projection room theaters, Shroud of Turin replicas, interactive kiosks, and a life-size sculpture of Christ, was conceived over a span of three years and funded through private donations.",
      "The content was created primarily by Othonia, Inc., a Rome-based group dedicated to the examination of the shroud, one of the most studied artifacts in history. The original \u2014 a 14-foot-long, 3.5-foot-wide (4.3-meter-long, 1 meter-wide) cloth \u2014 is kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case housed in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, Italy.",
      "The California museum \u2014 covering 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) \u2014 contains a life-size laminated visual of the shroud stretched over a wall. It shows the faint image of a man with wounds similar to those of Christ.",
      "The Vatican has called the cloth a powerful symbol of Christ\u2019s suffering while making no claim to its authenticity. Many experts stand by carbon-dating of scraps of the cloth that put it in the 13th or 14th century, but many faithful \u2014 some accomplished scientists among them \u2014 say the results might have been skewed by contamination, calling for larger samples to be analyzed. Many insist that the cloth contains pollen from Jerusalem and is woven in a pattern that was unique to the first century.",
      "The cloth, considered a relic by many Christians, was most recently on display in the spring of 2015. While the shroud may never leave Turin, the new exhibit will remain at least through 2030 on the Christ Cathedral campus, next to the famous glass tower and sanctuary erected by televangelist Robert H. Schuller that is now home to the Catholic Diocese of Orange.",
      "The Most Rev. Timothy Freyer, an auxiliary bishop at the diocese, said he hopes the exhibit will reinforce for visitors the power of God\u2019s love for all.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that people of faith will have stronger faith, people who are doubting will come to belief and people with no faith will begin the questioning process and then come to faith,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the highlights of the immersive experience is a re-creation of Christ\u2019s resurrection on Easter morning, with museum visitors sitting in the tomb and watching the shrouded body disappear in a flash of light. The exhibit also features replicas of the spear believed to have pierced Christ\u2019s chest and the helmet of thorns placed on his head.",
      "Philip Rizzo, a parishioner at St. Bonaventure Catholic Church in Huntington Beach who was part of a group that got a preview, said seeing these items up close created a powerful visual representation of Christ\u2019s suffering and sacrifice. Also, he said, witnessing the extensive scientific research conducted on the cloth makes the artifact more relatable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re tangible beings, not just spirit and light,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cScience really helps make that connection.\u201d",
      "While some scientists have criticized the eagerness of Christians to authenticate the cloth, the new exhibit had its origins in such curiosity. Its main proponent was August Accetta, a gynecologist who opened up the Shroud Center of Southern California in 1998 and has studied the cloth's mystery for over three decades.",
      "Accetta said it was the Shroud of Turin that converted him from agnostic to Catholic. His Shroud fascination continued after meeting John Jackson, a nuclear physicist, who in 1978 led a 40-person team of scientists as part of the Shroud of Turin Research Project. Their study determined that the cloth was not a manufactured work of art, but contained human bloodstains and that no known physical, chemical or biological process could adequately explain how the image on the Shroud was formed.",
      "Accetta believes, as some other scientists do, that the image was created by a burst of radiation and that a massive amount of energy is required to create the image without burning the cloth.",
      "\u201cOn the shroud, you see four centimeters of anatomically correct information encoded in two microns, which is about half the thickness of a strand of hair,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t even begin to understand that, let alone reproduce it.\u201d",
      "To him, the only explanation \u2014 as the interactive exhibit illustrates \u2014 is that the body of Christ became light and the shroud simply collapsed, leaving the fine imprint of his face on the white linen.",

The stains should be smeared and fragmented if that were the case, he said. Like Accetta, Spitzer says the etching on the cloth was likely caused by particle radiation.",
      "\u201cAnd then one 10,000th of a second after the discharge begins, whap! These blood stains are transferred perfectly onto the cloth,\u201d Spitzer said. \"The only explanation is that body has to disappear. I mean \u2014 like Frodo\u2019s ring \u2014 it\u2019s gone.\u201d",

      "Nora Creech, director of Othonia in the U.S., said the Rome-based organization was founded by the Rev. Hector Guerra, who dreamed of creating 100 exhibits globally. He built the first flagship exhibit in Jerusalem and others in Rome, Poland, Mexico and the U.S. This latest one is the first to feature an immersive experience, which was created by a California-based studio.",
      "Creech said they decided to begin the movielike immersive experience with Christ\u2019s life story from birth to crucifixion and end with the resurrection and the message that \u201cJesus is still with us today.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of the quotes in the movie is that the cross received Jesus alive and turned him over to the shroud, dead. The shroud received Jesus dead and turned him over to us alive in the Eucharist,\u201d she said.",
      "Rudy Dicthtl, one of the scientists who formed the 1978 research team, still remembers every moment spent touching and holding the cloth in his hands. He said he and the other scientists walked into the project with the understanding that they would leave the moment they saw the cloth was a forgery or a manufactured piece of art. Their research found that it was not.",
      "\u201cWe saw the cloth as something that had the potential to be the burial cloth of Christ,\u201d he said.",
      "Dichtl, a Catholic, said as a scientist he acknowledges there is limited evidence in science to conclusively say the cloth was the one that covered the body of Christ.",

COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago later released a proposal with 21 options for negotiators to choose from on four sticky and interrelated issues.",
      "\u201cIt's text Tuesday and we\u2019re sort of off to the races,\u2019\u2019 said World Resources Institute's David Waskow, who said the nine-page proposal \u201caddresses some of the core questions that have been part of the presidency consultations.\u2019\u2019",
      "The four key political issues are whether countries should be told to do better on their new climate plans; details on handing out $300 billion in pledged climate aid; dealing with trade barriers over climate; and improving transparency, which Waskow said is really about reporting climate progress.",

That timeline is \u201cpretty ambitious,\u201d said Alden Meyer, a senior associate at climate think tank E3G.",

      "But if you're confused, you're not alone. Google searches for \u201cagentic\u201d have skyrocketed from near obscurity a year ago to a peak earlier this fall.",
      "A new report Tuesday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Boston Consulting Group, who surveyed more than 2,000 business executives around the world, describes agentic AI as a \u201cnew class of systems\u201d that \u201ccan plan, act, and learn on their own.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not just tools to be operated or assistants waiting for instructions,\u201d says the MIT Sloan Management Review report. \"Increasingly, they behave like autonomous teammates, capable of executing multistep processes and adapting as they go.\u201d",
      "AI chatbots \u2014 such as the original ChatGPT that debuted three years ago this month \u2014 rely on systems called large language models that predict the next word in a sentence based on the huge trove of human writings they've been trained on. They can sound remarkably human, especially when given a voice, but are effectively performing a kind of word completion.",
      "That's different from what AI developers \u2014 including ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI, and tech giants like Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Salesforce \u2014 have in mind for AI agents.",
      "\u201cA generative AI-based chatbot will say, \u2018Here are the great ideas\u2019 \u2026 and then be done,\u201d said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at Amazon Web Services, in an interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s useful, but what makes things agentic is that it goes beyond what a chatbot does.\u201d",
      "Sivasubramanian, a longtime Amazon employee, took on his new role helping to lead work on AI agents in Amazon's cloud computing division earlier this year. He sees great promise in AI systems that can be given a \u201chigh-level goal\u201d and break it down into a series of steps and act upon them. \u201cI truly believe agentic AI is going to be one of the biggest transformations since the beginning of the cloud,\u201d he said.",
      "For most consumers, the first encounters with AI agents could be in realms like online shopping. Set a budget and some preferences and AI agents can buy things or arrange travel bookings using your credit card. In the longer run, the hope is that they can do more complex tasks with access to your computer and a set of guidelines to follow.",

Tambe said he's been \u201camused\u201d by the sudden popularity of \u201cagentic\u201d as an adjective. Previously, the word describing something that has agency was mostly found in other academic fields, such as psychology or chemistry.",

The cameras will use AI to automate inspections of guardrails, road signs and pavement markings, instantly discerning between minor problems and emergencies that warrant sending a maintenance crew.",
      "\u201cThis is not something where it\u2019s looked at once a month and then they sit down and figure out where they\u2019re going to put their vans,\u201d said Richard Browning, chief commercial officer at Nextbase, which developed the dashcams and imagery platform for Hawaii.",
      "After San Jose, California, started mounting cameras on street sweepers, city staff confirmed the system correctly identified potholes 97% of the time. Now they're expanding the effort to parking enforcement vehicles.",
      "Texas, where there are more roadway lane miles than the next two states combined, is less than a year into a massive AI plan that uses cameras as well as cellphone data from drivers who enroll to improve safety.",

      "Hawaii drivers over the next few weeks will be able to sign up for a free dashcam valued at $499 under the \u201cEyes on the Road\u201d campaign, which was piloted on service vehicles in 2021 before being paused due to wildfires.",
      "Roger Chen, a University of Hawaii associate professor of engineering who is helping facilitate the program, said the state faces unique challenges in maintaining its outdated roadway infrastructure.",
      "\u201cEquipment has to be shipped to the island,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a space constraint and a topography constraint they have to deal with, so it\u2019s not an easy problem.\u201d",
      "Although the program also monitors such things as street debris and faded paint on lane lines, the companies behind the technology particularly tout its ability to detect damaged guardrails.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re analyzing all guardrails in their state, every single day,\u201d said Mark Pittman, CEO of Blyncsy, which combines the dashboard feeds with mapping software to analyze road conditions.",
      "Hawaii transportation officials are well aware of the risks that can stem from broken guardrails. Last year, the state reached a $3.9 million settlement with the family of a driver who was killed in 2020 after slamming into a guardrail that had been damaged in a crash 18 months earlier but never repaired.",
      "In October, Hawaii recorded its 106th traffic fatality of 2025 \u2014 more than all of 2024. It's unclear how many of the deaths were related to road problems, but Chen said the grim trend underscores the timeliness of the dashboard program.",

      "Utilities are producing eye-popping forecasts about the amount of electricity they'll need to power massive new data centers that are feeding the fast-growing AI economy",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they'll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.",
      "But the challenges \u2014 some say the impossibility \u2014 of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.",
      "One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built \u2014 eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.",
      "The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that's ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.",
      "Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas \u2014 such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. \u2014 are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s speculation in there,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. \u201cNobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what\u2019s speculative, what\u2019s double-counting, what\u2019s real, what\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "There is no standard practice across grids or for utilities to vet such massive projects, and figuring out a solution has become a hot topic, utilities and grid operators say.",
      "Uncertainty around forecasts is typically traced to a couple of things.",
      "One concerns developers seeking a grid connection, but whose plans aren't set in stone or lack the heft \u2014 clients, financing or otherwise \u2014 to bring the project to completion, industry and regulatory officials say.",
      "Another is data center developers submitting grid connection requests in various separate utility territories, PJM Interconnection, which operates the mid-Atlantic grid, and Texas lawmakers have found.",
      "Often, developers, for competitive reasons, won't tell utilities if or where they've submitted other requests for electricity, PJM said. That means a single project could inflate the energy forecasts of multiple utilities.",
      "The effort to improve forecasts got a high-profile boost in September, when a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member asked the nation\u2019s grid operators for information on how they determine that a project is not only viable, but will use the electricity it says it needs.",
      "\u201cBetter data, better decision-making, better and faster decisions mean we can get all these projects, all this infrastructure built,\u201d the commissioner, David Rosner, said in an interview.",
      "The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, said it welcomed efforts to improve demand forecasting.",
      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents tech giants like Google and Meta and data center developers, has urged regulators to request more information from utilities on their forecasts and to develop a set of best practices to determine the commercial viability of a data center project.",
      "The coalition's vice president of energy, Aaron Tinjum, said improving the accuracy and transparency of forecasts is a \u201cfundamental first step of really meeting this moment\u201d of energy growth.",

      "States also are trying to do more to find out what\u2019s in utility forecasts and weed out speculative or duplicative projects.",
      "In Texas, which is attracting large data center projects, lawmakers still haunted by a blackout during a deadly 2021 winter storm were shocked when told in 2024 by the grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that its peak demand could nearly double by 2030.",
      "They found that state utility regulators lacked the tools to determine whether that was realistic.",
      "Texas state Sen. Phil King told a hearing earlier this year that the grid operator, utility regulators and utilities weren\u2019t sure if the power requests \u201care real or just speculative or somewhere in between.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers passed legislation sponsored by King, now law, that requires data center developers to disclose whether they have requests for electricity elsewhere in Texas and to set standards for developers to show that they have a substantial financial commitment to a site.",

      "The data center projects counted in the forecast are backed by contracts with financial commitments often reaching tens of millions of dollars, PPL said.",
      "Still, PPL's projections helped spur a state lawmaker, Rep. Danilo Burgos, to introduce a bill to bolster the authority of state utility regulators to inspect how utilities assemble their energy demand forecasts.",
      "Ratepayers in Burgos' Philadelphia district just absorbed an increase in their electricity bills \u2014 attributed by the utility, PECO, to the rising cost of wholesale electricity in the mid-Atlantic grid driven primarily by data center demand.",

      "Several lawsuits emerged across the U.S. \u2014 and were later consolidated \u2014 after AT&T notified millions of customers that information ranging from Social Security numbers to call records were compromised in these breaches last year. Plaintiffs alleged that the telecommunications giant \u201crepeatedly failed\u201d to protect consumer data. While AT&T has continued to deny wrongdoing, it opted to settle earlier this year.",
      "\u201cWe have agreed to this settlement to avoid the expense and uncertainty of protracted litigation,\u201d AT&T said in a Thursday statement, adding that the company remains \"committed to protecting our customers\u2019 data and ensuring their continued trust in us.\u201d",

      "AT&T disclosed the first of these breaches in March 2024, after the company said it found that customer information from 2019 or earlier had been released on the \u201cdark web\" weeks earlier. At the time, AT&T said the breach impacted roughly 7.6 million current and 65.4 million former account holders \u2014 with leaked data including some sensitive info like Social Security numbers and passcodes.",
      "The other breach involved call and text records of nearly all AT&T customers from May through October of 2022, as well as a small subset from Jan. 2, 2023. AT&T said it learned that data was \u201cillegally downloaded from our workspace on a third-party cloud platform\u201d in April of last year \u2014 and began notifying customers in July 2024, after launching an investigation. The company maintained that the leaked records included information like phone numbers, but not content of the calls or texts, or other personally identifiable information.",

      "There's a new frontier in treating autoimmune diseases",
      "Scientists are trying a revolutionary new approach to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus and other devastating autoimmune diseases \u2014 by reprogramming patients\u2019 out-of-whack immune systems.",
      "When your body\u2019s immune cells attack you instead of protecting you, today\u2019s treatments tamp down the friendly fire but they don\u2019t fix what\u2019s causing it. Patients face a lifetime of pricey pills, shots or infusions with some serious side effects \u2014 and too often the drugs aren\u2019t enough to keep their disease in check.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re entering a new era,\u201d said Dr. Maximilian Konig, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University who\u2019s studying some of the possible new treatments. They offer \u201cthe chance to control disease in a way we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d",
      "How? Researchers are altering dysfunctional immune systems, not just suppressing them, in a variety of ways that aim to be more potent and more precise than current therapies.",
      "They\u2019re highly experimental and, because of potential side effects, so far largely restricted to patients who\u2019ve exhausted today\u2019s treatments. But people entering early-stage studies are grasping for hope.",
      "\u201cWhat the heck is wrong with my body?\u201d Mileydy Gonzalez, 35, of New York remembers crying, frustrated that nothing was helping her daily lupus pain.",
      "Diagnosed at 24, her disease was worsening, attacking her lungs and kidneys. Gonzalez had trouble breathing, needed help to stand and walk and couldn\u2019t pick up her 3-year-old son when last July, her doctor at NYU Langone Health suggested the hospital\u2019s study using a treatment adapted from cancer.",
      "Gonzalez had never heard of that CAR-T therapy but decided, \u201cI\u2019m going to trust you.\u201d Over several months, she slowly regained energy and strength.",
      "\u201cI can actually run, I can chase my kid,\u201d said Gonzalez, who now is pain- and pill-free. \u201cI had forgotten what it was to be me.\u201d",
      "CAR-T was developed to wipe out hard-to-treat blood cancers. But the cells that go bad in leukemias and lymphomas \u2014 immune cells called B cells \u2014 go awry in a different way in many autoimmune diseases.",
      "Some U.S. studies in mice suggested CAR-T therapy might help those diseases. Then in Germany, Dr. Georg Schett at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg tried it with a severely ill young woman who had failed other lupus treatment. After one infusion, she\u2019s been in remission \u2014 with no other medicine \u2014 since March 2021.",
      "Last month, Schett told a meeting of the American College of Rheumatology how his team gradually treated a few dozen more patients, with additional diseases such as myositis and scleroderma \u2014 and few relapses so far.",
      "Those early results were \u201cshocking,\u201d Hopkins\u2019 Konig recalled.",
      "They led to an explosion of clinical trials testing CAR-T therapy in the U.S. and abroad for a growing list of autoimmune diseases.",
      "How it works: Immune soldiers called T cells are filtered out of a patient\u2019s blood and sent to a lab, where they\u2019re programmed to destroy their B cell relatives. After some chemotherapy to wipe out additional immune cells, millions of copies of those \u201cliving drugs\u201d are infused back into the patient.",
      "While autoimmune drugs can target certain B cells, experts say they can\u2019t get rid of those hidden deep in the body. CAR-T therapy targets both the problem B cells and healthy ones that might eventually run amok. Schett theorizes that the deep depletion reboots the immune system so when new B cells eventually form, they\u2019re healthy.",
      "CAR-T is grueling, time consuming and costly, in part because it is customized. A CAR-T cancer treatment can cost $500,000. Now some companies are testing off-the-shelf versions, made in advance using cells from healthy donors.",
      "Another approach uses \u201cpeacekeeper\u201d cells at the center of this year\u2019s Nobel Prize. Regulatory T cells are a rare subset of T cells that tamp down inflammation and help hold back other cells that mistakenly attack healthy tissue. Some biotech companies are engineering cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases not to attack, like CAR-T does, but to calm autoimmune reactions.",
      "Scientists also are repurposing another cancer treatment, drugs called T cell engagers, that don\u2019t require custom engineering. These lab-made antibodies act like a matchmaker. They redirect the body's existing T cells to target antibody-producing B cells, said Erlangen's Dr. Ricardo Grieshaber-Bouyer, who works with Schett and also studies possible alternatives to CAR-T.",

      "Rather than wiping out swaths of the immune system, Hopkins\u2019 Konig aims to get more precise, targeting \u201conly that very small population of rogue cells that really causes the damage.\u201d",

      "Nearby in another Hopkins lab, biomedical engineer Jordan Green is crafting a way for the immune system to reprogram itself with the help of instructions delivered by messenger RNA, or mRNA, the genetic code used in COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "In Green's lab, a computer screen shines with brightly colored dots that resemble a galaxy. It\u2019s a biological map that shows insulin-producing cells in the pancreas of a mouse. Red marks rogue T cells that destroy insulin production. Yellow indicates those peacemaker regulatory T cells \u2014 and they're outnumbered.",
      "Green's team aims to use that mRNA to instruct certain immune \u201cgenerals\u201d to curb the bad T cells and send in more peacemakers. They package the mRNA in biodegradable nanoparticles that can be injected like a drug. When the right immune cells get the messages, the hope is they'd \u201cdivide, divide, divide and make a whole army of healthy cells that then help treat the disease,\" Green said.",

      "Type 1 diabetes develops gradually, and blood tests can spot people who are brewing it. A course of the drug teplizumab is approved to delay the first symptoms, modulating rogue T cells and prolonging insulin production.",
      "Deane studies rheumatoid arthritis and hopes to find a similar way to block the joint-destroying disease.",
      "About 30% of people with a certain self-reactive antibody in their blood will eventually develop RA. A new study tracked some of those people for seven years, mapping immune changes leading to the disease long before joints become swollen or painful.",
      "Those changes are potential drug targets, Deane said. While researchers hunt possible compounds to test, he\u2019s leading another study called StopRA: National to find and learn from more at-risk people.",
      "On all these fronts, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of research left to do \u2014 and no guarantees. There are questions about CAR-T's safety and how long its effects last, but it is furthest along in testing.",
      "Allie Rubin, 60, of Boca Raton, Florida, spent three decades battling lupus, including scary hospitalizations when it attacked her spinal cord. But she qualified for CAR-T when she also developed lymphoma \u2014 and while a serious side effect delayed her recovery, next month will mark two years without a sign of either cancer or lupus.",
      "\u201cI just remember I woke up one day and thought, \u2018Oh my god, I don\u2019t feel sick anymore,\u2019\u201d she said.",

The company also announced that it's planning to invest another billion dollars next year to remodel stores and build new ones, increasing the total cost for the makeover to $5 billion.",
      "Investors have punished Target\u2019s stock recently, sending it down 43% over the past year. Shares edged lower before the opening bell.",
      "Turning around the 19% profit slide in the most recent quarter is the latest challenge to incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke, a 20-year company veteran who is replacing CEO Brian Cornell on Feb. 1. The handover arrives as the retailer tries to reverse a persistent sales malaise and to revive its reputation as the place to go for affordable but stylish products.",
      "Target\u2019s troubles stand in stark contrast to rival Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, which is thriving. Walmart reports on it's most recent quarterly performance Thursday.",
      "Target announced in October that it was eliminating about 1,800 corporate positions in an effort to streamline decision-making and accelerate initiatives to rebuild the flagging customer base. The cuts represent about 8% of Target\u2019s corporate workforce.",
      "To pump up sales, Target is offering more than 20,000 new items, twice as many as last year, and it has lowered prices on thousands of food, beverage and essential items.",

      "With about 1,980 U.S. stores, Target has struggled to find its footing since inflation caused pinched shoppers to curtail their discretionary spending. Customers have complained of messy stores with merchandise that did not reflect the expensive-looking but budget-priced niche that long ago earned the retailer the jokingly posh nickname \u201cTarzhay.\u201d",

      "Internal Pentagon figures show the number of major accidents involving military aircraft spiked in 2024",
      "WASHINGTON -- The number of major accidents involving military aircraft spiked in 2024, internal Pentagon figures show, and a series of high-profile aviation mishaps with deaths and the loss of aircraft in 2025 suggest the disturbing trend may be continuing.",
      "Across the military, the rate of severe accidents per 100,000 flight hours rose 55% in the 2024 budget year compared with four years earlier. The Marine Corps saw the highest increase, nearly tripling its rate over the same period.",
      "The data, which was released by the Defense Department to Congress and provided exclusively to The Associated Press, tracks Class A mishaps \u2014 the most serious accidents, which result in death or a permanent full disability.",
      "An aviation expert noted that broader worsening trends are unlikely the result of a single factor but rather a reflection of multiple smaller issues that accumulate to create an unsafe culture. These issues include increased operational demands, riskier aircraft like the V-22 Osprey and interruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a significant curtailing of flying time across the military.",
      "But the rising number of serious accidents has some in Congress looking for answers.",
      "The data was released to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, in January after her office asked for the figures after a spate of deadly mishaps involving the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft. Warren's office provided the data to the AP, which reviewed it independently.",
      "The statistics cover the full budget years 2020-2023 and then the first 10 months of the 2024 budget year, through July 31. In those 10 months of last year, 25 service members and Defense Department civilian employees were killed and 14 aircraft were destroyed.",
      "\u201cThese accident rates are incredibly troubling and demand action,\" Warren told the AP in an emailed statement. She said legislative changes to make accident reports more accessible \"are desperately needed so Congress can understand the root causes of these accidents to save service member lives.\u201d",
      "The Osprey, which flies like a plane but converts to land like a helicopter, has been among the most dangerous aircraft, as the AP has reported extensively.",
      "In addition, the new Defense Department data shows the Apache helicopter had about 4.5 times the rate of the most serious Class A accidents during the 2024 budget year compared with four years earlier. The C-130 transport plane, a workhorse of the military, nearly doubled its rate over the same period, even as it reported safer years in between.",
      "The Pentagon, when asked about these trends, did not immediately respond.",
      "The Navy's data on just its own aviation mishaps shows a marked increase this year. The Naval Safety Command reported eight Class A aviation mishaps in 2024. In 2025, that total has spiked to 14.",
      "Aviation expert and former military pilot John Nance said the ever-growing demands being placed on military pilots are most likely playing a major part in the growing number of mishaps.",
      "\u201cWhether we\u2019re talking about the end of Afghanistan, whether we talk about deployments to Djibouti, or the back and forth across Saudi Arabia to get to the Emirates, I think that as the pace (of military operations) ticks up, the mishaps are going to tick up,\u201d Nance said.",

      "Investigations found that the Black Hawk helicopter\u2019s altimeter gauge was broken, there were issues with the military pilot's night vision goggles, and the Federal Aviation Administration didn't address warnings about the dangers that helicopters presented in the area around the Washington airport.",

      "Then, in October, a fighter jet and a helicopter based off the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz both crashed into the South China Sea within 30 minutes of each other, though no one was killed.",
      "Nance didn't rule out the possibility that this spike in mishaps is the downstream effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, when military pilots had far less flying time.",

      "FRANCONIA, N.H. -- The closing of a health center in rural New Hampshire has raised concerns that the projected cuts in Medicaid are already taking a toll.",
      "Last month, a site of the Ammonoosuc Community Health Services in Franconia, a town of around 1,000 people, closed for good.",
      "Ammonoosuc officials and a Democratic senator have blamed Medicaid cuts for the closure of the facility that served 1,400 patients from Franconia, Easton, Lincoln and Sugar Hill. These are all tiny communities around the White Mountains, whose patients typically are older and sicker than in other parts of the state.",
      "The closure of the Franconia center reflects the financial struggles facing community health centers and rural health care systems more broadly amid Medicaid cuts and a feared spike in health insurance rates. The government shutdown, which ended last week, was driven by a Democratic demand to extend tax credits, which ensure low- and middle-income people can afford health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, or ACA.",
      "More than 100 hospitals closed over the past decade, according to the Center For Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a policy and advocacy group, and more than 700 more hospitals are at risk of closure. A branch of the HealthFirst Family Care Center, a facility in Canaan, New Hampshire also announced it was closing at the end of October due in part to \u201cchanges in Medicaid reimbursement and federal funding\u201d for these facilities.",
      "On average, the federally-funded community health centers like the one in Franconia are losing money, relying heavily on cash reserves, making service changes and sometimes closing locations to stay afloat, NACHC found. Nearly half have less than 90 days\u2019 cash on hand, according to the association. And the future is even more bleak with at least 2 million community health center patients expected to lose Medicaid coverage by 2034 and 2 million more who are newly uninsured turning to the centers for care.",
      "Ed Shanshala, the CEO of Ammonoosuc, said the Medicaid cuts are to blame for the closure of the Franconia center.",
      "Shanshala runs a network of five health centers in New Hampshire which relies more than $2 million in federal funding \u2014 out of a $12 million budget. He faced a $500,000 shortfall due to the cuts and realized closing Franconia would save about half that money. It also was the only facility where they leased space.",

      "FRANCONIA, N.H. -- For more than two decades, Susan Bushby, a 70-year-old housekeeper from a rural ski town in New Hampshire's White Mountains, took comfort in knowing she only had a short drive to reach the community health center.",
      "The lodgelike medical building, which sits on a hill overlooking town, was like a second home for Bushby and many other patients. The front desk staff knew their names and never missed a chance to celebrate a birthday or anniversary. Staff photos of the wilderness that makes this place such a draw hung on the walls, and bumping into a neighbor in the waiting room was routine.",
      "But last month, this site of the Ammonoosuc Community Health Services in Franconia, a town of around 1,000 people, closed for good.",
      "Officials blamed cuts in Medicaid, the federal program that millions of low-income Americans rely on for health care. The 1,400 patients, almost half of them older and some facing serious health challenges like cancer and early stage dementia, must now drive at least 10 miles (16 kilometers) along rural roads to reach the nearest health center, which also is near a regional hospital. A second center is twice as far.",

These providers are going to see more and more uninsured patients. And that means they\u2019re going to have to make really difficult decisions.\u201d",
      "The sustainability of the centers is critical, because they serve as the nation\u2019s primary care safety net, treating patients regardless of insurance coverage or ability to pay.",
      "Though federally-funded community health centers like the one in Franconia have expanded their reach in recent years, treating 1 in 10 Americans and 1 in 5 rural Americans, they\u2019ve often done so in the face of major financial constraints, according to data from the National Association of Community Health Centers.",

He also expected work requirements in the bill and spikes in health insurance premiums to have an impact.",

We\u2019ll help them with transportation, but it\u2019s clearly a grieving process. Whenever a business leaves a community regardless if it\u2019s health care or something else, there\u2019s an emotional fabric tear.\u201d",
      "The closure has brought little controversy. Just a lot of grief.",
      "Most of the patients come from the small towns of Franconia, Easton, Lincoln and Sugar Hill, communities whose economies rely on hikers, skiers and leaf peepers. Many are older, sicker and more spread out than the rest of the state.",
      "Luce, who volunteers at the local Head Start program and delivers food to schools in Franconia, said the closure has her mostly frustrated with politicians, adding that she wished lawmakers in Washington could \u201cjust live the way regular people live\u201d for a few months.",

Now that Americans have seen how the his plan is being implemented, there are signs that many think he has gone too far.

      "Courthouse arrests are coordinated days in advance to meet quotas with little regard for the particulars of a case, according to several of the U.S. officials.",
      "According to one official, Homeland Security lawyers note on a spreadsheet which cases are \u201camenable\u201d to dismissal, allowing an asylum-seeker to be immediately rearrested and placed in expedited removal proceedings. Most of those detained are men without lawyers who entered the U.S. alone and are expected to appear in court in person. Contrary to Trump's claims that he is targeting the \u2018worst of the worst,\u2019 most don't have a criminal conviction, according to a Cato Institute analysis of ICE data.",
      "ICE reviews the spreadsheet and selects which people it wants to pursue if cases are dismissed. On the hearing date, federal agents communicate directly with DHS lawyers, who act as prosecutors in immigration courts.

The Executive Office for Immigration Review, or EOIR, was created in 1983. But that agency remained a part of the Justice Department, giving the attorney general authority to override decisions.",
      "\u201cWe were a legal Cinderella,\u201d said Dana Leigh Marks, who retired as an immigration judge in 2021 after a 34-year career. \u201cNo other court in the nation functions like this.\u201d",
      "The first Trump administration undertook a series of changes to reduce the case backlog, including instructing judges to deny entire categories of asylum claims such as for victims of gang or domestic violence.",

      "The administration has pushed back against criticism it is co-opting the courts to accelerate its deportation goals. In a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre said DHS decides whether to arrest migrants and that most judges consider it an \u201chonor rather than an insult\u201d to be called an inferior officer empowered by the Constitution and serving at the will of the attorney general.",
      "Baldassarre likened a record surge of asylum seekers during the Biden administration to an \u201cimproper conspiracy between DHS and the Immigration Courts to effectuate an unlawful amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.\u201d The Justice Department, she said, had \"restored the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the Courts.\u201d",

      "Comey has pleaded not guilty to charges accusing him of making a false statement and obstructing Congress and has denied any wrongdoing.

      "Though vindictive prosecution motions are not often successful, Comey's lawyers contend that his case should be dismissed and call it the outgrowth of the president's hunger for retribution against the man who once served as his FBI director.

That night, he said he would appoint Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide with no prior prosecutorial experience, to the job of interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Halligan, who replaced a veteran prosecutor effectively forced from the job after not charging Comey or another Trump foe, New York Attorney General Letitia James, secured an indictment of Comey days later as the statute of limitations on the case was about to expire.",

      "According to court records, Walls broke into the Florida Panhandle mobile home of Eglin Air Force Base airman Edward Alger and his girlfriend, Ann Peterson, in July 1987. Walls tied the couple up, but Alger managed to break free and attack Walls. Walls cut Alger's throat and them shot him in the head when the airman continued to fight. Walls then went to attack Peterson and shot her as she struggled.",
      "Walls was arrested the day after the bodies were found when his roommate tipped off police about Walls' odd behavior. During a search of the home, investigators reported finding items from the crime scene, and Walls later admitted to the killings.",

      "Federal agents are set to conduct a major immigration crackdown called \u201cSwamp Sweep\u201d in New Orleans in the coming weeks",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Around 250 federal border agents are set to descend on New Orleans in the coming weeks for a two-month immigration crackdown dubbed \u201cSwamp Sweep\u201d that aims to arrest roughly 5,000 people across southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press and three people familiar with the operation.",
      "The deployment, which is expected to begin in earnest on Dec. 1, marks the latest escalation in a series of rapid-fire immigration crackdowns unfolding nationwide \u2014 from Chicago to Los Angeles to Charlotte, North Carolina \u2014 as the Trump administration moves aggressively to fulfill the president\u2019s campaign promise of mass deportations.",
      "In Louisiana, the operation is unfolding on the home turf of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, a close Trump ally who has moved to align state policy with the White House\u2019s enforcement agenda. But, as seen in other blue cities situated in Republican-led states, increased federal enforcement presence could set up a collision with officials in liberal New Orleans who have long resisted federal sweeps.",
      "Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander tapped to run the Louisiana sweep, has become the administration\u2019s go-to architect for large-scale immigration crackdowns \u2014 and a magnet for criticism over the tactics used in them. His selection to oversee \u201cSwamp Sweep\u201d signals that the administration views Louisiana as a major enforcement priority for the Trump administration.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the operation. \u201cFor the safety and security of law enforcement we\u2019re not going to telegraph potential operations,\u201d spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.",
      "In Chicago, Bovino drew a rare public rebuke from a federal judge who said he misled the court about the threats posed by protesters and deployed tear gas and pepper balls without justification during a chaotic confrontation downtown. His teams also oversaw aggressive arrest operations in Los Angeles and more recently in Charlotte, where Border Patrol officials have touted dozens of arrests across North Carolina this week after a surging immigration crackdown that has included federal agents scouring churches, grocery stores and apartment complexes.",
      "Planning documents reviewed by the AP show Border Patrol teams preparing to fan out across neighborhoods and commercial hubs throughout southeast Louisiana, stretching from New Orleans through Jefferson, St. Bernard and St. Tammany parishes and as far north as Baton Rouge, with additional activity planned in southeastern Mississippi.",

The people familiar with the matter could not publicly discuss details of the operation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.",
      "To support an operation of that scale, federal officials are securing a network of staging sites: A portion of the FBI\u2019s New Orleans field office has been designated as a command post, while a naval base five miles south of the city will store vehicles, equipment and thousands of pounds of \u201cless lethal\u201d munitions like tear gas and pepper balls, the people said.

Recently, increased media attention has generated more calls to preserve the ship, and a group called the New York Coalition sued in Pensacola federal court asking a judge to halt sinking such a historically significant vessel.",
      "But Okaloosa County officials have said that preventing the SS United States from becoming a reef would only send it to the scrapyard.",
      "The vessel, which is more than 100 feet (30 meters) longer than the RMS Titanic, was once considered a beacon of American thousands of troops. On its maiden voyage, the ship reached an average speed of 36 knots, or just over 41 mph (66 kph), The Associated Press reported from aboard.",
      "The ship crossed the Atlantic Ocean in three days, 10 hours and 40 minutes, besting the RMS Queen Mary\u2019s time by 10 hours. To this day, the SS United States holds the trans-Atlantic speed record for an ocean liner.",

      "BOSTON -- A Massachusetts man remains on trial for murder in the death and dismemberment of his wife after pleading guilty just as jury selection began Tuesday to disposing of her body and misleading police.",
      "Brian Walshe did not plead guilty to killing his wife, Ana Walshe, an immigrant from Serbia who was last seen early on Jan. 1, 2023, following a New Year\u2019s Eve dinner at her Massachusetts home. Her body has never been found. Walshe's first-degree murder trial is still scheduled to move forward, with jury selection continuing on Wednesday.",
      "In 2023, Walshe pleaded not guilty to all three charges against him: first-degree murder, misleading police and willfully conveying a human body in violation of state law. When he appeared in Norfolk Superior Court on Tuesday, he pleaded guilty to the two lesser charges, but not the murder charge.",
      "Prosecutors have said that starting Jan. 1 and for several days after, Brian Walshe made multiple online searches for \u201cdismemberment and best ways to dispose of a body,\u201d \u201chow long before a body starts to smell\u201d and \u201chacksaw best tool to dismember.\u201d",
      "When questioned by investigators, Walshe said his wife had been called back to Washington, D.C., from Massachusetts on New Year\u2019s Day for a work emergency. He didn\u2019t contact her employer until Jan. 4. The company \u2014 the first to notify police that Ana Walshe was missing \u2014 said there was no emergency, prosecutors said.",

      "Prosecutors have also said that Ana Walshe had taken out $2.7 million in life insurance naming her husband as the sole beneficiary.",

    "story": [
      "If you felt a personal connection with a celebrity this year, you likely weren't alone.",
      "That feeling led Cambridge Dictionary to select \"parasocial\" as its 2025 word of the year. Parasocial is defined as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.\"",
      "It's an academic term that has only been around for about 70 years, but it has now become mainstream, said Colin McIntosh, the lexical program manager for Cambridge Dictionary.",
      "\"Millions of people are engaged in parasocial relationships; many more are simply intrigued by their rise,\" McIntosh said in a statement. \"The data reflects that, with the Cambridge Dictionary website seeing spikes in lookups for 'parasocial.'\"",
      "A recent example of this happened when pop star Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce announced their engagement. Many fans who have been captivated by Swift's lyrics for years celebrated the moment despite not actually knowing her or Kelce.",
      "But parasocial relationships can become problematic, Simone Schnall, a professor of experimental social psychology at the University of Cambridge, said.",
      "\"We've entered an age where many people form unhealthy and intense parasocial relationships with influencers,\" Schnall said. \"This leads to a sense that people 'know' those they form parasocial bonds with, can trust them and even to extreme forms of loyalty. Yet it's completely one sided.\"",
      "The trend is also evolving to include artificial intelligence.",
      "\"Parasocial trends take on a new dimension as many people treat AI tools like ChatGPT as 'friends,' offering positive affirmations, or as a proxy for therapy. This is an illusion of a relationship and group think, and we know young people can be susceptible for this,\" Schnall said.",

      "In \"Defying Gravity: The Creative Career of Stephen Schwartz, from Godspell to Wicked\" (published by Applause Books), biographer Carol de Giere explores the life and work of the Grammy- and Oscar-winning composer of treasured Broadway and movie hits.",
      "Read an excerpt below, in which Schwartz finds the inspiration of what will become his most successful musical production to date, when he discovers Gregory Maguire's prequel to L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" \u2013 the genesis of the long-running Broadway musical \"Wicked.\"",
      "And don't miss Mo Rocca's interview with Stephen Schwartz on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 16!",

      "Landing in Oz",
      "\"It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes and leap!\" \u2014Wicked",
      "At the start of 1996, Stephen Schwartz never imagined he would end the year envisioning his next Broadway musical, Wicked. Movie songwriting seemed to be his future, especially after one eventful evening in March. He donned his newly-purchased black tuxedo and white silk dress shirt, strode across the red carpet, and met up with his Pocahontas writing partner Alan Menken at Los Angeles' Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. For forty-eight-year-old Schwartz, being nominated for an Academy Award was a welcome twist on his childhood dream of writing musicals for the stage. With his parents and wife in the audience, he waited for the announcement.",
      "\"And the Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score goes to\u2026\" An expectant silence settled in the hall while presenter Quincy Jones opened the envelope.",
      "\"Alan Menken, musical and orchestral score, and Stephen Schwartz, lyrics, for Pocahontas.\" Applause burst out while the pair made their way to the stage. As Menken thanked their Pocahontas music team, Schwartz clutched his golden statuette and smiled, looking down at Mel Gibson in the front row making funny faces at him and soaking in the acknowledgment from Hollywood. That evening he and Menken also stepped up to accept the award for Best Original Song, \"Colors of the Wind.\"",
      "Back home in Connecticut, he placed his gold-plated statuettes beside his Grammy gramophones in a trophy case converted from an aquarium that his kids no longer used.",
      "The rest of the year was a busy one, with the premiere of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and early work on The Prince of Egypt involving meetings with the DreamWorks team and the writing and demo-ing of songs. He was also working on an early production of a revue musical Snapshots in Seattle, confident that when finally finished, the show would go direct to stock and amateur licensing rather than to a commercial production. The one thing he was emphatically not doing was planning anything new for Broadway.",
      "Then towards the end of the year, a phone call came that would change everything. He was in Los Angeles finishing some work on The Prince of Egypt when his long-time buddy, songwriter John Bucchino, called him from the island of Maui in Hawaii. Singer-songwriter Holly Near had hired Bucchino as a piano accompanist for her performances at a conference at the tropical getaway. Once on Maui, Bucchino decided it was too good not to share. His room included an extra bed, and he had a car and free food. \"If you can cash in some frequent flyer miles and come for the weekend, you'll have a free vacation in Hawaii,\" Bucchino offered.",
      "\"Why not?\" thought Schwartz. He had the weekend free, and after all, it was Hawaii. \"I am so there,\" came Schwartz's answer from LA, and by December 16th, he was.",
      "When Bucchino and Near had a block of time away from the stage, they organized a snorkeling adventure with Schwartz and Near's friend, Pat Hunt. A small boat sped them over to Molikini, a mostly submerged volcanic crater popular for its rainbow spread of sea creatures that delight snorkelers.",
      "On the trip back, Holly casually mentioned to Stephen, \"I'm reading this really interesting book called Wicked, by Gregory Maguire.\"",
      "The novel's title sounded intriguing. \"I think I've heard of it. What's it about?\" he inquired.",
      "\"It's the Oz story from the Wicked Witch of the West's point of view.\"",
      "In an instant, Schwartz's imagination flashed through the implications of a backstory for The Wizard of Oz told from the perspective of the unpopular witch. His reaction was visceral: \"All the hairs on my arms stood on end,\" he recalls. \"I thought it was the best idea for a musical I had ever heard.\"",
      "As soon as he returned to his LA apartment, he called his attorney in New York, inquiring about Maguire's 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. \"Okay, this book has been out for a while, so somebody has the rights. I need you to find out who has them. Meanwhile, I'm going to get the book and read it, because I think I have to do this.\"",
      "There was no way around it. This was a Broadway concept not suited to a small-budget theater company. And he knew it was a highly theatrical idea, not one meant for film or television. Although he had firmly decided, indeed pledged, never to work on Broadway again, his instincts didn't leave him a choice.",
      "But with such a popular novel, surely someone in Hollywood was converting it to the silver screen. Schwartz would have to stop them, and somehow inspire the rights holders to consider instead the risky, expensive, and time-consuming venture of producing a musical in New York City.",
      "While his attorney, Nancy Rose, followed clues on the rights trail, Wicked's prospective composer-lyricist read the novel and confirmed that his hunch had been right: musicalizing the Wicked Witch's story seemed \"quintessentially an idea for me,\" meaningful enough to be worth the potential struggle.",
      "For one thing, he loved looking at traditional stories from a new angle. When he was in college he saw Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Tom Stoppard's play in which two minor characters in Shakespeare's Hamlet are made the central characters. \"It was a revelation to me,\" he recalls. \"From that point on, the idea of looking at familiar material from an unfamiliar point of view became a goal for my own work.\" Godspell had approached the New Testament in a fresh way, Children of Eden reworked Genesis for a new take on family life, and The Prince of Egypt explored the Exodus story from the standpoint of the brother relationship between Moses and Ramses. But Gregory Maguire's twist on The Wizard of Oz was a chance to do something more directly like the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern concept. \"I recognized immediately that this was a genius idea and that it was an idea for me: the way it took a familiar subject and spun it,\" Schwartz recalls.",
      "Wicked also felt inherently musical to him. \"Elphaba is a very musical character with big emotions. She is fantastical. The world is fantastical. Glinda is very musical.\" To him it was clear that the world of musical theater was where the story belonged.",
      "And then there was the character Maguire's vision had moved to the center of the story: Elphaba, the quirky and misunderstood green girl who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Maguire named her after L. Frank Baum, who penned The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, when he pondered the sound of the author's initials \"eL\" \"Fa\" \"Ba.\" Elphaba's story seemed close to Schwartz's own emotional experience. He knew what it felt like to be \"green\" and what inner resources are needed to carry on with life. \"The idea of the story created a sympathetic resonance in me,\" Schwartz affirms, \"and I know that I'm not alone. Anyone who is an artist in our society is going to identify with Elphaba. Anyone who is of an ethnic minority, who is black or Jewish or gay, or a woman feeling she grew up in a man's world, or anyone who grew up feeling a dissonance between who they are inside and the world around them, will identify with Elphaba. Since that's so many of us, I think there will be a lot of people who will.\"",
      "\"There were things that I knew right away. I knew how it was going to begin, I knew how it was going to end, I knew who Elphaba was, and I knew why\u2014 on some strange level\u2014this was autobiographical even though it was about a green girl in Oz.\" \u2014Stephen Schwartz",
      "Schwartz bought a spiral notebook in which he would capture all his story and lyric ideas\u2014snatches of inspiration, research notes, lists of rhyming words, first drafts of lyric lines, and later drafts. On the black cover, the manufacturer's slogan, \"Five Star\u2014In a Class By Itself,\" hinted at what would become of the musical that began as penciled scrawls on the lined pages.",
      "Maguire had created, as the author himself described it, a dense, almost nineteenth-century-type novel that takes place over thirty-eight years and has thirty-eight speaking parts. Could any group of musical collaborators successfully distill these ingredients into a viable evening of theater?",

    "summary": "When the \"Star Trek\" actor and America's favorite astrophysicist share the stage, sparks can fly on an astronomical level. They talk about their bromance built on an appreciation of science and curiosity.",
    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",
      "The universe, it turns out, might be a bit absurd, but what an interesting ride!",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Nov 2025 09:42:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The composer and lyricist behind such hits as \"Godspell,\" \"Pippin\" and \"Wicked\" talks about the price of his early success, and why he almost left composing Broadway musicals for good.",
    "story": [
      "When songwriter Stephen Schwartz sits at the piano, he feels the music. \"When I was a kid and playing my Beethoven \u2026 I would play that bar over and over again, and cry. It's very embarrassing! Beethoven, living in a world that has nothing to do with ours, but he writes, and it speaks to us across the centuries.\"",
      "Schwartz knows a little something about speaking to audiences. He's the composer and lyricist of \"Wicked,\" the blockbuster stage musical-turned-two-part movie musical. Part two, \"Wicked: For Good,\" opens Nov. 21.",
      "The prequel to the classic \"Wizard of Oz,\" \"Wicked\" tells the story of Elphaba (played by Cynthia Erivo), who grows up to be the Wicked Witch of the West. The bubbly Glinda (played by Ariana Grande) becomes the Good Witch of the North.",
      "Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo perform \"Popular,\" from \"Wicked\":",
      "Schwartz has been telling stories through song for over five decades. \"My sort of glib joke where people say, like, how do you write a song? I just say, tell the truth and make it rhyme,\" he said. \"And if I can be honest enough, then that'll speak to other people.\"",
      "\"Wicked\" opened 22 years ago, making it the fourth-longest-running Broadway show in history.",
      "And where was Schwartz on the night of Oct. 30, 2003? \"Well, that was the opening night of 'Wicked' on Broadway, and therefore, I was not at the Gershwin Theatre, because I don't go to my own openings,\" he said. \"It's too nerve-wracking for me. I don't like the opening night parties where everybody is just waiting to hear what reviews come in.\"",
      "Kristin Chenoweth originated the role of Glinda on Broadway. She and Schwartz have reunited for the recently-opened new musical, \"The Queen of Versailles.\" \"I'm working with my Rodgers and Hammerstein; it's just packed into one person,\" she said of Schwartz. \"There's not five of him. There's one. He's original. He's singular. And there's nobody else like him.\"",
      "Schwartz grew up on New York's Long Island. A prodigy, he attended the prestigious Juilliard School as a high schooler. Just after college, he collaborated on the musical that became his first big hit, \"Godspell.\" The musical features a ragtag group who help Jesus tell various parables.",
      "I asked, \"It's a musical with Jesus as a central character. You're a Jewish guy. Did you think, well, alright, I'll give it a go?\"",
      "Schwartz replied, \"I think one of the things that made 'Godspell' work was the fact that I didn't know a lot of those stories. So, I think I came to it with a kind of fresh eye about not preaching to the converted, so to speak.\"",
      "In 1972, Schwartz brought that fresh eye to the story of \"Pippin,\" a young man searching for the meaning of life in the Middle Ages. Hit #3, 1974's \"The Magic Show,\" starred magician Doug Henning. Schwartz was 3-for-3, with all three playing simultaneously on Broadway when he was just 27 \u2013 a theatrical trifecta that Schwartz described as \"very dizzying.\"",
      "\"The truth is, when you are very young and unprepared for a success, it can be difficult to handle,\" he said. \"It was difficult for me to handle. I think I got very, quite full of myself. I got kind of difficult to deal with. I kept thinking, well, why isn't everybody just doing exactly what I say? I lost somewhat the ability to collaborate. You know, it took some failures to kind of learn how to deal with both success and failure.\"",
      "The failures came in short order, a \"four-fecta\" of flops\": \"Working\" (which closed after a month), and 'Rags\" (which closed after four performances), while \"The Baker's Wife\" and \"Children of Eden\" never made it to Broadway.",
      "I noted, \"You haven't always been critic's choice.\"",
      "\"I'm almost never a critic's choice,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Why? \"I have no idea,\" he said. \"I'll be frank about it, you know, I wish I got Steve Sondheim's reviews.\"",
      "\"But listen, as great as he was, his shows didn't run the way yours have.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the grass is always greener,\" Schwartz replied.",
      "In the early 1990s Schwartz stepped away from the piano. Had he quit Broadway? \"Absolutely, a hundred percent,\" he said.",
      "\"Did you worry that you were out of juice?\" I asked.",
      "\"Totally, yeah. And in the '90s, I actually went back to school. I was pursuing a degree in psychology. I was gonna become a therapist.\"",
      "Studying to become a therapist turned out to be quite therapeutic. \"I think that time away reminded me of how to behave myself and how to collaborate and how to deal with other people, and not just come in like a bull in a china shop,\" he said.",
      "When he returned to songwriting, it was not for Broadway, though, but for Hollywood, writing songs for \"Pocahontas,\" \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" \"Enchanted,\" and music and lyrics for \"The Prince of Egypt.\" He picked up three Academy Awards along the way.",
      "\"The Colors of the Wind,\" from \"Pocahontas\":",
      "But Stephen Schwartz's home will always be the stage. \"I feel so blessed and so fortunate that work I've done has this ongoing life that I know is gonna keep going when I'm not here on this planet anymore,\" he said. \"Listen, I'm 77 years old, and they still let me do this!\"",

    "story": [
      "The Vatican shared the spotlight with Hollywood on Saturday as Pope Leo XIV hosted dozens of stars, including Cate Blanchett, Spike Lee and Monica Bellucci for a special audience celebrating the power of cinema.",
      "The event, organized by the Vatican's culture ministry, took place in a frescoed Vatican audience hall. Leo called on the attending artists to use their art to include marginalized voices and praised film to console and challenge audiences.",
      "\"It articulates the questions that dwell within us, and sometimes, even provokes tears that we did not know we needed to express,\" Leo said.",
      "The first U.S.-born pope also acknowledged the financial difficulties facing movie theaters. He said institutions should not give up, but \"cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value\" of theaters, drawing applause from the audience.",
      "\"His speech was beautiful and very inspiring, about hope and our work in cinema. We're glad we came,\" said Judd Apatow, who attended the audience with his wife and fellow Hollywood star Leslie Mann.",
      "\"It was so inspiring,\" Mann added.",
      "Leo spent nearly an hour greeting guests and making conversation with each attendee. Lee, a basketball lover, gifted the pontiff a New York Knicks jersey that featured the No. 14 and Leo's name on the back. Leo may be a known Chicago Bulls fan, but Lee said he told the pope that the Knicks' current roster includes three players from Villanova University, the Holy Father's alma mater. Lee said Leo's words about film were \"very, very moving.\"",
      "Pope Francis held similar audiences with artists and comedians. The audiences are part of the Vatican's efforts to reach out beyond the Catholic Church to engage with the secular world.",

Earlier this week, he listed his four favorite movies: \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"The Sound of Music,\" \"Ordinary People,\" and \"Life Is Beautiful,\" all classics that celebrate love and hope in the face of darkness. Leo will also be the subject of his own movie, a documentary from the Vatican that traces his life from Chicago to St. Peter's.",
      "\"He is a pope who grew up with television and grew up with cinema, and it's a natural (medium) to tell his story,\" said Monsignor Paul Tighe, the Vatican's culture secretary, in a conversation with CBS Saturday Morning.",
      "Tighe said the large group of filmmakers and actors was pulled together during the last three months. Vatican officials used contacts in Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese, to help craft the list of attendees. The hardest part, Tighe said, was convincing Hollywood agents that the invitation wasn't a hoax. Tighe told CBS Saturday Morning that he hopes the event shows that the Church embraces the arts, instead of just tolerating them.",
      "\"We have to trust that the artist, even when he or she is being provocative, is trying to wake us up, grab our attention, and make us think about things that are important,\" Tighe said.",

      "Wen was charged with \"being a public nuisance,\" Singapore court documents posted online showed. Wen represented himself and said he would plead guilty, according to the documents. He is to appear in court again on Monday.",
      "Viral video clips show the man wrapping around a shocked Grande before he jumps up and down and waves to the crowd. Grande's co-star Cynthia Erivo then rushes to her defense, jumping between Wen and Grande and shoving him away. He was then grabbed by security guards and put back over the barricade. Footage shows Erivo and others on the red carpet comforting Grande.",
      "After the incident, Wen shared video on Instagram and thanked Grande for \"letting (him) jump on the Yellow Carpet\" with her.",
      "If sentenced, Wen faces a $1,500 fine, three months in jail, or both.",
      "Singapore's public prosecutions office could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "The movie launch went ahead on Thursday night. \"Wicked: For Good\" will be released in the United States on Nov. 21.",
      "Grande and Erivo have been inseparable during the movie musical's press tours. In December 2024, Erivo told \"CBS Mornings\" that the duo made a pact early in production to take care of and support each other.",
      "\"Before we started shooting both of us had a conversation about making sure that we would take care of each other and make the space that we needed for each other, and take, you know, give each other what we needed, be generous with each other in this thing, because we knew it was a big undertaking,\" Erivo said. \"We knew we had a big responsibility, but we knew neither of us could really do that alone.\"",
      "Grande, 32, began her career as a teen on Broadway before embarking on a hugely successful pop career. At perhaps the height of her meteoric pop fame in 2017, one of her concerts was bombed. The Manchester Arena attack killed 22 people, wounded more than 1,000 and left Grande with PTSD.",

    "story": [
      "A New Jersey man is the first person believed to have died from a so-called meat allergy triggered by a tick bite, researchers say.",
      "The man died in September 2024, but\u00a0researchers just recently linked the death to the allergy, known as alpha-gal syndrome, or AGS.",
      "According to experts, the bite of a Lone Star tick can lead an individual to develop a sensitivity or allergy to alpha galactose, a carbohydrate found in red meat and dairy products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says AGS\u00a0can cause hives, nausea, stomach pain, breathing issues and swelling.",
      "Man died several hours after eating hamburger at barbecue",
      "According to researchers, a 47-year-old New Jersey man went on a camping trip with his wife and children in summer 2024, and after spending the day outdoors, they had beef steak for dinner. About four hours later, researchers say the man experienced severe abdominal discomfort, diarrhea and vomiting that lasted about two hours.",
      "The man apparently felt better the following morning, but when discussing what had happened with his family, he allegedly said, \"I thought I was going to die.\" However, he decided not to consult a doctor about the symptoms, researchers say.",
      "About two weeks later, researchers say the man attended a barbecue where he ate a hamburger. About four hours after eating, the man was found unconscious on the bathroom floor with vomit around him. He was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead several hours later.",
      "The man's name was not released, nor was the location he went camping.",
      "Postmortem blood test reveals allergic reaction to alpha-gal",
      "The man's death was ruled a \"sudden unexplained death,\" but his wife asked a friend in the medical field to review the autopsy report. The doctor contacted researchers in Virginia to look into the possible role of AGS.",
      "Earlier this year, the man's blood was tested, and researchers say it was determined he had suffered an allergic reaction to alpha-gal consistent with fatal anaphylaxis.",
      "The man's wife said that earlier in the summer, he had gotten about a dozen bug bites around his ankles believed to be from Lone Star tick larvae.",
      "According to researchers, this is \"the first documented anaphylactic death related to AGS where the symptoms started several hours after consuming mammalian meat.\"",
      "Doctors want to raise awareness of alpha-gal syndrome",
      "The researchers argue more public education on AGS is necessary, considering the increased presence of Lone Star ticks in northern states and the fact that abdominal pain is not widely recognized as a possible symptom of an allergic reaction.",
      "\"Although this is very, very uncommon\u2013 what happened to him is not likely to happen to other people. I'm not afraid of that,\" said Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills with UVA Health. \"But they should know about it.\"",
      "\"If they start noticing they're developing abdominal pain, rashes after eating red meat, they should talk to their physicians about the possibility that they've been sensitized to this specific carbohydrate within red meat,\" said Dr. Suraj Saggar, chief of infectious disease at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, \"and understand that if they continue to eat it, there is at least the potential for having a very serious and even fatal reaction.\"",
      "Experts say people who live in areas where Lone Star ticks are common, like New York and New Jersey, should do what they can to avoid tick bites.",
      "\"With the changing seasons, the warming of our climate, these ticks are increasing in their numbers. The potential exposures are increasing,\" Saggar said. \"People should take all the precautions they can to protect [from] tick bites.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 11:38:26 -0500",
    "summary": "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries called GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene an\u00a0ally during the shutdown for joining Democrats in demanding that Congress address high health care costs.",
    "story": [
      "Like many of her Democratic colleagues, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is urging Congress to act quickly to address the spiraling cost of health care for millions of Americans who could soon see huge spikes in their insurance premiums.",
      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview Friday. \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",
      "About 22 million lower- and middle-income Americans rely on the tax credits to reduce their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. During the longest government shutdown in history, Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but the shutdown ultimately ended Wednesday without a deal to extend the tax credits. Democrats were promised, however, that a vote on the tax credits will be held next month.",
      "But House Democrats took notice of Greene's views on health care. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, asked by \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson if he had found any Republican allies during the 43-day impasse, replied,\"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "\"She's been very clear that this health care crisis is not made up, it's real, Republicans have no health care plan, and that Democrats are correct in fighting to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries continued.",
      "And top Republicans noticed, too. Earlier this week, President Trump said of Greene after she criticized him for focusing on foreign policy, rather than high prices at home, \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie \u2014 nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"",
      "\"I haven't lost my way \u2014 I'm for the American people only,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I am America first and I make no apologies about that to anyone.\" But she added that the rapidly rising health insurance costs had affected her personally.",
      "\"As far as health insurance is concern it hurt my own family. Back in 2010, the Democrats passed Obamacare, and in 2014 when it went into effect my family's health insurance went from $800 to over $2,400 a month, and we've seen the health insurance industry prices just go up and up,\" Greene said.",
      "\"I see simply that the American people have been done wrong, and I want my party to produce a solution and a plan that fixes this mess once and for all,\" Greene said. \"And so that is what I've been urging here in Washington, and I really hope to see Republicans and Democrats both work together to come up with a very good solution with health care for the American people.\"",

    "summary": "In some metro areas, child care expenses amount to more than double what families spend on rent, LendingTree found.",
    "story": [
      "As child care costs soar, many Americans today find themselves paying more for a caregiver than they do for their monthly rent, according to a new analysis.",
      "Child care costs for parents with two kids exceed rental costs in 85 of the country's largest metro areas, personal finance site\u00a0LendingTree found. In Omaha, Neb., Milwaukee, Wis., and Buffalo, N.Y., which have the highest child care costs in the country relative to local rents, families with an infant and a 4-year-old under care on average pay more than double the cost of their rent.",
      "Families around the U.S. pay an average of $1,282 for full-time infant care, still below the average monthly cost to rent a two-bedroom unit, LendingTree's data shows. Families with two children, on the other hand, spend an average of $2,252 per month on child care.",
      "LendingTree, which determined how child care costs stack up against rent in 100 cities. compiled its findings using data from nonprofit group Child Care Aware of America and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Exorbitant child care costs are contributing to what amounts to a crisis of affordability for many Americans, who also face rising food, housing,\u00a0energy and\u00a0health care costs. A\u00a0survey\u00a0of roughly 3,000 people released this week by Brigham Young University and Deseret News found that 7 in 10 respondents said that raising children is unaffordable, a sentiment that has surged over the last decade.",
      "One parent facing a child care crunch is New York City resident Gina Monroe, who started sending her son to day care in September.",
      "\"Having to have a household with both parents working and a grandmother that was getting too old to take care of a two-year-old, you don't have a choice,\" she told CBS News.",
      "The 42-year-old said she pays $450 a week to send her son to a day care center on nearby Long Island. That's less than her monthly mortgage payment of $3,200, but still represents one of her family's biggest expenses, she said.",
      "The financial strain of everyday life in the U.S., especially following the fierce inflation that erupted during the pandemic, has emerged as a political flashpoint this year.",
      "For example, the Trump administration has in recent weeks floated several ideas aimed at easing costs for Americans, including proposals for a\u00a0$2,000 tariff rebate check\u00a0and a 50-year mortgage. The administration also last week\u00a0announced tariff exemptions on some popular grocery store staples, including bananas, beef and coffee, as Americans continue to battle elevated food costs.",
      "Incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani also made issues around affordability the centerpiece of his campaign, urging city officials to establish free child care for children ages 6 weeks to 5 years old.",
      "Why are child care costs soaring?",
      "Child care expenses have been rising steadily for years, and show little sign of relenting. From 2020 to 2024, costs rose nearly 30%, data from the nonprofit group Child Care Aware shows.",
      "The main driver for that surge, according to experts: a shortage of early education workers and available places at daycare centers, relative to the enormous demand for such services from families around the U.S.",
      "To that end, Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, pointed to what he described as \"child care deserts\" in some regions, where parents face a dearth of acceptable options. These are most common in low-income rural areas, which have difficulty recruiting and retaining a qualified workforce, a 2023 government report found.",
      "Where high-quality child care is in short supply, the owners can charge a premium given they face little competition, Schulz noted.",
      "Many households also don't have the benefit of having nearby family members who can help with child care responsibilities, Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy group for American families, told CBS News.",
      "\"What we actually need are policies that recognize the modern realities of working families and what the true cost of raising children in America actually is right now,\" she said.",

Many of the messages were from the late 2010s, well after Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida, but before he was charged with sex trafficking in federal court and taken into custody in July 2019.",
      "The exchanges between Summers and Epstein include one in which they appeared to banter about a woman Summers knew in London, with Epstein seeming to offer him advice.",

    "summary": "Facing pressure from states and families, Roblox will require players to use AI-powered technology that helps verify their age.",
    "story": [
      "Roblox, the popular online gaming platform that hosts millions of user-created games, said Tuesday it is strengthening protections for minors.",
      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age. The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",
      "Roblox in September outlined plans to expand age checks for all users who want to access communication features on the gaming platform. The guardrails are meant to limit communication between adults and minors unless they already know each other in the real world.",

      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",

      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",

    "summary": "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",

      "Impending layoff notices across much of the U.S. surged in October, highlighting signs of stress in the job market.",
      "Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland shows that 39,006 Americans last month in 21 states received a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN, notice informing them of an upcoming layoff. U.S. labor law requires employers to provide these written warnings 60 days ahead of plant closings or mass layoffs.",
      "It represents one of the highest numbers of WARN notices since Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland researchers started tracking the data in January 2006, although the tally remains below the spikes recorded during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic.",

      "Despite the lack of official government data, some other measures point to a cooling U.S. labor market. For example, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas recently said that layoffs last month\u00a0soared to their highest October level in 22 years, while\u00a0ADP data\u00a0released Tuesday shows U.S. companies shed an average of 2,500 jobs per week in the four weeks ending Nov. 1.",

      "The S&P 500 remains up more than 12% this year, the Dow has added 8% and the Nasdaq has risen more than 15%.",
      "AI pioneer Nvidia was again the heaviest weight on the market.

      "\"Stocks are extending their losses so far on [Tuesday] as sentiment stays downbeat and investors continue to dial back on tech exposure,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a research note.",
      "What Nvidia does matters disproportionately to investors because it's the most influential stock on Wall Street. It can almost single-handedly steer the direction of the S&P 500 on some days because of its immense size, after fervent demand for its AI chips helped it briefly top $5 trillion in total value. The S&P 500 sits at the heart of many investors' 401(k) accounts.",
      "\"The boost AI has given to the U.S. stock market since the launch of ChatGPT has been so strong that the S&P 500 would currently be closer to 5,000 without it,\" John Higgins, chief markets economist with Capital Economics, said in a note to investors. \"It's therefore hardly surprising that investors are preoccupied with whether the gains racked up by titans in the sectors at the heart of this transformative technology can be sustained.\"",
      "Nvidia's and the U.S. stock market's struggles are a sharp turnaround from months of relentless rallying since April, when Wall Street sold off after President Donald Trump shocked the world with stiff tariffs.",
      "That rally, though, was so strong that critics said it may have carried stock prices too high, too fast and left the market at risk of a sharp drop. They pointed in particular to stocks swept up in the mania around AI.",
      "Despite Wall Street's recent stumble, many big investors expect stocks to recover, according to the latest monthly survey of global fund managers by Bank of America Global Research. But when asked what the No. 1 risk for the market is, one with a lower probability of happening but a high chance of damage, 45% pointed to an AI bubble. That beat out trouble in the bond market, inflation and trade wars.",
      "The highest net percentage of investors in 20 years is also saying companies are \"overinvesting,\" according to the survey. The worry is that all the investment pouring into AI chips and data centers worldwide may not produce the kind of revolution that proponents have been predicting, or at least not as profitable a one.",
      "Other high-flying areas of the market with their own evangelists have also been struggling lately. Bitcoin's price briefly fell below $90,000 during the morning, down from nearly $125,000 last month.",

      "On Sunday, Chinese coast guard vessels spent several hours in Japan's territorial waters around the disputed Senkaku Islands, known as the Diaoyu in China and a frequent flashpoint, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said.",

      "Beijing insists Taiwan \u2014 which Japan occupied for decades until its 1945 defeat in World War II \u2014   is part of its territory, and the prime minister's comments have sparked outrage among Chinese officials.",
      "Japanese leader's controversial remarks about China and Taiwan",
      "Before taking power last month, Prime Minister Senae Takaichi, 64, was a vocal critic of China and its military build-up in the Asia-Pacific.",
      "If a Taiwan emergency entails \"battleships and the use of force, then that could constitute a situation threatening the survival (of Japan),\" she told parliament on Nov. 7. Under Japan's self-imposed domestic rules, an existential threat is one of the few cases where it can act militarily. Taiwan sits around 60 miles from the nearest Japanese island.",
      "In response to Takaichi's remarks, a Chinese diplomat stationed in Japan threatened to \"cut off that dirty neck,\" apparently referring to Takaichi, as China and Japan summoned each other's ambassadors.",
      "In Beijing, tech worker Daniel Feng called the Chinese government's responses \"very restrained\" given Takaichi's \"extremely unreasonable\" remarks.",
      "\"If she spouts words, that's not a problem ... but if they take real action, our country's military will definitely defeat them,\" the 40-year-old told AFP.",

      "Economic impact as Asian economic giants feud",
      "Beijing also advised its citizens over the weekend to avoid traveling to Japan, and warned the roughly 100,000 Chinese students in the country that there were alleged risks to their safety.",

      "Japan was also the fourth-most popular destination for Chinese tourists last year, helping the land of Mount Fuji, sushi and geishas set new records for foreign arrivals. But in fears that this may now stop, investors wiped 9% off Japanese cosmetics firm Shiseido's market value on Monday.",
      "Department store group Mitsukoshi fell 11.3% and Pan Pacific, behind discount retail chain and tourist magnet Don Quijote, slid 5.3%.",
      "Japan Airlines, whose shares nosedived 3.4%, has not seen any major cancellations on flights to and from China, a spokesperson told AFP.",
      "CBS News foreign correspondent Anna Coren reports that, apart from tourism there are concerns in Japan that China could inflict more economic pain by weaponizing its dominance in the supply chains of rare earth and other critical minerals, both of which are vital to Japan's electronics and automotive industries.",
      "Even Japan's film industry has been affected. Two movies due for release in China have been suspended.",
      "No off-ramp in sight for China and Japan's feud",
      "In response to the fallout, Coren said Japan on Tuesday urged its citizens in China to take precautions, including avoiding crowds and watching for suspicious people. Last year, a Japanese schoolboy was fatally stabbed in southern China.",
      "The tit-for-tat warnings from both capitals have fueled concern about nationalism being whipped up, and Coren said there was no apparent off-ramp available to ease tension. Japan sent a senior diplomat to Beijing for talks on Tuesday, but there was no announcement of any significant progress to ease the bilateral standoff.",
      "During the daily briefing on Tuesday at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a spokesman demanded that Japan \"immediately retract its erroneous remarks, engage in profound self-reflection, change course, and provide the Chinese people with a clear explanation\" of Takaichi's comments.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:18:14 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump floated the idea of tapping his administration's tariff revenue to send checks to most Americans.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Nov. 9 said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a\u00a0Truth Social post last week. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later\u00a0told Fox News that the rebates would likely be given to families making \"less than, say, $100,000.\"\u00a0 That threshold is still in discussion, he added.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "Speaking from the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump said his administration plans on issuing dividends from tariffs \"probably in the middle of next year.\"\u00a0He said \"thousands of dollars\" would go to \"moderate income, middle income\" Americans, adding that his administration has taken in \"tremendous amounts of money\" from tariffs.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "Bessent on Nov. 9 told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending new tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",

      "The full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security is calculated using a worker's birth year, while their monthly benefits are based on the number of years they've worked and their income over that period. People may claim Social Security as early as age 62, but doing so permanently reduces their monthly benefit by about 30% compared with waiting until hitting their FRA.",
      "Starting in 2026, Social Security's full retirement age is set to make its final scheduled increase, marking the last step-up in age enacted under a\u00a01983 congressional reform\u00a0designed to shore up the program's finances. Before that overhaul, people could claim their FRA benefits at 65, but the law gradually pushed that age higher, culminating in the change that takes effect in 2026.",
      "Since 2021, the FRA has been rising by two months each year. It now stands at 66 years and 10 months for people born in 1959. Next year brings the final step in that schedule, when the FRA will reach 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later.",
      "With the FRA hitting 67, people born in 1960 won't qualify for their full benefits until 2027, rather than 2026. (You can check your own full-benefit age by entering your birthdate into this Social Security calculator.)",
      "The increase in the FRA will first impact the youngest baby boomers, or those born between 1960-1964, followed by Generation X, which spans 1965 to 1980. The change comes as many workers report feeling financially unprepared for retirement, with only about four in 10 Americans saying they're on track to maintain their current lifestyle in retirement,\u00a0according\u00a0to recent research from Vanguard.",
      "\"Raising the retirement age is an effective cut in lifetime benefits for younger baby boomers, members of Gen X and all the generations after,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the advocacy group National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, in an email to CBS News.",
      "While the increase in the full retirement age shouldn't come as a surprise given it was enacted 43 years ago, it doesn't guarantee older workers will be any more prepared financially for retirement, he added.",
      "\"Having time to plan, however, does not mean they have been able to put aside more for retirement, considering the stagnation of real wages and the rising cost of college tuition, home prices and other key living expenses,\" Richtman said.",
      "Retirement expectations versus reality",
      "There's also a longstanding gap between the age at which people expect to stop working and their real-world experiences, which can add to the financial strain of funding retirement. Many Americans believe they'll retire at age 65, but the median retirement age in the U.S. is in fact 62.",
      "Nearly six in 10 retirees say they stepped back from the workforce earlier than they had planned, according to research published last year by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. An October survey from the same group found that most middle-class retirees \u2014 people with annual household incomes between $50,000 and $199,999 \u2014 stopped working earlier than they envisioned because of employment issues, such as losing their jobs, or poor health.",
      "That gap between expectations and reality may explain recent research that found 44% of Americans said they plan to claim Social Security before they\u00a0reach their full retirement age, which would result in lower monthly benefits.",
      "Some Americans also flle for Social Security before reaching their FRA out of a belief it makes more sense to bank more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower monthly amount.",
      "Transamerica also found that nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore the conventional financial advice of\u00a0waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits, which locks in a 24% boost to a retiree's FRA payments.",
      "In the meantime, younger boomers and Gen Xers will have to hold off a little longer to claim their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"These younger cohorts will have to try their best to plan for retirement, knowing that they cannot collect full benefits until 67,\" Richtman added.",

      "Artificial intelligence can save you money preparing that Thanksgiving Day feast.",
      "Just tell an AI chatbot such as ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft Co-Pilot how many guests you're expecting, provide information on any dietary restrictions and outline your budget. The tools will help compare prices at different stores, and can even offer step-by-step instructions on how to prepare a Thanksgiving meal, as well as outline different recipes for various dishes.",
      "For example, Microsoft Co-Pilot lets users take photos of specific products and then ask questions about the product, like \"where can I find the best deal on this boxed stuffing?\" or \"how many boxes of this stuffing will I need to feed 10 people?\" The chatbot will offer suggestions based on those prompts, help shoppers buy the appropriate amount of ingredients and stay on budget by pointing to any cheaper options at local stores.",
      "Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst who goes by \"The SupermarketGuru,\" said smart shoppers can feed guests this holiday season for under $6 a person.",
      "AI is one tool consumers can use to ensure they're getting the best deals and to keep their holiday budgets under control. This year, shoppers can expect to spend roughly $80 to $95 \u2014 or $8 to $9.50 per person \u2014 preparing Thanksgiving dinner, according to a recent Wells Fargo analysis.",
      "That's about 2% to 3% less this year compared with Turkey Day costs in 2024, the bank found. Consumers are catching a break on foods such as bread, butter, eggs and wine, while the cost of staples such as potatoes, milk and some vegetables has remained flat or risen only modestly, according to the CBS News price tracker.",
      "As for the star ingredient, turkey, wholesale prices have jumped about 40% since last year, from 94 cents a pound to $1.32, according to the Department of Agriculture. However, wholesale costs don't always mean higher store prices. Wells Fargo found that retail prices for turkey are down 3.7% from a year ago.",
      "Retailers are also making it easier for shoppers to save money and time by offering budget-friendly Thanksgiving dinner packages. Target offers a dinner option that serves four people for $20, while Amazon provides a similar package that feeds five for $25. Each bundle includes a turkey, along with ingredients for classic sides such as stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy and bread.",
      "For larger gatherings, Walmart and ALDI also have $40 meal baskets designed to serve up to 10 people.",

    "story": [
      "A growing share of lower-income Americans are struggling to get by financially as their wages fail to keep up with inflation, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Roughly 29% of lower-income households are living paycheck to paycheck, up slightly from 2024 and from 27.1% in 2023, data from the Bank of America Institute shows. The financial firm defines that as spending more than 95% of household income on necessities such as housing, gasoline, groceries, utility bills and internet service.",
      "In 2025, nearly a quarter of all U.S. households lived paycheck to paycheck, Bank of America estimates. Several factors explain why many people are falling behind.",
      "First, the nation's inflation rate this year has edged up to an annual rate of 3%\u00a0after dipping to 2.3% in April. The rise in consumer prices this year is well below their pandemic-era peak of 9.1% in 2022, but remains above the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%.",
      "\"Inflation is picking back up again, and cost increases are picking back up again,\" said Joe Wadford, an economist at the Bank of America Institute, which recently\u00a0examined\u00a0the financial pressures facing Americans by income. \"That's definitely going to put some renewed pressure on those households.\"",
      "Second, the cost of groceries and other essentials is continuing to rise as lower-wage workers see their paychecks and purchasing power stagnate. In October, wages for lower-income households were up only 1% from a year ago, according to Bank of America deposit data.",
      "\"The gap between their wages and expenses has just continued to widen since the beginning of the year,\" Wadford said. \"When the cost of living is increasing 3% but your wages are only increasing 1%, you're just going to really struggle to keep up.\"",
      "Lower-wage workers experienced strong wage growth during the pandemic and subsequent economic recovery, but that rise has slowed sharply since late 2022, according to Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. One factor weighing on wage growth \u2014 a decline in job openings and the rate at which workers are leaving their jobs.",
      "\"When people aren't looking for other offers or quitting, that is going to cause wage growth to slow,\" she said.",
      "In the trailing 12 months through October, higher-income millennial households have seen their average wages grow five percentage points faster than those of lower-income millennials, according to the Bank of America Institute.",
      "While lower-income households are struggling to scrape by, middle- and higher-income households are on firmer financial footing, buoyed by stronger wage growth. This group has seen little to no increase in the share of households living paycheck to paycheck, the Bank of America Institute found.",
      "\"These higher-income cohorts are more able to absorb the recent reacceleration in inflation due to their outsized wage growth,\" Wadford wrote in the report.",
      "That bifurcation is fueling what economists refer to as the \"K-shaped economy,\" a term experts use to describe the divergence in spending and financial health between wealthier Americans and people with more modest incomes.",
      "Gould also noted that many low-income Americans are unbanked and that Bank of America's findings, which are drawn from an analysis of its depositor data, may not fully capture the impact of slowing wage growth on poor households.",
      "\"You're missing some of the bottom end and how much pain [and] economic distress they may be feeling,\" she said.",

But he said the Dublin, Ohio-based company is likely to close in the \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its 6,011 U.S locations, or roughly 300 store closures if it shuts 5% of its existing restaurants.",
      "Wendy's said the closures will start in the fourth quarter this year. Closing underperforming locations will improve traffic and profitability at its remaining U.S. restaurants, Cook added.",
      "Fast-food chains have been struggling to lift sales as lower-income consumers feel increasingly squeezed by rising food costs. Both Wendy's and McDonald's have introduced value meals to entice diners, but Cook said he doesn't expect the financial strain on these households to ease soon.",
      "\"We do see more pressure on the lower-income consumer,\" he said Friday. \"We continued to see that in [the third quarter] and we expect that to continue into the fourth.\"",
      "The new round of closures comes on top of the closure of 140 U.S. Wendy's locations in 2024. At the time, Wendy's said that many of the 55-year-old chain's restaurants are simply out of date.",
      "Cook became Wendy's CEO in July after the company's previous CEO, Kirk Tanner, left to become the president and CEO of Hershey Co.",

      "\"When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective. The goal is to address and fix those restaurants,\" Cook said during a conference call with investors.",
      "In the first nine months of this year, Wendy's said its U.S. same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 4% compared to the same period last year. Wendy's revenue fell 2% to $1.63 billion in the same period, while its net income fell 6% to $138.6 million.",
      "Cook said $5 and $8 meal deals \u2014 which have been matched by McDonald's \u2014 have helped bring some traffic back to its U.S. stores.

    "story": [
      "A record 81.8 million Americans are set to travel during the Thanksgiving holiday, with about 90% planning to drive to their destinations, according to a new forecast from AAA.",
      "Compared with the Thanksgiving holiday a year earlier, an additional 1.6 million people are predicted to travel more than 50 miles from their homes between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, the automobile group said. That would represent a new record for Turkey Day travel, which has rebounded since dipping to 56.8 million travelers in 2020, when the pandemic caused people to cancel their plans.",
      "Despite the disruption to air travel during the longest-running government shutdown in U.S. history, which ended Nov. 12, AAA projects that about 6.1 million Americans will fly during Thanksgiving week, up 2% from a year earlier. Flight cancellations have dropped since the end of the shutdown, which had prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to throttle air traffic at dozens of busy airports due to a shortage of air traffic controllers.",
      "On Sunday, the FAA said it was lifting all restrictions on commercial flights, allowing airlines to resume their regular schedules beginning Monday at 6 a.m. EST.",
      "Still, some travelers may opt to drive this year rather than fly due to the recent flight disruptions caused by the shutdown, AAA said.",
      "\"A lot of air travelers have been taking a wait-and-see approach to Thanksgiving and riding out the recent cancellations and recent reductions in the hopes their flight will be okay come Thanksgiving week,\" AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz told CBS News' Kris Van Cleave.",
      "About 73 million people plan to drive to their Thanksgiving destinations this year, a 1.3 million increase from the same period in 2024. The busiest pick-up day for car rentals is expected to be Wednesday, Nov. 26, according to car rental agency Hertz.",
      "Some drivers could get a financial break this year, with domestic car rentals 15% cheaper this Thanksgiving versus a year earlier, AAA said. Gasoline is about the same price as last year, with the average per-gallon cost at about $3.07, AAA data shows. The group recommends that drivers fill up the night before they leave for their Thanksgiving trips.",

    "summary": "The Federal Aviation Administration says it is lifting all restrictions on commercial flights that were imposed during the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said Sunday it was lifting all restrictions on commercial flights that were imposed at 40 major airports during the country's longest government shutdown.",
      "Airlines were given permission to resume their regular flight schedules beginning Monday at 6 a.m. EST, the agency said.",
      "The announcement was made in a joint statement by Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford.",
      "Citing safety concerns as staffing shortages grew at air traffic control facilities during the shutdown, the FAA issued an unprecedented order to limit traffic in the skies. It had been in place since Nov. 7, affecting thousands of flights across the country.",
      "Impacted airports included large hubs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta.",
      "The flight cuts started at 4% and later grew to 6% before the FAA on Friday rolled the restrictions back to 3%, citing continued improvements in air traffic controller staffing since the record 43-day shutdown ended on Nov. 12.",
      "The number of flights canceled this weekend was at its lowest point since the order took effect and was well below the 3% cuts FAA was requiring for Saturday and Sunday. Data from aviation analytics firm Cirium showed that less than 1% of all flights were canceled this weekend. The flight tracking website FlightAware said 149 flights were cut Sunday and 315 were canceled on Saturday.",
      "The FAA statement said an agency safety team recommended the order be rescinded after \"detailed reviews of safety trends and the steady decline of staffing-trigger events in air traffic control facilities.\"",
      "The statement said the FAA \"is aware of reports of non-compliance by carriers over the course of the emergency order. The agency is reviewing and assessing enforcement options.\" It did not elaborate.",
      "Cancellations hit their highest point Nov. 9, when airlines cut more than 2,900 flights because of the FAA order, ongoing controller shortages and severe weather in parts of the country. Conditions began to improve throughout last week as more controllers returned to work amid news that Congress was close to a deal to end the shutdown. That progress also prompted the FAA to pause plans for further rate increases.",
      "The agency had initially aimed for a 10% reduction in flights. Duffy had said worrisome safety data showed the move was necessary to ease pressure on the aviation system and help manage worsening staffing shortages at air traffic control facilities as the shutdown entered its second month and flight disruptions began to pile up.",
      "Air traffic controllers were among the federal employees who had to continue working without pay throughout the shutdown. They missed two paychecks during the impasse.",
      "Duffy hasn't shared the specific safety data that prompted the cuts, but he cited reports during the shutdown of planes getting too close in the air, more runway incursions and pilot concerns about controllers' responses.",
      "Airline leaders have expressed optimism that operations would rebound in time for the Thanksgiving travel period after the FAA lifted its order.",

    "story": [
      "Businesses face a tough decision this holiday season: Run a Black Friday promotion and see their profits drop, or charge full price and risk turning off buyers.",
      "Some business owners said sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports are raising their costs, giving them less room to roll out aggressive holiday sales.",
      "Lisa Cheng Smith, founder of Yun Hai Taiwanese Pantry, a New York City-based retailer that imports products from businesses and farms in Taiwan, said her costs have jumped 20% to 50% this year from 2024 because of U.S. tariffs on imports from Taiwan and other Asian countries.",
      "In past years, Yun Hai has offered a 15% Black Friday discount as a way to drive holiday purchases, with Cheng Smith telling CBS News that the annual promotion \"is a really important thing for us.\" This year, however, she's unsure how much of a discount she can afford to offer, given her higher operational costs resulting from tariffs.",
      "\"It's complicated because of tariffs and how the retail math works,\" Cheng Smith said. \"Do we offer less of a discount and try to preserve margins, or do we use the same promotion language and structures that customers have come to expect?\"",
      "For small business owners, such calculations can make all the difference, she added. \"What we do from October through December is equal to the whole rest of the year in terms of sales, so every day is more high stakes,\" she noted.",
      "Retail experts said higher tariff costs for retailers and other businesses could mean fewer, and paltrier, Black Friday discounts this year.",
      "\"There will be discounts and deals \u2014 that's what Black Friday is about. Very few retailers will want to shun that completely, but I think they will be more surgical and selective in the discounting,\" Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"They will perhaps discount fewer items, and some discounts will be less generous in terms of the amount of money off.\"",
      "Dan Peskorse, whose company, Upstream Brands, sells a range of merchandise under different labels on Amazon and other e-commerce sites, also said higher tariff costs are forcing him to rethink his Black Friday strategy this year.",
      "For previous Black Fridays, Peskorse said Upstream Brands typically offered discounts of up to 30% on products sold under the company's flagship brands, including ThinkFit, which makes meal-prep bags and containers, and Ash Harbor, a maker of small home goods.",
      "Not this year. \"This is the first year that we are not offering across-the-board discounts on products,\" he said, noting that the decision was \"100%\" related to tariffs.",
      "Peskorse has taken steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including raising prices and absorbing the extra costs that come with importing goods from China and India. The only tool he has left to control costs and preserve his business's profits is to scrap discounts, he said.",
      "The average U.S. tariff rate has increased sevenfold this year, to 16.6%, according to EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. Those higher duties are pushing up the prices of imported goods as retailers pass on a portion of the\u00a0costs to shoppers, he noted.",
      "\"It's going to be a strange season\"",
      "Squeezed by tariff costs, many businesses are also grappling with a slowdown in holiday spending by lower-income consumers still feeling the\u00a0impact of persistent inflation.",
      "\"I think the rubber is going to hit the road when we get into Black Friday,\" said Sonia Lapinsky, a retail analyst at management consulting firm AlixPartners. \"Consumers are telling us they are pulling back on holiday spending this year, holding on to their dollars and putting their money in critical places, not in discretionary buckets.\"",
      "Discounts are a powerful tool for incentivizing consumers to spend money, she added.",
      "\"It's the only way retailers will get them in the door, because they can't stomach this,\" Lapinsky said. \"So it's going to be a strange season. If retailers get it wrong, they're risking the biggest selling season they have.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Wednesday formally sent to the Senate a bill that would force the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the final procedural move before the legislation can be sent to President Trump for his signature.",
      "After the House passed the measure in a 427-1 vote on Tuesday, the Senate approved the bill unanimously before it could even be formally transmitted from the lower chamber. With the transmission of the bill Wednesday morning, the bill is formally considered passed, and now heads to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "Mr. Trump, who had initially expressed opposition to the release of the files, is expected to sign the measure into law, after he changed his tune Sunday and urged Republicans to vote in favor of the bill.",
      "With his signature, the Justice Department, FBI and U.S. attorney's offices would be forced to release their files related to Epstein, his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell and other entities connected to them within 30 days. Survivors' personal information and other sensitive material can be withheld or redacted with explanations to Congress.",
      "A long path to passage",
      "The final hurdles for the bill come months after the effort began. After the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures in July, interest in the files has swelled, sparking widespread calls for greater transparency from the Trump administration.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced legislation in July that would require the Justice Department to release the Epstein files within 30 days. And when Congress returned from recess in September, Massie filed a discharge petition to force a vote on the bill, circumventing GOP leadership. The petition, which required 218 signatures, picked up support from all Democrats and four Republicans, but the final signature needed remained out of reach as Rep. Adelita Grijalva's swearing in was delayed during the government shutdown.",
      "Meanwhile, Republican leaders had pushed back on the discharge petition and underlying legislation, warning against the possible release of sensitive information while touting work from congressional committees to look into the Epstein files. But public pressure on lawmakers to force the release of the documents remained high.",
      "Last week, Grijalva was sworn in and became the final signature needed on the discharge petition and force a vote. On Wednesday, after Mr. Trump gave his blessing, the House voted almost unanimously in favor of the measure.",
      "The Senate quickly followed suit, unanimously agreeing to deem the bill passed once it arrived from the House.",
      "A GOP split",
      "The effort, and the Epstein issue more broadly, often divided Republicans, who faced conflicting pressure from constituents and the administration.",
      "Last week, the president lashed out at Republicans who pushed to release the files, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a long-time supporter. Mr. Trump reversed his endorsement of Greene, calling her a \"traitor,\" after she called his prior opposition to releasing the files a \"huge miscalculation.\"",
      "As the bill approached passage on Tuesday, Khanna spoke of the \"extraordinary political consequences\" suffered by Massie and Greene, along with other Republicans who supported the measure. And Greene lamented that the fight over the disclosure of the Epstein files had \"ripped MAGA apart.\"",
      "The issue also seemed to divide GOP leaders. Johnson led the charge against it in Congress. On Tuesday, even as he expressed concerns about the bill, the speaker voted to move it forward, saying that he expected the Senate to amend it and insisting that Senate Majority Leader John Thune do so. Thune did not, and the bill sailed through the Senate unanimously.",
      "Thune acknowledged Johnson's concerns to reporters ahead of the vote, saying, \"I think there are some things he'd like to change, but you got a 427 to 1 vote, it's probably not likely to happen.\" Johnson told reporters afterward, when asked whether he was frustrated with Thune, that \"I'm frustrated with the process, but I trust Leader Thune.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 10:33:51 -0500",
    "summary": "In court Wednesday, former FBI Director James Comey is trying to have the criminal charges against him dismissed.",
    "story": [
      "Lawyers for former FBI Director James Comey is again confronting the Justice Department in a federal courtroom Wednesday, as Comey seeks to have the two-count federal indictment against him dismissed on the grounds that it is based on a \"vindictive and selective\" prosecution.",
      "The hearing is the second in two weeks stemming from Comey's bids to dismiss the criminal charges, which stem from testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee more than five years ago. Comey has pleaded not guilty to both charges and has argued that the prosecution is a result of Mr. Trump's efforts to target a political foe.",
      "In court filings last month, Comey's attorneys wrote that the charges were the result of an \"egregious abuse of power,\" and asserted there were \"multiple glaring constitutional violations\" in the indictment. They argued that Mr. Trump ordered prosecutors to charge Comey out of \"personal spite\" and because he \"frequently criticized the President,\" who fired Comey from his role leading the FBI in 2017 and has continued to attack him for years.",
      "Comey's legal team argued that \"absent a dismissal with prejudice, Mr. Comey would face a potential perpetual state of being vindictively prosecuted.\" If the case is dismissed with prejudice, prosecutors would not be able to re-file the charges.",
      "Defendants must clear a high bar in order to win the dismissal of an indictment on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive and selective.",
      "For vindictive prosecution, the defendant must show that the prosecutor acted with \"genuine animus\" toward him, and that prosecutor pursued charges to punish the defendant for exercising a protected right.",
      "In a claim of selective prosecution, the defendant must show that the government was motivated by a discriminatory purpose, either by demonstrating that similarly situated individuals were spared from prosecution or that the decision to bring charges was \"invidious or in bad faith.\"",
      "Comey's lawyers have argued in filings that direct evidence establishes that Mr. Trump harbors \"genuine animus\" toward Comey based on his protected speech and the president's \"arbitrary personal bias.\" The former FBI chief has repeatedly spoken out against Mr. Trump's conduct in office and in response, the president has \"resorted to personal attacks and calls to retaliate against Mr. Comey through punishment and imprisonment,\" defense lawyers wrote.",
      "To demonstrate the breadth of Mr. Trump's dislike of Comey, his lawyers provided the court with nearly 60 pages of social media posts from the president dating back to May 2017 in which he attacks and accuses the former FBI director of wrongdoing.",
      "\"As a private citizen, Mr. Comey has vigorously and prominently exercised his First Amendment right to criticize President Trump. In response, President Trump has repeatedly attacked and threatened Mr. Comey,\" Comey's lawyers wrote. \"That pattern began soon after Mr. Comey's May 2017 termination as FBI Director and has continued up until \u2014 and even after \u2014 the indictment in this case.\"",
      "Defense lawyers also highlighted the timing of Comey's indictment \u2014 sought days before the five-year statute of limitations expired \u2014 and the fact that it was pursued only after the president installed his former personal defense lawyer and White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who did not have any prosecutorial experience before being tapped to lead the Virginia prosecutors' office. She replaced Erik Siebert in the role, whose abrupt departure came amid concerns he would be removed for failing to bring a case against New York Attorney General Letitia James, another critic of the president.",
      "\"With the statute-of-limitations deadline looming and no career prosecutor \u2014 not even President Trump's own interim U.S. Attorney (Mr. Siebert) \u2014 willing to seek the indictment, the President took matters into his own hands by directing his Attorney General to seek 'JUSTICE' against Mr. Comey and to unlawfully appoint a White House aide who would prosecute this case. She then immediately did so,\" they wrote.",
      "Justice Department lawyers responded by arguing in court filings that Comey \"weaves a tale\" through \"news reports, social media posts, and speculation\" that does not meet the \"rigorous legal standard\" to dismiss the case.",
      "They argued that numerous high-ranking government officials have been prosecuted for lying to Congress about official actions. The department also argued that Comey has not alleged that Halligan, who sought the indictment, harbored animus against Comey, and there is no evidence that Mr. Trump displaced her as the decision-maker in bringing the prosecution.",
      "\"The true affront to the criminal justice system would be to allow the defendant to escape accountability for lying to and obstructing Congress under oath about actions he took while serving as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" prosecutors wrote. \"The indictment was presented by a duly appointed and unbiased prosecutor. And a duly constituted grand jury found probable cause that he committed the indicted offenses.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyers also pointed to Mr. Trump's years of social media posts about Comey, but said they show the president's view that Comey committed a crime preceded the former FBI director's public criticism of the president.",
      "They said Comey was prosecuted because of his \"extraordinary conduct\" and \"flagrant violation\" of the public's trust by allegedly lying to Congress.",
      "\"The Executive cannot be expected to ignore agency heads lying about official actions simply because they later become outspoken critics,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Comey's motion claiming selective and vindictive prosecution is one of several pursued by his defense team that aim to have the charges dismissed before the start of a trial.",
      "As proceedings have moved forward in the weeks since his indictment in late September, prosecutors have run into issues that could doom their case.",
      "On Monday, a federal magistrate judge took what he called the \"extraordinary remedy\" of ordering federal prosecutors to turn over all grand jury materials to Comey's defense team, citing a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in the case, including potential issues with how the Justice Department handled evidence used in the grand jury presentation and how Halligan conducted herself in front of the grand jury.",
      "The U.S. district judge handling the case, Michael Nachmanoff, has temporarily paused that order while the Justice Department appeals it.",
      "Comey's legal team also argued alongside New York Attorney General Letitia James' legal team last week that the indictments against them should be dismissed because Halligan's appointment was unlawful. James was indicted last month on federal mortgage fraud charges and has pleaded not guilty. The federal judge who heard arguments on that issue said she would have a ruling on the validity of Halligan's appointment by Thanksgiving.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana was the only House member to vote against a bill that would require the Justice Department to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The bill passed the House on Tuesday in a 427-1 vote after months of delay and pushback from GOP leaders, and then went on to win unanimous consent in the Senate. Despite the roadblocks, it achieved overwhelming Republican support to propel it to passage after President Trump dropped his opposition to a vote, opening the door for nearly all GOP members to support it.",
      "In a post on X, Higgins explained his reasons for opposing the measure, saying the files could inadvertently entangle innocent people if they are released.",
      "\"I have been a principled 'NO' on this bill from the beginning. What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today. It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America. As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people \u2014 witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc.,\" Higgins wrote. \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt. Not by my vote.\"",
      "His concerns echoed those expressed by House Speaker Mike Johnson and others, who argued that the legislative language needed to be changed to prevent the release of information that could compromise investigations or other sensitive material. The bill's supporters dismissed those concerns and said the bill includes provisions to block such disclosures.",
      "Higgins' statement continued: \"The Oversight Committee is conducting a thorough investigation that has already released well over 60,000 pages of documents from the Epstein case. That effort will continue in a manner that provides all due protections for innocent Americans. If the Senate amends the bill to properly address [the] privacy of victims and other Americans, who are named but not criminally implicated, then I will vote for that bill when it comes back to the House.\"",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act requires the Justice Department to release \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" regarding Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his co-conspirator who is serving a 20-year prison sentence, within 30 days of being signed into law. The legislation also requires the disclosure of \"[i]ndividuals, including government officials, named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities, civil settlements, immunity or plea agreements, or investigatory proceedings,\" as well as corporate, academic and governmental entities linked to him.",
      "The measure says that \"No record shall be withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\"",
      "The legislation allows the attorney general to withhold or redact documents that \"contain personally identifiable information of victims or victims' personal and medical files,\" if their release would \"constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" It also excludes child sexual abuse material, information about ongoing criminal cases and material that could harm national security. Any redactions must be explained in notices to Congress.",
      "Shortly after the House vote, Senate Majority Leader John Thune indicated the upper chamber would take up the matter quickly.",
      "\"I think there are some things he'd like to change, but you got a 427 to 1 vote, it's probably not likely to happen,\" the South Dakota Republican said.",

    "summary": "House lawmakers are moving quickly to repeal a provision that allows senators to sue for $500,000 over phone record seizures. It's unclear what the Senate will do.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House is fast-tracking a bill to repeal a controversial provision that allows senators to sue for $500,000 if federal investigators search their phone records without their knowledge.",
      "The House is poised to easily pass the bill with the necessary two-thirds majority required for passage under suspension of the rules on Wednesday evening. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Tuesday that he wasn't sure how the upper chamber would approach the legislation, but he defended the provision allowing the lawsuits.",
      "\"The House isn't implicated in what we did. It just simply applies to the Senate,\" he said. \"There's a statute that obviously was violated and what this does is enables people who are harmed \u2014 in this case, United States senators \u2014 to have a private right of action against the weaponization by the Justice Department.\"",
      "The new law requires service providers to notify senators if their phone records or other data are seized or subpoenaed. A court cannot delay notification unless the senator is the target of a criminal investigation.",
      "The bill states: \"Any senator whose Senate data, or the Senate data of whose Senate office, has been acquired, subpoenaed, searched, accessed, or disclosed in violation of this section may bring a civil action against the United States if the violation was committed by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States or of any federal department or agency.\"",
      "Senators are entitled to $500,000 for each violation under the new law, which also limits how the government can rebut the claims. The law is retroactive to 2022, meaning it would allow at least eight senators to sue the federal government over their phone records being seized during special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "The provision was tucked into a year-long measure to fund the legislative branch, which passed Congress last week as part of a broader package to end the government shutdown.",
      "As the package moved through the House Rules Committee last week, Democrats tried to amend the bill to remove the provision. Several Republicans on the committee expressed surprise and anger over the provision's inclusion, but said they had to support the overall package to reopen the government because removing it would prolong the shutdown by sending the amended bill back to the Senate.",
      "\"What they did is wrong,\" GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia said last week. \"There's actually a list of people that know they will get paid as soon as this thing is signed \u2014 at least they've got the coupon where all they have to do is go file at the courthouse to get paid.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas called the provision \"self-serving\" and criticized its last-minute insertion into the bill without any debate.",
      "\"It is beside my comprehension that this got put in the bill, and it's why people have such a low opinion of this town,\" Roy said.",
      "Citing the provision, Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, refused to vote for the funding package to reopen the government.",
      "After a conversation with Senate Majority Leader John Thune last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the South Dakota Republican \"regretted the way it was done.\" Johnson said the Senate's move was \"way out of line.\"",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said he did not ask Thune to commit to holding a vote in the Senate, but he expected the chamber to do so.",

      "The event took place in the White House East Room, a space that will one day adjoin the new $300 million ballroom, and was arranged to recognize donors who privately funded construction that's now underway. Guests included representatives from more than two dozen nationally recognized firms, like tobacco giant Altria, Comcast, Microsoft and T-Mobile.",
      "Several companies retained more than one of the lobbying firms in 2025, paying hundreds of thousands annually for advocacy before Congress and the Trump administration.",
      "CBS News also found that a fourth firm, Akin, provided lobbying or legal services to at least nine of the donor companies, according to 2025 federal lobbying disclosures, and one of its lobbyists also attended the East Room dinner.",

      "The key, Crockett said, is if the polling shows she can beat a Republican candidate in the general election next November.",
      "\"At the end of the day, if the numbers are strong that I am our best shot, then it's bigger than my district, it's bigger than the state of Texas,\" said Crockett. \"This is about the country because we know if we can change the Senate map in this country, then that's where we start to get wins.\"",

As of Tuesday morning, Border Patrol had recorded more than 200 arrests as part of that operation, which the Trump administration has dubbed \"Charlotte's Web,\" a DHS official familiar with the data told CBS News.",

      "The pomp and circumstance \u2014 and the president's praise and warmth toward MBS \u2014 were more typical of a visit from an allied Western democracy than an absolute monarchy with a troubled human rights record, pointing to the president's focus on economic and business ties above virtually all else. The White House sees Saudi Arabia as a critical security partner in a turbulent Middle East, as well as an economic partner.",
      "The White House arrival ceremony for the crown prince on Tuesday morning was laden with fanfare, complete with a U.S. military flyover, cannons, horses, and a red carpet. American and Saudi flags adorned the White House South Lawn, and a military band greeted the Saudi royal. Mr. Trump and the crown prince exchanged greetings as they shook hands, and then watched the formation of F-35 and F-16 fighter jets fly by before going inside the White House.",
      "The crown prince's meeting with the president concluded and MBS departed the White House Tuesday afternoon, though he returned later in the evening for a black-tie dinner in his honor. Guests spotted at the dinner included Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays for Saudi team Al-Nassr.",
      "Ahead of bin Salman's arrival, Mr. Trump\u00a0told reporters\u00a0Monday that the U.S. would sell F-35 fighter jets to the Saudis. In the Oval Office, MBS said the Saudis will increase a planned investment of $600 billion in the U.S. to closer to $1 trillion, an announcement that pleased Mr. Trump greatly.",
      "Mr. Trump praised the crown prince in the Oval Office, calling him a \"very good friend\" and insisting his record on human rights is commendable, despite the State Department's long list of concerns of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. Arbitrary and unlawful killings, disappearances, torture, serious restrictions on freedom of expression and restrictions on religious freedom continue to plague the nation, according to the latest 2024 State Department report.",
      "The trip to the White House is the crown prince's first U.S. visit since Washington Post journalist and human rights activist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in 2018 in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul by members of the Saudi government. The president has smoothed over relations with the Saudis since the CIA assessed about a month after Khashoggi's killing, during Mr. Trump's first term, that the crown prince had\u00a0ordered it.",
      "Bin Salman has denied any involvement, but he\u00a0told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell\u00a0in a 2019 \"60 Minutes\" interview, \"I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\"",
      "The Biden administration later released the Trump-era intelligence report concluding the crown prince \"approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\"",
      "Bin Salman was asked about Khashoggi directly in the Oval Office Tuesday, giving U.S. reporters a rare chance to question the future king. \"About the journalist, it's really painful to hear that anyone losing his life for no real purpose,\" MBS said.",
      "The crown prince sought to distance the Saudi government from the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, as families of the attacks criticize the White House for inviting him. Bin Salman said he feels \"painful about families of 9/11 in America,\" but claimed Osama bin Laden used the Saudi people to \"destroy\" the American-Saudi relationship. Allegations that members of the Saudi government had links to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers have circulated for years, drawing\u00a0vehement denials\u00a0from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized members of the media for some of the questions.",
      "\"We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm very proud of the job, what he's done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.\"",
      "Later in the day Tuesday, the crown prince attended a dinner at the White House. There are 120 invited guests, according to a person familiar with the planning, and 30 will be from the Saudi delegation.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday evening's dinner is a perfect example of why his large ballroom under construction is necessary. Although it's not a state dinner, it is the first formal dinner hosted by Mr. Trump in his second term to honor a nation's leader. Bin Salman's father, Salman bin Abdulaziz, is technically the head of state of the kingdom, but he delegated his duties as ruler to MBS in 2017.",
      "\"We're more than meeting,\" Mr. Trump said Friday of the visit. \"We're honoring Saudi Arabia.\"",
      "AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy, defense sales and the fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge, which was announced during the president's trip to Saudi Arabia in May.",
      "Mr. Trump is also planning to attend a Saudi business summit in Washington, D.C., Wednesday. An invitation previously obtained by CBS News said the event at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts will be co-hosted by the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia and the U.S.-Saudi Business Council.",
      "Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and former top White House adviser Jared Kushner have fostered close relationships with the Saudis and the crown prince in particular, viewing them as critical partners for both security and business in a turbulent Middle East. The president said the Abraham Accords \u2014 an agreement from his first term that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel, Bahrain and the UAE\u00a0 \u2014 would be a big topic of discussion during the visit.",
      "\"The Abraham Accords will be a part we're going to be discussing,\" Mr. Trump said over the weekend. \"I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly. We've had tremendous interest in the Abraham Accords since we put Iran out of business.\"",
      "Mr. Trump recently told \"60 Minutes\" contributing correspondent Norah O'Donnell that he thought bin Salman would join the agreement, although the Saudis have indicated that would not happen without a path to Palestinian statehood.",
      "The Trumps also have extensive and longheld personal business ties in Saudi Arabia. Last year, the Trump Organization announced plans for the development of a Trump Tower in Jeddah, a major Saudi city along the Red Sea.",
      "Eric Trump, the president's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told Reuters that the Trump Organization also has plans for a Trump-branded property in Riyadh.",
      "And Kushner started a private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which received a reported $2 billion investment from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund controlled by bin Salman.",
      "Asked about the potential conflicts of interest given his family business ties, Mr. Trump insisted Tuesday,\"I have nothing to do with the family business.\"",
      "\"They've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually, I'm sure they could do a lot,\" Mr. Trump said of his family.",
      "Criticism of human rights record",
      "Following the killing of Khashoggi, Mr. Trump did not seek to punish bin Salman personally during his first administration and said he viewed Saudi Arabia as a \"great ally,\" noting the economic ties between the U.S. and the Saudis. The Trump administration did sanction 19 Saudi nationals over the killing.",
      "\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Mr. Trump posted on social media in November 2018.",
      "\"That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.\"",
      "Human rights advocates are dismayed about the treatment bin Salman is expected to receive in Washington, not only because of Khashoggi's murder, but also because of Saudi Arabia's human rights record under bin Salman.",
      "\"We know President Trump won't ask MBS to reveal where Jamal's remains are so his family can finally bury him,\" said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now, an organization Khashoggi founded months before he was killed. \"But the least he can do \u2014 the absolute minimum \u2014 is publicly press MBS to release the dozens of activists, writers and reformers languishing in Saudi prisons for the 'crime' of speaking freely.\"",
      "Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director at DAWN, called bin Salman's journey from castigation over Khashoggi's murder to a high-profile White House welcome an \"extraordinary political feat.\" And that's not just because of Mr. Trump's gestures of friendship toward the crown prince. Whitson mentioned the \"fist bump seen around the world,\" as former President Joe Biden warmly greeted Khashoggi in Riyadh during his presidency \"hat in hand.\"",
      "\"We went from the Biden administration narrowly sanctioning Mohamamd bin Salman himself for the murder of Khashoggi \u2026 to now welcoming him into Washington and not only sort of feting him for whatever lucrative deals he can pass to American businesses, but also to potentially actually help as a stabilizing force,\" Whitson said.",

      "Reacting to the meeting between the two leaders, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi recounted what she said were \"seven years of hell\" in an interview with CBS News on Tuesday. She said that her husband did not deserve to be brutally killed over his criticism of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and that she has not received an apology or seen any actions of accountability from the crown prince.",
      "\"It destroyed my life. It inverted my life,\" Elatr told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout.\"",
      "Elatr came to the U.S. in August 2020 to apply for asylum because she feared for her safety, and was granted it in November 2023,\u00a0according to\u00a0CBS News' partner network BBC News. She had been living in Dubai, where she also grew up, prior to coming to the U.S.",
      "\"I was sharing his mission and vision. I'm the one supporting him in his exile. I was speaking up, putting in my social media, but it fired back at me,\" she said, adding that she was detained many times following his death and placed on house arrest until she decided to come to the U.S.",
      "Upon moving to the U.S., she alleges that she learned authorities in the United Arab Emirates had been surveilling even her prior to her husband's death, in collaboration with Saudi authorities.",

      "Khashoggi's widow \"disappointed\" in Trump response",

The crown prince has denied any involvement in Khashoggi's killing.",
      "When he was asked about his business dealings with bin Salman, despite that report, Mr. Trump said of Khashoggi, \"You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial.\"",
      "The 59-year-old Washington Post columnist was killed after entering a Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. In the first two weeks following his disappearance, Saudi officials denied any knowledge. Mr. Trump at the time admitted the nation had been untruthful, but\u00a0resisted blaming MBS for Khashoggi's death.",
      "\"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about, whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it and we can leave it at that,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday.",
      "Elatr said she was \"disappointed\" to hear Mr. Trump describing her husband in a way that \"kind of justifies a crime.\"",
      "\"To say he's controversial ... it does not give anyone the right to just kidnap him, torture him, kill him and dismantle his body,\" she told CBS News. \"This hurt me a lot. It's taking away, as well, the freedom for the journalists to do their job. ... And what is the different then between U.S. and any dictatorship in Middle Eastern country?\"",
      "Demanding accountability",
      "While the crown prince has denied any involvement in Khashoggi's killing, he said in a 2019 \"60 Minutes\" interview that he takes full responsibility as the leader of Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"He admitted verbally, he took responsibility verbally, but he did not take any action to show the world there is rectifying of this crime,\" Elatr said Tuesday. \"... I did not receive an official apology myself as a wife, as they destroyed my life. They've taken my lover.\"",
      "Despite the 2021 intelligence report's findings, Elatr told CBS News that she doesn't know if MBS was directly responsible.",
      "\"I'm not sure 100% the order was given by the crown prince himself because I don't have the tools, I don't have the intelligence. I don't have a country to support me to dig in and to make sure,\" she said.",
      "Sitting next to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, bin Salman said, \"It's painful and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that will never happen again.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 More than a dozen of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers stood alongside Democratic and GOP lawmakers and pressed Congress to look beyond politics, with the House set to vote Tuesday on a bill to release the government's remaining files related to the investigation of his crimes.",
      "\"This is one of the most horrific and disgusting corruption scandals in our country's history,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat who sponsored the bill. \"Because survivors spoke up, because of their courage, the truth is finally going to come out.\"",
      "At a news conference outside the Capitol, the accusers called for transparency and argued that releasing the files should transcend politics.",
      "Haley Robson said, \"It's time that we put the political agendas and party affiliations to the side.\" \"This is not an issue of a few corrupt Democrats or a few corrupt Republicans, this is a case of institutional betrayal,\" said Annie Farmer. And Liz Stein said \"the Epstein files are not about loyalty to any one political party. They're evidence of a crime.\"",
      "\"In a divided nation, this is one demand we all share,\" said Lisa Phillips.",
      "The House vote, which is expected Tuesday afternoon, comes after four Republicans joined all\u00a0 Democrats to sign a petition to force a vote on the issue, circumventing House GOP leadership. Although President Trump initially expressed opposition to the release of the files and lashed out against Republicans who advocated for the release of the files, he changed his tune Sunday when it was evident the bill would pass. He urged House Republicans to vote to release the Epstein files \"because we have nothing to hide.\"",
      "Another Epstein accuser, Jena-Lisa Jones, spoke of the emotionally \"distressing\" back-and-forth from the administration regarding the release of the files. She called on the president, whom she said she voted for, to \"show some real leadership,\" adding that his \"behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment.\"",
      "\"I beg you, President Trump, please stop making this political,\" Jones said. \"It is not about you, President Trump. You are our president. Please start acting like it.\"",
      "Interest in the files has grown since July, when the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. Since then, there's been widespread calls for greater transparency from the Trump administration.",
      "Khanna outlined the widespread nature of the allegations from Epstein's accusers, saying, \"There should be no buildings named after people in this Epstein class, there should be no scholarships named after them, they shouldn't be enjoying the perks of being affiliated with corporations or universities or writing op-eds or being lionized.\" He added that \"many of the survivors will tell you, some of these people still are celebrated in our society.\"",
      "The California Democrat said the accusers \"are the ones who made today possible,\" adding that for decades, \"we have not done enough about this issue.\"",
      "Khanna also praised Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, whom he said have suffered \"extraordinary political consequences\" for their work on the issue.",
      "Massie thanked the women, saying they're \"giving everybody hope in this country.\"",
      "\"There are survivors of other sex crimes in this country wondering if they should come forward,\" Massie said. \"These survivors have stepped forth, taking that same risk, worried that they will be defamed themselves \u2014 they have been defamed for stepping forward \u2014 but we're going to get justice for them. That's going to happen today in the People's House.\"",
      "Greene praised the women for coming forward, saying, \"These women have fought the most horrific fight that no woman should have to fight.\" She said they did so by fighting together \"against the most powerful people in the world, even the president of the United States, in order to make this vote happen today.\"",
      "The Georgia Republican noted she's been \"called a traitor\" by Mr. Trump in recent days in a public spat that seems to stem from the Epstein files.",
      "\"I've never owed him anything, but I fought for him for the policies and for America first \u2014 and he called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition,\" she said.",
      "\"Let me tell you what a traitor is: A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries, and themselves.\" Greene said.",
      "\"Today you are going to see probably a unanimous vote in the House to release the Epstein files,\" Greene said. \"But the real fight will happen after that.\"",
      "The \"real test\" will be whether the DOJ will release the files, or whether they will remain \"tied up in investigations,\" Greene said. She and Massie have raised the possibility that if the Justice Department opens investigations into Epstein's relationships with prominent Democrats, as Mr. Trump has suggested, they could be used to block the files' release.",
      "Massie said while \"they can try to protect a few certain people or a few certain companies, those investigations will eventually end.\" He added, \"They can't open enough investigations to cover up everything that's in these files.\"",
      "But if the bill passes in the House, it would next head to the Senate for approval, where Republican leaders have not said whether they'll bring it up for a vote. Massie appealed to the upper chamber in his remarks, asking the Senate not to derail the effort.",
      "\"If you do anything that prevents any disclosure, you are not for the people and you are not part of this effort,\" Massie said. \"Do not muck it up in the Senate.\"",

    "summary": "The measure compelling the Justice Department to release materials related to Jeffrey Epstein won congressional approval. In a sudden reversal, President Trump told lawmakers they should vote for it.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Tuesday passed a bill\u00a0in a near-unanimous vote that would compel the Justice Department to release materials related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Senate then approved it by unanimous consent, meaning it will soon head to President Trump's desk for a signature.",
      "The vote took place after House GOP leaders dragged out the process for months. The issue has disrupted committee meetings, stalled floor action on other legislation since this summer and fueled President Trump's tirades against some House Republicans, most recently GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. House Speaker Mike Johnson finally expedited a vote on the issue after more than half of all House members \u2014 including every Democrat and four Republicans \u2014 signed a petition forcing a vote.",
      "Mr. Trump suddenly reversed his opposition to the bill late Sunday after it appeared all but certain there would be mass Republican defections.",
      "Here's what to know about the process, what comes next, and how we got here.",
      "What the House's Epstein bill would do",
      "The bill would require the attorney general to make public all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials in possession of the Justice Department, the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices within 30 days of becoming law.",
      "Information that falls under that umbrella includes investigative and prosecutorial materials related to Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as flight logs, travel records and materials about Epstein's detention and death. It also calls for the release of names of individuals and entities referenced in any Epstein case and internal Justice Department communications about the case.",
      "It would also make public any records \"concerning the destruction, deletion, alteration, misplacement, or concealment of documents, recordings, or electronic data\" related to Epstein and his associates.",
      "What files does the DOJ have on Epstein?",
      "It's not clear what \u2014 or how many \u2014 records the Justice Department has in its possession, but Epstein and Maxwell have been the subject of multiple federal investigations.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal and state officials in Florida in the 2000s, which ended with him pleading guilty to state-level prosecution charges. He was investigated again more than a decade later, leading to federal charges in 2019 for allegedly sex trafficking minors.",
      "Maxwell was charged in 2020, and she is now serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls.",
      "And Epstein's 2019 death by suicide in federal custody was probed by the Justice Department.",
      "Thousands of pages of documents related to Epstein, including emails, flight logs and other material, have already been released to the public by the House Oversight Committee and by a federal judge who oversaw the settlement of a lawsuit against Maxwell.",
      "Senate views on the bill",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, was noncommittal about bringing it up for a vote when asked in September. On Sunday, before Mr. Trump encouraged lawmakers to vote for the bill, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, expressed a similar sentiment.",
      "\"It'll come to the Senate. We'll take a look at it,\" he told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"But to me, this is not about truth. It's not about justice. This is about an attempt by the Democrats to make President Trump a lame duck president. I'm not going to aid and abet them in their efforts to do that.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement Tuesday that he would move to \"immediately\" take up and pass the bill, and said that if Thune \"tries to bury the bill, I'll stop him.\"",
      "Once it passed the House, Schumer called for Senate approval by unanimous consent, which it quickly received.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Monday he would sign the bill if it makes it to his desk.",
      "The president also has the power to order the Justice Department to release the files without action from Congress, but he has not indicated any plans to do so.",
      "Lawmakers push for Epstein files' release",
      "The bill's lead sponsors \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 have led the charge in the House for the documents' release. First, they introduced legislation that would force the Justice Department to make Epstein-related files public within 30 days, and they later used a procedural maneuver to bypass House leaders, who control what legislation hits the floor.",
      "The procedural maneuver, known as a discharge petition, secured the final signature needed to force a vote last Wednesday, when newly seated Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona added her name. Her swearing-in was delayed for seven weeks while the House was on an extended break during the shutdown.",
      "Instead of waiting until early December, when Johnson would be required to hold a vote on the issue under the rules governing the discharge petition process, the speaker is now seeking to move on sooner.",
      "\"It's a totally pointless exercise,\" Johnson said last week about why he was now choosing to accelerate the vote. \"It is completely moot now. We might as well just do it.\"",
      "Massie said Johnson's decision to drag out the vote for months \"caused nothing but political pain.\" Greene called Mr. Trump's previous opposition to releasing the files a \"huge miscalculation.\"",
      "Johnson has repeatedly criticized the effort by Democrats and some Republicans to force a vote, saying their measure lacked enough protections for Epstein's victims. More recently, Johnson has touted the House Oversight Committee's investigation as sufficient.",
      "The Republican-led committee has so far released tens of thousands of documents from Epstein's estate and the Justice Department, as well as transcripts from interviews with former government officials about their handling of the case. The committee has also sought to depose Maxwell.",
      "The most recent release contained text messages and emails from Epstein in which he alluded to having dirt on Mr. Trump. In his correspondence with others, Epstein said of Mr. Trump, \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" and referred to him as the \"dog that hasn't barked.\"",
      "\"You see, I know how dirty Donald is,\" Epstein wrote in an email chain discussing a 2018 New York Times opinion column on impeachment.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crimes related to the Epstein case. He and Epstein knew each other in New York and Palm Beach social circles in the 1990s and early 2000s, but Mr. Trump has said he cut ties years ago.",
      "Even Republicans who have supported making the Epstein materials public have defended Mr. Trump against criticism of his appearances in the files, arguing Democrats have cherry-picked details to damage the president.",
      "Trump weighs in",
      "Mr. Trump has accused Democrats of focusing on Epstein to deflect from the shutdown, which ended last week after 43 days. He also said he's ordering the Justice Department to investigate Epstein's relationships with prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, and major financial institutions.",
      "But late Sunday, Mr. Trump ended his pressure campaign against the House bill, saying \"House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had previously lashed out at Republicans supportive of the efforts, calling them \"weak and ineffective.\" In recent days, he pulled his endorsement from Greene, who was once a close ally, bashing her as a \"traitor.\"",
      "Greene said the Epstein files \"sent him over the edge\" and alleged Mr. Trump had directed his ire at her \"to scare all the other Republicans\" from voting to make the materials public.",
      "\"It's astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,\" she wrote on Friday.",
      "On Saturday, she added, \"It really makes you wonder what is in those files and who and what country is putting so much pressure on him?\"",
      "Massie pondered Sunday whether Mr. Trump's directive for the Justice Department to investigate Clinton and others was an attempt to block the files from becoming public.",
      "\"If they have ongoing investigations in certain areas, those documents can't be released,\" Massie told ABC News' \"This Week.\" \"So this might be a big smoke screen \u2026 a last-ditch effort to prevent the release of the Epstein files.\"",
      "Trump administration's handling of Epstein files",
      "The Trump administration's handling of the Epstein materials has divided Mr. Trump's base.",
      "Some of those who believe that the federal government has concealed information about Epstein to protect powerful figures have been disappointed by his administration's disclosures so far.",
      "When right-wing influencers visited the White House in February, Attorney General Pam Bondi gave the group binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" But she faced criticism after the influencers said that the binders contained documents that had been public for years.",
      "Months later, a July memo from the Justice Department and FBI said they had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of material related to Epstein and \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\" There was no \"client list\" or \"credible evidence\" that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures, according to the memo, which also confirmed that Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail.",
      "Bondi had previously suggested a \"client list\" was sitting on her desk.",
      "After pressure from members of both parties, the Trump administration asked courts to unseal grand jury materials from the Epstein and Maxwell cases earlier this year, but those moves have been rejected by judges.",

    "story": [
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon told CBS News on Tuesday that federal money to support low-income students and special education will continue to flow as the Education Department shifts some of its grant programs to other agencies, amid the Trump administration's push to wind down the department altogether.",
      "The agency announced Tuesday\u00a0that the Department of Labor will now manage many of the Education Department's grants to elementary and secondary schools, including the Title I program, which hands out billions of dollars to aid schools with large numbers of low-income students.",
      "A handful of other shifts were also unveiled Tuesday. Certain higher education grants will be moved to the Department of Labor, the Department of the Interior will now handle Native American education grants, the State Department will run some international education programs, and the Department of Health and Human Services will take over a small child care grant program and a panel that reviews foreign medical schools.",
      "McMahon said the department has not decided how to handle some of its other major responsibilities, including its special education\u00a0grants and its Office for Civil Rights.",
      "But programs that support low-income students, students with special needs and civil rights will remain in place, even if they're moved to different agencies, McMahon told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout.\"",
      "\"They will all still be done,\" McMahon said. \"They were done before there was a Department of Education, and they will continue to be done.\"",
      "\"Special education will not be abandoned,\" McMahon added.",
      "She said the Education Department will still oversee the programs that are being moved to other agencies, and their funding will come from the department's budget.",
      "McMahon said permanently moving the Education Department's responsibilities elsewhere would require congressional approval. But the department has argued that it does have the legal authority to essentially contract out some of its duties to other parts of the federal government.",
      "She referred to the moves as a \"pilot program\" and a \"proof of concept.\"",
      "\"I want to prove to Congress that these transfers of programs are more efficient and that they work,\" McMahon said. \"And so if we can do that, then hopefully ... we can get Congress to vote and to codify those transfers and make it a permanent move.\"",
      "President Trump has taken aim at the Education Department for months, signing an executive order in March directing the department to start closing itself down to the maximum extent required by law. The department has also moved to slash its workforce.",
      "The administration has argued that the Department of Education is overly bureaucratic and many of its tasks should be overseen by states and localities.",
      "\"The Trump Administration is fully committed to doing what's best for American students, which is why it's critical to shrink this bloated federal education bureaucracy while still ensuring efficient delivery of funds and essential programs,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said Tuesday, adding that \"students and teachers don't need Washington bureaucrats micromanaging their classrooms.\"",
      "Tuesday's moves drew pushback from the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents thousands of Education Department staffers.",
      "\"Students, educators and families depend on the Department's comprehensive support for schools, from early learning through graduate programs,\" the union said in a press release that called the changes \"unlawful\" and an \"insult\" to students. \"That national mission is weakened when its core functions are scattered across other federal or state agencies that are not equipped or positioned to provide the same support and services as ED staff.\"",

      "Federal immigration authorities will expand their enforcement action in North Carolina to Raleigh as soon as Tuesday, the mayor of the state's capital city said, while Customs and Border Protection agents continue operating in Charlotte following a weekend that saw arrests of more than 130 people in that city, the state's largest.",
      "Mayor Janet Cowell said Monday that she didn't know how large the operation would be or how long agents would be present. At a city council meeting n Tuesday, she said there have been Border Patrol \"sightings\" in the county.",
      "\"Our law enforcement partners have confirmed that Border Patrol is in Wake County. So there have been several confirmed sightings \u2014 and Durham County,\" Cowell said. \"And we are just encouraging everyone if you feel unsafe or you see something that you think is illegal, to please call the Raleigh Police Department or your local jurisdiction, and to stay safe.\"",
      "Immigration authorities haven't spoken about it. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News in a statement: \"Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations.\"",
      "Cowell, a Democrat, pointed out in a statement that crime was lower in Raleigh this year compared to last and that public safety was a priority for her and the city council.",
      "\"I ask Raleigh to remember our values and maintain peace and respect through any upcoming challenges,\" she said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cowell added, \"While RPD is not involved in immigration enforcement, we are committed to protecting our residents and to following the law. I can confirm that the Raleigh Police Department has not participated in any immigration planning activities.\"",
      "Democratic North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement\u00a0Monday night that his office \"is aware of reports that the Border Patrol is bringing its operation to Raleigh. Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations. Stop targeting people simply going about their lives because of the color of their skin, as you are doing in Charlotte.",
      "\"To the people of Raleigh: remain peaceful, and if you see something wrong, record it and report it to local law enforcement. Let's keep each other safe.\"",
      "The Trump administration has made Charlotte, a Democratic-leaning city of about 950,000 people, its latest focus for an immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime \u2014 despite local opposition and declining crime rates. Residents reported encounters with immigration agents near churches, apartment complexes and stores.",
      "McLaughlin said in a statement that Border Patrol officers there had arrested \"over 130 illegal aliens who have all broken\" immigration laws. The agency said the records of those arrested included gang membership, aggravated assault, shoplifting and other crimes, but it didn't spell out how many cases had resulted in convictions, how many people had been facing charges or any other details.",
      "Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools reported on student absences Monday. \"Unofficial attendance data from today indicates that approximately 20,935 students were absent from school today. This accounts for approximately 15% of students enrolled\" in that district, officials said. There was no word on the percentage of students who are absent on a typical day there.",
      "The immigration crackdown set off fierce objections from leaders in the Charlotte area.",
      "\"We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color,\" Stein said in a video statement late Sunday. \"This is not making us safer. It's stoking fear and dividing our community.\"",
      "Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said Monday she was \"deeply concerned\" about videos she's seen of the crackdown but also said she appreciates protesters' peacefulness.",
      "\"To everyone in Charlotte who is feeling anxious or fearful: You are not alone. Your city stands with you,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Charlotte area's place in immigration issue",
      "Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County have both found themselves part of America's debates over crime and immigration, two of the most important issues to the White House.",
      "The most prominent was the fatal stabbing this summer of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train, an attack captured on video. While the suspect was from the U.S., the Trump administration repeatedly highlighted that he'd been arrested more than a dozen times.",
      "Charlotte, which had a Republican mayor as recently as 2009, is now a city dominated by Democrats, with a growing population brought by a booming economy. The racially diverse city includes more than 150,000 foreign-born residents, officials say.",
      "Lyles easily won a fifth term as mayor earlier this month, defeating her Republican rival by 45 percentage points even as GOP critics blasted city and state leaders for what they call rising incidents of crime. Following the Nov. 4 election, Democrats are poised to hold 10 of the other 11 seats on the city council.",
      "While the DHS has said it's focusing on the state because of sanctuary policies, North Carolina county jails have long honored \"detainers,\" or requests from federal officials to hold an arrested immigrant for a limited time so agents can take custody of them. Nevertheless, some common, noncooperation policies have existed in a handful of places, including Charlotte, where the police don't help with immigration enforcement.",
      "In Mecklenburg County, the jail didn't honor detainer requests for several years, until after state law effectively made it mandatory starting last year.",
      "DHS said about 1,400 detainers across North Carolina had not been honored since October 2020, putting the public at risk.",
      "For years, Mecklenburg Sheriff Garry McFadden pushed back against efforts by the Republican-controlled state legislature to force him and a handful of sheriffs from other urban counties to accept ICE detainers.",
      "Republicans ultimately overrode a veto by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper late last year to enact the bill into law.",
      "While McFadden has said his office is complying with the law's requirement, he continued a public feud with ICE leaders in early 2025 that led to a new state law toughening those rules. Stein vetoed that measure, but the veto was overridden.",
      "Republican House Speaker Destin Hall said in a Monday post on X that immigration agents are in Charlotte because of McFadden's past inaction: \"They're stepping in to clean up his mess and restore safety to the city.\"",
      "Last month, McFadden said he'd had a productive meeting with an ICE representative.",
      "\"I made it clear that I do not want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,\" McFadden said in a statement.",
      "But such talk doesn't calm the political waters.",
      "\"Democrats at all levels are choosing to protect criminal illegals over North Carolina citizens,\" state GOP Chairman Jason Simmons said Monday.",

    "summary": "Documents suggest Epstein had contacts with the Saudi royal family and traveled to the Kingdom in the last years of his life.",
    "story": [
      "In late 2016, Jeffrey Epstein flew his private Gulfstream G550 alone from Paris to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and emerged from the visit with a lavish gift, apparently from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It was a tent, \"carpets and all,\" as he later described it. Bedouin tents, in Middle Eastern culture, are a symbol of hospitality.",
      "What Epstein was doing to be honored with that gift is currently a mystery.",
      "This was one of several meetings and interactions Epstein had with world leaders, according to emails and documents released in recent weeks that detail his activities in the final years of his life. They also included meetings with other members of the Saudi royal family.",
      "Bin Salman is visiting Washington this week and meeting with President Trump. It's a major moment for the Kingdom as it seeks to enhance its global image in the wake of the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. So far, Epstein's business dealings with the Kingdom and members of the royal family have largely avoided close scrutiny.",
      "Much of that information comes from the release of hundreds of text messages, emails and other documents sent to the House Oversight Committee by Epstein's estate as part of the committee's investigation. Revelations about the tent and carpets were included in emails between Epstein and Hyatt executive chairman Tom Pritzker.",
      "Epstein's planning for his 2016 trip included an email from his assistant saying, \"Did you need me to book the Four Seasons for you in Riyadh? Or is the king taking care of it!?\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Saudi officials in D.C. for comment and has not had a response by time of publication.",
      "There is no evidence that anyone involved in the Saudi government had involvement with anything related to Epstein's sex trafficking allegations.",
      "Why Epstein's estate has chosen to release certain documents is not clear. The release is in response to a subpoena that included requests for documents relating to his finances, as well as potential victims. What has been released is likely a fraction of what the estate possesses of Epstein's communications, and it's not clear if there will be future releases that could provide additional details. Epstein maintained extensive communication with his staff, financial clients and friends over the years.",
      "As Congress voted almost unanimously on Tuesday to demand the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files, most of the public's focus has been on his sex crimes \u2014 but any release of additional documents could reveal more about Epstein's vast global business connections, which have so far remained mostly unknown.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, told CBS News there are a host of unanswered questions stemming from Epstein's financial dealings all around the globe.",
      "\"My own investigation has found that Epstein was moving hundreds of millions of dollars around the world during the years he operated his cross-border sex trafficking operation, but it's still not clear who among his foreign network knew about his trafficking, enabled it, and participated in it,\" Wyden said.",
      "Epstein, who fashioned himself as an elite money manager, was also advising the governments of Mongolia and the Maldives, as well as traveling and presumably making or seeking business deals in the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, the Ivory Coast, China, Russia, Qatar and Belarus, according to those documents. But Epstein's contacts with Saudi Arabia appear to have been some of his most extensive and potentially lucrative dealings with foreign leaders.",
      "Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman consolidated his control in Saudi Arabia in 2017 following a purge of high level government officials. A few days later, New York Times reporter Thomas Landon Jr. emailed Epstein, \"Did your Saudi friends survive the purge?\" Epstein responded, \"All. With gods help ;).\"",
      "Epstein discussed another brush with the Saudi crown prince in April 2018. It comes up in a text message exchange with an individual whose name is redacted in the documents, but who appears from the context of their chat to be former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Epstein writes, \"MBS [Mohammed bin Salman] has the Louvre and 400 guards. To himself,\" and he indicates that he is on his way over.",
      "\"No better way to spend s(sic) Sunday,\" came the reply.",
      "That evening, French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted a photo of himself and bin Salman at the Louvre with the caption, \"With Mohammed Bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\" CBS News has reached out to the government of France to find out if Epstein was present, but has not received a response.",
      "That document ended with a text the following day from Epstein to Bannon: \"If you are around the 18th, in dc. John Kerry,\" the former senator, presidential candidate and secretary of state.",
      "A spokesperson for Kerry told CBS News that he was back home in Boston after the end of his service in the Obama administration. \"He wasn't in Washington, DC, was never scheduled to be in Washington, and did not have a meeting or meeting request from that cast of characters, period, which isn't surprising since he didn't have a relationship with either one of them, and wasn't in contact with either of them,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "According to other messages sent from Epstein, he was planning another visit for the summer of 2019 to Saudi Arabia. That trip never happened due to his arrest and incarceration on federal sex crime charges.",
      "Other signs of the connections between Epstein and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have surfaced since his death. Authorities found a photograph of Epstein posing with bin Salman prominently displayed in his Manhattan mansion, according to The New York Times.",
      "After Epstein's arrest in 2019, officials also discovered that he held an expired Austrian passport from the 1980s with his picture and a false name, which listed his residence as Saudi Arabia.",

    "summary": "If President Trump signs the bill passed by the House and Senate requiring DOJ to release documents tied to investigations of Jeffrey Epstein, here's what could be published.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate and House of Representatives passed \u2014 in rare bipartisan fashion \u2014 a bill that would require the Justice Department to release a trove of documents tied to investigations of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "President Trump's signature on the legislation would clear the way for the release of a new set of documents, including material not previously disclosed among the tens of thousands of pages released in batches from congressional investigators. Those disclosures have brought new focus on the former financier's global social circle of wealthy, powerful men.",
      "What Epstein files would be released, according to the bill?",
      "The bill would require the attorney general to make public all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials in possession of the Justice Department, the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices within 30 days of becoming law.",
      "Combined, the documents would stem from a pair of federal investigations, in Florida and New York, spanning more than a decade.",
      "The two cases spawned widespread accusations of conspiratorial coverups, as it became clear that Epstein's jetsetting revolved around wining, dining and business deals with a wide cross section of world leaders and celebrities. Recent CBS News investigations have raised questions about the circumstances of Epstein's 2019 death in custody, and shown that Epstein continued to court the rich and famous right up until his 2019 arrest, even as sex trafficking accusations intensified following a 2008 \"sweetheart deal\" with prosecutors in Florida.",
      "The documents could include bank records, correspondence, witness interviews and communications or other files retrieved from Epsteins' electronic devices.",
      "New releases could reveal \"troublingly close relationships,\" though not necessarily more criminal conduct",
      "Columbia Law School professor and former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman said a recent release of files might give a hint of what to expect. Last week, the House Oversight Committee published thousands of documents showing emails and text messages sent to and from Epstein \u2014 with Democrats on the committee highlighting emails in which Epstein suggested Mr. Trump \"knew about the girls.\"",
      "\"From a public interest perspective, the preview from House Dems last week suggests the files may reveal troublingly close relationships between Epstein and various notables,\" Richman said, but cautioned that he believes federal prosecutors in New York would have pursued any substantial leads with \"zeal.\"",
      "\"I would not be quick to assume any revelations when it comes to chargeable criminal conduct,\" Richman said.",
      "Former Epstein attorney David Schoen told CBS News he's concerned that the slow drip of file releases could harm the reputations of people who might have socialized or did business with Epstein, without involvement in his crimes. He pointed to an announcement Monday night by former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers that he's \"stepping back from public commitments\" as scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein builds.",
      "Summers said he was \"deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused.\" The correspondence that was published suggests Summers sought advice on women from Epstein: \"I said what are you up to,\" Summers wrote in part of one message, describing a conversation with the woman. \"She said 'I'm busy.' I said awfully coy u are.\"",
      "Epstein's reply read, in part: \"shes smart. making you pay for past errors.\" There is no evidence of illegal conduct on Summers' part.",
      "Schoen said, \"My fear is that people's reputations will be tarnished now because their names appear even though they did nothing wrong.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he expects the Senate will amend the legislation to address what he called \"serious deficiencies\" related to survivors' privacy and the possibility of unintended disclosure of sensitive information.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI sought to address some of those concerns in an unsigned July memo, describing a review of the files, which it said contain \"images and videos of victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten thousand downloaded videos and images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography.\"",
      "The agencies wrote in their memo that \"while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information regarding Epstein\u2026.no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"",
      "Richman said he didn't put much stock in the Justice Department's decisionmaking related to withholding documents related to Epstein.",
      "\"Such withholding might well be normal, but here, I worry that it will be used as a cover for a selectivity that helps Trump and his friends and hurts those he considers his enemies,\" said Richman. The Columbia Law School professor is a longtime friend of former FBI Director James Comey, a frequent target of Mr. Trump's ire who was indicted in September on two federal counts related to past testimony to Congress.",
      "FBI review revealed no Epstein client list",
      "While Attorney General Pam Bondi implied during a Fox News interview in February that an Epstein \"client list\" was sitting on her desk, in the July memo her agency and the FBI claimed, \"this systematic review revealed no incriminating 'client list.'\"",
      "\"We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties,\" the July memo said.",
      "Actress Alicia Arden, who accused Epstein of sexual battery during a 1997 incident, said during a Monday press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred that it's a bipartisan issue, and asked,",
      "\"Why would there be a single 'No' vote?\"",
      "\"Vote to release these files so we can finally see who else helped Jeffrey Epstein,\" Arden said.",
      "New Epstein investigation could affect any release of files",
      "A recently announced investigation could complicate the matter.",
      "Bondi said on Friday that she had asked U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to open an investigation hours after Mr. Trump demanded a probe into several prominent Democrats and financial institutions.",
      "It is unclear how that new investigation might impact efforts to release files related to Epstein's closed cases. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky said Monday he worries that the new investigation could be used to block the release of some files. The Justice Department and Bondi have not commented further on Clayton's investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned that now he's opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files. That's my concern,\" Massie, who led the effort to get the bill to the House floor, told reporters. \"I'm afraid they're going to try to use a provision of the law that allows you not to release these materials if they're subject of an ongoing investigation.\"",
      "During Arden's press conference Monday, attorney Gloria Allred echoed Massie's concern.",
      "\"So, now we're just involved in this political bloodbath trying to get answers. All I can say is when the fog of political war clears, I certainly hope that the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein will have more answers and information than they have now,\" Allred said.",

    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California, Missouri and North Carolina redistricting push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina is now the latest state to join a mid-decade redistricting gambit that could shake up next year's midterms, following similar moves by Missouri, Texas and California to redraw their House maps, along with a separate court-ordered effort in Utah.",
      "The redistricting push began with President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the state's districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a push that has drawn national attention. It led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats, which was approved by voters on Election Day by a 29-point margin.",
      "In Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map in September to edge out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district, and the legislation was signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican. In October, North Carolina Republicans targeted a single Democratic district as well, passing a map that redraws the 1st Congressional District to make it lean more heavily Republican.",
      "Utah lawmakers also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans, but a judge in November threw out the GOP-controlled legislature's map and ordered one that will create a Democratic-leaning district in Salt Lake City.",
      "Challenges remain in all states that are redoing their maps. In Texas, a federal court\u00a0blocked the state\u00a0from using the newly redrawn map in the upcoming midterm elections. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Kehoe's authority to create Missouri's new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Despite getting the seal of approval by voters in California, state Republicans filed a lawsuit against Prop 50 after Election Day.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, including Indiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains here in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The proposed maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's\u00a0 district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "On Nov. 18, a three-judge panel in the U.S. District Court in El Paso blocked Texas from using the maps approved by the legislature in August. The court said that the plaintiffs will likely succeed in showing that race predominated over partisanship in the map-making process, and said the state legislature appears to have set and followed a racial target.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. They've held two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",
      "North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest \u2014 it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.",
      "In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.",
      "In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic.",
      "Utah redistricting",
      "Utah's redistricting is different from the other states' campaigns, starting with the fact that the state does not have any Democratic members of Congress. The redistricting push also wasn't kicked off by Mr. Trump and Republicans or in retaliation for moves by other states. Utah's 2025 redistricting was put in motion this summer when a judge ruled the current districts were in violation of a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature put forward four maps for public comment, and ultimately on Oct. 6 approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. The legislature proposed a map that will split Salt Lake County into two districts, which would make Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.",
      "But a district court judge in Utah on Nov. 10 rejected redistricting maps selected by the Republican-controlled legislature and instead selected a map that would create a Democratic-leaning congressional district in Salt Lake City. The map approved by the legislature \"does not comply with Utah law,\" wrote 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson in her opinion. She continued that \"based on the evidence presented,\" the Legislature map \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"",
      "Utah currently has four representatives in Congress, all of whom are Republicans. Both senators are also Republicans. The maps enacted by Gibson create a new district encompassing Salt Lake City that would be 62% Democratic, based on the 2024 presidential results.",

    "summary": "A federal court ordered Texas to use House district lines adopted in 2021 for next year's congressional elections.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal court on Tuesday blocked Texas from using its newly redrawn congressional map in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, a setback for Republicans as they work to maintain their narrow majority in the House.",
      "In a decision authored by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, the court\u00a0ordered the state to instead use House district lines adopted by the Texas legislature in 2021 for next year's congressional elections. The dispute was heard by a three-judge panel, which divided 2-1 in finding that voting rights and advocacy groups that challenged the redistricting plan were likely to prove that the 2025 map is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "The court found that plaintiffs will likely succeed in showing that race predominated over partisanship in the map-making process, and said the state legislature appears to have set and followed a racial target.",
      "\"The public perception of this case is that it's about politics. To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map,\" Brown, appointed to the federal bench by President Trump in 2019, wrote. \"But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said the decision will be appealed directly to the Supreme Court.",
      "\"Legislature redrew our congressional maps to better reflect Texans' conservative voting preferences \u2013 and for no other reason. Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" he said in a statement. \"This ruling is clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.\"",
      "Still, the ruling marks an early blow for Republicans and Mr. Trump, who had urged Texas state lawmakers to engage in a mid-decade redrawing of their House map in order to bolster the GOP's chances of holding onto its majority in the lower chamber.",
      "\"A federal court just stopped one of the most brazen attempts to steal our democracy that Texas has ever seen,\" Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu said in a statement. \"Greg Abbott and his Republican cronies tried to silence Texans' voices to placate Donald Trump, but now have delivered him absolutely nothing.\"",
      "The map approved by the Texas legislature, which was signed by Abbott in August, redraws the state's congressional districts to create five GOP-friendly seats. The effort in Texas kicked off a redistricting battle that has expanded to other states. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, pushed to recraft his state's voting boundaries, and voters there approved a ballot measure earlier this month to draw new congressional districts. The map unveiled by California Democrats shifts five of the state's House seats to be more favorable to Democrats in next year's midterm elections.",
      "In both Missouri and North Carolina, state GOP lawmakers have approved new maps that target a single Democratic-held district in each state. But the battles over House district lines have also sparked court fights that seek to block the updated maps from taking effect.",
      "Under the original lines adopted by Texas' GOP-led legislature in the wake of the 2020 Census, Republicans hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats, while Democrats control 12. The death of Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, has left one seat open. Those voting lines enacted in 2021 were used in the 2022 and 2024 House elections.",
      "But with the GOP holding a razor-thin majority in the House, and Republicans at risk of losing their hold on the lower chamber, Mr. Trump's political team began pushing Texas GOP leaders earlier this year to explore redrawing the state's congressional map. That effort picked up steam after the Justice Department sent Abbott a letter in July alleging that some of the districts in the 2021 map were racial gerrymanders that violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment.",
      "The letter from Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, threatened legal action if Texas didn't dismantle and re-configure four Democratic-held congressional districts, which she said were unconstitutional.",
      "Abbott then added redistricting to the agenda for a special session of the state legislature and directed state lawmakers to draw a new congressional map to address the Justice Department's concerns. The new redistricting plan, signed by Abbott in August, creates five new districts that are favorable to Republicans.",
      "Soon after the map received the green-light from state Republicans, a coalition of advocacy groups moved to block the state from using it in the upcoming House elections. The plaintiffs argued that Texas lawmakers engaged in an unconstitutional racial gerrymander when redrawing the lines, while the state said it relied exclusively on politics, not race, during the latest redistricting process.",
      "The federal court in El Paso held a nine-day trial last month to address the claims and found that the nonprofit organizations were likely to prevail on their racial-gerrymandering claims.",
      "Brown wrote in his decision that the Justice Department, in its July letter, directed Texas to engage in racial gerrymandering when it ordered the state to rectify districts that it deemed problematic. The court said the Justice Department's letter effectively imposed a 50% racial target for Texas to meet when drawing congressional district lines.",
      "Brown also pointed to Abbott's actions in response to the letter, including his decision to add redistricting to the legislative agenda for the special session and his public statements.",
      "\"The Governor explicitly directed the Legislature to redistrict based on race. In press appearances, the Governor plainly and expressly disavowed any partisan objective and instead repeatedly stated that his goal was to eliminate coalition districts and create new majority-Hispanic districts,\" Brown wrote in his 160-page decision evaluating the redrawn map. \"The legislature adopted those racial objectives.\"",
      "The court said that supporters of the new redistricting plan also made numerous statements that suggested they retooled the district lines to create more majority-Hispanic and majority-Black districts.",
      "The judges also rejected any concerns that it is blocking the new map too close to the election. Courts typically avoid ordering late changes election rules to protect against voter confusion and disruption. But Brown wrote that if the new House districts can remain in place, voters will be forced to vote under a map that likely sorts them on the basis of race, depriving them of their right to participate in a \"free and fair election.\"",
      "Additionally, because the candidate-filing deadline is Dec. 8, the court said that the 2026 congressional election is not yet underway.",
      "\"To allow legislatures to redistrict as close to elections as possible while limiting the courts' ability to review the constitutionality of that action \u2014 even in extraordinary cases like this one\u2014 would unduly tip the balance of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches and impair the effectiveness of the Constitution's protections of voting rights,\" Brown wrote for the court.",

    "summary": "The bill aims to impose restrictions on ballroom donors seeking to influence the administration.",
    "story": [
      "Democrats on Tuesday introduced legislation to put guardrails around private donations to fund construction on White House grounds and the vice president's residence.",
      "The bill, which comes in response to President Trump soliciting private money to fund a $300 million East Wing ballroom, is sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.",
      "The bill aims to impose restrictions on donors seeking to influence the administration in power and would require transparency. It would prohibit the president from soliciting donations, ban the display of donor names, bar donors from remaining anonymous and institute a two-year \"cooling-off period\" in which donors would be prohibited from lobbying the government.",
      "The bill, called \"Stop Ballroom Bribery Act,\" would also prevent donations from businesses or individuals with business before the government \u2014 including those facing federal litigation or enforcement actions.",
      "Several firms that donated to the 90,000-square-foot ballroom project have pending business before the government, like mergers requiring Justice Department approval or federal contracts hanging in the balance.",
      "\"Americans shouldn't have to wonder whether President Trump is building a ballroom to facilitate a pay-to-play scheme for political favor,\" Warren said.",
      "With Republican majorities in both chambers, the bill faces long odds. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, co-sponsored the legislation.",
      "\"President Trump has put a 'for sale' sign on the White House\u2014soliciting hundreds of millions of dollars from special interests to fund his $300 million vanity project. Our measure is a direct response to Trump's ballroom boondoggle,\" Blumenthal said.",
      "The White House did not reply to a request for comment on the bill. In the Oval Office Tuesday, President Trump said the new, larger ballroom would be useful to host more guests at official dinners \u2014 like the one Tuesday night in honor of the Saudi crown prince. He said people were excluded from the event due to space limitations.",
      "In late October and early November, Blumenthal sent letters to more than 40 individuals, foundations and companies that supported the White House ballroom. Blumenthal sought answers about how much firms like Amazon and Comcast had poured into the project and whether they had the option to remain anonymous.",
      "So far, just 16 donors have replied. Their responses mention corporate civic pride and compliance with federal law, but offer few details about their financial contributions or substantive answers to the senator's questions, according to congressional sources.",
      "Microsoft was a bit more forthcoming than most. It said it was contacted by a fundraiser about making a donation in late September, according to the congressional source. The tech giant was given information about how to donate and an invitation to a dinner for supporters.",
      "That dinner was held in the White House's East Room on Oct. 15. Several Microsoft executives were on the guest list, according to CBS News sources.",
      "Amazon said it started talking to fundraisers in August, not long after the project was announced, according to the congressional source. Amazon vice president of public policy Brian Huseman was the company's representative at the October dinner, sources said.",
      "NVIDIA told Blumenthal that it requested that the Trust for the National Mall, the nonprofit collecting donations, notify NVIDIA before making public statements about the company, according to the congressional source.",
      "Among those who replied to Blumenthal are Amazon, Apple, The Betty Wold Johnson Foundation, Booz Allen, Coinbase, Comcast, Google, HP, Meta, Micron Technology, Microsoft, NVIDIA, The Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Foundation, Reynolds, Ripple and T-Mobile.",
      "None of the firms or foundations specified how much money they contributed to the cause.",
      "Blumenthal is the top Democrat on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the investigative arm of the Senate's Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.",
      "Without a subpoena, firms and individual donors are not compelled to provide detailed answers to Blumenthal's questions. Responses are entirely voluntary.",
      "Congressional Democrats have written at least nine letters seeking more information about the ballroom.",

      "Former Treasury Secretary and Harvard President Larry Summers said Monday he will step back from \"public commitments\" after messages between him and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were released last week.",
      "\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,\" Summers said in a statement. \"While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me.\"",
      "Dozens of messages between Summers and Epstein were included in a trove of documents from Epstein's estate that was released by the House Oversight Committee last week.",
      "The emails show Summers and Epstein communicated regularly during the last years of Epstein's life, even as the accused sex trafficker's public infamy and notoriety grew. Many of the messages were from the late 2010s, well after Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida, but before he was charged with sex trafficking in federal court and taken into custody in July 2019.",
      "In one March 2019 exchange, the pair appeared to banter about a woman that Summers knew in London, with Epstein seeming to offer advice to the Harvard professor.",
      "\"I said what are you up to,\" Summers wrote in part of one message, describing a conversation with the woman. \"She said 'I'm busy.' I said awfully coy u are.\"",
      "Epstein's reply read, in part: \"shes smart. making you pay for past errors.\"",
      "In a separate conversation, Epstein appears to call himself Summers' \"wing man.\"",
      "There is no evidence of illegal conduct on the part of Summers.",
      "It's not clear what public commitments Summers will call off. An economist by training, he has remained a professor at Harvard University since stepping down as the Ivy League school's president in 2006. He currently teaches two classes at the Harvard Kennedy School on globalization and U.S. economic policy, according to the school's course catalog.",
      "A former Treasury Secretary during the Clinton administration, Summers is an influential voice on economic policy. He advised former President Barack Obama during the financial crisis, and he publicly tangled with the Biden administration over its approach to post-COVID-19 economic stimulus.",
      "Epstein's ties with Harvard were well known. The late financier donated upward of $9 million to the university prior to his 2008 guilty plea in Florida, Harvard found in a 2020 investigation. The school said it didn't accept donations from Epstein after that, but he continued to engage with faculty and visit the school dozens of times",
      "CBS News has reached out to Harvard for comment.",
      "President Trump called on the Justice Department last week to investigate Epstein's relationships with Summers, former President Bill Clinton and other high-profile Democrats. A spokesperson for former President Clinton said he wasn't aware of Epstein's actions and didn't do anything wrong.",
      "Mr. Trump's own relationship with Epstein has also drawn intense scrutiny. The two men traveled in the same Manhattan and Palm Beach social circles for a period of time, but Mr. Trump says he cut ties many years ago. The president hasn't been charged with a crime or been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Epstein regularly brought up Mr. Trump in the emails that were released last week. In one correspondence, Epstein said of the president, \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" referring to Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing related to Epstein, and has called the controversy over it a \"hoax\" perpetuated by Democrats.",

      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",
      "The universe, it turns out, might be a bit absurd, but what an interesting ride!",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/breast-cancer-birth-control-study-science/",
    "published": "Sat, 15 Nov 2025 07:00:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The study sought to answer questions about how breast cancer risk differs by type of hormonal contraceptive. Doctors say the results won't change how they counsel patients.",
    "story": [
      "As misinformation about women's health spreads faster than ever, doctors say new research on the risks of hormonal birth control underscores the challenge of communicating nuance in the social media age.",
      "The massive study, which was conducted in Sweden and tracked more than two million teenage girls and women under age 50 for more than a decade, found that hormonal contraception remains safe overall, but also found small differences in breast cancer risk based on the hormones used in the formulation. In addition, the researchers observed a small, short-term rise in breast cancer diagnoses among current or recent users. Those findings are consistent with prior large studies, including a 2017 Danish registry analysis and a 2023 meta-analysis.",
      "It was published online Oct. 30 in JAMA Oncology.",
      "Doctors say these study results won't change how they advise patients and that women should not stop using their birth control.",
      "Still, TikTok is flooded with factually incomplete warnings that contraceptives cause cancer and are as dangerous as smoking. Reproductive health advocates warn that studies like this can easily be taken out of context online and be reduced to a single alarming number.",
      "Case in point: The study reported that women who had used hormonal birth control had about a 24% higher rate of breast cancer than women who hadn't. But because breast cancer is still uncommon in younger women, that works out to an increase from roughly 54 to 67 breast cancer cases per 100,000 women per year \u2014 about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women, or about one extra case per 7,800 users of hormonal contraceptives per year.",
      "Co-authors \u00c5sa Johansson and Dr. Fatemeh Hadizadeh, epidemiologists at Uppsala University, said the rise is modest and short-term, with risk highest during current use and fading within five to 10 years after stopping.",
      "Rachel Fey \u2014 interim co-CEO of Power to Decide, a group whose mission is to provide accurate information on sexual health and contraceptive methods \u2014 said that kind of nuance is exactly what tends to disappear on social media. \"I get really angry at this because it's designed to scare people like me away from birth control, which has made my life so much better in so many ways,\" she said. \"It's really frustrating \u2026 especially when it's given without context. And then in this era of social media, it can just take off without anybody who knows what they're talking about providing that context.\"",
      "The researchers also found the risk was slightly higher with certain progestins such as desogestrel \u2014 found in combined oral contraceptives like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, and Pimtrea \u2014 but did not increase with others, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, sold under the brand name Depo\u2011Provera.",
      "How to interpret the findings",
      "Some experts say the results should be viewed with care because the study counted both invasive breast cancers and early, noninvasive lesions known as in situ tumors, growths that may never become life-threatening. Including these precancerous cases could make the overall risk of clinically significant disease appear higher than it is.",
      "\"A substantial proportion of the 'cases' would never have progressed to invasive breast cancer,\" said Lina S. M\u00f8rch, a senior researcher and team leader at the Danish Cancer Institute. M\u00f8rch was not associated with the Swedish study. She added that experts should wait for more data separating early-stage and advanced cancers before making new rules or warnings about specific hormones.",
      "The doctor-patient conversation",
      "Even as scientists debate how to interpret the finer points of the data, physicians emphasize that for most patients, the study reinforces what they already discuss in the exam room: that hormonal birth control is broadly safe, and decisions should be tailored to each woman's needs and values.",
      "Dr. Katharine White, chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston Medical Center, said this study won't change how she talks to her patients.",
      "\"When counseling patients about their contraceptive options, I focus on their past experiences with birth control, their medical history, and what's important to them about their birth control method and pregnancy planning (if applicable),\" White wrote in an email. \"Side effects and risks of methods are already a key part of my counseling about both hormonal and non-hormonal methods.\"",
      "Other doctors noted there are other contraceptive options.",
      "Dr. Eleanor Bimla Schwarz, chief of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said, \"For those who prefer hormone-free contraception, the copper IUD offers safe, convenient, highly effective contraception for over a decade after placement, and is rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired,\" referring to a type of long-acting intrauterine device.",
      "Dr. Mary Rosser, director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said this was a large, high-quality study that looked at many types of hormones over many years. But she added that doctors shouldn't change their advice yet.",
      "Johansson and Hadizadeh stressed that the results should guide shared decision-making, not cause alarm. \"It may be reasonable to consider formulations associated with lower observed risk in our data,\" they said. They noted that products containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, or levonorgestrel were linked to lower risk, while long-term use of desogestrel-only contraceptives might be best avoided when other options fit.",
      "Keeping the risk in perspective",
      "Hormonal birth control provides many health benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. It can lighten heavy periods, ease pain from endometriosis, and lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers for years after stopping. M\u00f8rch noted that even small risks are worth discussing but said decisions should be guided by women's \"values and preferences.\"",
      "White said it's important to see the big picture. \"The risk of an unintended pregnancy is 85% for people who do not use contraception\u2014so any risks of birth control need to be weighed against the risk of an unexpected pregnancy,\" she wrote.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/largest-spider-web-discovered-cave-greece-albania-border/",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:12:09 -0500",
    "summary": "The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
    "story": [
      "What is thought to be the world's largest-known spider's web, housing tens of thousands of arachnids, has been discovered in a cave on the Albanian-Greek border.",
      "After researchers published their findings of two different spider species peacefully cohabiting in a giant colony nestled in a pitch-black, sulfur-rich cave, evolutionary biologist Lena Grinsted likened the \"extremely rare\" occurrence to humans living in an apartment block.",
      "\"When I saw this study, I was very excited because \u2026 group living is really rare in spiders,\" Grinsted, a senior lecturer at the U.K.'s University of Portsmouth, told The Associated Press. \"The fact that there was this massive colony of spiders living in a place that nobody had really noticed before \u2014 I find extremely exciting.\"",
      "The results of the study, published last month in the journal Subterranean Biology, spread rapidly online due to the striking images of the giant 1,140-square-foot spider's web, a carpet-thick sprawl stretching along a narrow passage wall inside Sulfur Cave, which extends into Albania from its entrance in Greece.",
      "This arachnophobe's worst nightmare was quickly labelled the \"world's largest spiderweb.\"",
      "But the most surprising thing about the spider colony \u2014 which boasts an estimated 110,000 spiders \u2014 had less to do with its size and more to do with what scientists found inside the huge mass of funnel-shaped webs.",
      "Two different spider species \u2014 about 69,000 Tegenaria domestica, or common house spider, and 42,000 Prinerigone vagans \u2014 were living side by side and thriving. The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
      "\"So often if you have spiders in close vicinity, they will fight and end up eating each other,\" said Grinsted, who was not part of the cave study but has extensively researched spiders. \"We can sometimes see that if there's an abundance of food that they sort of become a bit less aggressive.\"",
      "In addition to spiders, the terrestrial fauna in the cave include centipedes, terrestrial isopods, scorpions and beetles, the researchers said.",
      "\"In the stream passage located close to the cave entrance, a dense swarm of adult chironomid flies fills the air in the immediate vicinity of the sulfidic stream, and a large portion of the cave wall is covered by a massive colonial spider web,\" the study's authors write.",
      "Abundant food source",
      "Scientists are keen to understand how and why the two species came to coexist peacefully in a \"permanently dark zone\" about 160 feet from the entrance of the cave, carved out by the waters of the Sarandaporo River to form the Vromoner Canyon. (The study's authors note that Vromoner means \"smelly water\" in Greek.)",
      "Part of the answer, the research suggests, may lie in the combination of the estimated 2.4 million midge flies that buzz around the spider colony \u2014 an \"unusually dense swarm\" that provides a constant food source in an otherwise predator-scarce environment. The scientists also speculate that the friendly living arrangement could be a result of darkness impairing the spiders' vision.",
      "However, Grinsted says it is more likely that the larger spiders evolved or simply grew accustomed to responding to vibratory cues when the small flies land on their silken web \u2014 and maybe don't attack otherwise.",
      "\"Spiders, in general, are not particularly good at seeing stuff ... and that includes these two species,\" she said. She added that the two species might cooperate \"to some extent in building the web \u2026 but I think it's highly unlikely that they cooperate in anything else like prey capture, in brood care, or looking after each other's babies.\"",
      "Grinsted draws parallels between the cohabiting spiders and how humans tend to coexist in apartment blocks.",
      "\"You're very happy to share the stairs, the lift,\" she said. \"But if anybody comes into your living room and you haven't invited them, you'll be aggressive towards them.\"",
      "She added that while many spiders are \"typically solitary, very aggressive\" toward other critters, the cohabitation of two species is \"relatively common\" once spiders have evolved the ability to live in groups.",
      "\"But again, because these two species have never been found to live together and never been found to live in groups, it makes it particularly exciting,\" she said.",
      "\"The web is dense \u2014 like a blanket\"",
      "Blerina Vrenozi, a biologist and zoologist at the University of Tirana, in Albania, who co-authored the research paper, told the AP that the expeditions this year helped understand \"how this mystery existed in there.\"",
      "\"The DNA is interesting because they revealed that the species which live inside the cave is different from the one which lives outside the cave,\" she said. \"So it's the same species, but different DNA.\"",
      "The cave colony's giant web was first observed in 2021 by a team of Czech speleologists led by Marek Audy. A year later, the Czech team expanded to include scientists from multiple universities, which led to the recently published scientific paper.",
      "\"The web is dense; it's more like a blanket, and when there's danger, the female crawls back and hides, and no creature of a higher order can dig her out of there,\" Audy said. \"Spiders in the cave lay about a third of the eggs compared to spiders that live outdoors. Because it's certain that they will raise their offspring there \u2026 so they can afford to lay fewer eggs.\"",
      "Audy added that the cave, which is also home to large bat colonies, also thrive on the abundance of midges inside the humid, dark space. \"They are constantly having a party there, both the spiders and the bats,\" he said.",
      "Seemingly ideal environment",
      "The study noted that the methodology used might \"slightly overestimate\" the total population count of spiders in the colony, as some funnel webs may be abandoned or unoccupied. However, other experts agree that the team's exciting new research could offer broader evolutionary clues and deserves deeper study.",
      "Sara Goodacre, professor of evolutionary biology and genetics at the School of Life Sciences, at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, says these kinds of research projects help pave the way for more studies that could prove \"fundamental to our understanding of what forces shape the world around us \u2014 spidery or not.\"",
      "\"Natural selection will favor the 'best' strategies \u2026 the 'winning strategy,' whatever this is,\" she said. \"My guess is that the benefits of being part of this community far outweigh the costs.\"",
      "She added that if the dynamics in the seemingly ideal environment of abundant food and relative safety were to change, \"then 'freeloading' will emerge and it will all break down.\"",
      "The politics of coexistence will hopefully not prove trickier above ground. Audy said that Albania has already asked which side the newly famous spiders lie.",
      "\"From a conservation point of view, we did something interesting there and marked out a border,\" he said. \"I just looked into it \u2014 and the spider web is on the Greek side.\"",
      "The discovery of the massive web comes just months after Australian scientists discovered a new species of the deadly funnel-web spider that is bigger and more venomous than its relatives, nicknaming it \"Big Boy.\"",

    "story": [
      "A woman has pleaded guilty to falsely reporting that her astronaut ex-wife committed a crime while deployed to the International Space Station.",
      "Summer Heather Worden, 50, told law enforcement in July 2019 that her former spouse had illegally accessed her bank account earlier that year while she was in space, according to a news release from the Department of Justice. Her wife, previously identified as astronaut\u00a0Anne McClain, was at the ISS from December 2018 to June 2019. It was the first allegation of a crime being committed in space.",
      "An investigation by NASA's Office of the Inspector General found that Worden had opened the bank account in April 2018 and that both she and McClain had access to it until January 2019, the Justice Department said. The investigation also found that Worden had regularly given McClain access to her bank records, including login credentials, from at least 2015, the news release said.",
      "McClain said in 2019 that she had accessed the bank account with Worden's permission, The New York Times reported. Worden, a former Air Force intelligence officer, disputed that claim and filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. A complaint filed to NASA's Office of Inspector General by Worden's family accused McClain of identity theft and improper access.",
      "McClain denied the allegations\u00a0on social media\u00a0and said that she and Worden had \"been going through a painful, personal separation that's now unfortunately in the media.\"",
      "Worden pleaded guilty to one count of lying to law enforcement on Nov. 13. She will be sentenced in February 2026. Worden faces up to 5 years in federal prison, as well as a maximum possible fine of $250,000, and remains on bond pending the hearing.",
      "McClain returned to the International Space Station in 2025. She participated in a spacewalk during the mission, years after she was set to take part in NASA's first all-female spacewalk, which was delayed at the last minute because there were not enough suits available after she requested a size adjustment.

    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched a joint NASA-European environmental research satellite early Monday, the second in an ongoing billion-dollar project to measure long-term changes in sea level, a key indicator of climate change.",
      "The first satellite, known as Sentinel-6 and named in honor of NASA climate researcher Michael Freilich, was launched in November 2020. The latest spacecraft, Sentinel-6B, was launched from California atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 12:21 a.m. EST.",
      "Both satellites are equipped with a sophisticated cloud-penetrating radar. By timing how long it takes beams to bounce back from the ocean 830 miles below, the Sentinel-6 satellites can track sea levels to an accuracy of about one inch while also measuring wave height and wind speeds.",
      "The project builds on earlier missions dating back to the early 1990s that have provided an uninterrupted stream of sea level data.",
      "That data indicates sea levels are slowly but surely rising, widely interpreted as evidence of global warming caused in large part by human industrial activity.",
      "But in keeping with recent Trump administration policies aimed at scaling back climate research and the interpretation of such data, NASA did not directly refer to \"climate change\" or \"global warming\" in a Sentinel-6B pre-launch briefing Saturday.",
      "In the press kit released by NASA for the first Sentinel 6 mission in 2020, the first item in a \"need to know list\" said the satellite would \"provide information that will help researchers understand how climate change is reshaping Earth's coastlines \u2014 and how fast this is happening.\"",
      "In the press kit for the Sentinel 6B mission launched Monday, NASA's first \"need to know\" item said simply that \"Sentinel-6B will contribute to a multi-decade dataset that is ... key to helping improve public safety, city planning and protecting commercial and defense interests.\"",
      "Karen St. Germain, director of NASA's Earth Science Division, did not directly mention climate change in the Saturday briefing, focusing instead on the practical importance of monitoring sea levels.",
      "\"Sentinel 6B is the latest in a line of missions stretching over three decades, keeping an uninterrupted watch over our planet's sea surface height, finding patterns and advancing our understanding of planet Earth,\" she said.",
      "She said the data provided by the Sentinel-6 satellites \"underpins navigation, search and rescue and industries like commercial fishing and shipping. These measurements form the basis for U.S. flood predictions for coastal infrastructure, real estate, energy storage sites and other assets along our shoreline.\"",
      "The data, she continued, will help scientists \"understand and predict coastal erosion and salt water encroachment into inland supplies of water that are used for agriculture, irrigation as well as municipal drinking water.\"",
      "Regardless of interpretation, the launch of Sentinel-6B went off without a hitch.",
      "After blasting off from launch complex 4E at the Vandenberg Space Force Base, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage powered the vehicle out of the dense lower atmosphere, separated and flew itself back to a landing pad at the California launch site.",
      "The upper stage then carried out two firings of its single engine before releasing the 2,600-pound Sentinel-6B into an 830-mile-high orbit tilted 66 degrees to the equator, the same orbit used by Sentinel-6A and earlier sea level-monitoring spacecraft.",
      "Taking 112 minutes to complete one orbit, the solar-powered satellite will fly over locations between 66 degrees north and south latitude, covering 90 percent of the world's oceans.",
      "Along with measuring sea levels, the new satellite will monitor temperature and humidity in the lower atmosphere as well as the higher-altitude stratosphere using an instrument that measures atmospheric effects on signals broadcast by navigation satellites.",
      "But the primary mission is monitoring Earth's changing sea levels.",
      "\"The dynamic balance that persisted before the industrial revolution has been upset by the almost instantaneous combustion of huge reserves of carbon as our society has developed,\" Craig Donlon, a European Space Agency project scientist, said before the first Sentinel-6 launch in 2020.",
      "\"We see evidence of this dramatic change in many different measurements ... but they all point the same direction: the Earth is warming. And the greatest indicator of this Earth system imbalance is sea level rise.\"",
      "The Sentinel-6 satellites are the result of a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "St. Germain said NASA's share of the cost for both Sentinel-6 satellites came to about $500 million. The Europeans contributed a similar amount.",

    "summary": "Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, plans to challenge SpaceX with the powerful, partially reusable New Glenn rocket.",
    "story": [
      "Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket Thursday, putting two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The centerpiece of Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos' space ambitions, the towering 321-foot-tall New Glenn rocket's seven methane-burning main engines ignited at 3:55 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the booster skyward atop 3.8 million pounds of thrust.",
      "The launch came three days late due to stormy weather on Earth and in space, where a powerful solar storm buffeted Earth's atmosphere with a torrent of high-energy radiation that could have caused electrical problems with the rocket or its payloads.",
      "The storm had abated by launch time Wednesday, and Blue Origin employees, looking on from viewing sites several miles from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch pad, cheered and applauded as the booster climbed skyward, followed moments later by the booming roar of its engines sweeping across the Space Coast.",
      "The New Glenn's maiden flight last January successfully boosted a  Blue Origin payload into orbit, but the reusable first stage failed in  its attempt to reach an offshore landing ship, named after Bezos'  mother, Jacklyn.",
      "The 188-foot-tall first stage launched Wednesday,  nicknamed \"Never Tell Me The Odds,\" featured a variety of upgrades to  improve performance. This time around, the big rocket flew itself to an  on-target touchdown, prompting more cheers and applause from Blue Origin  workers.",
      "Much like returning SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets, the larger New Glenn booster will be hauled back to Port Canaveral and, depending on its condition, be refurbished and readied for use on an upcoming New Glenn flight.",
      "The second stage, meanwhile, pressed ahead, carrying out two firings of its twin engines to reach the planned Earth-escape trajectory. Thirty-three minutes after liftoff, the ESCAPADE satellites were released to fly on their own.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission. The acronym stands for Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers.",
      "The probes were built for UC Berkeley by Rocketlab under a NASA program intended to develop lower-cost, fast-track planetary missions.",
      "ESCAPADE cost $107.4 million, a bargain compared to the cost of more traditional, more sophisticated planetary spacecraft that can cost hundreds of millions to well over a billion dollars each.",
      "The ESCAPADE probes were originally expected to hitch a ride to Mars a few years ago with NASA's Psyche asteroid probe. But for a variety of reasons, the Mars satellites mission ultimately ended up on New Glenn's second flight.",
      "Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "To make Wednesday's New Glenn launch work in 2025, mission planners with Advanced Space LLC came up with an innovative flight plan, one that will take Blue and Gold longer to reach Mars but will enable more flexible trajectories for future missions.",
      "The probes were deployed on a trajectory that will carry them a million miles out, well past the moon's orbit, where they will loiter for the next 11 months before heading back toward Earth.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars.",
      "In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "\"We are using a very flexible ... approach where we go into a loiter orbit around Earth in order to sort of wait until Earth and Mars are lined up correctly in November of next year to go to Mars,\" said Robert Lillis, the principal investigator.",
      "\"This is an exciting, flexible way to get to Mars because in the future ... we could potentially queue up spacecraft using the approach that ESCAPADE is pioneering\" without having to wait for a planetary launch window to open, Lillis said.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",
      "Working in tandem, first in the same orbit at different distances from each other and then from different altitudes, Blue and Gold will measure how the solar wind and energetic electrons and protons from solar storms interact with the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Data from earlier Mars satellites showed the planet's atmosphere is constantly being stripped by those interactions, but exactly how that happens over time is not fully understood.",
      "\"We really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,\" Lillis said. \"We know that atmospheric escape from Mars is a major driver for the evolution of the Martian climate. We know that Mars at least was episodically warm and wet for a couple billion years, but hasn't been so for about 2 billion years or so. And we think atmospheric escape is a major reason for that.\"",
      "Blue and Gold will provide what amounts to a stereo view of those processes.",
      "\"If you only have one spacecraft, you can either measure what the sun is throwing at Mars, the so-called space weather environment upstream of Mars, or you can measure the conditions close to Mars in its upper atmosphere, where the atmosphere is escaping,\" Lillis said.",
      "\"You can't be in two places at once. But we can, because we have two spacecraft to do this. So we can really get that cause-and-effect at the same time. We've never had that before, and that's really exciting,\" Lillis said.",

    "story": [
      "Roblox, the popular online gaming platform that hosts millions of user-created games, said Tuesday it is strengthening protections for minors.",
      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age. The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",
      "Roblox in September outlined plans to expand age checks for all users who want to access communication features on the gaming platform. The guardrails are meant to limit communication between adults and minors unless they already know each other in the real world.",

    "summary": "The stock market has stumbled on concerns that the surge in artificial intelligence stocks could echo the dot-com bubble.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",

      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Nov 2025 15:05:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

    "summary": "State-sponsored cybercriminals used Anthropic's tech to target tech companies, financial institutions and other organizations, AI company alleges.",
    "story": [
      "Anthropic said Thursday that Chinese hackers used its artificial intelligence technology in what the company believes is the first cyberespionage operation largely carried out using AI.",
      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",
      "\"We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said in a statement.",
      "The San Francisco-based company shared its findings with CBS News but did not offer additional comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services. AI agents are cheaper than professional hackers and can operate quickly at a larger scale, making them particularly attractive to cybercriminals, MIT Technology Review\u00a0has pointed out.",
      "Chris Krebs, the former head of the federal government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS Mornings on Friday that this attack is a sign of what's to come.",
      "\"As security experts, we've been talking about events and attacks like this for close to a decade,\" he said. To see an AI cyberattack come to life like this is \"pretty chilling,\" he added.",

    "summary": "Google said the fake messages are part of a massive criminal network called \"Lighthouse\" that has stolen information through phishing and smishing scams.",
    "story": [
      "Google is filing a federal lawsuit against a network of foreign cybercriminals based in China that is accused of launching massive text-message phishing attacks, the tech giant told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Google said the messages are part of a criminal network called \"Lighthouse.\" The texts look legitimate, often warning recipients of a \"stuck package\" or an \"unpaid toll,\" but they're actually phishing or what's called smishing \u2014 a type of phishing scam that uses text messages to try to trick recipients into revealing personal and sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, which are then stolen.",
      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",
      "DeLaine Prado said Google has filed what it calls a first-of-its-kind lawsuit under the RICO Act, which is typically used to take down organized crime rings.",
      "The case targets unknown operators \u2014 listed as John Does 1 through 25 \u2014 who allegedly built a \"phishing-as-a-service\" platform to power mass text attacks.",
      "DeLaine Prado said the lawsuit is not meant specifically to help victims recover any losses, but rather to serve as a \"deterrent for future criminals to create similar enterprises.\"",
      "Google said it found more than 100 fake sites using its logo to trick people into handing over passwords or credit card numbers. According to its complaint, it estimates the group has stolen sensitive information linked to tens of millions of credit cards in the U.S. alone.",
      "In an update on Nov. 13, Google said its request for a temporary restraining order \"was granted just hours after the complaint was filed, and the Lighthouse operation is now essentially dark.\"",
      "Kevin Gosschalk, the CEO of cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, said that while recovering lost money is a challenge, lawsuits like Google's could help disrupt scammers' operations.",
      "\"It has an impact on the ecosystem,\" Gosschalk told CBS News. He said that if there are three major players and you go after the big one and take it down, \"then the other two start second-guessing, 'Hey, should we be in this business, or should we get out of this business?'\"",
      "Google's move appears aimed as much at setting a legal precedent as at seeking punishment \u2014 testing whether a 1970s racketeering law can be applied to a 21st-century digital crime.",
      "Gosschalk said it will be very hard for Google to go after cybercriminals overseas since a lot of them also operate in countries like Cambodia, where there are limited extradition laws.",
      "\"But it does mean the individuals behind those things will not be able to travel to the U.S. in the future, so it does add extra risk,\" Gosschalk said.",
      "Users can avoid text scams by not clicking links or replying to unknown messages. On an iPhone, users can turn on \"Filter Unknown Senders\" and \"Filter Junk.\" On Android, enable Spam Protection and forward scam texts to 7726 (SPAM).",
      "Note that those filters can also catch legitimate messages from numbers that are not in the phone's contact list, so be sure to check the unknown senders or spam folder once in a while.",

      "Summer Heather Worden, 50, told law enforcement in July 2019 that her former spouse had illegally accessed her bank account earlier that year while she was in space, according to a news release from the Department of Justice. Her wife, previously identified as astronaut\u00a0Anne McClain, was at the ISS from December 2018 to June 2019. It was the first allegation of a crime being committed in space.",
      "An investigation by NASA's Office of the Inspector General found that Worden had opened the bank account in April 2018 and that both she and McClain had access to it until January 2019, the Justice Department said. The investigation also found that Worden had regularly given McClain access to her bank records, including login credentials, from at least 2015, the news release said.",
      "McClain said in 2019 that she had accessed the bank account with Worden's permission, The New York Times reported. Worden, a former Air Force intelligence officer, disputed that claim and filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. A complaint filed to NASA's Office of Inspector General by Worden's family accused McClain of identity theft and improper access.",
      "McClain denied the allegations\u00a0on social media\u00a0and said that she and Worden had \"been going through a painful, personal separation that's now unfortunately in the media.\"",

      "McClain returned to the International Space Station in 2025. She participated in a spacewalk during the mission, years after she was set to take part in NASA's first all-female spacewalk, which was delayed at the last minute because there were not enough suits available after she requested a size adjustment.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Wednesday formally sent to the Senate a bill that would force the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the final procedural move before the legislation can be sent to President Trump for his signature.",
      "After the House passed the measure in a 427-1 vote on Tuesday, the Senate approved the bill unanimously before it could even be formally transmitted from the lower chamber. With the transmission of the bill Wednesday morning, the bill is formally considered passed, and now heads to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "Mr. Trump, who had initially expressed opposition to the release of the files, is expected to sign the measure into law, after he changed his tune Sunday and urged Republicans to vote in favor of the bill.",
      "With his signature, the Justice Department, FBI and U.S. attorney's offices would be forced to release their files related to Epstein, his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell and other entities connected to them within 30 days. Survivors' personal information and other sensitive material can be withheld or redacted with explanations to Congress.",
      "A long path to passage",
      "The final hurdles for the bill come months after the effort began. After the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures in July, interest in the files has swelled, sparking widespread calls for greater transparency from the Trump administration.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced legislation in July that would require the Justice Department to release the Epstein files within 30 days. And when Congress returned from recess in September, Massie filed a discharge petition to force a vote on the bill, circumventing GOP leadership. The petition, which required 218 signatures, picked up support from all Democrats and four Republicans, but the final signature needed remained out of reach as Rep. Adelita Grijalva's swearing in was delayed during the government shutdown.",
      "Meanwhile, Republican leaders had pushed back on the discharge petition and underlying legislation, warning against the possible release of sensitive information while touting work from congressional committees to look into the Epstein files. But public pressure on lawmakers to force the release of the documents remained high.",
      "Last week, Grijalva was sworn in and became the final signature needed on the discharge petition and force a vote. On Wednesday, after Mr. Trump gave his blessing, the House voted almost unanimously in favor of the measure.",
      "The Senate quickly followed suit, unanimously agreeing to deem the bill passed once it arrived from the House.",
      "A GOP split",
      "The effort, and the Epstein issue more broadly, often divided Republicans, who faced conflicting pressure from constituents and the administration.",
      "Last week, the president lashed out at Republicans who pushed to release the files, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a long-time supporter. Mr. Trump reversed his endorsement of Greene, calling her a \"traitor,\" after she called his prior opposition to releasing the files a \"huge miscalculation.\"",
      "As the bill approached passage on Tuesday, Khanna spoke of the \"extraordinary political consequences\" suffered by Massie and Greene, along with other Republicans who supported the measure. And Greene lamented that the fight over the disclosure of the Epstein files had \"ripped MAGA apart.\"",
      "The issue also seemed to divide GOP leaders. Johnson led the charge against it in Congress. On Tuesday, even as he expressed concerns about the bill, the speaker voted to move it forward, saying that he expected the Senate to amend it and insisting that Senate Majority Leader John Thune do so. Thune did not, and the bill sailed through the Senate unanimously.",
      "Thune acknowledged Johnson's concerns to reporters ahead of the vote, saying, \"I think there are some things he'd like to change, but you got a 427 to 1 vote, it's probably not likely to happen.\" Johnson told reporters afterward, when asked whether he was frustrated with Thune, that \"I'm frustrated with the process, but I trust Leader Thune.\"",

      "Child care costs for parents with two kids exceed rental costs in 85 of the country's largest metro areas, personal finance site\u00a0LendingTree found. In Omaha, Neb., Milwaukee, Wis., and Buffalo, N.Y., which have the highest child care costs in the country relative to local rents, families with an infant and a 4-year-old under care on average pay more than double the cost of their rent.",
      "Families around the U.S. pay an average of $1,282 for full-time infant care, still below the average monthly cost to rent a two-bedroom unit, LendingTree's data shows. Families with two children, on the other hand, spend an average of $2,252 per month on child care.",
      "LendingTree, which determined how child care costs stack up against rent in 100 cities. compiled its findings using data from nonprofit group Child Care Aware of America and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Exorbitant child care costs are contributing to what amounts to a crisis of affordability for many Americans, who also face rising food, housing,\u00a0energy and\u00a0health care costs. A\u00a0survey\u00a0of roughly 3,000 people released this week by Brigham Young University and Deseret News found that 7 in 10 respondents said that raising children is unaffordable, a sentiment that has surged over the last decade.",

      "The financial strain of everyday life in the U.S., especially following the fierce inflation that erupted during the pandemic, has emerged as a political flashpoint this year.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 10:33:51 -0500",
    "summary": "In court Wednesday, former FBI Director James Comey is trying to have the criminal charges against him dismissed.",
    "story": [
      "Lawyers for former FBI Director James Comey is again confronting the Justice Department in a federal courtroom Wednesday, as Comey seeks to have the two-count federal indictment against him dismissed on the grounds that it is based on a \"vindictive and selective\" prosecution.",
      "The hearing is the second in two weeks stemming from Comey's bids to dismiss the criminal charges, which stem from testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee more than five years ago. Comey has pleaded not guilty to both charges and has argued that the prosecution is a result of Mr. Trump's efforts to target a political foe.",
      "In court filings last month, Comey's attorneys wrote that the charges were the result of an \"egregious abuse of power,\" and asserted there were \"multiple glaring constitutional violations\" in the indictment. They argued that Mr. Trump ordered prosecutors to charge Comey out of \"personal spite\" and because he \"frequently criticized the President,\" who fired Comey from his role leading the FBI in 2017 and has continued to attack him for years.",
      "Comey's legal team argued that \"absent a dismissal with prejudice, Mr. Comey would face a potential perpetual state of being vindictively prosecuted.\" If the case is dismissed with prejudice, prosecutors would not be able to re-file the charges.",
      "Defendants must clear a high bar in order to win the dismissal of an indictment on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive and selective.",
      "For vindictive prosecution, the defendant must show that the prosecutor acted with \"genuine animus\" toward him, and that prosecutor pursued charges to punish the defendant for exercising a protected right.",
      "In a claim of selective prosecution, the defendant must show that the government was motivated by a discriminatory purpose, either by demonstrating that similarly situated individuals were spared from prosecution or that the decision to bring charges was \"invidious or in bad faith.\"",
      "Comey's lawyers have argued in filings that direct evidence establishes that Mr. Trump harbors \"genuine animus\" toward Comey based on his protected speech and the president's \"arbitrary personal bias.\" The former FBI chief has repeatedly spoken out against Mr. Trump's conduct in office and in response, the president has \"resorted to personal attacks and calls to retaliate against Mr. Comey through punishment and imprisonment,\" defense lawyers wrote.",
      "To demonstrate the breadth of Mr. Trump's dislike of Comey, his lawyers provided the court with nearly 60 pages of social media posts from the president dating back to May 2017 in which he attacks and accuses the former FBI director of wrongdoing.",
      "\"As a private citizen, Mr. Comey has vigorously and prominently exercised his First Amendment right to criticize President Trump. In response, President Trump has repeatedly attacked and threatened Mr. Comey,\" Comey's lawyers wrote. \"That pattern began soon after Mr. Comey's May 2017 termination as FBI Director and has continued up until \u2014 and even after \u2014 the indictment in this case.\"",
      "Defense lawyers also highlighted the timing of Comey's indictment \u2014 sought days before the five-year statute of limitations expired \u2014 and the fact that it was pursued only after the president installed his former personal defense lawyer and White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who did not have any prosecutorial experience before being tapped to lead the Virginia prosecutors' office. She replaced Erik Siebert in the role, whose abrupt departure came amid concerns he would be removed for failing to bring a case against New York Attorney General Letitia James, another critic of the president.",
      "\"With the statute-of-limitations deadline looming and no career prosecutor \u2014 not even President Trump's own interim U.S. Attorney (Mr. Siebert) \u2014 willing to seek the indictment, the President took matters into his own hands by directing his Attorney General to seek 'JUSTICE' against Mr. Comey and to unlawfully appoint a White House aide who would prosecute this case. She then immediately did so,\" they wrote.",
      "Justice Department lawyers responded by arguing in court filings that Comey \"weaves a tale\" through \"news reports, social media posts, and speculation\" that does not meet the \"rigorous legal standard\" to dismiss the case.",
      "They argued that numerous high-ranking government officials have been prosecuted for lying to Congress about official actions. The department also argued that Comey has not alleged that Halligan, who sought the indictment, harbored animus against Comey, and there is no evidence that Mr. Trump displaced her as the decision-maker in bringing the prosecution.",
      "\"The true affront to the criminal justice system would be to allow the defendant to escape accountability for lying to and obstructing Congress under oath about actions he took while serving as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" prosecutors wrote. \"The indictment was presented by a duly appointed and unbiased prosecutor. And a duly constituted grand jury found probable cause that he committed the indicted offenses.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyers also pointed to Mr. Trump's years of social media posts about Comey, but said they show the president's view that Comey committed a crime preceded the former FBI director's public criticism of the president.",
      "They said Comey was prosecuted because of his \"extraordinary conduct\" and \"flagrant violation\" of the public's trust by allegedly lying to Congress.",
      "\"The Executive cannot be expected to ignore agency heads lying about official actions simply because they later become outspoken critics,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Comey's motion claiming selective and vindictive prosecution is one of several pursued by his defense team that aim to have the charges dismissed before the start of a trial.",
      "As proceedings have moved forward in the weeks since his indictment in late September, prosecutors have run into issues that could doom their case.",
      "On Monday, a federal magistrate judge took what he called the \"extraordinary remedy\" of ordering federal prosecutors to turn over all grand jury materials to Comey's defense team, citing a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in the case, including potential issues with how the Justice Department handled evidence used in the grand jury presentation and how Halligan conducted herself in front of the grand jury.",
      "The U.S. district judge handling the case, Michael Nachmanoff, has temporarily paused that order while the Justice Department appeals it.",
      "Comey's legal team also argued alongside New York Attorney General Letitia James' legal team last week that the indictments against them should be dismissed because Halligan's appointment was unlawful. James was indicted last month on federal mortgage fraud charges and has pleaded not guilty. The federal judge who heard arguments on that issue said she would have a ruling on the validity of Halligan's appointment by Thanksgiving.",

    "summary": "GOP Rep. Clay Higgins was the only House member to vote against a bill that would require the Justice Department to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana was the only House member to vote against a bill that would require the Justice Department to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The bill passed the House on Tuesday in a 427-1 vote after months of delay and pushback from GOP leaders, and then went on to win unanimous consent in the Senate. Despite the roadblocks, it achieved overwhelming Republican support to propel it to passage after President Trump dropped his opposition to a vote, opening the door for nearly all GOP members to support it.",
      "In a post on X, Higgins explained his reasons for opposing the measure, saying the files could inadvertently entangle innocent people if they are released.",
      "\"I have been a principled 'NO' on this bill from the beginning. What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today. It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America. As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people \u2014 witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc.,\" Higgins wrote. \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt. Not by my vote.\"",
      "His concerns echoed those expressed by House Speaker Mike Johnson and others, who argued that the legislative language needed to be changed to prevent the release of information that could compromise investigations or other sensitive material. The bill's supporters dismissed those concerns and said the bill includes provisions to block such disclosures.",
      "Higgins' statement continued: \"The Oversight Committee is conducting a thorough investigation that has already released well over 60,000 pages of documents from the Epstein case. That effort will continue in a manner that provides all due protections for innocent Americans. If the Senate amends the bill to properly address [the] privacy of victims and other Americans, who are named but not criminally implicated, then I will vote for that bill when it comes back to the House.\"",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act requires the Justice Department to release \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" regarding Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his co-conspirator who is serving a 20-year prison sentence, within 30 days of being signed into law. The legislation also requires the disclosure of \"[i]ndividuals, including government officials, named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities, civil settlements, immunity or plea agreements, or investigatory proceedings,\" as well as corporate, academic and governmental entities linked to him.",
      "The measure says that \"No record shall be withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\"",
      "The legislation allows the attorney general to withhold or redact documents that \"contain personally identifiable information of victims or victims' personal and medical files,\" if their release would \"constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" It also excludes child sexual abuse material, information about ongoing criminal cases and material that could harm national security. Any redactions must be explained in notices to Congress.",
      "Shortly after the House vote, Senate Majority Leader John Thune indicated the upper chamber would take up the matter quickly.",
      "\"I think there are some things he'd like to change, but you got a 427 to 1 vote, it's probably not likely to happen,\" the South Dakota Republican said.",

    "summary": "House lawmakers are moving quickly to repeal a provision that allows senators to sue for $500,000 over phone record seizures. It's unclear what the Senate will do.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House is fast-tracking a bill to repeal a controversial provision that allows senators to sue for $500,000 if federal investigators search their phone records without their knowledge.",
      "The House is poised to easily pass the bill with the necessary two-thirds majority required for passage under suspension of the rules on Wednesday evening. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Tuesday that he wasn't sure how the upper chamber would approach the legislation, but he defended the provision allowing the lawsuits.",
      "\"The House isn't implicated in what we did. It just simply applies to the Senate,\" he said. \"There's a statute that obviously was violated and what this does is enables people who are harmed \u2014 in this case, United States senators \u2014 to have a private right of action against the weaponization by the Justice Department.\"",
      "The new law requires service providers to notify senators if their phone records or other data are seized or subpoenaed. A court cannot delay notification unless the senator is the target of a criminal investigation.",
      "The bill states: \"Any senator whose Senate data, or the Senate data of whose Senate office, has been acquired, subpoenaed, searched, accessed, or disclosed in violation of this section may bring a civil action against the United States if the violation was committed by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States or of any federal department or agency.\"",
      "Senators are entitled to $500,000 for each violation under the new law, which also limits how the government can rebut the claims. The law is retroactive to 2022, meaning it would allow at least eight senators to sue the federal government over their phone records being seized during special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "The provision was tucked into a year-long measure to fund the legislative branch, which passed Congress last week as part of a broader package to end the government shutdown.",
      "As the package moved through the House Rules Committee last week, Democrats tried to amend the bill to remove the provision. Several Republicans on the committee expressed surprise and anger over the provision's inclusion, but said they had to support the overall package to reopen the government because removing it would prolong the shutdown by sending the amended bill back to the Senate.",
      "\"What they did is wrong,\" GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia said last week. \"There's actually a list of people that know they will get paid as soon as this thing is signed \u2014 at least they've got the coupon where all they have to do is go file at the courthouse to get paid.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas called the provision \"self-serving\" and criticized its last-minute insertion into the bill without any debate.",
      "\"It is beside my comprehension that this got put in the bill, and it's why people have such a low opinion of this town,\" Roy said.",
      "Citing the provision, Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, refused to vote for the funding package to reopen the government.",
      "After a conversation with Senate Majority Leader John Thune last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the South Dakota Republican \"regretted the way it was done.\" Johnson said the Senate's move was \"way out of line.\"",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said he did not ask Thune to commit to holding a vote in the Senate, but he expected the chamber to do so.",
      "The Republican senators whose phone records were subpoenaed as part of Smith's election interference investigation were: Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.",
      "Most of the eight senators said they do not plan to seek damages under the new law.",
      "Graham, however, indicated he plans to take action.",
      "\"If you think I'm going to settle this thing for a million dollars \u2014 no,\" he said last week. \"I want to make it so painful no one ever does this again.\"",
      "Thune said Tuesday \"the penalty is in place to ensure that in the future, if you get a Justice Department who did what Jack Smith did and weaponized the federal government against the Article I branch of the government, members of the Article I branch of the government, there is a remedy in place, there's a recourse in place.\"",

    "story": [
      "A death row inmate who was convicted of fatally shooting a U.S. airman and his girlfriend and later confessed to three other killings is now scheduled to die by lethal injection next month in Florida, under the terms of a death warrant signed Tuesday by Gov. Ron DeSantis. DeSantis has authorized a record number of executions this year. Sixteen of the 43 executions that have taken place so far in the United States happened in Florida alone.",
      "Florida is set to execute Frank Athen Walls, 58, on Dec. 18 at Florida State Prison, according to the death warrant. Walls is the 19th person set for execution in Florida in 2025, with two other inmates scheduled to be put to death before the end of the year.",
      "The next execution, of inmate Richard Barry Randolph, is scheduled for Thursday, while another convicted killer, Mark Allen Geralds, is set to die Dec. 9. Before this week, the state's last execution happened Nov. 13, when inmate Bryan Frederick Jennings was put to death by lethal injection. Jennings had been convicted of raping and killing his neighbor.",
      "In 2025, DeSantis has overseen more executions in a single year than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. The previous record was set in 2014 with eight executions.",
      "Walls was convicted of two counts of murder, two counts of kidnapping, burglary and theft and sentenced to death in 1988. The Florida Supreme Court later reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial, where Walls was again convicted and sentenced to death in 1992.",
      "According to court records, Walls broke into the Florida Panhandle mobile home of Eglin Air Force Base airman Edward Alger and his girlfriend, Ann Peterson, in July 1987. Walls tied the couple up, but Alger managed to break free and attack Walls. Walls cut Alger's throat and them shot him in the head when the airman continued to fight. Walls then went to attack Peterson and shot her as she struggled.",
      "Walls was arrested the day after the bodies were found when his roommate tipped off police about Walls' odd behavior. During a search of the home, investigators reported finding items from the crime scene, and Walls later admitted to the killings.",
      "After his conviction, DNA evidence linked Walls to the May 1987 rape and murder of Audrey Gygi. Walls pleaded no contest, avoiding another trial and possible death sentence. Walls also admitted responsibility for the killings of Tommie Lou Whiddon in March 1985 and Cynthia Sue Condra in September 1986 as part of a deal with prosecutors.",
      "Attorneys for Walls are expected to file appeals to the Florida Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Florida is among 11 states across the U.S. where executions have happened since the start of 2025, but it leads the way in terms of the number of procedures carried out by a significant margin. After Florida, Alabama, Texas and South Carolina have carried out the second-highest shares of executions this year, with five each. DeSantis' flurry of death warrants substantially contributed to the fact that, nationwide, this is the busiest year for the death penalty in this country in more than a decade.",

      "The event took place in the White House East Room, a space that will one day adjoin the new $300 million ballroom, and was arranged to recognize donors who privately funded construction that's now underway. Guests included representatives from more than two dozen nationally recognized firms, like tobacco giant Altria, Comcast, Microsoft and T-Mobile.",
      "Several companies retained more than one of the lobbying firms in 2025, paying hundreds of thousands annually for advocacy before Congress and the Trump administration.",
      "CBS News also found that a fourth firm, Akin, provided lobbying or legal services to at least nine of the donor companies, according to 2025 federal lobbying disclosures, and one of its lobbyists also attended the East Room dinner.",

      "The great horned owl was found at the Black Desert Resort and arrived at the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Kanab, Utah, earlier this month with its face, chest and right wing covered in dried concrete. After making sure the bird could breathe, sanctuary workers spent days cracking apart the concrete using forceps and cleaning its feathers using toothbrushes, dish soap and their fingers.",
      "Two weeks later, it was able to fly again and is continuing its recovery in an aviary.",
      "\"He's a youngster, which may be why he ended up in a concrete mixer, and we do believe he's a male because he's on the smaller side,\" said Bart Richwalski with the animal sanctuary.",
      "Great horned owls typically have a downy coating on their feathers that enables them to fly silently as they hunt. But the concrete frayed the rescued owl's feathers, said Best Friends' Chief Sanctuary Officer Judah Battista.",
      "Now the bird makes a \"whooshing\" sound as it flies, and the sanctuary won't release it into the wild until it sheds its feathers and can again fly silently. That should occur next spring or summer, Battista said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whooping-cough-pertussis-cases-vaccination-rates/",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 05:00:12 -0500",
    "summary": "New details from health officials suggest the whooping cough surge may be part of a national pattern driven by slipping vaccine coverage and waning immunity, with infants bearing the brunt.",
    "story": [
      "Rates of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, are surging in Texas, Florida, California, Oregon, and other states and localities across the country.",
      "The outbreaks are fueled by falling vaccination rates, fading immunity, and delays in public health tracking systems, according to interviews with state and federal health officials. Babies too young to be fully vaccinated are most at risk.",
      "\"Pertussis cases increase in a cyclical fashion driven by waning immunity, but the size of the outbreak and the potential for severe outcomes in children who cannot be vaccinated can be mitigated by high coverage and good communication to folks at risk,\" said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization program, who resigned in August.",
      "Before the first pertussis vaccine became available in the early 1900s, whooping cough was one of the most common childhood diseases and a major cause of childhood death in the United States. Today, children get a series of DTaP shots (full-dose version) starting at 2 months old, and teens and adults receive a Tdap booster (lower-dose version) every 10 years. (Both vaccines target diphtheria and tetanus in addition to pertussis.)",
      "Until recently, 8 in 10 toddlers had received four doses of the DTaP vaccine by age 2, and case rates were controlled. But vaccine coverage has declined since the COVID pandemic and increases in state nonmedical exemptions have widened immunity gaps, which is when the proportion of individuals who are immune falls below the level needed to contain spread.",
      "Texas logged 1,928 pertussis cases in 2024. By October 2025, the state had exceeded 3,500. National numbers are just as stark: In the first three months of 2025, the U.S. tallied 6,600 cases \u2014 four times last year's pace and 25 times 2023's. Several states are posting their highest case totals in a decade, and outbreaks from Louisiana to South Dakota to Idaho make clear this surge isn't regional. It's everywhere.",
      "Key factors behind these numbers",
      "Texas lawmakers recently passed a law that made it easier for parents to claim nonmedical exemptions from school vaccine requirements by allowing them to download exemption forms online. These forms now go straight to schools, not health departments, making the exemptions harder to track.",
      "Dallas County Health and Human Services Director Dr. Phil Huang said the full impact of the new exemption rule is not yet known because it began this school year, but he expects it will make school-level vaccination rates fall even more.",
      "He's already noted a dramatic drop in vaccinations. Normally, during back-to-school season, \"our whole front downstairs area is packed,\" he said. \"We did not see that this year.\"",
      "Dr. Huang believes fear of immigration enforcement may be keeping at least some families, especially Hispanic families, from getting vaccinated. Dallas County is about 40% Hispanic. \"We think that a lot of them are deterred by the ICE activity,\" he said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "More complications: These vaccines protect against severe disease, but protection against infection fades over time, as is the case with the COVID and influenza vaccines.",
      "The U.S. switched in the 1990s from whole-cell pertussis vaccines to \"acellular\" ones, which cause fewer side effects but do not last as long. Because more adults today than in the past received the acellular vaccine as children, many have lost immunity over time and may unknowingly pass the infection to babies.",
      "Babies face the greatest risk",
      "Whooping cough is especially dangerous for infants under a year old. Some stop breathing during coughing fits. Many need hospital care, about 1 in 5 of whom develop pneumonia, and about 1% of whom die.",
      "Because of this high risk, the CDC urges pregnant women to get a Tdap vaccine during every pregnancy. This allows the mother's antibodies to pass to the baby before birth.",
      "Health officials once promoted \"cocooning,\" vaccinating all family members and caregivers around the baby, but that strategy was hard to carry out in real life and is no longer widely recommended. Vaccination of pregnant women and babies at 2 months of age remains the strongest protection.",
      "Better testing finds more cases",
      "Modern PCR testing is also uncovering more pertussis cases than in the past. Many clinics now routinely use this lab-based technology to test for several respiratory infections at once, including pertussis. Ten years ago, these panels were uncommon.",
      "CDC experts say this explains part of the rise in case counts. But the large number of infant hospitalizations and the size of state outbreaks show that true transmission has also increased.",
      "A growing worry: antibiotic resistance",
      "Doctors normally treat pertussis with macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin. These drugs work best early in the illness and help stop spread. Another drug, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is an option for some older infants and adults.",
      "But macrolide-resistant pertussis has become common abroad, especially in China, and recent reports show resistance rising in Peru. In the U.S., resistant cases have been rare.",
      "CDC officials warn that resistant strains could spread more easily through international travel. Because treatment options are limited, especially for very young infants, health workers are watching this closely.",
      "Dr. Huang said macrolide resistance has not been seen yet in Dallas County. But he is aware of the national concern.",
      "What happens now",
      "The resurgence of whooping cough has no single cause. Instead, several problems are occurring at once: falling vaccine coverage, only about 60% of pregnant women receiving Tdap, waning immunity, improved testing, and early signs of antibiotic resistance.",
      "Health experts say solutions must match the problem's complexity.",
      "Across the nation, clinicians are being told to have a higher suspicion for pertussis when they see patients, especially children or caregivers of newborns with a persistent cough or coughing fits followed by vomiting. Babies who stop breathing or turn blue need immediate care.",
      "Obstetricians are encouraged to discuss Tdap during every pregnancy. Pediatricians and family doctors are urged to check booster status for teens and adults.",
      "Several states have issued health advisories over the past two years, including Texas, which has issued alerts in both 2024 and 2025 urging clinicians to stay vigilant.",
      "Dr. Huang said Dallas County is trying to rebuild public health outreach programs that were cut when COVID funding ended. But staffing is still limited. \"There's just a lot of different things that are making it more difficult,\" he said.",
      "He also noted that Dallas County now receives immunization registry data only once a month, rather than daily, making it harder to track vaccine coverage. \"We don't have that yet. \u2026 It's not real time,\" he said.",
      "Protecting the youngest",
      "As the holiday season approaches, experts urge families with newborns to take extra care:",
      "Ensure infants and children are up to date with their childhood vaccines and that everyone in the family is up to date with their vaccines for influenza, COVID, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.Keep sick visitors away.Seek care quickly if an infant has a cough or pauses breathing.",

    "story": [
      "A Gustav Klimt portrait painting sold Tuesday for $236 million, a record for a modern art piece, at an auction where a solid gold, fully functional toilet satirizing the ultrarich also fetched $12.1 million.",
      "The toilet, by Maurizio Cattelan \u2014 the provocative Italian artist known for taping a banana to a wall \u2014 went up for auction Tuesday evening at Sotheby's in New York. The starting bid for the 223-pound, 18-karat-gold work was about $10 million.",
      "Cattelan has said the piece, titled \"America,\" satirizes superwealth.",
      "\"Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise,\" he once said. Sotheby's, for its part, calls the commode an \"incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value.\"",
      "Klimt's \"Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer\" sold earlier in the night after a 20-minute bidding war, also becoming the most expensive work of art ever sold by Sotheby's worldwide. The piece attracted bids from at least six collectors before finally selling.",
      "The portrait was one of the few by the Austrian artist that survived World War II intact. It depicts the young daughter of one of Klimt's patrons and was kept separate from his other paintings that were burned in a fire at an Austrian castle.",
      "The piece was part of the collection of billionaire Leonard A. Lauder, heir to cosmetics giant The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies. He died earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, a portrait of a young woman by Klimt that was long believed to be lost was sold at an auction in Vienna for $32 million. The painting, \"Portrait of Fr\u00e4ulein Lieser,\" was one of Klimt's last pieces of work before he died in 1918.",
      "Klimt worked mainly in Vienna in the early 1900s and he may be best known for \"The Kiss.\"",
      "The toilet, which had been owned by an unnamed collector, was one of two that Cattelan created in 2016. The other one was displayed in 2016 at New York's Guggenheim Museum, which pointedly offered to lend it to President Trump when he asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting. Then the piece was stolen while on display in England at Blenheim Palace, the country manor where Winston Churchill was born.",

    "story": [
      "Roblox, the popular online gaming platform that hosts millions of user-created games, said Tuesday it is strengthening protections for minors.",
      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age. The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",
      "Roblox in September outlined plans to expand age checks for all users who want to access communication features on the gaming platform. The guardrails are meant to limit communication between adults and minors unless they already know each other in the real world.",

      "\"I want to thank you because you've agreed to invest $600 billion into the United States, and because he's my friend, he might make it a trillion, but I'm going to have to work on him,\" Mr. Trump said during their Oval Office meeting.",

      "A May 2017 defense agreement with the kingdom worth around $110 billion was supposed to take effect immediately, the White House said at the time. But according to records kept by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees foreign military sales, the Defense Department formally notified Congress of roughly $23 billion in possible arms sales to Saudi Arabia between 2017 and 2020.",

      "The pomp and circumstance \u2014 and the president's praise and warmth toward MBS \u2014 were more typical of a visit from an allied Western democracy than an absolute monarchy with a troubled human rights record, pointing to the president's focus on economic and business ties above virtually all else. The White House sees Saudi Arabia as a critical security partner in a turbulent Middle East, as well as an economic partner.",
      "The White House arrival ceremony for the crown prince on Tuesday morning was laden with fanfare, complete with a U.S. military flyover, cannons, horses, and a red carpet. American and Saudi flags adorned the White House South Lawn, and a military band greeted the Saudi royal. Mr. Trump and the crown prince exchanged greetings as they shook hands, and then watched the formation of F-35 and F-16 fighter jets fly by before going inside the White House.",
      "The crown prince's meeting with the president concluded and MBS departed the White House Tuesday afternoon, though he returned later in the evening for a black-tie dinner in his honor. Guests spotted at the dinner included Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays for Saudi team Al-Nassr.",
      "Ahead of bin Salman's arrival, Mr. Trump\u00a0told reporters\u00a0Monday that the U.S. would sell F-35 fighter jets to the Saudis. In the Oval Office, MBS said the Saudis will increase a planned investment of $600 billion in the U.S. to closer to $1 trillion, an announcement that pleased Mr. Trump greatly.",
      "Mr. Trump praised the crown prince in the Oval Office, calling him a \"very good friend\" and insisting his record on human rights is commendable, despite the State Department's long list of concerns of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. Arbitrary and unlawful killings, disappearances, torture, serious restrictions on freedom of expression and restrictions on religious freedom continue to plague the nation, according to the latest 2024 State Department report.",
      "The trip to the White House is the crown prince's first U.S. visit since Washington Post journalist and human rights activist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in 2018 in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul by members of the Saudi government. The president has smoothed over relations with the Saudis since the CIA assessed about a month after Khashoggi's killing, during Mr. Trump's first term, that the crown prince had\u00a0ordered it.",

      "The Biden administration later released the Trump-era intelligence report concluding the crown prince \"approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\"",
      "Bin Salman was asked about Khashoggi directly in the Oval Office Tuesday, giving U.S. reporters a rare chance to question the future king. \"About the journalist, it's really painful to hear that anyone losing his life for no real purpose,\" MBS said.",
      "The crown prince sought to distance the Saudi government from the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, as families of the attacks criticize the White House for inviting him. Bin Salman said he feels \"painful about families of 9/11 in America,\" but claimed Osama bin Laden used the Saudi people to \"destroy\" the American-Saudi relationship. Allegations that members of the Saudi government had links to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers have circulated for years, drawing\u00a0vehement denials\u00a0from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized members of the media for some of the questions.",
      "\"We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm very proud of the job, what he's done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.\"",
      "Later in the day Tuesday, the crown prince attended a dinner at the White House. There are 120 invited guests, according to a person familiar with the planning, and 30 will be from the Saudi delegation.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday evening's dinner is a perfect example of why his large ballroom under construction is necessary. Although it's not a state dinner, it is the first formal dinner hosted by Mr. Trump in his second term to honor a nation's leader. Bin Salman's father, Salman bin Abdulaziz, is technically the head of state of the kingdom, but he delegated his duties as ruler to MBS in 2017.",
      "\"We're more than meeting,\" Mr. Trump said Friday of the visit. \"We're honoring Saudi Arabia.\"",
      "AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy, defense sales and the fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge, which was announced during the president's trip to Saudi Arabia in May.",
      "Mr. Trump is also planning to attend a Saudi business summit in Washington, D.C., Wednesday. An invitation previously obtained by CBS News said the event at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts will be co-hosted by the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia and the U.S.-Saudi Business Council.",
      "Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and former top White House adviser Jared Kushner have fostered close relationships with the Saudis and the crown prince in particular, viewing them as critical partners for both security and business in a turbulent Middle East. The president said the Abraham Accords \u2014 an agreement from his first term that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel, Bahrain and the UAE\u00a0 \u2014 would be a big topic of discussion during the visit.",
      "\"The Abraham Accords will be a part we're going to be discussing,\" Mr. Trump said over the weekend. \"I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly. We've had tremendous interest in the Abraham Accords since we put Iran out of business.\"",
      "Mr. Trump recently told \"60 Minutes\" contributing correspondent Norah O'Donnell that he thought bin Salman would join the agreement, although the Saudis have indicated that would not happen without a path to Palestinian statehood.",
      "The Trumps also have extensive and longheld personal business ties in Saudi Arabia. Last year, the Trump Organization announced plans for the development of a Trump Tower in Jeddah, a major Saudi city along the Red Sea.",
      "Eric Trump, the president's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told Reuters that the Trump Organization also has plans for a Trump-branded property in Riyadh.",
      "And Kushner started a private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which received a reported $2 billion investment from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund controlled by bin Salman.",
      "Asked about the potential conflicts of interest given his family business ties, Mr. Trump insisted Tuesday,\"I have nothing to do with the family business.\"",
      "\"They've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually, I'm sure they could do a lot,\" Mr. Trump said of his family.",
      "Criticism of human rights record",
      "Following the killing of Khashoggi, Mr. Trump did not seek to punish bin Salman personally during his first administration and said he viewed Saudi Arabia as a \"great ally,\" noting the economic ties between the U.S. and the Saudis. The Trump administration did sanction 19 Saudi nationals over the killing.",
      "\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Mr. Trump posted on social media in November 2018.",
      "\"That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.\"",
      "Human rights advocates are dismayed about the treatment bin Salman is expected to receive in Washington, not only because of Khashoggi's murder, but also because of Saudi Arabia's human rights record under bin Salman.",
      "\"We know President Trump won't ask MBS to reveal where Jamal's remains are so his family can finally bury him,\" said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now, an organization Khashoggi founded months before he was killed. \"But the least he can do \u2014 the absolute minimum \u2014 is publicly press MBS to release the dozens of activists, writers and reformers languishing in Saudi prisons for the 'crime' of speaking freely.\"",
      "Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director at DAWN, called bin Salman's journey from castigation over Khashoggi's murder to a high-profile White House welcome an \"extraordinary political feat.\" And that's not just because of Mr. Trump's gestures of friendship toward the crown prince. Whitson mentioned the \"fist bump seen around the world,\" as former President Joe Biden warmly greeted Khashoggi in Riyadh during his presidency \"hat in hand.\"",
      "\"We went from the Biden administration narrowly sanctioning Mohamamd bin Salman himself for the murder of Khashoggi \u2026 to now welcoming him into Washington and not only sort of feting him for whatever lucrative deals he can pass to American businesses, but also to potentially actually help as a stabilizing force,\" Whitson said.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate and House of Representatives passed \u2014 in rare bipartisan fashion \u2014 a bill that would require the Justice Department to release a trove of documents tied to investigations of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "President Trump's signature on the legislation would clear the way for the release of a new set of documents, including material not previously disclosed among the tens of thousands of pages released in batches from congressional investigators. Those disclosures have brought new focus on the former financier's global social circle of wealthy, powerful men.",
      "What Epstein files would be released, according to the bill?",
      "The bill would require the attorney general to make public all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials in possession of the Justice Department, the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices within 30 days of becoming law.",
      "Combined, the documents would stem from a pair of federal investigations, in Florida and New York, spanning more than a decade.",
      "The two cases spawned widespread accusations of conspiratorial coverups, as it became clear that Epstein's jetsetting revolved around wining, dining and business deals with a wide cross section of world leaders and celebrities. Recent CBS News investigations have raised questions about the circumstances of Epstein's 2019 death in custody, and shown that Epstein continued to court the rich and famous right up until his 2019 arrest, even as sex trafficking accusations intensified following a 2008 \"sweetheart deal\" with prosecutors in Florida.",
      "The documents could include bank records, correspondence, witness interviews and communications or other files retrieved from Epsteins' electronic devices.",
      "New releases could reveal \"troublingly close relationships,\" though not necessarily more criminal conduct",
      "Columbia Law School professor and former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman said a recent release of files might give a hint of what to expect. Last week, the House Oversight Committee published thousands of documents showing emails and text messages sent to and from Epstein \u2014 with Democrats on the committee highlighting emails in which Epstein suggested Mr. Trump \"knew about the girls.\"",
      "\"From a public interest perspective, the preview from House Dems last week suggests the files may reveal troublingly close relationships between Epstein and various notables,\" Richman said, but cautioned that he believes federal prosecutors in New York would have pursued any substantial leads with \"zeal.\"",
      "\"I would not be quick to assume any revelations when it comes to chargeable criminal conduct,\" Richman said.",
      "Former Epstein attorney David Schoen told CBS News he's concerned that the slow drip of file releases could harm the reputations of people who might have socialized or did business with Epstein, without involvement in his crimes. He pointed to an announcement Monday night by former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers that he's \"stepping back from public commitments\" as scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein builds.",
      "Summers said he was \"deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused.\" The correspondence that was published suggests Summers sought advice on women from Epstein: \"I said what are you up to,\" Summers wrote in part of one message, describing a conversation with the woman. \"She said 'I'm busy.' I said awfully coy u are.\"",
      "Epstein's reply read, in part: \"shes smart. making you pay for past errors.\" There is no evidence of illegal conduct on Summers' part.",
      "Schoen said, \"My fear is that people's reputations will be tarnished now because their names appear even though they did nothing wrong.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he expects the Senate will amend the legislation to address what he called \"serious deficiencies\" related to survivors' privacy and the possibility of unintended disclosure of sensitive information.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI sought to address some of those concerns in an unsigned July memo, describing a review of the files, which it said contain \"images and videos of victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten thousand downloaded videos and images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography.\"",
      "The agencies wrote in their memo that \"while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information regarding Epstein\u2026.no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"",
      "Richman said he didn't put much stock in the Justice Department's decisionmaking related to withholding documents related to Epstein.",
      "\"Such withholding might well be normal, but here, I worry that it will be used as a cover for a selectivity that helps Trump and his friends and hurts those he considers his enemies,\" said Richman. The Columbia Law School professor is a longtime friend of former FBI Director James Comey, a frequent target of Mr. Trump's ire who was indicted in September on two federal counts related to past testimony to Congress.",
      "FBI review revealed no Epstein client list",
      "While Attorney General Pam Bondi implied during a Fox News interview in February that an Epstein \"client list\" was sitting on her desk, in the July memo her agency and the FBI claimed, \"this systematic review revealed no incriminating 'client list.'\"",
      "\"We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties,\" the July memo said.",
      "Actress Alicia Arden, who accused Epstein of sexual battery during a 1997 incident, said during a Monday press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred that it's a bipartisan issue, and asked,",
      "\"Why would there be a single 'No' vote?\"",
      "\"Vote to release these files so we can finally see who else helped Jeffrey Epstein,\" Arden said.",
      "New Epstein investigation could affect any release of files",
      "A recently announced investigation could complicate the matter.",
      "Bondi said on Friday that she had asked U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to open an investigation hours after Mr. Trump demanded a probe into several prominent Democrats and financial institutions.",
      "It is unclear how that new investigation might impact efforts to release files related to Epstein's closed cases. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky said Monday he worries that the new investigation could be used to block the release of some files. The Justice Department and Bondi have not commented further on Clayton's investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned that now he's opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files. That's my concern,\" Massie, who led the effort to get the bill to the House floor, told reporters. \"I'm afraid they're going to try to use a provision of the law that allows you not to release these materials if they're subject of an ongoing investigation.\"",
      "During Arden's press conference Monday, attorney Gloria Allred echoed Massie's concern.",
      "\"So, now we're just involved in this political bloodbath trying to get answers. All I can say is when the fog of political war clears, I certainly hope that the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein will have more answers and information than they have now,\" Allred said.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:18:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal court ordered Texas to use House district lines adopted in 2021 for next year's congressional elections.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal court on Tuesday blocked Texas from using its newly redrawn congressional map in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, a setback for Republicans as they work to maintain their narrow majority in the House.",
      "In a decision authored by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, the court\u00a0ordered the state to instead use House district lines adopted by the Texas legislature in 2021 for next year's congressional elections. The dispute was heard by a three-judge panel, which divided 2-1 in finding that voting rights and advocacy groups that challenged the redistricting plan were likely to prove that the 2025 map is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "The court found that plaintiffs will likely succeed in showing that race predominated over partisanship in the map-making process, and said the state legislature appears to have set and followed a racial target.",
      "\"The public perception of this case is that it's about politics. To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map,\" Brown, appointed to the federal bench by President Trump in 2019, wrote. \"But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said the decision will be appealed directly to the Supreme Court.",
      "\"Legislature redrew our congressional maps to better reflect Texans' conservative voting preferences \u2013 and for no other reason. Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" he said in a statement. \"This ruling is clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.\"",
      "Still, the ruling marks an early blow for Republicans and Mr. Trump, who had urged Texas state lawmakers to engage in a mid-decade redrawing of their House map in order to bolster the GOP's chances of holding onto its majority in the lower chamber.",
      "\"A federal court just stopped one of the most brazen attempts to steal our democracy that Texas has ever seen,\" Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu said in a statement. \"Greg Abbott and his Republican cronies tried to silence Texans' voices to placate Donald Trump, but now have delivered him absolutely nothing.\"",
      "The map approved by the Texas legislature, which was signed by Abbott in August, redraws the state's congressional districts to create five GOP-friendly seats. The effort in Texas kicked off a redistricting battle that has expanded to other states. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, pushed to recraft his state's voting boundaries, and voters there approved a ballot measure earlier this month to draw new congressional districts. The map unveiled by California Democrats shifts five of the state's House seats to be more favorable to Democrats in next year's midterm elections.",
      "In both Missouri and North Carolina, state GOP lawmakers have approved new maps that target a single Democratic-held district in each state. But the battles over House district lines have also sparked court fights that seek to block the updated maps from taking effect.",
      "Under the original lines adopted by Texas' GOP-led legislature in the wake of the 2020 Census, Republicans hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats, while Democrats control 12. The death of Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, has left one seat open. Those voting lines enacted in 2021 were used in the 2022 and 2024 House elections.",
      "But with the GOP holding a razor-thin majority in the House, and Republicans at risk of losing their hold on the lower chamber, Mr. Trump's political team began pushing Texas GOP leaders earlier this year to explore redrawing the state's congressional map. That effort picked up steam after the Justice Department sent Abbott a letter in July alleging that some of the districts in the 2021 map were racial gerrymanders that violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment.",
      "The letter from Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, threatened legal action if Texas didn't dismantle and re-configure four Democratic-held congressional districts, which she said were unconstitutional.",
      "Abbott then added redistricting to the agenda for a special session of the state legislature and directed state lawmakers to draw a new congressional map to address the Justice Department's concerns. The new redistricting plan, signed by Abbott in August, creates five new districts that are favorable to Republicans.",
      "Soon after the map received the green-light from state Republicans, a coalition of advocacy groups moved to block the state from using it in the upcoming House elections. The plaintiffs argued that Texas lawmakers engaged in an unconstitutional racial gerrymander when redrawing the lines, while the state said it relied exclusively on politics, not race, during the latest redistricting process.",
      "The federal court in El Paso held a nine-day trial last month to address the claims and found that the nonprofit organizations were likely to prevail on their racial-gerrymandering claims.",
      "Brown wrote in his decision that the Justice Department, in its July letter, directed Texas to engage in racial gerrymandering when it ordered the state to rectify districts that it deemed problematic. The court said the Justice Department's letter effectively imposed a 50% racial target for Texas to meet when drawing congressional district lines.",
      "Brown also pointed to Abbott's actions in response to the letter, including his decision to add redistricting to the legislative agenda for the special session and his public statements.",
      "\"The Governor explicitly directed the Legislature to redistrict based on race. In press appearances, the Governor plainly and expressly disavowed any partisan objective and instead repeatedly stated that his goal was to eliminate coalition districts and create new majority-Hispanic districts,\" Brown wrote in his 160-page decision evaluating the redrawn map. \"The legislature adopted those racial objectives.\"",
      "The court said that supporters of the new redistricting plan also made numerous statements that suggested they retooled the district lines to create more majority-Hispanic and majority-Black districts.",
      "The judges also rejected any concerns that it is blocking the new map too close to the election. Courts typically avoid ordering late changes election rules to protect against voter confusion and disruption. But Brown wrote that if the new House districts can remain in place, voters will be forced to vote under a map that likely sorts them on the basis of race, depriving them of their right to participate in a \"free and fair election.\"",
      "Additionally, because the candidate-filing deadline is Dec. 8, the court said that the 2026 congressional election is not yet underway.",
      "\"To allow legislatures to redistrict as close to elections as possible while limiting the courts' ability to review the constitutionality of that action \u2014 even in extraordinary cases like this one\u2014 would unduly tip the balance of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches and impair the effectiveness of the Constitution's protections of voting rights,\" Brown wrote for the court.",

      "The bill aims to impose restrictions on donors seeking to influence the administration in power and would require transparency. It would prohibit the president from soliciting donations, ban the display of donor names, bar donors from remaining anonymous and institute a two-year \"cooling-off period\" in which donors would be prohibited from lobbying the government.",
      "The bill, called \"Stop Ballroom Bribery Act,\" would also prevent donations from businesses or individuals with business before the government \u2014 including those facing federal litigation or enforcement actions.",
      "Several firms that donated to the 90,000-square-foot ballroom project have pending business before the government, like mergers requiring Justice Department approval or federal contracts hanging in the balance.",
      "\"Americans shouldn't have to wonder whether President Trump is building a ballroom to facilitate a pay-to-play scheme for political favor,\" Warren said.",
      "With Republican majorities in both chambers, the bill faces long odds. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, co-sponsored the legislation.",
      "\"President Trump has put a 'for sale' sign on the White House\u2014soliciting hundreds of millions of dollars from special interests to fund his $300 million vanity project. Our measure is a direct response to Trump's ballroom boondoggle,\" Blumenthal said.",
      "The White House did not reply to a request for comment on the bill. In the Oval Office Tuesday, President Trump said the new, larger ballroom would be useful to host more guests at official dinners \u2014 like the one Tuesday night in honor of the Saudi crown prince. He said people were excluded from the event due to space limitations.",
      "In late October and early November, Blumenthal sent letters to more than 40 individuals, foundations and companies that supported the White House ballroom. Blumenthal sought answers about how much firms like Amazon and Comcast had poured into the project and whether they had the option to remain anonymous.",
      "So far, just 16 donors have replied. Their responses mention corporate civic pride and compliance with federal law, but offer few details about their financial contributions or substantive answers to the senator's questions, according to congressional sources.",
      "Microsoft was a bit more forthcoming than most. It said it was contacted by a fundraiser about making a donation in late September, according to the congressional source. The tech giant was given information about how to donate and an invitation to a dinner for supporters.",
      "That dinner was held in the White House's East Room on Oct. 15. Several Microsoft executives were on the guest list, according to CBS News sources.",
      "Amazon said it started talking to fundraisers in August, not long after the project was announced, according to the congressional source. Amazon vice president of public policy Brian Huseman was the company's representative at the October dinner, sources said.",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 The head of the Louvre Museum said Wednesday that new surveillance cameras and anti-intrusion systems will soon be installed at the Paris landmark after last month's stunning crown jewels heist.",
      "The cameras \u2014 some 100 of them \u2014 will be up and running by the end of next year while anti-intrusion systems will start to be put in place within two weeks, Louvre director Laurence des Cars said.",
      "She described the systems as equipment that will prevent intruders from getting close to the museum buildings but did not offer specifics. The new surveillance cameras will try to ensure \"complete protection of the museum's surroundings,\" she said.",
      "\"After the shock, after the emotion, after the assessment, it's time for action\" at the world's most visited museum, des Cars told the Committee of Cultural Affairs of the National Assembly.",
      "She said it was all part of more than 20 \"emergency measures\" that will be implemented. The new measures also include the creation of a \"security coordinator\" position at the museum, and the job has been posted this month, she added.",
      "On the day of the heist, it took thieves less than eight minutes to force their way through a window into the Apollo Gallery with the help of a freight lift and steal the 88 million euros ($102 million) trove.",
      "At least five people have been arrested, but none of the jewels have been recovered. Master jeweler and Parisian gem appraiser Stephen Portier told CBS News the thieves would struggle to sell the loot.",
      "\"The whole world knows about this robbery. Dealers will have pictures of every single piece up in their offices,\" he said. \"So if they think they're being offered diamonds from the Louvre ... they will ask some hard questions. And contact the police.\"",
      "Des Cars unveiled some new details about the security breach that allowed the Oct. 19 robbery, saying the power tools used by robbers to cut through the display cases were disc cutters meant for concrete.",
      "\"It's a method that had not been imagined at all\" when the display cases in the Apollo Gallery were replaced in 2019, she said. At the time, they had been designed primarily to counter an attack from inside the museum with weapons, she added.",
      "Footage from museum cameras show that during the robbery, the display cases \"held up remarkably well and did not break apart,\" she said. \"Videos show how difficult it was for the thieves.\"",
      "Des Cars stressed security improvement is a priority of the decade-long \"Louvre New Renaissance\" plan launched earlier this year, with an estimated cost of up to 800 million euros ($933 million), to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.",
      "With the Louvre crumbling under the weight of mass tourism, des Cars has restricted the daily number of visitors to 30,000 in recent years.",
      "The famed glass pyramid inaugurated in 1989 was meant to welcome about 4 millions visitors a year, she recalled. This year, already more than 8 million people visited the Louvre.",
      "\"The extensive modernization that the Louvre underwent in the 1980s is now technically obsolete, with equipment that has been overperforming for 40 years,\" des Cars said.",
      "On Monday, the Louvre announced it was temporarily closing some employee offices and one public gallery because they were structurally fragile.",

      "\"We have military options ready should the Yantar change course,\" Reuters quoted him as saying.",
      "British officials said the Yantar is part of the Russian navy, designed to conduct surveillance in peacetime and sabotage during times of war. Because of this, the U.K. and its allies track the ship and work to deter its operations whenever it approaches British territorial waters.",
      "\"It is part of a Russian fleet designed to put and hold our undersea infrastructure and those of our allies at risk,\" Healey said, referencing attacks on pipelines and cables under the Baltic Sea earlier this year.",
      "This isn't the first time the Yantar has probed Britain's defenses, Healey said. After a warning last year, the Yantar left U.K. waters for the Mediterranean.

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he will designate Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally, marking a step up in defense ties between the United States and the Gulf monarchy.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the move at a black-tie dinner at the White House in honor of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. The two leaders signed a new strategic defense deal earlier in the day, and Mr. Trump said Monday the U.S. will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.",
      "The designation could open the door to further collaboration between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. military, including easier access to U.S.-made military equipment. It's also a symbolic move: Mr. Trump said in brief remarks Tuesday evening that it would take \"our military cooperation to even greater heights.\"",
      "There are currently 20 major non-NATO allies, including other Middle Eastern countries like Israel, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.",
      "\"A stronger and more capable alliance will advance the interests of both countries, and it will serve the highest interests of peace,\" Mr. Trump said during Tuesday's dinner.",
      "The U.S.'s close relationship with Saudi Arabia dates back eight decades, bookended by a meeting between King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud and former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt aboard a U.S. Navy cruiser in 1945. The two countries have long cooperated on defense, and in recent decades, they have been bound together in part by a mutual rivalry with Iran.",
      "During Tuesday's meetings \u2014 marked by elaborate White House ceremonies and a military flyover \u2014 Mr. Trump pressed for even further military and economic cooperation with the Gulf state. The White House said\u00a0Tuesday that Saudi Arabia will buy hundreds of tanks and fighter jets and will partner with the U.S. on artificial intelligence and civil nuclear issues, while bin Salman pledged to invest nearly $1 trillion in the U.S., up from $600 billion.",
      "Members of Mr. Trump's family also have some business interests in the country. Mr. Trump insisted earlier Tuesday he has \"nothing to do\" with those deals, and \"they've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually.\"",
      "Still unclear is whether Saudi Arabia will sign onto the Abraham Accords, a series of diplomatic deals brokered by Mr. Trump between Israel and majority-Muslim states like the United Arab Emirates. Most of those agreements were inked during the president's first term, and Mr. Trump told \"60 Minutes\" he believes Saudi Arabia will also join.",
      "During an Oval Office event earlier Tuesday, bin Salman told reporters he wants to join the accords but needs to see a path toward a Palestinian state. Mr. Trump added that the two leaders \"had a very good talk on the Abraham Accords.\"",
      "But Saudi Arabia's human rights record makes it a controversial U.S. partner. American intelligence agencies concluded in 2021 that bin Salman approved the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who regularly criticized the country's regime in the pages of The Washington Post.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday he believes bin Salman \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 killing, and called Khashoggi \"extremely controversial.\" Bin Salman said it was \"really painful to hear\" about the killing.",

      "Sitting next to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office while\u00a0visiting the White House, bin Salman said, \"About the journalist, it's really painful to hear that anyone losing his life for no real purpose.\" The crown prince also said, \"We did all the right steps in terms of investigation, etc., in Saudi Arabia and we've improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that.\"",
      "\"It's painful and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that will never happen again,\" bin Salman said.",
      "Bin Salman is making his first visit to the White House since Khashoggi's murder. Bin Salman has denied any involvement, but he told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in a 2019 \"60 Minutes\" interview, \"I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\"",
      "The 2021 U.S. intelligence report concluded that \"the Crown Prince has had absolute control over the Kingdom's security and intelligence organizations, making it highly unlikely that Saudi officials would have carried out an operation of this nature without the Crown Prince's authorization.\"",
      "After Mr. Trump's comments Tuesday, Khashoggi's widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, directed a message on social media to him, writing, \"There is no justification to murder my husband.\"",
      "\"While Jamal was a good transparent and brave man many people may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press,\" she wrote.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, she said she was \"hurt\" and \"disappointed\" by the Oval Office remarks.",
      "Mr. Trump called bin Salman his friend and praised him as \"incredible on human rights and everything else\" as the Saudi royal made his first visit to the White House since Khashoggi's killing.",
      "Mr. Trump also insisted he has \"nothing to do\" with his family's business dealings with Saudi Arabia, and said, \"they've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually.\"",
      "As families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack have pursued a civil lawsuit alleging the kingdom sponsored, aided and supported the al Qaeda hijackers, bin Salman has sought to distance the Saudi government from the attack.",
      "\"I feel painful about, you know, families of 9/11 in America, but you know, we have to focus on reality,\" bin Salman said Tuesday. \"Reality based on CIA documents and based on a lot of documents that Osama bin Laden used Saudi people in that event for one purpose: To destroy this relation, the American-Saudi relationship.\"",
      "Bin Salman said that \"whoever buys that\" is \"helping Osama bin Laden's purpose of destroying this relation.\" Bin Salman said bin Laden knew the \"strong\" relationship between America and Saudi Arabia is \"bad for extremism.\"",

      "Bin Salman, who goes by MBS, agreed that the figure would be close to $1 trillion.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first administration, the president touted $450 billion in Saudi investments in the U.S., but an economic analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute found that exports of American goods and services to Saudi Arabia from 2017 to 2020 totaled just a fifth of that, around $92 billion.",
      "A May 2017 defense agreement with the kingdom worth around $110 billion was supposed to take effect immediately, the White House said at the time. But according to records kept by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees foreign military sales, the Defense Department formally notified Congress of roughly $23 billion in possible arms sales to Saudi Arabia between 2017 and 2020.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Nov 2025 18:15:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Documents suggest Epstein had contacts with the Saudi royal family and traveled to the Kingdom in the last years of his life.",
    "story": [
      "In late 2016, Jeffrey Epstein flew his private Gulfstream G550 alone from Paris to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and emerged from the visit with a lavish gift, apparently from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It was a tent, \"carpets and all,\" as he later described it. Bedouin tents, in Middle Eastern culture, are a symbol of hospitality.",
      "What Epstein was doing to be honored with that gift is currently a mystery.",
      "This was one of several meetings and interactions Epstein had with world leaders, according to emails and documents released in recent weeks that detail his activities in the final years of his life. They also included meetings with other members of the Saudi royal family.",
      "Bin Salman is visiting Washington this week and meeting with President Trump. It's a major moment for the Kingdom as it seeks to enhance its global image in the wake of the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. So far, Epstein's business dealings with the Kingdom and members of the royal family have largely avoided close scrutiny.",
      "Much of that information comes from the release of hundreds of text messages, emails and other documents sent to the House Oversight Committee by Epstein's estate as part of the committee's investigation. Revelations about the tent and carpets were included in emails between Epstein and Hyatt executive chairman Tom Pritzker.",
      "Epstein's planning for his 2016 trip included an email from his assistant saying, \"Did you need me to book the Four Seasons for you in Riyadh? Or is the king taking care of it!?\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Saudi officials in D.C. for comment and has not had a response by time of publication.",
      "There is no evidence that anyone involved in the Saudi government had involvement with anything related to Epstein's sex trafficking allegations.",
      "Why Epstein's estate has chosen to release certain documents is not clear. The release is in response to a subpoena that included requests for documents relating to his finances, as well as potential victims. What has been released is likely a fraction of what the estate possesses of Epstein's communications, and it's not clear if there will be future releases that could provide additional details. Epstein maintained extensive communication with his staff, financial clients and friends over the years.",
      "As Congress voted almost unanimously on Tuesday to demand the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files, most of the public's focus has been on his sex crimes \u2014 but any release of additional documents could reveal more about Epstein's vast global business connections, which have so far remained mostly unknown.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, told CBS News there are a host of unanswered questions stemming from Epstein's financial dealings all around the globe.",
      "\"My own investigation has found that Epstein was moving hundreds of millions of dollars around the world during the years he operated his cross-border sex trafficking operation, but it's still not clear who among his foreign network knew about his trafficking, enabled it, and participated in it,\" Wyden said.",
      "Epstein, who fashioned himself as an elite money manager, was also advising the governments of Mongolia and the Maldives, as well as traveling and presumably making or seeking business deals in the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, the Ivory Coast, China, Russia, Qatar and Belarus, according to those documents. But Epstein's contacts with Saudi Arabia appear to have been some of his most extensive and potentially lucrative dealings with foreign leaders.",
      "Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman consolidated his control in Saudi Arabia in 2017 following a purge of high level government officials. A few days later, New York Times reporter Thomas Landon Jr. emailed Epstein, \"Did your Saudi friends survive the purge?\" Epstein responded, \"All. With gods help ;).\"",
      "Epstein discussed another brush with the Saudi crown prince in April 2018. It comes up in a text message exchange with an individual whose name is redacted in the documents, but who appears from the context of their chat to be former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Epstein writes, \"MBS [Mohammed bin Salman] has the Louvre and 400 guards. To himself,\" and he indicates that he is on his way over.",
      "\"No better way to spend s(sic) Sunday,\" came the reply.",
      "That evening, French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted a photo of himself and bin Salman at the Louvre with the caption, \"With Mohammed Bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\" CBS News has reached out to the government of France to find out if Epstein was present, but has not received a response.",

    "story": [
      "Alice and Ellen Kessler, twin dancers and singers who launched their career in the 1950s and performed with Fred Astaire, Frank Sinatra and Harry Belafonte, among others, have died, police in Germany said Tuesday. They were 89.",
      "The death of the twins in Gr\u00fcnwald, a prosperous suburb of Munich where they shared a house, was reported by German newspaper Bild and news agency dpa on Monday, without named sources. Munich police on Tuesday confirmed the deaths, saying in an emailed statement that it was a \"joint suicide.\" In a statement, the German Society for Humane Dying confirmed to Bavarian Broadcasting that it was an assisted suicide.",
      "The Kessler twins learned to dance at a young age and joined the Leipzig Opera children's ballet. In 1952, when they were 16, their family fled to West Germany, where they danced in a revue theater in D\u00fcsseldorf. In 1955, the sisters were discovered by the director of the Lido cabaret theater in Paris, where their international career took off.",
      "In the 1960s, the Kessler twins toured worldwide, moved to Rome and performed with Astaire, Sinatra and Belafonte. They turned down an offer to appear with Elvis Presley in \"Viva Las Vegas\" in 1964 for fear of becoming defined by musical films in America, dpa reported.",
      "Even at 80, the sisters appeared on stage in a musical. Alice said shortly before their 80th birthday that they probably wouldn't have managed to perform for so long alone.",
      "Being a twosome \"only has advantages,\" she said. \"Together you're stronger.\"",
      "Asked about the secret of their success, she remarked: \"Discipline, every day. Gratitude, time and again. Humility, not cockiness. And togetherness. Until death.\"",
      "The twins told the German tabloid\u00a0Bild\u00a0in April 2024 that they wanted to be buried in the same urn, along with the ashes of their mother and dog. \"That's what we stipulated in our wills,\" Ellen Kessler told Bild.",
      "Assisted suicide is legal in nine countries in Europe as well as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Colombia, Cuba and Ecuador, according to the nonprofit\u00a0Dignity in Dying.",
      "In the U.S.,\u00a0dying with medical assistance\u00a0is legal in 10 states and Washington, D.C., but at least eight other states are considering similar laws this year, according to Death with Dignity.",
      "Currently, some New York lawmakers and advocates are calling for Gov. Kathy Hochul to sign the \"Medical Aid In Dying\" bill, also known as MAID. The bill would legalize giving terminally ill adult patients who have six months or less to live the option to have a doctor prescribe them a mixture of a lethal medication.",

    "story": [
      "An expansive ancient city has been unearthed in central Asia, shedding light on the area's industrial history and ranking as \"one of the most remarkable archaeological discoveries in this region for decades,\" according to the lead author of a landmark new\u00a0report\u00a0on the site.",
      "The report, from researchers at the United Kingdom's Durham University and University College London as well as Kazakhstan's Toraighyrov University, offers the fullest picture to date of what Semiyarka, the \"City of Seven Ravines,\" may have been like in its prime more than 3,500 years ago.",
      "Located on the Kazakh Steppe, a vast grassland that covers northern Kazakhstan and parts of Russia, Semiyarka spanned some 350 acres and is currently the largest known ancient settlement in that region, according to the report. Originating around 1600 B.C.E. during the Bronze Age, the city was among only a few production centers at the time and the first on the Kazakh Steppe now known to have had bronze-producing capabilities.",
      "That's important for understanding the early communities of the steppe region, researchers said, as the archaeological evidence for Semiyarka's well-organized metal economy challenges prior beliefs that such societies did not exist in the area when Semiyarka did. The ancient city, which is called \"Seven Ravines\" because of its location overlooking multiple valleys, developed during a period where nomadic people began to form permanent or semipermanent settlements.",
      "Researchers previously thought only seminomadic people lived on the Kazakh Steppe at that time. But what they found after years of archaeological exploration of Semiyarka indicates that the site was not only a large-scale metal producer but, potentially, a crucial trading post with regional power. Its size, along with remnants of its manufacturing, \"highlight its potential importance for advancing our understanding of regional settlement patterns, social organisation and technology,\" researchers wrote in their report.",
      "\"This is one of the most remarkable archaeological discoveries in this region for decades. Semiyarka changes the way we think about steppe societies,\" Miljana Radivojevi\u0107, an archaeological researcher at University College London and the report's lead author, said in a\u00a0statement released by the university. \"It shows that mobile communities could build and sustain permanent, organised settlements centred on a likely large-scale industry \u2014 a true 'urban hub' of the steppe.\"",
      "Researchers at Toraighyrov University initially identified Semiyarka in the early 2000s, but the city was never thoroughly investigated before now.",
      "\"I have been surveying Semiyarka for many years with the support of Kazakh national research funding,\" said Viktor Merz, of Toraighyrov University, who initially identified Semiyarka two decades ago and co-authored the new report, \"but this collaboration has truly elevated our understanding of the site.\"",

      "The four men, aged 20 to 23, are members of an \"Active Club\" \u2014 loosely structured groups that meet in gyms and aim to promote white-nationalist, misogynist and hyper-masculine ideology.",
      "They were given prison sentences ranging from three to three-and-a-half years for aggravated assault after they beat up three men of foreign origin on Aug. 27 in Stockholm.",
      "The group first attacked a Black man with an umbrella while shouting racial slurs, prosecutors said. They then attacked a man of Syrian origin, knocking him to the ground and kicking him in the head until he lost consciousness and four teeth. Three of the four men then beat up a man on a subway train.",
      "\"The four men are of Swedish origin and have connections to Aktivklubb Sverige (AKS), which is considered a far-right organization with clear racist elements and which engages in martial arts,\" the court said in a statement. \"At least two of the men performed Hitler salutes during the night in question. All of the victims have an ethnic background different from the defendants.\"",
      "\"All of the crimes for which the men are convicted have hate crime motives, except for the vandalism,\" the court said, referring to neo-Nazi graffiti drawn on store windows.",
      "\"Intense hatred\"",
      "During the trial, prosecutors presented material seized from the four men, including notebooks with swastikas and stickers with the inscription \"Love Sweden, Hate Islam.\"",
      "The victims said they had been traumatized. The man attacked in the subway said he felt \"intense hatred\" as he was assaulted.",
      "\"I was beaten severely ... I didn't even have time to think before he took a running start and hit me with full force,\" he told the court.",
      "The victim beaten with the umbrella testified: \"It was as if these people knew what they were doing, that they were practicing kickboxing or something similar, that they were training to injure.\"",

      "Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s   Maduro indicated Monday that he is open to direct talks with the Trump administration, calling for diplomacy instead of confrontation as the U.S. Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier joined almost a dozen other American warships off his country's shores in a tense standoff.",
      "The administration accuses Maduro of facilitating drug trafficking into the United States, but the Venezuelan leader says the U.S. is trying to overthrow him.",
      "\"Those who want to speak with Venezuela will speak,\" Maduro said in Spanish, adding in English: \"Face-to-face.\"",
      "The Venezuelan leader made the remarks on his television program, which aired in Venezuela on Monday. He was asked by an interviewer about reports that President Trump was considering speaking with him.",
      "\"Venezuela's position is unwavering: Absolute respect for international law. We firmly reject the threat or use of force to impose rules between countries,\" Maduro said. \"We reaffirm what the U.N. Charter, our Constitution, and our people say: Only through diplomacy should free nations understand each other. Governments must seek common ground on mutual interests only through dialogue.\"",
      "Maduro's comments came hours after President Trump said he would be willing to talk with the Venezuelan leader, while not ruling out deploying U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.",
      "Mr. Trump accuses Maduro of working in conjunction with drug cartels that traffic narcotics into the U.S., and the Venezuelan leader has been indicted in a U.S. court on narco-terrorism charges. President Trump recently told CBS News' 60 Minutes that he believed Maduro's days in power were numbered.",
      "Maduro has denied all accusations that he works with cartels and said he believes the drug trafficking claims are a pretext for a U.S. military operation to remove him from power.",
      "Maduro has \"done tremendous damage to our country, primarily because of drugs, but really because we have that problem with other countries too, but more than any other country, the release of prisoners into our country has been a disaster,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office on Monday. \"He's emptied his jails. Others have done that also. He has not been good to the United States. So we'll see what happens. At a certain period of time, I'll be talking to him.\"",
      "The Trump administration has presented no evidence to date to substantiate claims that Venezuela has deliberately sent criminals to the U.S.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters that \"we may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we'll see how that turns out. They would like, they would like to talk.\"",

      "The Ford arrived as the U.S. moved to designate the \"Cartel de Los Soles\" group as a foreign terrorist organization \u2014 a shift Mr. Trump said could open the door to targeting Venezuelan assets and infrastructure.",
      "D'Agata reported Tuesday that there are now about 15,000 U.S. troops at sea in the region and on land in Puerto Rico, where U.S. F-35 stealth fighter jets have been seen flying nearly around the clock.",
      "The U.S. military has conducted strikes against at least 22 vessels that the Trump administration alleges were transporting drugs to the U.S. from South America, killing at least 83 people.",
      "Maduro has condemned those strikes \u2014 the legality of which has also been questioned by rights groups, the United Nations, other countries in the region, and some lawmakers in the U.S. \u2014   since they began in September.",

      "If a Taiwan emergency entails \"battleships and the use of force, then that could constitute a situation threatening the survival (of Japan),\" she told parliament on Nov. 7. Under Japan's self-imposed domestic rules, an existential threat is one of the few cases where it can act militarily. Taiwan sits around 60 miles from the nearest Japanese island.",
      "In response to Takaichi's remarks, a Chinese diplomat stationed in Japan threatened to \"cut off that dirty neck,\" apparently referring to Takaichi, as China and Japan summoned each other's ambassadors.",

      "The tit-for-tat warnings from both capitals have fueled concern about nationalism being whipped up, and Coren said there was no apparent off-ramp available to ease tension. Japan sent a senior diplomat to Beijing for talks on Tuesday, but there was no announcement of any significant progress to ease the bilateral standoff.",
      "During the daily briefing on Tuesday at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a spokesman demanded that Japan \"immediately retract its erroneous remarks, engage in profound self-reflection, change course, and provide the Chinese people with a clear explanation\" of Takaichi's comments.",

    "summary": "The most advanced U.S. aircraft carrier has arrived in the Caribbean Sea in a display of American military power.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. is set to designate Cartel de los Soles \u2014 a group that the Trump administration has claimed is headed by Venezuela's president \u2014 as a foreign terrorist organization, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Sunday night, hours after the most advanced aircraft carrier in the nation crossed into the Caribbean Sea, the U.S. Navy said.",
      "Rubio's announcement and the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford mark a major moment in what the Trump administration says is a counterdrug operation but has been seen as an escalating pressure tactic against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Cartel de los Soles' designation as a foreign terrorist organization is set to go into effect on Nov. 24, Rubio said in a statement. He alleged the cartel is headed by Maduro and \"other high-ranking individuals of the illegitimate Maduro regime who have corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary.\"",
      "\"Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela's legitimate government,\" Rubio added. \"Cartel de los Soles by and with other designated FTOs including Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel are responsible for terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters Sunday night after the announcement was made, President Trump said, \"We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we'll see how that turns out. They would like to talk.\"",
      "Cartel de los Soles is not known to be a traditional, hierarchical drug cartel like the Sinaloa or Tren de Aragua The term is instead generally used to describe a loose, decentralized network of military and government officials within the Venezuelan state who are alleged to be involved in the illegal drug trade.",
      "The U.S. has asserted that Maduro is complicit with armed criminal gangs that smuggle drugs into the U.S., allegations that Maduro has rejected. And over the last two months, the U.S. military has\u00a0conducted strikes against at least 22 vessels it alleges were ferrying drugs from South America to the U.S., killing at least 83 people.",
      "\"Through unwavering commitment and the precise use of our forces, we stand ready to combat the transnational threats that seek to destabilize our region,\" Adm. Alvin Holsey, commander of U.S. Southern Command, said Sunday in a statement announcing the USS Ford's arrival in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"The USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group's deployment represents a critical step in reinforcing our resolve to protect the security of the Western Hemisphere and the safety of the American Homeland,\" he added. Southern Command is the primary combatant unit for operations in the Caribbean and South America.",
      "The Ford rounds off the largest buildup of U.S. firepower in the region in generations, in what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dubbed Operation Southern Spear. The Ford's carrier strike group, which includes squadrons of fighter jets and guided-missile destroyers, transited the Anegada Passage near the British Virgin Islands on Sunday morning, the Navy said.",
      "Rear Adm. Paul Lanzilotta, who commands the Ford's carrier strike group, said it will bolster an already large force of American warships to \"protect our nation's security and prosperity against narco-terrorism in the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "The administration has insisted that the buildup of warships is focused on stopping the flow of drugs into the U.S., but it has released no evidence to support its assertions that those killed in the boats were \"narco-terrorists.\"",
      "President Trump said Friday that he's \"sort of\" decided how to proceed on Venezuela, as\u00a0top officials\u00a0weigh potential military operations in the Latin American country. \"I sort of have made up my mind\" about the administration's next steps in Venezuela, he told CBS News aboard Air Force One, but \"I can't tell you what it would be.\"",
      "Top Trump administration officials, military and senior staff gathered at the White House for at least the third day in a row on Friday to discuss possible military operations in Venezuela, according to sources familiar with the matter. Vice President JD Vance, Hegseth, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were among those who spoke with Mr. Trump at the White House on Friday, the sources said.",
      "Venezuela was also discussed as part of the president's daily intelligence briefing on Wednesday. CBS News has\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that Hegseth, Caine and other military officials presented Mr. Trump on Wednesday with options for potential operations in\u00a0Venezuela\u00a0in the coming days, including possible strikes on land.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuela announced Tuesday that it was\u00a0launching a massive military exercise\u00a0across the country, reportedly involving some 200,000 forces.",
      "Many people both inside Venezuela, including Maduro himself, and observers outside the country believe the increased U.S. military pressure is\u00a0aimed at forcing Maduro out of office.",
      "When asked\u00a0in a recent interview with \"60 Minutes\" if Maduro's \"days were numbered,\" Mr. Trump responded, \"I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.\" Mr. Trump\u00a0last month also confirmed\u00a0that he had authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela.",
      "The president has justified the attacks on drug boats by saying the U.S. is in \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels while claiming the boats are operated by foreign terror organizations. He has faced pushback from leaders in the region, the U.N. human rights chief and lawmakers, including some Republicans, who have pressed for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the boat strikes.",
      "Senate Republicans\u00a0recently voted to reject legislation that would have put a check on Mr. Trump's ability to launch an attack against Venezuela without congressional authorization. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the only Republicans to support the resolution, which failed in a 49-51 vote.",
      "Experts disagree on whether or not American warplanes may be used to strike land targets inside Venezuela. Either way, the 100,000-ton warship is sending a message, one expert said.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 19:28:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.N. Security Council has approved a U.S. plan for Gaza that authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in the Palestinian territory.",
    "story": [
      "The U.N. Security Council on Monday approved a U.S. plan for Gaza that authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in the devastated territory and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Russia, which had circulated a rival resolution, abstained along with China on the 13-0 vote. The U.S. and other countries had hoped Moscow would not use its veto power on the United Nations' most powerful body to block the resolution's adoption.",
      "The vote was a crucial next step for the fragile ceasefire and efforts to outline Gaza's future following two years of war between Israel and Hamas. Arab and other Muslim countries that expressed interest in providing troops for an international force had signaled that Security Council authorization was essential for their participation.",
      "The ceasefire went into effect on Oct. 10, but accusations of violations of the terms by both Hamas and Israel had threatened to upend the deal in the weeks since its implementation.",
      "The first phase of the deal called for Hamas to release all living and deceased hostages in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel. While the living hostages were returned by the deadline, the remains of some of the dead hostages had not been handed over \u2014 with both Hamas and U.S. officials citing the difficulties in recovering some of the remains amid the destruction in the Gaza Strip \u2014 which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said constituted a violation.",
      "There have also been flare-ups of violence in Gaza, including airstrikes from Israel, which it said were in retaliation for Hamas attacks on Israeli forces, since the deal went into effect. International advocates have also accused Israel of not adhering to the requirement to deliver all of the aid it promised to Gaza in the deal.",
      "The U.S. resolution endorses President Trump's 20-point ceasefire plan, which calls for a yet-to-be-established Board of Peace as a transitional authority that Mr. Trump would head. It also authorizes the stabilization force and gives it a wide mandate, including overseeing the borders, providing security and demilitarizing the territory. Authorization for the board and force expires at the end of 2027.",
      "\"Congratulations to the World on the incredible Vote of the United Nations Security Council, just moments ago, acknowledging and endorsing the BOARD OF PEACE, which will be chaired by me, and include the most powerful and respected Leaders throughout the World,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media following the U.N. vote. He thanked the members of the Security Council, including Russia and China, and said, \"The members of the Board, and many more exciting announcements, will be made in the coming weeks.\"",
      "Hamas criticized the U.N.'s adoption of the plan, saying, \"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation,\" according to Reuters.",
      "\"Any international force, if established, must be stationed solely on the borders to separate the forces and monitor the ceasefire, and must be entirely under the supervision of the United Nations,\" Hamas said, according to Al Jazeera.",
      "During nearly two weeks of negotiations on the U.S. resolution, Arab nations and the Palestinians had pressed the United States to strengthen the original weak language about Palestinian self-determination.",
      "The U.S. revised it to say that after the Palestinian Authority \u2014 which now governs parts of the West Bank \u2014 makes reforms and after redevelopment of the devastated Gaza Strip advances, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\"",
      "\"The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,\" it adds.",
      "That language angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed Sunday to oppose any attempt to establish a Palestinian state. He has long asserted that creating a Palestinian state would reward Hamas and eventually lead to an even larger Hamas-run state on Israel's borders.",
      "A key to the resolution's adoption was support from Arab and Muslim nations pushing for a ceasefire and potentially contributing to the international force. The U.S. mission to the U.N. distributed a joint statement Friday with Qatar, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan and Turkey calling for \"swift adoption\" of the U.S. proposal.",
      "The vote took place amid hopes that Gaza's fragile ceasefire would be maintained after a war set off by Hamas' surprise terror attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel's more than two-year offensive has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children.",
      "Russia last week suddenly circulated a rival proposal with stronger language supporting a Palestinian state alongside Israel and stressed that the West Bank and Gaza must be joined as a state under the Palestinian Authority.",
      "It also stripped out references to the transitional board and asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to provide options for an international force to provide security in Gaza and for implementing the ceasefire plan, stressing the importance of a Security Council role.",
      "The U.S. resolution calls for the stabilization force to ensure \"the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip\" and \"the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.\" A big question is how to disarm Hamas, which has not fully accepted that step.",
      "It authorizes the force \"to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate\" in compliance with international law, which is U.N. language for the use of military force.",
      "The resolution says the stabilization troops will help secure border areas, along with a Palestinian police force that they have trained and vetted, and they will coordinate with other countries to secure the flow of humanitarian assistance. It says the force should closely consult and cooperate with neighboring Egypt and Israel.",
      "As the international force establishes control and brings stability, the resolution says Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\" These must be agreed to by the stabilization force, Israeli forces, the U.S. and the guarantors of the ceasefire, it says.",

      "Colon cancer patients could live longer if they take GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, a new study suggests. (iStock)",
      "\"The central message is that GLP-1 medications were associated with substantially lower five-year mortality among patients with colon cancer, and that this signal was most pronounced in those with severe obesity, with BMI at or above 35,\" lead study author Raphael Cuomo, Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and member of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Taken together, the findings are consistent with the idea that improving metabolic health and reducing obesity-related inflammation can translate into better cancer outcomes, not only better glycemic control.\"",

      "The researcher said the findings, which were published in the journal Cancer Investigation on Nov. 11, were surprising.",
      "\"I expected some benefit in patients with severe obesity, because GLP-1 therapies directly target the metabolic and inflammatory milieu that drives worse colon cancer outcomes, but the absolute difference in five-year mortality was larger than many clinicians might anticipate,\" Cuomo said.",
      "Only about 15% of GLP-1 users died within five years compared with 37% of non-users. (iStock)",
      "One potential reason for the effect is that GLP-1s are known to reduce inflammation, lower insulin levels and promote weight loss, which could also slow down cancer growth, the release stated.",

      "Dr. Marc Siegel, a Fox News senior medical analyst who was not involved in the research, noted that the study is observational, so it can\u2019t prove causation, but it is \"very exciting, because it fits in with what is becoming clearer and clearer about these drugs.\"",
      "\"Namely, they are systemic anti-inflammatory agents that overcome insulin resistance and improve metabolic function,\" he went on. \"It is disarray of metabolism, especially when accompanied by inflammatory chemicals that can form the precursors of cancer, including colon cancer.\"",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The study did have some limitations, primarily that it could not prove that GLP-1s caused the extended survival, but only established an association.",
      "\"One caveat: It may not be for all people,\" Siegel cautioned. \"Delayed gastric emptying, which accompanies these drugs, could be a carcinogenic factor with some patients, perhaps those with inflammatory bowel disease.\"",
      "The survival benefit was seen even after accounting for factors like age, cancer severity and other medical issues. (iStock)",

This is especially egregious given that Turning Point USA\u2019s events involve minors. These are young kids being attacked by left-wing radicals who are adults! This 100% should be investigated by authorities.\"",

      "A major national security debate is unfolding, and it affects more than government networks. It touches your home, your devices and the Wi-Fi your family uses every day. The Commerce Department has proposed blocking new sales of TP-Link products after a months-long review into the company\u2019s ties to China, citing a growing TP-Link security risk.",

      "Why military families are even more vulnerable",
      "Lawmakers from both parties say military households face extra risk. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who leads a bipartisan group of 23 lawmakers, warns that TP-Link cameras and networking devices sold on Army, Navy and Air Force exchange sites could expose sensitive footage from base housing and dorms. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, echoed that concern, saying these devices could act as a backdoor for Chinese intelligence to collect information on service members and their families. Even when products appear out of stock, officials worry they remain popular in military communities.",
      "These lawmakers say Chinese laws could force companies to share data or push hidden software changes that weaken U.S. networks. They argue that this creates a real risk for households on or near military installations. While TP-Link disputes every allegation and states that it stores U.S. data inside America, lawmakers want a deeper investigation.",
      "\"China will use any way to infiltrate us, and we must ensure they cannot access our homeland or military bases,\" said Ernst. \"High-tech security cameras sending video and audio directly back to Beijing must be treated like the grave threat that they are.

    "summary": "Washington court rules automated license plate reader images are public records, even when stored by vendors like Flock Safety, setting precedent for transparency.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A Skagit County Superior Court judge ruled that images from Flock Safety automated license plate reader cameras in Stanwood and Sedro-Woolley qualify as public records under Washington's Public Records Act.",
      "Judge Elizabeth Yost Neidzwski said the images are \"not exempt from disclosure\" and explained that an agency does not need to physically hold a record for it to fall under the law.",
      "The request that led to the ruling",
      "The case began when Washington resident Jose Rodriguez asked Stanwood for one hour of Flock camera images. That request prompted Stanwood and neighboring Sedro-Woolley to ask the court to declare that vendor-stored data did not count as public records.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Judge Neidzwski rejected that argument. She said the cities' ALPR images support a government purpose and meet the definition of a public record.",
      "SEATTLE ELECTS DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST KATIE WILSON AS MAYOR",
      "Flock Safety cameras use AI to capture license plate images in real time, tracking vehicles as they move through neighborhoods. (Flock Safety)",
      "However, Rodriguez will not receive the specific images he sought. The city had already allowed the footage to auto-delete after 30 days, and it expired before the ruling.",
      "We reached out to Flock Safety, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"The Court merely declined to exempt these records from disclosure under Washington's extremely broad public records law. Nothing changed in the status quo in Washington as a result of this ruling \u2014 these records were covered by the law before the ruling, and remain so following the ruling. Unfortunately, some individuals in Washington have abused the breadth of the public records law to extort significant settlements from Washington communities for technical violations of the disclosure requirements, which we cannot believe is the intent of the law. We are supporting efforts to enact a legislative fix to this situation, which is costing Washington communities tens of thousands of dollars to stave off frivolous lawsuits.\"",
      "The Washington court ruling marks a major step toward transparency in how police collect and store surveillance data. (Flock Safety)",
      "Why the decision matters for transparency",
      "Flock's automated license plate reader cameras capture multiple still images of passing vehicles along with time, location and license plate information. Cities use the system to assist law enforcement with investigations, relying on stored images to identify vehicles connected to crimes or alerts.",
      "The court's ruling raises broader questions about how local agencies manage these images once they're created. By finding that the images qualify as public records, the decision forces cities to examine how long they retain this data, how it is stored and who may request access under state law.",
      "Privacy advocates say the ruling highlights the need for clear policies around retention and transparency, while law enforcement groups argue that access rules must still protect ongoing investigations.",
      "AI DASHCAMS ENHANCE TRUCKER SAFETY WHILE RAISING PRIVACY CONCERNS",
      "The debate continues as communities weigh the balance between public safety, privacy and the right to know what\u2019s being recorded. (Flock Safety)",
      "How this ruling impacts privacy and surveillance",
      "For years, cities and police agencies have argued that data stored by third-party vendors falls outside public records laws. They often make this claim even when the data documents activity on public roads. The Washington ruling did not settle broader questions about surveillance, but it rejected the idea that Flock camera images are exempt simply because a vendor stores them. This decision exposes a growing tension between how agencies use surveillance tools and what the public can access under state law.",
      "Beryl Lipton of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to defending digital privacy, free expression and transparency in technology, told Cyberguy,\u00a0\"The use of third-party vendors for surveillance and data storage is widespread and growing across the country, and allowing this to undermine the public\u2019s right to know is very dangerous. The government's primary obligation should be to its constituents, which includes protecting their rights under public records laws, not to the private vendors that they choose to employ while conducting mass surveillance. Whether an agency stores images and information on their own devices or on the private server of a vendor should not affect the appropriate disclosure of these records under public records laws. If the use of these devices makes it too difficult for a city to comply with the law, then the response should not be to circumvent the laws they find inconvenient, but rather it should be to only use vendors that won\u2019t get in the way of a city\u2019s ability to fulfill its responsibilities to their citizenry. Otherwise, they should not use these tools at all.\"",
      "What this means for you",
      "If your town uses Flock or other automated license plate readers, this ruling shows how Washington courts may handle future records requests. It confirms that ALPR images can count as public records, even when a vendor stores the data.",
      "The debate over privacy and safety continues. Supporters say public access builds trust and oversight. Critics worry that releasing vehicle data could expose sensitive details without strong safeguards or redactions.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This ruling shows how courts may handle data from automated license plate readers. It also reveals how much vehicle information cities collect. As a result, it raises new questions about who should access these records. In addition, the decision may guide future transparency debates in Washington. However, it will also spark fresh conversations about how surveillance tools fit within state records laws.",

      "Security expert Xavier Mertens first spotted the campaign, confirming that the same kind of scheme was seen earlier this year. According to BleepingComputer, these fake TikTok videos show short PowerShell commands and instruct viewers to run them as administrators to \"activate\" or \"fix\" their programs.",

      "How the TikTok scam works",
      "This campaign uses what experts call a ClickFix attack. It's a social engineering trick that makes victims feel they're following legitimate tech instructions. The instructions seem quick and simple: run one short command and get instant access to premium software.",
      "But instead of activating anything, the PowerShell command connects to a remote domain named slmgr[.]win, which downloads harmful executables from Cloudflare-hosted pages. The main file, updater.exe, is a variant of the Aura Stealer malware. Once inside the system, it hunts for your credentials and sends them back to the attacker.",
      "Another file, source.exe, uses Microsoft's C# compiler to launch code directly in memory, making it even harder to detect. The purpose of this extra payload isn't fully known yet, but the pattern follows previous malware used for crypto theft and ransomware delivery.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "In-vitro fertilization (IVF) can take a serious toll on families, not only emotionally but financially, especially when every cycle comes with new bills and no clear sense of what the full journey might cost. Gaia Family aims to change that by removing the guesswork around pricing with a blend of tech and AI-driven forecasting.",
      "Instead of worrying about unpredictable costs, couples pay a fixed upfront price or monthly installments that cover their planned IVF treatment, medications, embryo transfers and built-in protections if cycles or transfers aren't successful. It gives families a clearer path forward and support that lasts through the entire process.",

      "Artificial intelligence is giving hopeful parents more clarity about their chances over multiple IVF cycles, helping them plan their journey with clearer expectations instead of guesswork. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Gaia Family was born",
      "Gaia Family was founded by Nader AlSalim, a former Goldman Sachs executive who knew the IVF struggle firsthand. After spending over $50,000 across five IVF rounds in multiple countries, he and his wife finally had a son. The experience left him frustrated by how little clarity the system offered and how emotionally draining the process could be.",
      "He saw that most fertility systems were built around procedures, not people. His goal with Gaia Family was to build something different, a program that uses data to empower families instead of leaving them to navigate uncertainty and mounting debt. That personal experience became the foundation of Gaia Family's mission to bring agency, transparency and compassion to fertility care.",

      "Gaia Family gives families one fixed IVF price with built-in protection and full support every step of the way. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Choose your clinic:\u00a0Gaia partners with more than 100 fertility clinics across the U.S.Get your personalized quote: Your doctor designs your treatment plan, and Gaia uses it to calculate your fixed cost upfront.Start with confidence:\u00a0Pay monthly or upfront, then begin treatment knowing all your major expenses are covered.",

      "Get your personalized quote: Your doctor designs your treatment plan, and Gaia uses it to calculate your fixed cost upfront.",
      "Start with confidence:\u00a0Pay monthly or upfront, then begin treatment knowing all your major expenses are covered.",
      "If a cycle doesn't result in viable embryos, Gaia's built-in protection covers another attempt, helping families try again without financial shock. Once you have viable embryos, your Gaia Plan allows you unlimited frozen embryo transfers (usually $5,000 each) at no extra cost until you have a baby. And, if none of those transfers result in a live birth, then Gaia will give you money toward another cycle. Plus, you have the option of including all of your PGT-A testing and your medication for a fixed cost, so you have even more protection throughout your journey. AlSalim, tells CyberGuy the company's mission goes beyond technology.",
      "\"At Gaia Family, we're using AI not to replace the human element of fertility care, but to bring more confidence to it,\" AlSalim said. \"Fertility treatment can feel like a game of chance \u2014 our technology helps turn it into a guided, informed journey. By analyzing millions of data points, we can forecast the most effective and affordable pathway for each individual, so patients can make decisions grounded in data rather than uncertainty. Ultimately, it's about giving hopeful parents more agency, transparency and peace of mind in one of the most emotional experiences of their lives.\"",
      "SKIN DNA BREAKTHROUGH COULD LET 60-YEAR-OLD WOMEN HAVE GENETICALLY RELATED KIDS",
      "For many couples, this combination of data and compassion is transforming uncertainty into confidence and renewed hope. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Gaia Family's model matters",
      "IVF in the United States can cost as much as $30,000 per cycle, and most couples need several tries. Each failed attempt adds more bills and stress. Gaia Family's fixed-cost model gives families financial predictability while keeping them emotionally supported. It also encourages clinics to focus on outcomes rather than repeated treatments.",
      "This approach is transforming how people view fertility care. Instead of relying on luck, families can benefit from AI insights to make better decisions. While it may not lower the medical costs yet, it changes how couples experience one of life's most emotional challenges, turning fear into informed planning and despair into hope. Gaia removes the spiraling costs, making couples' outcomes so much more cost-efficient.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are thinking about IVF or egg freezing, Gaia Family's model could make your path more manageable. It provides upfront transparency about costs, protection against financial loss and a data-driven forecast of success. It helps you make decisions based on evidence rather than guesswork.",
      "Still, while AI can analyze data patterns, it cannot alter biology. Factors like age, health and genetics continue to shape outcomes. Even so, Gaia Family's system gives couples a sense of control that traditional fertility care rarely provides by serving everyone, with no eligibility criteria in terms of age or health factors. Knowing that your finances are protected can ease stress and allow you to focus on what matters most: building your family.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

      "Could the Klein Vision AirCar redefine the future of travel? Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses.",
      "Pennsylvania may soon join the few states ready to welcome flying cars. State Sen. Marty Flynn from the 22nd District has reintroduced Senate Bill 1077, also known as the Jetsons Act, during the 2025-2026 Regular Session.",
      "The proposal amends Title 75 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, creating a new legal category for roadable aircraft. These vehicles would have the unique ability to operate both on public roads as motor vehicles and in the air as aircraft.",
      "The legislation was referred to the Senate Transportation Committee Nov. 5, 2025. Although a similar version failed to pass last session, Flynn remains committed to positioning Pennsylvania as a leader in advanced transportation technology. He believes that laying the groundwork now will allow the state to adapt quickly when these vehicles become commercially viable.",

      "Lawmakers hope clear rules today will make tomorrow\u2019s skyways as safe as the highways below. (Rachel Wisniewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why this bill matters",
      "Technology is advancing faster than most laws can keep up. The rise of advanced air mobility is blurring the line between cars and aircraft.",
      "Several companies, including\u00a0Alef Aeronautics,\u00a0Samson Sky and\u00a0CycloTech are developing vehicles that can take off vertically or transform from cars to small aircraft within minutes.",
      "Some states are already laying the groundwork for this new era. Minnesota and New Hampshire have passed legislation formally recognizing \"roadable aircraft,\" making them the first states to treat flying cars as both vehicles and aircraft under state law. Pennsylvania now hopes to follow their lead with its own version through Sen. Marty Flynn's Jetsons Act.",
      "At the same time, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has begun approving real-world tests. In 2023, the FAA granted a special airworthiness certificate to SpaceX-backed Alef Aeronautics for its Model A prototype, allowing it to operate on roads and in the air for research and development. That approval marked the first time a flying car received official clearance for combined ground and flight testing in the United States.",
      "Sen. Flynn wants Pennsylvania to be part of this growing national conversation. In his co-sponsorship memo, he explained that proactive legislation will help the state prepare for the next wave of innovation.",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "The Alef flying car is made of ultra-light material, allowing it to fly and travel on roads. (Alef Aeronautics)",
      "How the Jetsons Act would work",
      "Under Senate Bill 1077, Pennsylvania would officially define a \"roadable aircraft\" as a hybrid vehicle capable of both driving and flying. These vehicles would need to register with the state, display a unique registration plate and meet standard inspection requirements. When operated on highways or city streets, they would be subject to the same rules as other vehicles. When used in flight, they would remain under federal aviation oversight.",
      "The bill also clarifies how drivers and pilots must transition between ground and air operations safely. It allows take-offs and landings only in approved areas, except during emergencies. Flynn emphasizes that clear definitions and consistent oversight will prevent confusion for both motorists and law enforcement. He hopes this clarity will also encourage manufacturers to consider Pennsylvania a test site for future flying car technologies.",

      "Pennsylvania\u2019s Jetsons Act aims to prepare the state for the future of flying cars before they take off. (CycloTech)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Pennsylvania, this bill could one day change how you think about personal transportation. While flying cars remain in development, legislation like this sets the stage for their eventual arrival. Drivers may one day register, inspect and insure a flying car just like a regular vehicle. Pilots could use the same roadways to reach take-off zones before switching to flight mode.",
      "Even for residents who never plan to own a flying car, the ripple effects could be significant. New rules may influence local zoning, airspace management and infrastructure planning. Communities might see new vertiports or designated landing pads as part of urban development. Insurance companies and safety regulators will need to rethink how they handle this new class of hybrid travel.",
      "The bill also signals a broader change in how states approach innovation. Rather than waiting for federal action, Pennsylvania wants to establish a framework that welcomes new technologies while protecting public safety.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Sen. Flynn's Jetsons Act might sound futuristic, but it reflects a growing reality in transportation. As autonomous vehicles, drones and hybrid aircraft evolve, state governments must adapt to keep up. This legislation shows Pennsylvania's willingness to lead rather than follow. While it may take years before you see a flying car parked in your driveway, the groundwork is already being laid. Lawmakers are thinking ahead about licensing, safety and how to integrate flying cars into existing traffic systems. That forward-thinking approach could one day make Pennsylvania one of the first states to see cars take to the sky.",

If you ever get a message about a service you never signed up for, delete it right away. Instead of calling the number in the message, go to the official Best Buy or Geek Squad website to confirm if there is a real issue with your account. Also, sign up for strong antivirus software. Antivirus software acts as your digital guard. It scans downloads, detects malicious links and warns you before dangerous sites load. Choose a trusted program that updates automatically and includes email protection features.

      "Conduent, which manages critical public services across the United States, says hackers infiltrated its systems for nearly three months. The cyberattack exposed personal information linked to more than 10 million people.",
      "All about the Conduent breach and its scale",
      "Conduent discovered the intrusion in January 2025 and said hackers had infiltrated its network as early as Oct. 21, 2024. During this period, attackers reportedly stole large amounts of data linked to state-level programs such as Medicaid, child support, food assistance and toll systems. Conduent claims that its investigation found no ongoing malicious activity and said operations were safely restored after the breach was contained.",
      "Conduent manages technology and payment systems for dozens of U.S. state governments, processing roughly $85 billion in annual disbursements and handling over 2 billion customer service interactions every year. According to its own estimates, it supports around 100 million residents through various government health and welfare programs.",

      "The company reported that at least 400,000 people in Texas were affected, with compromised data including Social Security numbers, medical records and health insurance details. Other affected states include Washington, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Maine, Oregon, Massachusetts and California.

      "How the Conduent breach unfolded",
      "In January, Conduent described the event as an \"operational disruption caused by a third-party compromise.\" The breach led to several days of downtime, disrupting vital services in multiple states. In Wisconsin, for instance, parents and beneficiaries were unable to process payments due to system outages, leaving many struggling to meet obligations related to child support and welfare programs.",
      "The SafePay ransomware group later claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging it had stolen 8.5 terabytes of data. Conduent confirmed in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that hackers had indeed exfiltrated files belonging to a limited number of clients. The company says it hired cybersecurity experts to analyze the stolen data and recently confirmed that it contained significant amounts of personal information from end-users across multiple programs.",
      "Despite the massive theft, Conduent said there is currently no evidence that the stolen data has been published online or on dark web marketplaces.",
      "HACKERS TARGET ONLINE STORES WITH NEW ATTACK",
      "We reached out to Conduent for a comment, and a rep for the company provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",

At this time, Conduent has no evidence of any attempted or actual misuse of any information potentially affected by this incident.",
      "\"Upon discovery of the incident, Conduent acted quickly to secure its networks, restore its systems and operations, notify law enforcement and conduct an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensics experts. In addition, given the nature and complexity of the data involved, Conduent has been working diligently with a dedicated review team, including internal and external experts, to conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information contained therein, which was a time-intensive process. Conduent takes this matter seriously and regrets any inconvenience this incident may have caused.\"",

Data exfiltration on this scale has long-term implications, from identity theft to potential fraud within public benefit systems. The real test will be how both Conduent and its government partners adapt their cybersecurity oversight to prevent similar breaches. Because at this point, the question isn't whether these systems will be targeted again, but whether they'll be any better prepared when it happens.",

    "summary": "Texas startup Janta Power raises $5.5M for innovative vertical solar towers that generate 50% more energy than traditional panels while using just one-third the land.",
    "story": [
      "As AI data centers use more electricity, the solar industry is ramping up to provide more power.",
      "Texas startup Janta Power has secured $5.5 million in seed funding to expand its next-generation solar power towers, a vertical alternative to flat solar farms. The funding round was led by MaC Venture Capital with support from Collab Capital. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide.",
      "Why flat solar panels are no longer enough",
      "Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. This approach uses a lot of land and misses much of the day's available sunlight. The sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead.",
      "Janta Power takes a different approach. The company's pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Think of it as the solar version of a skyscraper: more power from less ground space.",
      "Janta Power\u2019s 3D solar towers capture more sunlight throughout the day while using just a third of the land. (Janta Power)",
      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How Janta's solar towers work",
      "Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the sun's path from sunrise to sunset. By adjusting its position throughout the day, the system collects more sunlight than traditional fixed panels. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.",

      "Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. The result is a steadier flow of electricity across the entire day, reducing stress on power grids and lowering the need for short-term backup plants.",
      "Stronger, smarter and more efficient",
      "Janta's towers are also built for strength. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments.",
      "Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide.",
      "A game-changer for energy economics",
      "The company's 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15.",
      "That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy.",
      "Built to endure 170 mph winds, Janta\u2019s modular towers are already powering airports in Munich, Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, and across Aena\u2019s global network. (Shelby Tauber/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "CHINESE-MADE SOLAR PANELS USED ON AMERICAN FARMS PUTS US POWER GRID AT RISK: FORMER NSA OFFICIAL",
      "What this means for you",
      "For businesses and communities, Janta Power's technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms.",
      "For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

    "story": [
      "CyberGuy explains how to make safe and secure passwords on your iPhone.",
      "Your Mac holds a lot more than just files. It carries your personal information, payment data, messages and every online account you access. Keeping that information safe starts with how you sign in. For years, passwords have been the standard way to protect accounts, but they are also one of the weakest links in digital security. They can be guessed, stolen or reused across multiple sites.",
      "Apple's introduction of passkeys marks a major step forward. Instead of relying on something you need to remember, passkeys rely on something you have (your trusted Apple device) and something you are, like your fingerprint or face. Together with iCloud Keychain and two-factor authentication, passkeys create a seamless and much safer way to secure your Mac and your digital life.",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys are a modern alternative to passwords. They use public key cryptography to let you sign in without ever creating or typing a password. When you register for an account using a passkey, your Mac creates two unique keys. One is public and stored by the website or app, and the other is private and stays securely on your device.",
      "The public key is not sensitive information. The private key, on the other hand, never leaves your Mac and is protected behind your device's security features. When you sign in, Touch ID or Face ID confirms your identity before your Mac uses the private key to authenticate you. This process prevents phishing and password leaks because no shared secret is ever transmitted to the website.",

      "HOW TO USE PASSKEYS TO KEEP YOUR COMPUTER SAFE",
      "A passkey on your Mac replaces passwords with a faster, more secure way to sign in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Apple keeps passkeys secure",
      "Passkeys are stored and synced across your devices through iCloud Keychain, which is protected by end-to-end encryption. This means that not even Apple can access your passkeys or passwords. iCloud Keychain also has built-in protection against brute force attacks, even if someone were to gain unauthorized access to Apple's servers.",
      "If you lose your devices, you can still recover your passkeys through iCloud Keychain recovery. To do this, you must sign in with your Apple ID and password, verify your identity with a code sent to your trusted number and confirm using your device passcode. The system limits the number of attempts, and if too many failed attempts occur, the recovery record is locked or destroyed to prevent misuse.",
      "You can also set an account recovery contact to make sure you never lose access, even if you forget your Apple ID password or device passcode. This multi-layered design ensures that your data remains secure even in extreme scenarios, such as a compromised Apple account or cloud breach.",
      "How to set up passkeys on your Mac",

It is a good thing that they are now forced to start soberly thinking about their defense and what that might entail.\"",

      "That urgency extends to nuclear cooperation, where Saudi Arabia has made clear that while China and South Korea exist as alternatives, its preference is for an American program. \"Saudi Arabia really wants American nuclear cooperation because it adds more security,\" he said, adding that Riyadh will not \"wait forever\" if conditions become overly restrictive but sees the current U.S. posture as an opening.",

      "Olidort said Saudi Arabia has been \"very categorical\" in what it expects in a changed Middle East: a defense pact and movement on Palestinian statehood. He recalled hearing a senior Saudi official say recently that \"there will be no regional integration without Palestinian statehood,\" a line that reflects the kingdom\u2019s long-standing public position that recognition of Israel will only come after a credible pathway to a Palestinian state is in place.",
      "Still, Olidort said full Saudi-Israel normalization may not be necessary at this moment for U.S. priorities to advance. He said normalization \"doesn\u2019t need to be the immediate priority\" and suggested that \"an upgraded deepening of cooperation, but short of full normalization,\" could be possible if both sides see value in closer security integration.",

      "That perspective is particularly relevant given the war in Gaza and Riyadh\u2019s position on reconstruction. As Alghashian noted, Saudi Arabia has said it \"will not do reconstruction unless Hamas is gone and Israel withdraws,\" a stance that places the kingdom at odds with any rushed postwar plan and, in his view, leaves the region \"in no man\u2019s land.\"",

      "Trump\u2019s decision to approve F-35 sales to Saudi Arabia adds another layer. Saudi Arabia has formally requested up to 48 of the fifth-generation jets, making it the largest potential F-35 buyer outside NATO and the first Arab state after the United Arab Emirates to receive them. The move would test Washington\u2019s commitment to maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge.",
      "Olidort, however, argued that the sale does not automatically threaten Israel\u2019s superiority. \"I don\u2019t know that it will mean Israel losing air superiority,\" he said, noting that Israel\u2019s defense and aerospace sectors are \"world-class\" and that the sale could \"potentially deepen collaboration between Israel and Saudi Arabia and make each of our partners\u2026 more effective.\"",

      "Those records would need to be released \u201cnot later than 30 days\u201d after the law is enacted.",
      "The legislation says the attorney general may withhold or redact any information that identifies victims or would jeopardize an active federal investigation.",
      "Ahead of the House vote, Massie, Khanna and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., held an emotional news conference outside the Capitol with more than a dozen Epstein survivors, urging senators to quickly take up the bill.",
      "\"You had Jeffrey Epstein, who literally set up an island of rape \u2014 a rape island \u2014 and you had rich and powerful men, some of the richest people in the world, who thought that they could hang out with bankers, buy off politicians and abuse and rape America\u2019s girls with no consequence,\" Khanna told reporters Tuesday.",
      "\"Because survivors spoke up, because of their courage, the truth is finally going to come out,\" he added. \"And when it comes out, this country is really going to have a moral reckoning.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had been working to persuade the Senate to amend language in the bill to better protect the identities of victims. Higgins, the lone no vote, wrote on X that the bill, as written, could reveal \"thousands of innocent people \u2014 witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc.\"",
      "But Massie urged his fellow Republicans not to \"muck it up in the Senate.\" And in the end, with such a large vote in the House, no GOP senator dared stand in the way.",
      "\"We fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win,\" Massie said, adding that opponents deserved some \"credit\" because they ultimately came around to the legislation. \"They are finally on the side of justice.\"",
      "Even after having voted for the bill, Johnson was still fuming over the process hours later. Returning to the Capitol from a White House dinner honoring Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Johnson said, \"I'm deeply disappointed in this outcome,\" and he lamented that \"Chuck Schumer rushed it to the floor.\" Senate Majority John Thune, R-S.D., didn't object, despite being aware of Johnson's concerns.",
      "Johnson said he was continuing to have conversations with Trump about those issues. \"I'm frustrated with the process,\" he said, \"but I trust Leader Thune.\"",

      "All House Democrats were on board, and after half the House signed the discharge petition to force a vote, a deluge of Republicans began announcing they would vote for it.",
      "Trump and the White House had worked behind the scenes to stop the effort, trying to pressure a handful of GOP women to drop off the petition.",
      "But with the writing on the wall, Trump abruptly reversed course Sunday night, posting on Truth Social that House Republicans should vote for the bill. On Friday, Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Epstein\u2019s ties to prominent Democrats and financial institutions.",
      "Trump, who had supported releasing the Epstein files before his re-election last year, vowed Monday to sign the legislation should it reach his desk, which he said would allow the GOP to turn the page and focus on the economy.",
      "\"Some of the people that we mentioned are being looked at very seriously for their relationship to Jeffrey Epstein, but they were with him all the time \u2014 I wasn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t at all,\" Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "\"What I just don\u2019t want Epstein to do is detract from the great success of the Republican Party, including the fact that the Democrats are totally blamed for the shutdown,\" he continued.",
      "Standing with fellow Epstein survivors Tuesday, Jena-Lisa Jones lashed out at Trump over the new Justice Department probe.",
      "\u201cI beg you, President Trump: Please stop making this political,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt is not about you, President Trump. You are our president. Please start acting like it. Show some class, show some real leadership, show that you actually care about the people other than yourself.\u201d",
      "Jones said she voted for Trump. \u201cYour behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment,\" she said.",
      "Asked about the criticism, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said: \"Democrats and the media knew about Epstein and his victims for years and did nothing to help them while President Trump was calling for transparency, and is now delivering on it with thousands of pages of documents as part of the ongoing Oversight investigation.\"",
      "A conservative Trump ally in the House told NBC News that Republicans have been widely frustrated with the White House\u2019s dismissive handling of the Epstein saga and have privately encouraged it to shift strategy \u2014 which was communicated as recently as Friday, days before Trump flipped on the issue.",
      "The White House was also warned that there would be mass Republican defections on the House floor.",
      "Thousands of documents released",
      "The Justice Department has already turned over tens of thousands of documents from the Epstein investigation to the House Oversight Committee, which is conducting its own probe and has made many of those records public.",
      "In addition, Democrats on the Oversight Committee released a series of emails last week from Epstein to Maxwell and journalist Michael Wolff that refer to Trump, which Epstein\u2019s estate turned over in response to a subpoena. In one 2019 email, Epstein wrote of Trump, \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\u201d but he didn't accuse Trump of any wrongdoing.",
      "Trump has consistently denied involvement in any of Epstein's crimes. The two men had socialized in the 1980s and the 1990s, including at a 1992 party at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where video shows them discussing women. But Trump and Epstein had a falling-out in the 2000s, when Trump accused Epstein of hiring away girls and young women from his resort\u2019s spa. Trump said he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago.",
      "In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to Florida state charges of soliciting prostitution with a minor. In July 2019, the Justice Department charged him with sex trafficking of minors. A month later, authorities said, Epstein killed himself in his jail cell while he was awaiting trial.",
      "Johnson has argued for months that the Epstein legislation isn't needed because the Oversight Committee has been releasing documents to the public. He dodged questions Monday about Trump's about-face and his conversations with the president.",
      "\"He's never had anything to hide. He and I had the same concern \u2014 that we wanted to ensure that victims of these heinous crimes are completely protected from disclosure, those who don't want their names out there,\" Johnson told reporters. \"And I'm not sure the discharge petition does that, and that's part of the problem.\""

    "story": [
      "A whistleblower who came forward to House Democrats alleging convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell received preferential treatment at a federal prison camp in Texas says she was not motivated by politics.",
      "Instead, \u201cthis was about common human decency and doing what\u2019s right for all inmates,\u201d Noella Turnage, a nurse who worked at Federal Prison Camp Bryan since 2019 until she was fired last week, told NBC News on Monday.",
      "She added that when even one inmate is wrongly retaliated against, \u201cand influence gets another one protected, somebody had to say something.\u201d",
      "Maxwell\u2019s time at FPC Bryan, an all-women\u2019s minimum-security facility, has come under scrutiny since her transfer there in early August from a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida. Her relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has become a focal point as Democrats and some Republicans renew their push to compel the Justice Department to make all investigative files surrounding Epstein\u2019s case public.",
      "Turnage said she was not driven by public outrage surrounding Epstein, Maxwell or any other public figures, but acted because she felt \u201cfailed by the institution\u201d when colleagues and others have spoken out about alleged leadership misconduct and retaliation.",
      "She said the federal Bureau of Prisons fired her on Nov. 10. The decision came a day after the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, wrote a letter to President Donald Trump saying they had received information from a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d indicating Maxwell was working on filing a \u201ccommutation application\u201d and receiving special treatment not typically afforded to inmates at Bryan. The information obtained by the House Judiciary Committee included email correspondence that Maxwell sent during her first few months at the prison camp.",
      "Leah Saffian, an attorney for Maxwell, said Friday that employees at FPC Bryan lost their jobs in light of Maxwell\u2019s emails being shared.",
      "There have been employees \u201cterminated for improper, unauthorized access to the email system used by the Federal Bureau of Prisons to allow inmates to communicate with the outside world,\u201d Saffian said in a statement.",
      "NBC News previously reviewed Maxwell\u2019s emails which indicated she was \u201chappier\u201d with her move to a facility that was cleaner and where staff were friendly.",
      "Maxwell\u2019s emails also suggested she had direct access to Bryan\u2019s warden, Tanisha Hall, for help, including arranging visits and communicating with her lawyers \u2014 actions that are highly unusual, other attorneys with clients at the prison say.",
      "The BOP and Hall did not respond to requests for comment about employees terminated in connection with Maxwell.",
      "A spokeswoman for House Judiciary Democrats said Tuesday they would continue to back government employees who claim retaliatory behavior in the workplace in order to shed light on waste, fraud and corruption.",
      "\"Trump's Bureau of Prisons appears to have wrongfully fired an individual for blowing the whistle to Congress on the grotesque pampering of convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell,\" the spokeswoman said. \"Retaliating against whistleblowers is a violation of federal law.\"",
      "Turnage said she was in contact with the House Judiciary Committee after Raskin wrote a letter to Hall on Oct. 30 asking about Maxwell\u2019s perceived \u201cVIP treatment.\u201d",
      "In that letter, Raskin said he was alarmed by news reports that the prison was giving special accommodations to Maxwell\u2019s visitors and other alleged perks, such as meals sent to her dormitory room, late-night workouts and the ability to shower after other inmates were already in bed for the night.",
      "His inquiry also raised other accusations made by inmates that they have been threatened with retaliation if they speak about Maxwell to the media. At least two inmates have been transferred out of Bryan after doing so, according to media reports that reviewed BOP records. NBC News has not confirmed the reason for the transfers.",
      "Turnage and another former Bryan employee, Ashley Anderson, said they spoke with House Democratic committee staff about allegations that BOP policy has been repeatedly violated and retaliation exists against those who report wrongdoing.",
      "Anderson, who had been a senior specialist officer at Bryan for a decade before she was terminated in August, said that she has tried to speak out in support of inmates who\u2019ve reported alleged abuse but that there remain \u201cflaws in a system that often lacks transparency, accountability, and fairness.\u201d",
      "Saffian has called the release of Maxwell\u2019s emails \u201cimproper\u201d and denied that a pardon application had been made to the Trump administration. She also said she would be filing a habeas petition with the Southern District of New York to challenge Maxwell\u2019s 20-year prison sentence for recruiting minors to be sexually abused by Epstein.",
      "Epstein died by suicide in a New York City jail in 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.",
      "Maxwell\u2019s transfer to FPC Bryan in early August came days after she met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in July. At that meeting, Maxwell told Blanche she never witnessed any inappropriate conduct by Trump or any other prominent figures associated with Epstein\u2019s orbit, according to a transcript. Trump, whose name appeared in the unsealed records as a friend of Epstein\u2019s before they had a falling out, has not been accused by authorities of any wrongdoing.",
      "Trump initially supported the release of documents related to Epstein before sparring with Democrats and some members of his own party, saying not all files should be made public.",
      "Last week, thousands of emails from the Epstein estate were released by the House Oversight Committee, including many that referenced Trump. On Sunday, Trump unexpectedly changed his stance on the issue, writing on his Truth Social account that House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files \u201cbecause we have nothing to hide.\u201d",
      "Turnage and Anderson said in a further statement that speaking to members of Congress about their time at Bryan was not about swaying the political narratives in the larger Epstein saga.",
      "\u201cThis was about truth, and nothing else,\u201d they said. \u201cIt was about telling the truth about how both staff and inmates were treated.\u201d"

      "James Comey is appearing before a federal judge in Virginia on Wednesday as his attorneys argue that the former FBI director is facing a \u201cselective and vindictive\u201d prosecution by the Trump administration,  a key hearing that could determine the future of the case.",
      "Comey was charged in September with making a false statement to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding, days after President Donald Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute Comey and others. Comey pleaded not guilty to the charges.",
      "Comey\u2019s lawyers believe the Trump administration has singled out their client because of his protected speech and what they call Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal animus\u201d toward Comey. Trump fired Comey as FBI director in 2017 after the two clashed over the Justice Department's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Comey had been an outspoken critic of Trump since then.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution forbids the government from prosecuting an individual based on his protected speech or based on a government official\u2019s animus toward the individual,\u201d attorneys for Comey wrote in filings. \u201cObjective evidence establishes that President Trump directed the prosecution of Mr. Comey in retaliation for Mr. Comey\u2019s public criticisms and to punish Mr. Comey because of personal spite.\u201d",
      "Comey\u2019s team has provided the court with pages of examples of Trump\u2019s disparaging posts and comments about the former FBI director. The posts are likely to play a role in Wednesday's hearing, especially Trump's message to Bondi. Legal experts told NBC News in September that Trump's post could backfire.",
      "Comey's lawyers want U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff to dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning the case cannot be brought for a second time. These types of motions rarely succeed in court, but legal experts say if there was ever a situation where it would succeed, this case may be the one.",
      "Patrick J. Cotter, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at UB Greensfelder, told NBC News the evidence supporting Comey's effort is incredibly strong, despite the high bar for such motions.",
      "\u201cThis is that rarest of all beasts. This is actually a vindictive prosecution,\u201d Cotter said. \u201cIf there is ever going to be a vindictive prosecution motion that is successful, it will be this motion.\"",
      "Cotter pointed to the evidence that Trump ordered the attorney general to indict Comey and others, and his long-standing animus toward the former FBI director.",
      "The Trump administration argues the charges against Comey are legitimate.",
      "\u201cThe societal interests in this prosecution are readily apparent and overwhelming. The defendant is a former FBI Director who lied to Congress about his conduct while at the helm of the Nation\u2019s primary federal law-enforcement agency. His prosecution implicates societal interests of the highest order,\u201d DOJ wrote in a filing.",
      "Comey, it says, \u201casks the Court to take the extraordinary step of dismissing his indictment because \u2014 he says \u2014 he is being vindictively and selectively prosecuted. Given the deep-seated separation-of-powers principles at stake, his request can be granted only if \u201cthe Constitution requires it.\u201d",
      "Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, whom the Trump administration indicted in October, separately filed motions to disqualify acting U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan from her post on the grounds that her appointment was unlawful.",
      "Trump named Halligan, a former Trump personal lawyer with no prior experience as a prosecutor, after her predecessor resigned under pressure to indict Comey and James.",
      "A separate judge, Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick, earlier this month accused the DOJ of taking a \u201cindict first, investigate later\u201d approach to Comey's case."

    "story": [
      "Many of the largest and most widely established state-sponsored online propaganda campaigns have embraced using artificial intelligence, a new report finds \u2014 and they\u2019re often bad at it.",
      "The report, by the social media analytics company Graphika, analyzed nine ongoing online influence operations \u2014 including ones it says are affiliated with China\u2019s and Russia\u2019s governments \u2014 and found that each has, like much of social media, increasingly adopted generative AI to make images, videos, text and translations.",
      "The researchers found that sponsors of propaganda campaigns have come to rely on AI for core functions like making content and creating influencer personas on social media, streamlining some campaigns. But the researchers say that content is low quality and gets little engagement.",
      "The findings run counter to what many researchers had anticipated with the growing sophistication of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence that mimics human speech, writing and images in pictures and videos. The technology has rapidly become more advanced in recent years, and some experts warned that propagandists working on behalf of authoritarian countries would embrace high-quality, convincing synthetic content designed to deceive even the most discerning people in democratic societies.",
      "Resoundingly, though, the Graphika researchers found that the AI content created by those established campaigns is low-quality \u201cslop,\u201d ranging from unconvincing synthetic news reporters in YouTube videos to clunky translations or fake news websites that accidentally include AI prompts in headlines.",
      "\u201cInfluence operations have been systematically integrating AI tools, and a lot of it is low-quality, cheap AI slop,\u201d said Dina Sadek, a senior analyst at Graphika and co-author of the report. As was the case before such campaigns started routinely using AI, the vast majority of their posts on Western social media sites receive little to no attention, she said.",
      "Online influence campaigns aimed at swaying American politics and pushing divisive messages go back at least a decade, when the Russia-based Internet Research Agency created scores of Facebook and Twitter accounts and tried to influence the 2016 presidential election.",
      "As in some other fields, like cybersecurity and programming, the rise of AI hasn\u2019t revolutionized the field of online propaganda, but it has made it easier to automate some tasks, Sadek said.",
      "\u201cIt might be low-quality content, but it\u2019s very scalable on a mass scale. They\u2019re able to just sit there, maybe one individual pressing buttons there, to create all this content,\u201d she said.",
      "Examples cited in the report include \u201cDoppelganger,\u201d an operation the Justice Department has tied to the Kremlin, which researchers say used AI to create unconvincing fake news websites, and \u201cSpamoflauge,\u201d which the Justice Department has tied to China and which creates fake AI news influencers to spread divisive but unconvincing videos on social media sites like X and YouTube. The report cited several operations that used low-quality deepfake audio.",
      "One example posted deepfakes of celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and former President Barack Obama, appearing to comment on India\u2019s rise in global politics. But the report says the videos came off as unconvincing and didn\u2019t get much traction.",
      "Another pro-Russia video, titled \u201cOlympics Has Fallen,\u201d seemed to be designed to denigrate the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris. A nod to the 2013 Hollywood film \u201cOlympus Has Fallen,\u201d it starred an AI-generated version of Tom Cruise, who didn\u2019t participate in either film. The report found it got little attention outside of a small echo chamber of accounts that normally share that campaign\u2019s films.",
      "Spokespeople for China\u2019s embassy in Washington, Russia\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry, X and YouTube didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Even if their efforts don\u2019t reach many actual people, there is value for propagandists to flood the internet in the age of AI chatbots, Sadek said. The companies that develop those chatbots are constantly training their products by scraping the internet for text they can rearrange and spit back out.",
      "A recent study by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonprofit pro-democracy group, found that most major AI chatbots, or large language models, cite state-sponsored Russian news outlets, including some outlets that have been sanctioned by the European Union, in their answers."

      "\u201cI think we are not all that far away from the development of robotic soldiers,\u201d Sanders said Sunday. \u201cRight now, politicians \u2014 at least sometimes \u2014 have to worry about loss of life when they decide to go to war. If you don\u2019t have to worry about loss of life, and what you worry about is loss of robots, what does that mean for issues of war and peace globally? It\u2019s a big issue.\u201d",
      "Sanders is known for his focus on the millionaires and billionaires of the world, and how the U.S. government might favor them.",
      "In recent months, he\u2019s turned his attention to AI, which he says is an extension of his primary concerns about wealth inequality.\u201cToday, before we have seen the full implications of robotics and AI, you\u2019re looking at unprecedented wealth and income concentration,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "\u201cThe top 1% of Americans own more wealth than the bottom 93%,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of these zillionaires \u2014 the Musks, the Ellisons, the Bezoses, the Zuckerbergs \u2014 are investing hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars into AI and robotics. What is the result of all that?\u201d",
      "Elon Musk, the CEO of xAI, was just approved to receive a pay package from one of his other companies, Tesla, that could make him the world\u2019s first trillionaire.",
      "\u201cIt will mean even more wealth and even more political power for these guys at the top, while our democracy gets weaker and weaker. Working people will see a significant decline in their standard of living unless we turn this around.\u201d",
      "Sanders\u2019 focus on AI comes as tech companies have announced historic AI investments and sought to secure goodwill from President Donald Trump. The Trump administration has prioritized ensuring America\u2019s AI ecosystem is \u201cunencumbered by bureaucratic red tape\u201d to avoid an \u201conerous regulatory regime,\u201d while also keeping many aspects of the Biden administration\u2019s AI efforts.",
      "Sanders is not the only elected official bringing attention to the issue, with rising interest in AI legislation at both the state and the federal levels. On Tuesday, a House subcommittee met to discuss the safety of AI chatbots.",
      "In the interview with NBC News, Sanders said he sees the issue as an urgent matter and hopes to provoke more discussion about AI and its potential impacts on society: \u201cThe folks who have studied this moment are suggesting this ain\u2019t just another technological revolution. It is a lot more profound, and it\u2019s going to move a lot quicker.\u201d",
      "With such a fast-moving and general purpose technology as AI, Sanders sees threats not only to workers, but also to larger notions of humanity.",
      "\u201cPeople are worried that right now, many young people, teenagers, are relying on companionship from AI rather than fellow human beings,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIf kids today have AI as their best friends, as the \u2018people\u2019 they relate to, where they spend most of their time rather than other human beings, what kind of change does that mean for humanity?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about incredibly deep, deep issues of what it means to be human,\u201d Sanders concluded. \u201cThis issue needs enormous discussion, and I hope we can provoke some of it.\u201d",
      "Sanders will hold a town hall with \u201cGodfather of AI\u201d and Nobel Laureate Geoffrey Hinton on Tuesday night at Georgetown University to discuss AI\u2019s trajectory, including its effect on workers.",
      "\u201cPeople who know a lot more than I do about this, people like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Dario Amodei, they are talking about massive, massive job dislocation,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cMusk recently said that \u2018AI and robots will replace all jobs. Working will be optional.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cBut what the hell does that mean if it\u2019s going to replace all jobs? If I\u2019m a factory worker today, if I\u2019m working in an office, how am I going to feed my family? How am I going to pay the rent? Who is talking about that?\u201d Sanders added, also referencing recent claims from Anthropic CEO Amodei that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and increase unemployment by up to 20% in the next one to five years.",
      "\u201cThere has been far, far, far too little discussion among the American people, in the media and certainly in Congress about the implications of AI and robotics.\u201d",
      "In October, Sanders released a report on AI and led a hearing on AI\u2019s potential to support American workers and families.",
      "He\u2019s also proposed a limited set of policies that he says could help address some issues posed by AI, including increased employee ownership of companies, a reduced workweek and even a potential robot tax on large corporations, using \u201cthe revenue to improve the lives of workers who have been harmed.\u201d",
      "Sanders has also proposed that leading American AI company OpenAI should be broken up given its size. In his interview with NBC News, he said his call \u201cwas more general\u201d than just OpenAI and meant to implicate several of America\u2019s largest AI companies.",
      "\u201cWhen I talk about breaking these [companies] up, I mean creating a situation where this new technology is designed to benefit ordinary people, not just designed by a handful of billionaires to make them even richer,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a blueprint in my back pocket here, because nobody has ever had to deal with this reality, but the idea that a handful of multibillionaires can determine the future of humanity seems a little bit crazy to me.\u201d",
      "Sanders is also criticizing growing efforts by American venture capitalists and deep-pocketed donors to create super PACs designed to lobby against AI regulation.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got people who are suggesting that it\u2019s almost anti-religious, the Antichrist, to be demanding regulation of AI and robotics right now,\u201d he said, obliquely referencing recent speeches by Silicon Valley stalwart Peter Thiel. In one of these lectures, Thiel said: \u201cIn the 21st century, the Antichrist is a Luddite who wants to stop all science.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt almost takes you back to the 1700s and the monarchies throughout Europe,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cSome of these Big Tech guys think that they have a God-given right to rule the world, and the idea that a Congress or ordinary citizens might object to what they are doing, they see as something that is unacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo they will put unlimited amounts of money into super PACs to elect candidates who will allow them to do whatever they want. It\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Asked about increasing cooperation between leading American AI companies and the U.S. military, Sanders highlighted growing concerns about privacy. \u201cHow far away are we from a small number of people having access to the email that you\u2019ve sent out, every phone call that you\u2019ve been on, really every aspect of your life? We\u2019re not far.\u201d",
      "\u201cEither we\u2019re there right now or we certainly assume we\u2019ll be there. That gives the people on top extraordinary control when they have that knowledge,\u201d he said.",
      "Sanders joins a growing and bipartisan group of national politicians focusing on AI.",
      "Some, like Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., have targeted the societal impacts of AI. Hawley has recently proposed several AI-related bills, including an effort to limit minors\u2019 access to chatbots, a push to better track AI-related layoffs and a mechanism to evaluate AI models\u2019 abilities.",
      "Others, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Jim Banks, R-Ind., have proposed bills targeting the export of American AI technology and hardware to China.",
      "For his part, Sanders is hoping his voice can help advance the conversation. \u201cI see growing awareness, but I don\u2019t think Congress is moving anywhere near fast enough,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani announced that he has chosen New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch to continue in her role leading the largest police department in the nation.",
      "As a candidate, Mamdani vowed to keep Tisch \u2014 who was appointed commissioner by Mayor Eric Adams \u2014 in the role.",
      "Pledging to keep Tisch on as police commissioner could be seen as a way to assuage voters' concerns that Mamdani, a democratic socialist, would not take crime as a serious issue, and over his past statements to defund the police.",
      "In a statement, he applauded Tisch for \"cracking down on corruption in the upper echelons of the police department, driving down crime in New York City, and standing up for New Yorkers in the face of authoritarianism.\"",
      "\"Together, we will deliver a city where rank-and-file police officers and the communities they serve alike are safe, represented, and proud to call New York their home,\" Mamdani said in the statement.",
      "In an internal email to the NYPD, Tisch said that being commissioner is \"greatest privilege of my life, and I am proud to continue doing it.\"",
      "She also acknowledged that she and Mamdani have their differences.",
      "On the campaign trail, Mamdani vowed to maintain the NYPD\u2019s head count, but shift some of its responsibilities to a civilian-led agency. He also said he had spoken with police officers and apologized for past anti-police social media posts.",
      "Tisch was appointed commissioner in 2024 by Adams, who is a former police officer.",
      "\"Now, do the Mayor-elect and I agree on everything? No, we don\u2019t,\" she wrote. \"But in speaking with him, it\u2019s clear that we share broad and crucial priorities: the importance of public safety, the need to continue driving down crime, and the need to maintain stability and order across the department.\"",
      "She added that she is \"confident that I can continue to lead this department honorably going forward\" under a Mayor Mamdani, and that the department can \"trust that I will be a fierce advocate\" for them.",
      "Tisch is an 18-year veteran of public service.",
      "She began her career in public service in 2008, working in the NYPD's Counterterrorism Bureau. Prior to leading the NYPD, she led the city's Sanitation Department, and the Information Technology and Telecommunications Department.",
      "Her family, led by her father's fortune as the CEO of Loews Corp., has donated unprecedented amounts of money to top New York City establishments, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York University and the Mount Sinai Health System.",
      "New York City recorded 377 homicides in 2024, its lowest number of killings since 2020, according to data released from the NYPD in January. However, the city recorded its highest number of felony assaults \u2014 29,417 attacks that involved or threatened serious injury \u2014  in at least 24 years."

    "story": [
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement that she would not seek re-election capped off a decades-long tenure in Congress and the top echelons of the Democratic Party.",
      "Now, her departure also sets up a clearer picture of the race to be San Francisco\u2019s next representative in the House \u2014 and of how Democrats want to chart the future of their party at a moment of generational change.",
      "The two main contenders for Pelosi's district \u2014 Scott Wiener, a California state senator, and Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 had already jumped into the race ahead of Pelosi\u2019s decision.",
      "Others could jump into the California race ahead of next June's all-party primary, but already the two existing candidates' views reflect different wings of the Democratic Party.",
      "In interviews with NBC News, Wiener said that he has a record of building diverse coalitions and delivering on legislation, while Chakrabarti touted his push for \u201cwhole scale, structural change.\u201d The perspectives reflect the wider party debate about whether to seek political change more through practical advances within existing systems or rather by overhauling those longstanding systems entirely.",
      "It's not the first time the race to succeed a former speaker also serves as a litmus test for the future of the party. After then-House Speaker John Boehner stepped down in 2015, the crowded GOP primary to fill his Ohio seat echoed the Republican Party\u2019s broader debate over its future. Rep. Warren Davidson ultimately won the seat with the backing of the anti-establishment conservative Club for Growth, which had previously sparred with Boehner.",
      "Neither Wiener nor Chakrabarti believed that Pelosi\u2019s announcement changed much about the dynamics of the race. Wiener predicted that Chakrabarti, who had been focusing much of his attention on Pelosi, would pivot to attacking the state senator instead. Chakrabarti said that he believed the race wasn\u2019t just about the former speaker, but the Democratic Party needing \u201cwholesale change.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, the real moment right now in the Democratic Party is, do we want to go back to the politics as usual?\u201d Chakrabarti said in an interview, framing his opponent as \u201cpart of that normal establishment politics.\u201d",
      "Across the divide, Wiener presented himself as the candidate who could actually deliver.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just say that you want to accomplish X, Y and Z and to make videos about it, you need to give voters confidence that you know how to actually deliver on those promises around housing, health care, energy and so forth,\u201d Wiener said, referencing Chakrabarti\u2019s social media presence.",
      "Wiener\u2019s website touts the candidate's record \u201cauthoring and passing more than 100 state laws,\u201d pointing to his push to advance housing and pro-LGBTQ issues.",
      "Chakrabarti disputed Wiener\u2019s questions about whether he can deliver legislatively. He emphasized his role in crafting the Green New Deal, a progressive set of policy goals, and asserted that when people mobilized around climate, it forced Democratic presidential candidates to embrace environmental proposals in 2019 and 2020. Chakrabarti argued that the push contributed to former President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which included billions of dollars to fight climate change.",
      "Pelosi has not yet weighed in on the race, and she told NBC News last week that making an endorsement was not her \u201ccurrent plan.\u201d",
      "Chakrabarti declined to share whether he was in talks about potential endorsements with the likes of Ocasio-Cortez or Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Chakrabarti worked on Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "Chakrabarti acknowledged that if he's elected in 2026, while Republicans still control the White House, he would not be able to push forward on goals like enacting a universal health care system or developing a national bank to \"fund, finance and develop affordable housing.\" Instead, he said his initial goals would be \u201cdefending\u201d constituents from Trump administration policies like immigration raids and troop deployment and working to \u201cforce the conversation\u201d on anti-corruption issues.",
      "If elected, Wiener emphasized wanting to elevate housing as a bigger issue at the federal level. Asked about similarities and differences with Pelosi, he noted that he is \u201cvery aligned\u201d with her on issues like expanding health care access and said he was \u201ca huge admirer of her work.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m my own person, and we have lots of shared values and priorities, and I have priorities that are my own,\u201d he said."

      "When P\u00e9rez, who was already a fan of the band, met Selena in person, he thought she was \u201cbeautiful and talented,\u201d he told  Entertainment Tonight in 2018. \u201cI\u2019m a shy person by nature, and there was something about her that was just able to pull me out,\u201d he said.",
      "The pair\u2019s relationship turned romantic after the band flew to Acapulco, Mexico. While there, P\u00e9rez felt a new closeness and chemistry with the \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom\u201d singer, he explained during a 2021 interview on the \u201cAnything for Selena\u201d podcast.",

      "P\u00e9rez also recalled worrying about giving into his feelings. \u201cDude, she was like massaging my hand and there I am like, duh, I didn\u2019t know what to think. Add to that, we worked together,\u201d he said.",
      "When Did They Get Married?",
      "The couple initially kept their love affair a secret from Selena\u2019s father but they found it difficult to hide their joy.",
      "\u201cWe were in Laredo when we had our conversation about how we both felt the same way about each other. Selena had the biggest smile on her face when we were walking back to the bus afterward,\u201d P\u00e9rez told Texas Monthly in 2010. \u201cI\u2019m smiling right now just thinking about it. I wanted to tell her, \u2018Hey, quit smiling! You\u2019re going to give it away.\u2019 \u201d",
      "After Abraham Quintanilla found out about the couple\u2019s romance, he kicked P\u00e9rez out of the band despite Selena\u2019s protests.",
      "Selena and P\u00e9rez eloped on April 2, 1992 when Selena was 21, Texas Monthly reported. Abraham Quintanilla told the publication that after P\u00e9rez married his daughter, he \u201caccepted him as part of the family\u201d and allowed him to rejoin Selena\u2019s band. This was also confirmed in \u201cSelena y Los Dinos.\u201d",

      "How Was Chris P\u00e9rez\u2019s Relationship With Selena\u2019s Family After Her Death?",
      "Years after Selena's death, tensions between P\u00e9rez and his father-in-law resurfaced in December 2010 when Abraham Quintanilla sued P\u00e9rez and the media production company Endemol Shine Latino to halt production of a planned Selena bioseries, NBC News reported at the time.",

      "Five years later, in September 2021, the pair filed a joint motion to dismiss the lawsuit, P\u00e9rez revealed.",
      "\u201cGood news! I have amicably resolved my legal dispute with the Quintanilla family,\u201d he tweeted at the time. \u201cNow that these issues are behind us, going forward, my hope, and the hope of the Quintanilla family, is for us to work together to continue to honor and celebrate the legacy of Selena.\u201d",
      "P\u00e9rez, who appears alongside Selena\u2019s family members in the \u201cSelena y Los Dinos\u201d docuseries, has remained close to his sister-in-law and former bandmate Suzette Quintanilla.",
      "The two posed together under a mural of Selena last month in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cLike everything, family has disagreements about certain things, but we\u2019re past that,\u201d Suzette Quintanilla told E! News this month during a joint interview with P\u00e9rez. \u201cI will always consider Chris family, and I know that he feels the same way about me, and that\u2019s it.\u201d",

      "What Has Chris P\u00e9rez Said Recently About Selena?",
      "P\u00e9rez told People in November 2025 that 30 years after his late wife's tragic death, she is always on his mind.",
      "\u201cI think about Selena every day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m making a decision, I can hear her in my head, like, \u2018I don\u2019t know \u2014 are you sure you wanna do that?\u2019",
      "The guitarist said the love he shared with Selena is still precious to him.",
      "\u201cAs time has gone on, you romanticize it even more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe love story is a big part of her legacy. My most prized possessions are her love letters.\u201d He reads one of her letters in \u201cSelena y Los Dinos.\u201d",
      "He added in his People interview that the pain of Selena\u2019s death still haunts him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Chris before all of that happened, and Chris after,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe\u2019s a part of both sides. I\u2019ve lived with her presence in thoughts and feelings and music. That\u2019s become my new normal. But I can\u2019t watch the end of the documentary about her death. It\u2019s just difficult.\u201d",
      "What Does Chris P\u00e9rez Say About Selena in \u2018Selena y Los Dinos\u2019?",
      "In the Netflix documentary, P\u00e9rez says he was \u201cstarstruck\u201d when he met Selena and her band.",
      "\u201cThe honest truth was I was just more taken aback by the power of the band and the music and the sound,\u201d he said, before touching on his early relationship with Selena. \u201cAt first, we didn\u2019t hang out too much. Selena was always either off with Suzette or her mom.\u201d",
      "He credited the long tour bus trips to them becoming friends.",
      "\u201cAnytime we were next to each other, it would just be me and her talking about music and movies and things like that,\u201d he said, admiring how it was \u201ccool seeing her being a normal person.\u201d",
      "P\u00e9rez also commented on Selena\u2019s \u201cvulnerable side,\u201d as well as spoke about their trip to Mexico as a band when he started to have stronger feelings for her.",
      "He recalled their first kiss, as well as when their bandmate Ricky Vela walked in on them. P\u00e9rez also said he was \u201cgenuinely in fear\u201d of Selena\u2019s father and what he would say.",
      "\u201cBut what we had going with each other, I didn\u2019t want to jeopardize that at all,\u201d he said.",
      "P\u00e9rez also reads a letter Selena wrote to him before they got married and recalls the moment her dad got upset with him when he found out about their relationship.",
      "Selena\u2019s widow also touches on the day he found out she died.",
      "\u201cI do miss her a lot. But today, I\u2019m very proud of what she represents and the small part that I might play in that story,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "It wasn't until her junior year of college that Nia Sioux realized she was ready.",
      "Then a student at UCLA, she was in Los Angeles with her mom, Holly Frazier. She remembers looking at her and saying, \"I'm ready to write it.\"",
      "She was referring to her long-planned dream of writing a memoir about her time on the Lifetime reality show \"Dance Moms.\" Nia  was just 9 years old in the show's pilot. She and her mom, Holly Frazier, starred in it for seven seasons, from 2011 to 2017.",
      "That dream was actualized with the release of \"Bottom of the Pyramid: A Memoir of Persevering, Dancing for Myself, and Starring in My Own Life,\" which hit shelves Nov. 4.",
      "\"I always knew I was going to write a book about my time on 'Dance Moms,'\" Nia tells TODAY.com. \"But it's ever really been the right time. It never really felt right. I don't even think I was really comfortable talking about everything that happened on the show. I was still processing it.\"",
      "The book opens with her casting on the show, and each chapter unveils her side of some of the show's controversial moments, often with her dance teacher and the show's star, Abby Lee Miller, at the center of it. She alleges Miller made racist comments directed at her, tried to bribe a mentor to not work with Nia and most recently, refused Nia's request to visit Miller in the hospital to clear the air after she was diagnosed with cancer. (TODAY.com has reached out to Miller for comment.)",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com after the publication of the memoir, Nia confirms she hasn't heard from Miller about the book.",
      "\"I don't plan on getting anything either,\" Nia says. \"Yeah, no.\"",
      "But bringing that to light isn\u2019t why Nia wrote the book. In the memoir, she writes that after her request to meet was declined, she\u2019ll \u201cnever reach out to Abby Lee Miller again.\u201d She adds that she \u201cdidn\u2019t even want to use her name\u201d in the book.",
      "\"After I had a lot of space away from the show, I realized that that woman really does not have power over me. She really can't dictate my life and control things, and for so long, she made it seem like she controlled the world and she controlled my future,\" Nia says. \"I think having that space away from the show and realizing, like, oh my gosh, actually, she doesn't exist in my world. I can do my own thing and be successful ... and she's not going to get in the way of that.\"",
      "The book seeks to establish Nia as the \"star in my life.\"",
      "Its overarching theme is ironically best described by the title. The bottom of the pyramid, of course, refers to \"Dance Moms'\" episode's fixture in which Miller would rank each dancer in a tiered pyramid based on their performance at their most recent competition.",
      "Fans of the show may remember that typically Nia was toward the bottom, while the coveted top of the pyramid spot was most often dominated by Maddie Ziegler.",
      "\"My dad, at first, was a little concerned. He loved the title, but he also was concerned with it, because I've been trying to kind of shed that title my whole life,\" Nia says. \"So he was like, 'Why would you name your book \"Bottom of the Pyramid\"? Isn't that kind of putting yourself down?'",
      "\"I was like, 'No, it's basically me just reclaiming that title and turning it into a positive,'\" she adds.",
      "For example, she writes in the book, as the bottom of the pyramid she served as her team's base, its glue. And \"at the bottom, the only place you can go is up.\"",
      "\"I'm not shying away from it. I'm not embarrassed by it. I'm just ready to talk,\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "But that doesn't mean it was easy. She says the most difficult part was \"trying to tell my story\" while \"not trying to put other people down.\"",
      "\"Anytime I do bring up the girls and situations, I think that part was the hardest for me to write because I never want to paint them in a bad light,\" she says. \"But it's still my experience, and it's still very valid.",
      "\"My relationship with the show was very complicated,\" she adds. \"Although there were times where it was really negative and really challenging, at the same time, it's how I got my start. It's something that is a part of me, and it's something I'm still grateful for, with the good and the bad.\"",
      "Below, Nia discusses how she approached writing the memoir, how some of her fellow castmates have reacted and why the book feels like \"closure\" for the \"Dance Moms\" chapter of her life.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "The hardest part for me was making sure that I wrote everything in the way that I wanted it to be taken. I think that it's really difficult to talk about these sort of things because I come from a place of, you know, I'm healed. I always lead with love. At the same time, I'm not trying to put people down or badmouth anybody. So, trying to find that delicate balance between sharing my story, but (I'm) still not here to protect people. People have been protected this whole time. It was time for me to share my story. And I think that was the hardest part for me, is being OK sharing my story without being worried about what other people thought.",
      "I always knew that I endured a lot. But I feel like every time I read through the book to make my edits and add things, omit things, every single time something came up. Every single time I think I cried in different moments. It's really healing to see your whole story as something tangible, as a book. Literally reading your whole life \u2014\u00a0it's very therapeutic. It's basically my diary; it's like my journal. But it's been so healing. And I think that's the thing that I was so surprised about. It did bring up emotions. I was like, you know what, this might be hard for me to write, and there were times that were hard to write, but for the most part, it was just so healing.",
      "I did. Not every single episode, but the parts that I talk about in the book, I watched it back. I remember things a certain way, and I know how things went down, but I also needed to see how they played out on television to see what the world saw. Sometimes it was the same thing that I remembered. ... But there were a lot of things also that I remember that did happen that the show either cut out or they clipped a certain way.",
      "That was kind of weird, because in my head, I'm like, \"Oh, I thought people knew this.\" I thought it played out this way, but actually, they didn't show any of the stuff I actually went through that week. So watching it back, I mean, I did honestly get irritated at times. I'm like, \"Oh my goodness, they didn't show any of that.\" Watching it, what, 14, 13 years later, having that realization is kind of crazy.",
      "I think I watched the first few episodes of it. When it first came out we had our launch party. ... We watched the first episode when it came on, and I think maybe I probably watched the next couple.",
      "But if I'm being honest, no. One because I don't want to re-live that, I know what happens. But then also, too, I honestly really couldn't. We had no time to even watch anything. The time that the show came out, Tuesdays at 9, we literally had dance. I was at dance while the show was coming out. I would get home and the credits would be rolling. So yeah, even if I wanted to, I couldn't, really.",
      "Chloe did read it before it came out, but I didn't really talk to anyone else about the book before I announced that I was doing it. Chloe was my main girl for that because I knew that she would one, be understanding, and also I really wanted her to write the forward. And she was so excited about it. It was a very special moment when I asked her. I had her obviously read the book before she committed to writing the forward as well. Because, of course, I wanted her to be comfortable with what she was endorsing. She's been so great during this whole process, and I'm really proud of her. And I also know that she's proud of me, and it's been a very special journey.",
      "My mom, actually both my parents, would read chapters as they were done. Any parts I had done, I would have my parents read it, because I value their opinion a lot. They watched every episode and they were the adults, so they would probably remember more than me at times, and then remind me of things. That really helped, trying to get different points of view, making sure that I don't forget the little things.",
      "The book definitely feels like closure. I think before I wrote the book, I had definitely moved on. But I don't know if I really had closure with it because I had never talked about my experience. Not many people actually heard from me when it came to \"Dance Moms.\" So this really was healing. This really was closure. And I also say, this book is also a love letter to my younger self.",
      "Honestly, I feel like there hasn't been a ton from the cast members, reaction-wise. So I don't know whether that's good or bad, but like, I haven't seen too much about that. But I'm grateful for the people that have supported me. Grateful for my mom continuing to support me, grateful for Chloe.",
      "... Having her support means the absolute world because I know that I don't have support from everyone. So it's nice to have somebody, especially Chloe, be so supportive of my story.",
      "Well, my biggest dream is one, to help people. That's what I feel like is my mission, just to help people in any way I can. But also I'm a performer at the end of the day, so storytelling, in any way possible, whether that's through dance, music, acting, theater. Theater was my first love besides dance. So hopefully \u2014 well, not hopefully, I am \u2014\u00a0I'm going to dive back into all of those things.",
      "Now that I'm done with college and now I'm done writing the book and it's released now, I can finally focus on getting back into the swing of things. Before I went to college, I was kind of on a roll, and then I went to college, COVID happened, the actors strike happened. So a lot of things have changed within the past five years. So I'm excited to get back to it. I've been craving getting back to performing, getting back on stage, in any capacity."

Possibility. Real possibility. And I\u2019m proud that I survived. I didn\u2019t think my being would make it. I didn\u2019t think my energy would survive.",

There was a little bit of money, but not the amount of money that was generated. And I just walked away. I literally walked away. I did it very intentionally.\u201d",
      "She says in the documentary that a fitness business that at one point was millions per year never resulted in the money ending up in her bank account.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t running my company. It was a 50/50 deal,\u201d she says in the film. \u201cThere was nothing but lawsuits in the \u201990s. Yes, there was money, but I never had $300 million in the bank account. I never made the money that I generated.\u201d",
      "After declaring bankruptcy, she moved to Seattle to raise her three children as a single mother. Powter struggled to find consistent work as she got older.",

You need somebody that you can trust 100%. I know Liz always has my back.\u201d",
      "Executive produced by retired cheerleading coach Monica Aldama (\u201cCheer\u201d), NBC\u2019s new mockumentary \u201cStumble\u201d centers on the indomitable coach Courteney Potter (Jenn Lyon) and her quest to win her 15th championship cheer title.",
      "When she is abruptly fired from her Texas team at Sammy Davis Sr. Junior College (SDSJC), she vows to find and train a new squad \u2014 even if that means driving 80 miles to an Oklahoma junior college with a name she can\u2019t even pronounce and enlisting a team of misfits, including a kleptomaniac, a 30-something car salesman and a student with narcolepsy.",
      "\u201cCourteney is a bit of a mess, but a controlled mess,\u201d Jeff Astrof says. \u201cShe is super driven and loves these kids, which Jenn is such a natural at \u2014 she brings so much heart and pathos to the character.\u201d",
      "Lyon's North Carolina upbringing empowered her to add authenticity to the role. \u201cShe is protective of the character being from the South and will put us in check if we have a line in there that she doesn\u2019t think someone from the South would say, but instead, will always give us such great alternatives,\u201d Jeff Astrof says.",
      "Part of what grounds Courteney is her high-school-sweetheart husband and personal cheerleader Boon E. Potter (Taran Killam), who now works as a football coach after suffering a career-ending head injury.",

      "\u201cWhat I loved about Coach Taylor and Tami was that they fought and bickered, but you never worried they were going to break up,\u201d said Liz. \u201cThey were supportive and loving but could also have those serious and heartfelt conversations that can leave you choked up at the end.\u201d",
      "As with any underdog story, you need a rival.

Upon the news of Courteney\u2019s firing, Tammy does not follow her to Oklahoma, but rather, smiles with glee any time she hears of Courteney\u2019s struggles.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time the writers collaborated with Chenoweth. Jeff Astrof co-created the NBC legal sitcom \u201cTrial & Error\u201d with Matt Miller back in 2017, which Chenoweth starred in. When it came to the role of Tammy, the siblings knew it had to be Chenoweth.",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have done the character without her,\u201d Jeff Astrof says. \u201cThat\u2019s a big reason we shot in New York. It was so important for us to have access to her. Everything we can do to put her in more, we do.\u201d",
      "Even though Courteney\u2019s new cheer family may be more unconventional than her former elite squad, it doesn\u2019t mean the stunts have to suffer. In fact, choreographing impressive cheer routines was a crucial element throughout making the series.",
      "The writing duo recalled a time when they were nervous that one of the flyers was going to hit the ceiling, but the cheerleaders reassured them not to worry because they have control over their bodies, even in the air.",

      "Sald\u00edvar said her connection to Selena \u201chad grown from being just a fan-celebrity type to this personal type of relationship.\u201d",
      "In her 1995 \u201c20/20\u201d interview, she also said that Selena sometimes even called her \u201cmom.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe was like a cuddly bear, teddy bear, that \u2014 she would allow you to love her,\u201d Sald\u00edvar said. \u201cI told her that I loved her like a daughter. And she goes, \u2018You know, I give you that right.\u2019 She would call me \u2018mom\u2019 on the phone.\u201d",
      "The singer\u2019s family questioned whether Selena ever called Sald\u00edvar \u201cmom,\u201d according to \u201c20/20.\u201d",
      "In the 2024 trailer for the Oxygen documentary \u201cSelena & Yolanda: The Secrets Between Them,\u201d Sald\u00edvar seemed to suggest that she has previously undisclosed information to share about the circumstances of Selena's death. (Oxygen is owned by NBCUniversal, the parent company of TODAY.com.)",

      "In the series, Sald\u00edvar claimed she did not intentionally kill Selena and dismissed the long-held theory that she was embezzling money. Instead, Sald\u00edvar alleged that Selena was having an extramarital affair and tasked Sald\u00edvar with making purchases on her behalf to help cover up the tryst. Sald\u00edvar said she was simply paying herself back and that Selena was aware. But in the docuseries, Sald\u00edvar did not provide any evidence to substantiate her claims.",
      "\u201cAfter so many years, I think it\u2019s time to set the story straight,\u201d Sald\u00edvar said in a trailer for the series.",
      "\u201cI knew her secrets,\u201d Sald\u00edvar said later in the trailer. \u201cAnd I think that people deserve to know the truth.\u201d",
      "Selena\u2019s family slammed the docuseries for giving Sald\u00edvar a platform.",
      "\u201cNo one\u2019s gonna believe what she has to say anyway. Everyone knows there\u2019s zero truth to anything that comes out of her mouth,\u201d Abraham Quintanilla Jr. told TMZ.",
      "Selena\u2019s family declined to participate in the docuseries. At the time of its release, NBC News reached out to the family\u2019s spokesperson, as well as Abraham Quintanilla Jr. directly, for comment regarding Sald\u00edvar\u2019s claims."

    "story": [
      "Thirty years ago when Selena Quintanilla died, the world lost a rising star \u2014 and a groundbreaking artist.",
      "The Mexican American singer, known as the Queen of Tejano music, was just 23 years old when she was murdered by the president of her fan club and employee Yolanda Sald\u00edvar in 1995.",
      "The Texas native captivated audiences in the U.S. and Latin America with her hits \u201cComo La Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido\u201d and \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom.\u201d Her signature red lips, long black hair,  sultry voice and beloved dance moves have become iconic for fans of the late artist.",
      "Many who were unfamiliar with Selena during the height of her fame became aware of her extraordinary talent when Jennifer Lopez portrayed her in the 1997 biopic, \u201cSelena.\u201d",
      "Now, for the first time since Selena\u2019s death, her family is sharing never-before-seen footage from their archives of the superstar and her rise to fame in Netflix\u2019s \u201cSelena Y Los Dinos,\u201d streaming now.",
      "\u201cYou get to hear from Selena herself. We went through every single interview that we could find and that exists,\u201d director Isabel Castro tells TODAY.com. \u201cWe wanted to hear as much from Selena throughout the film as possible because we felt that, in that way, we would be telling the story in her voice.\u201d",
      "The documentary also includes interviews from her parents, Marcella and Abraham Quintanilla, sister Suzette Quintanilla, brother A.B. Quintanilla III, husband Chris P\u00e9rez, the bandmates who knew her best, and more.",
      "While many are familiar with the lead singer, the film chronicles how she started her career as part of her family's musical group Selena y Los Dinos. The band included her sister playing drums and her brother playing bass, backing vocals and writing songs, along with a slew of band members like Ricky Vela and Pete Astudillo. Her future husband later joined the group as a guitarist.",
      "\u201cI understand what Selena and her legacy represent even now, 30 years later,\u201d Suzette Quintanilla tells TODAY.com \u201cAnd I also know that's growing.\u201d",
      "Below, Suzette Quintanilla and Isabel Castro chat with TODAY.com about the decades of footage they combed through for this project \u2014 and the painful emotions and moments of joy that resurfaced after 30 years.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "Suzette Quintanilla: I had reached out to Isabel about two years ago or so. With social media, things get blurred, and stories get told one way \u2014 and then they start changing. I wanted to be able to take our family story and what we created as a whole... and bring it to 2025, leaving this really nice capsule of our story, told by \u2014 who better than our family?",
      "That\u2019s pretty much why I wanted to do this, and I thought maybe sharing some footage of us back in the day would be really good. Isabel has a fun story about how I let her into the vault. We call it the vault at the office, but it's basically where we keep all our footage.",
      "Isabel Castro: The vault is actually the perfect way to describe it, but it's floor to ceiling bookcases with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of VHS tapes, beta cam, film, CDs, flash drives.",
      "We spent two years going through all of that, logging everything, digitizing everything, watching every single thing. We watched every single piece of footage.",
      "SQ: I didn't feel differently. If anything, it gave me that good feeling of how life was. I was telling Isabel, like, \u201cOh, my God, I saw some of the footage, and I remember I was whistling when she bought those shoes\u201d or...different little key moments like clothing. Because we were sisters, we would shop a lot together.",
      "But what I did walk away with was, I had a really good feeling of like, \u201cWow, I know we worked really hard.\u201d It was a reminder of what we did come from, which was nothing, and that we created something memorable that still resonates with people. I\u2019m very grateful that our music is still relevant to this day.",
      "One of the things that I\u2019m really proud about this documentary is it truly tells and showcases the importance of each one of us and what we bring to our band. Yes, clearly Selena was a star and she was the forefront of our band. But there were other main factors that made our vision. I think that Isabel was able to really showcase the magnitude of what we each brought, and that\u2019s why we are here talking about our documentary.",
      "IC: That was one of the main goals of the film, to obviously explain how Selena became the symbol and the icon. But the film itself, I wanted it to feel as personal and as close to the family as possible, because my theory was that that was going to be what made it different from anything that had been made before. That was our North Star in the editorial process: to try to find ways to really make it as personal as possible.",
      "There's so many decisions that went into trying to cultivate that intimacy. We filmed people in spaces that they spent a lot of time in so they felt really comfortable. We didn't clean up the archive, we made sure that the edges and the glitches and the focusing of the camera and zooming in and out, those things were all kind of integrated into the editing process. And though these seem just like creative elements, they lend itself to the film feeling as if you're getting to know a more personal side of Selena.",
      "The other thing is that you get to hear from Selena herself. We went through every single interview that we could find and that exists. We transcribed every single interview and we wanted to hear as much from Selena throughout the film as possible because we felt that in that way, we would be telling the story in her voice as well.",
      "SQ: We\u2019ve never tried romanticizing anything about our life, I don\u2019t know if everybody else might have done that. But in regards to what we have always done is just kept it real. Isabel had so many things to go through to be able to create and integrate Selena into this film because that\u2019s the heart of this whole documentary. It\u2019s real. It\u2019s stripped down. There\u2019s no romanticizing going on. It\u2019s just who she was.",
      "What's relevant is, whenever you see an interview of her, she'll say something and she just starts laughing at herself. Most artists don\u2019t do that. They\u2019ll be like, \u201cNo, don\u2019t show that.\u201d And for her, she didn\u2019t care. It was just her being real. And I think that\u2019s one of the main beauties of this documentary. This is us talking about our life. We\u2019re not holding back, and I think that Isabel did an amazing job putting that all together and telling our story. And hopefully this will resonate for another 30, 40, years after I\u2019m no longer here. I hope it inspires.",
      "Another main reason is that I wanted to leave something behind. Selena was a beacon and I see her as that as well. People still look up to her and they admire her. I hope that after seeing this documentary, they walk away with that same mindset that their dream is attainable.",
      "SQ: I really don\u2019t know. That\u2019s kind of hard to say. I know that whatever she would have done, she would have been at the forefront of whatever she did. I think she would still be a beacon no matter whatever she did if she was still here and a complete role model. I do 100% believe if she was still here, she would be kicking ass in the design world and a designer.",
      "SQ: Every once in a while when I\u2019m in front of a live band, yeah, I want to play. But for the most part, I\u2019m at ease with that and I\u2019m fine with it because I keep myself so busy on the business side of everything. But I do miss it and I would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t.",
      "SQ: I\u2019m going to be very real with you. At the beginning, it was very, extremely difficult to live without her, hands down. I didn\u2019t think I would still be here, to be honest with you, that\u2019s how much grief took over. And then at one point I realized, after a couple of years of being in this mindset of feeling numb, so to speak, I realized that I needed to come out of it.",
      "I didn\u2019t go to therapy because back then, you know how (some) Mexican  (families) are. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in therapy.\u201d It\u2019s more like, \u201cCome and talk to your tia (aunt) type of therapy.\u201d But one thing I did is I prayed to God every day just to get me through that one day. That\u2019s it. Not the week, not the month, one day. And it just happened like that. And at one point, I started to let go of anger that I had in my heart for the person who took her life. Let go of things that I had no control over. Stay away from the \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d What if she was still here, what if she wouldn\u2019t have gone? What if? It doesn\u2019t matter because at the end of the day, the what ifs always brought me back around to the same thing: She is still not here.",
      "I went through this transition of healing my heart and my soul. It's still broken and it will forever be broken, and that's life. I'll probably go home, I\u2019ll go back to the hotel, probably have a good cry because I\u2019m going down memory lane today, but it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s a good cry and there\u2019s nothing wrong with crying here and there.",
      "I do miss her tremendously, but I'm in a place where we're celebrating not just Selena, but what we accomplished as a whole and as a family. That's what this documentary is about. I hope that my words resonate because what we can only do is celebrate the ones that are no longer with us anymore and keep their memory present."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Japan has been feeling the sting of China\u2019s economic retaliation as their diplomatic spat over Taiwan worsens, with travel agencies canceling group tours and fears mounting over an outright ban on Japanese seafood and movies.",
      "China hinted that it might halt seafood imports from Japan on Wednesday after warning its citizens to avoid traveling there and postponing the release in China of at least two Japanese movies.",
      "The two largest economies in Asia have been locked in a war of words that began when Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi told lawmakers on Nov. 7 that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could force a military response from Tokyo. It was the first time such a comment had been made by a sitting prime minister of Japan, a U.S. ally that has a mutual defense pact with Washington.",
      "China, which claims self-ruling Taiwan as a breakaway province to be seized by force if necessary, has repeatedly demanded that Takaichi retract her \u201cegregious\u201d remarks, saying it will take \u201csevere\u201d countermeasures if she refuses.",
      "Though unspecified, Beijing\u2019s threats have fueled concerns for Japan\u2019s already fragile economy that is heavily dependent on China, especially as Tokyo grapples with the effects of U.S. tariffs.",
      "On Wednesday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested that China might reimpose its ban on imports of Japanese seafood because Japan has \u201cso far failed\u201d to provide documents proving the quality and safety of its aquatic products.",
      "China resumed importing seafood from all but 10 Japanese prefectures earlier this month after suspending imports two years ago over the release of treated radioactive wastewater from Japan\u2019s wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.",
      "Takaichi\u2019s comments on Taiwan have triggered \u201cstrong public outrage in China,\u201d ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. \u201cUnder the current circumstances, even if Japanese aquatic products were exported to China, they would have no market.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s newest sign of economic retaliation came days after authorities advised Chinese citizens not to travel to Japan, saying Takaichi\u2019s \u201cblatantly provocative\u201d Taiwan remarks posed a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to the safety of Chinese people in the country.",
      "Japan, which says it continues to prefer a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue, has also advised its citizens to take extra safety precautions while in China.",
      "\u201cThe government will continue to closely monitor the situation, including the impact of the series of measures by China, and take appropriate action,\u201d Minoru Kihara, the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Following the government\u2019s instructions, several major Chinese airlines have started offering free refunds or itinerary changes for eligible flight tickets to and from Japan.",
      "While the number of canceled flights was not immediately clear, some travel businesses have reported disruption and losses amid the China-Japan tensions.",
      "East Japan International Travel Agency, a Tokyo-based tour operator offering tailored services to Chinese tourists, said about 70% of its group tours had been canceled, marking a \u201csignificant surge,\u201d and that new inquiries had also decreased about 90%.",
      "\u201cNormally, the period from late December to the Lunar New Year is peak season for corporate incentive travel,\u201d Yu Jixin, the agency\u2019s vice president, told NBC News in an emailed statement. \u201cBut this year, almost none of these groups are expected to visit Japan.\u201d",
      "Beijing Huatu International Travel Agency said it had suspended bookings for Japan-related tours until further orders from Chinese authorities.",
      "\u201cWe are all Chinese people of flesh and blood,\u201d it said Monday in a statement on RedNote, China\u2019s Instagram-like platform. \u201cWe will never waver when it comes to the fundamentals of right and wrong.\u201d",
      "At least two Japanese movies, \u201cCrayon Shin-chan the Movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers\u201d and \u201cCells at Work!,\u201d will have their releases postponed in mainland China, state-backed media China Film News said Monday.",
      "Chinese film importers and distributors said they made the \u201ccautious\u201d adjustment in response to viewers\u2019 \u201cwidespread and intense dissatisfaction\u201d with Takaichi\u2019s remarks.",

      "In his first visit to the White House since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Mohammed bin Salman received a warm welcome from President Donald Trump, who contradicted U.S. intelligence and said the Saudi crown prince \u201cknew nothing\u201d about the killing.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,\u201d Trump said Tuesday in response to questions from a journalist about Khashoggi. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t like that gentleman that you\u2019re talking about. Whether you like him or didn\u2019t like him, things happen, but [the crown prince] knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.\u201d",
      "Trump began his remarks by saying that he was proud of the crown prince in \u201cterms of human rights and everything else.\u201d",
      "Crown Prince Mohammed, 40, became an international pariah after the 2018 murder of Khashoggi, a fierce critic of his government. At the time, Trump defended the Saudi government even after the CIA concluded that the crown prince himself ordered the killing.",
      "Trump lashed out at a reporter from ABC News who asked the crown prince about Khashoggi's death and about criticism from the families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, many of whom have long pushed for answers on the Saudi government's potential ties to the attackers.",
      "\"ABC, fake news, one of the worst, one of the worst in the business,\" he said.",
      "The crown prince dismissed the criticisms against the Saudi government as part of a campaign to drive a wedge between Washington and Riyadh.",
      "\"I feel painful about, you know, families of 9/11 in America,\" he said. \"But you know, we have to focus on reality.\"",
      "Crown Prince Mohammed also defended the kingdom\u2019s probe into Khashoggi's murder, which he said included internal reforms. A Saudi court sentenced five people to death for their involvement in the killing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said, promising that \u201cwe are doing our best that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",
      "Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, the journalist's widow, responded to Trump on X, writing, \"There is no justification to murder my husband. While Jamal was a good transparent and brave man many people may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press. The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband.\"",
      "The crown prince said in 2019 that he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the Khashoggi killing since it happened on his watch but denied having ordered it.",
      "Khashoggi's death has highlighted the risks journalists face around the world, particularly in areas where there is conflict. A report from the Committee to Protect Journalists released in February said that at least 124 journalists and media workers were killed in 2024, mainly Palestinian journalists killed as a result of Israel's military offensive in Gaza.",
      "The crown prince's trip Tuesday will be seen more broadly as a move toward acceptance back into the diplomatic fold.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a different kind of figure now. Obviously, the questions about the manner of his rule and internal repression, those things haven\u2019t gone away. But he\u2019s a changed figure; it\u2019s a changed moment. And, I think, important symbolically in that sense,\u201d said Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group, a global nonprofit organization based in Brussels that works to prevent conflicts.",
      "He added: \u201cHe\u2019s central to what this administration wants to do in the region.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s welcome of the crown prince was an elaborate display of pomp and circumstance. After arriving at the White House, the crown prince was greeted by a military flyover of stealth fighter jets, officers on horseback and a tour of the Rose Garden from Trump. Later, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president praised the reception that he received when he visited the kingdom this year. \u201cI love the country and people,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump and the crown prince joked about investing $1 trillion \u2014 a sum roughly equal to Saudi Arabia's entire wealth fund \u2014 into the United States, up from a $600 billion pledge.",
      "The two leaders are also expected to sign economic and defense agreements, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "Even before the crown prince had set foot in the United States, Trump confirmed at an Oval Office event Monday that he would be willing to sign off on the sale of F-35 stealth fighter jets to the kingdom, a contentious move that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East, where Israel has been the primary recipient of America\u2019s cutting-edge military technology. Trump repeated the pledge Tuesday and promised a deal.",
      "Trump\u2019s announcement of the sale may not actually lead to Saudi Arabia receiving the F-35s anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThe devil will kind of be in the details there,\u201d said Andrew Leber, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has done extensive research on Saudi Arabia, noting that a similar deal announced with the United Arab Emirates fell through.",
      "He added, \u201cThat deal ultimately ran aground on a combination of U.S. concerns with maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge and concerns about the extent to which U.S. security technology might leak to China.\u201d",
      "Trump designated Saudi Arabia a \u201cMajor Non-NATO Ally\" on Tuesday, noting that the classification would take the country\u2019s military cooperation with the United States \u201cto even greater heights.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou always had a little cloud over your head, and sometimes that cloud was very big. That cloud is not there anymore, and we want to keep it that way,\u201d Trump said before he announced the designation at a dinner honoring Crown Prince Mohammed.",
      "Major Non-NATO Ally status is a designation that \u201cprovides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security cooperation,\u201d according to the State Department. It does not, however, require U.S. security commitments to such countries.",
      "The possibility of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel is a key part of the talks. \u201cI already brought it up,\" Trump said when asked about the prospect of Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham Accords, the 2020 U.S.-brokered agreement that led a number of regional countries to establish formal diplomatic ties with Israel. \"I don\u2019t want to use the word 'commitment,' but we had a good talk,\" he said.",
      "Analysts have been skeptical about a breakthrough.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no near-term horizon for normalization at the moment,\u201d Hanna said.",
      "\"The risks for Mohammed bin Salman are extremely high if he joins the Abraham Accords,\" agreed Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. He noted that Saudi Arabia had made clear it would need some form of Israeli commitment to a path to a Palestinian state \u2014 something Israel has publicly dismissed.",
      "The crown prince's strategy was generally \"to minimize the risks to his rule,\" Gerges said.",
      "Even if the crown prince does not announce the establishment of diplomatic ties with Israel, he has won favor with Trump as one of the regional leaders who helped pull together the current ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Trump has long touted his deal-making abilities and, according to a senior administration official, a number of deals are expected to be announced Tuesday, including a multibillion-dollar Saudi investment in America\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy and fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge via dozens of targeted investments.",
      "Critics have raised questions about Trump\u2019s affinity for mixing personal business and diplomacy. His properties have for years hosted tournaments for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf. And The New York Times reported this weekend that the Trump Organization is looking at a huge real estate deal with Saudi Arabia.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some massive ethical questions in here,\u201d Leber of the Carnegie Endowment said. \u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that all of the Gulf states have realized that the way you get to Trump is to find some way to enrich his family members, enrich his friends, promise to enrich them down the line.\u201d",
      "Trump, asked about his family\u2019s business ties to Saudi Arabia, said they \u201cdo business all over,\u201d and that he's no longer involved in the activities.",
      "Governments dealing with Saudi Arabia, human rights groups have long said, should also push the country\u2019s leaders on its dismal human rights record. In August, a report from Human Rights Watch noted an \u201cunprecedented surge\u201d in executions in 2025, with 241 people put to death as of Aug. 5.",
      "Still, the restrictions on women, another regular criticism leveled at the kingdom, have been eased, and the crown prince has tried to open up the society to Western exports, like Ultimate Fighting Championship matches and comedy shows, though the comedians who recently appeared at a comedy festival in Riyadh, including Louis C.K. and Bill Burr, were blasted for performing there.",
      "\u201cThis hasn\u2019t been political reform in the sense of creating space for real politics, but he\u2019s absolutely, fundamentally reoriented Saudi society and changed the role of the religious authorities,\u201d Hanna of the ICG said. \u201cThere\u2019s incredible social change that has happened partly because he\u2019s operating without any real constraints.\""

    "summary": "President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan may have passed the U.N. Security Council. But there are still major questions of how it will work.",
    "story": [
      "To hear President Donald Trump tell it, this was \"one of the biggest approvals in the history of the United Nations,\" a \"moment of true historic proportion\" that would \" lead to further peace all over the world.\" But the gravity of the U.N. Security Council's endorsement of the U.S. Gaza plan raised renewed questions Tuesday over how it will actually work.",
      "Most pressingly, it is not clear whether those at the heart of the conflict \u2014 the Palestinians and the Israelis themselves \u2014 actually support its end goals.",
      "Hamas, which still controls around half of the strip, outright rejected the resolution and said it robs Palestinians of their own agency, effectively giving Trump free rein over the Gaza Strip for the next two years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed its passage, but he previously said he rejects its talk of \"Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\"",
      "On a practical level, the proposal says it will require the creation of several as-yet-nonexistent bodies, including the \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d headed by Trump and the International Stabilization Force, or ISF, whose troops could be drawn from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates and as far away as Indonesia.",
      "That having been said, this was a rare moment of geopolitical unity.",
      "Trump's team won the support of Arab states by inserting language hinting at a future Palestinian state, and Russia and China abstained from the vote rather than use their vetoes to torpedo the proposal outright.",
      "It passed 13-0.",
      "Summarizing the mood Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres welcomed the vote as \"an important step\" but cautioned that it was \"essential now to translate the diplomatic momentum into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground,\" his office said in a statement.",
      "It's a sentiment shared by many observers.",
      "Frank Lowenstein, former special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under President Barack Obama, told NBC News that passing the resolution was \"essential\" for Trump's proposal.",
      "\"There was no way this Trump plan could possibly work without a U.N. Security Council resolution,\" he said. Not only will it impart \"the credibility and the legitimacy and the clear support of the international community,\" but it also \"provides an opportunity to begin creating a new reality, to begin moving forward with the process in a way that will give people hope.\"",
      "He cautioned, however, that the resolution's passage was \"nowhere near sufficient,\" principally because the U.N. has no enforcement mechanism, and that Hamas immediately rejected the ISF.",
      "The resolution claims \"the parties\" to the conflict \"have accepted it.\" But it's not clear that is the case.",
      "The main Palestinian governmental body, the Palestinian Authority, said in a statement Tuesday that it welcomed the resolution and expressed its \"full readiness to cooperate\" with the United States and its backers.",
      "But Hamas, the perpetrators of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, said the agreement did not meet the \"political and humanitarian demands and rights\" of the Palestinian people.",
      "The Palestinian militant-political group, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and would be disarmed under the deal, said in a statement that the mandate the resolution grants to the ISF to use force \u201cstrips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation.\u201d",
      "NBC News has contacted the White House for a response to those criticisms.",
      "Netanyahu praised Trump and \"his tireless and devoted team,\" saying he believed the plan \"will lead to peace and prosperity because it insists upon full demilitarization, disarmament and the deradicalization of Gaza.\"",
      "But just a day earlier, he had firmly rejected the resolution\u2019s call for \u201ca pathway towards Palestinian self-determination and eventual statehood,\u201d under pressure from his far-right coalition partners.",
      "Even putting those differences to one side, there are big question marks about how the basics of this plan will work in practice.",
      "\u201cThere is a genuine sense of relief that we are moving forward to diplomacy,\u201d said Nimrod Goren, the president of the Mitvim Institute, a progressive Israeli think tank.",
      "\u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s not really clear where all this is headed,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat is the commitment of the leaders, the motivations of those behind it? And can it actually lead us away from the status quo in which Hamas still controls part of Gaza and Israel controls other parts around it?\u201d",
      "On his Truth Social platform, Trump said members of the Board of Peace would be named in the coming weeks \u2014 having previously said British Prime Minister Tony Blair would be involved \u2014 and to expect \"many more exciting announcements.\"",
      "Goren said: \"There are all kinds of new terminology and mechanisms that do not yet exist. So there are a lot of question marks on the basic premises: What is their mandate? How will they be set up?\"",
      "Indonesia, one of the backers of the U.S. proposal, says it is readying 20,000 troops to deploy to the ISF. But they are unlikely to head into Gaza so long as Hamas opposes the deal, Lowenstein said.",
      "\"Nobody's going to send troops to be a part of the stabilization force that's going to be fighting Hamas,\" he said."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s Gaza peace plan was passed by a majority vote at the United Nations on Monday, though world powers were still divided over whether it can convert a fragile ceasefire into the long-term solution that has eluded the Middle East.",
      "Much about the plan remains uncertain, with occasional outbreaks of violence between Israel and Hamas threatening the tenuous diplomacy at every turn and Palestinians inside Gaza suffering hunger and now flooding at the onset of a bitter winter.",
      "The fraught path was made clear even before the delegates took to their desks, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 under pressure from his far-right coalition partners \u2014 denouncing the resolution's outlining of a future Palestinian state. Hamas also warned against the U.S. proposal.",
      "The Security Council adopted the plan with 13 votes in favor, zero votes against and two abstentions, Russia and China.",
      "\"Today\u2019s resolution represents another significant step towards a stable Gaza that will be able to prosper, and an environment that will allow Israel to live in security,\" Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said after the vote.",
      "Designed to usher Gaza from rubble-strewn war zone into a new era, the resolution backs establishing a \u201cBoard of Peace,\u201d headed by the president himself, to temporarily govern the territory. Alongside that, an International Stabilization Force, known as the ISF, would take over responsibility from the Israel Defense Forces currently occupying parts of the Gaza Strip.",
      "The proposal would be \u201cphase two\u201d of Trump\u2019s 20-point plan first announced in September, \u201cphase one\u201d of which brought a prisoner and hostage exchange, as well as a ceasefire that has largely held despite accusations of violations from both sides.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed at least 69,000 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to local health officials. Israel launched it after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist, attack in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 more were kidnapped.",
      "Some Security Council members objected that the U.S. resolution made no reference of Palestinian statehood, according to The Associated Press. The draft now says that after the Palestinian Authority has \u201cfaithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced, the conditions may be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,\u201d the AP reported.",
      "The resolution supporting the U.S. plan is backed by Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other Arab states, as well as Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan. Of those, the only ones on the Security Council are the United States and Pakistan, a nonpermanent member, which therefore does not have a veto.",
      "A joint statement from the United States and its backers said the \u201cprocess offers a pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\u201d and \u201cprovides a viable path towards peace and stability, not only between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but for the entire region.\u201d",
      "The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, lauded Trump for having \u201cassembled the Arab leaders and got them all to sign on the historic agreement.\u201d On Palestinian statehood, he issued a caveat that \u201cthe resolution does not call for the state, but it does say that it lays the groundwork, providing that there are reforms that have been called for for a long time.\u201d",
      "Even so, the open door to Palestinian statehood within the resolution has angered the Israeli far right, whose leading politicians are propping up Netanyahu\u2019s government. Under pressure from them, Netanyahu came out Sunday saying that \u201cour opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory has not changed.\u201d",
      "He said at a meeting: \u201cGaza will be demobilized and Hamas will be disarmed, the easy way or the hard way. I don\u2019t need reinforcements and tweets and lectures from anyone.\u201d",
      "The Hamas-led Palestinian Resistance Factions called the plan an \"attempt to impose another form of occupation on our land and people\" and \"a violation of our national sovereignty and a continuation of our people's suffering.\"",

      "The suggestion of a possible diplomatic path to defuse the mounting tensions with the South American country came after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States would designate the Cartel de los Soles, a group Washington alleges is run by Maduro, as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "The designation, set to take effect on Nov. 24, puts the cartel among the likes of Hamas and the Islamic State group. It allows the U.S. government to seize its assets and makes it unlawful to provide \u201cmaterial support\u201d to the group.",

Right now, he is satisfied with the strikes on alleged drug vessels, the senior White House official said. But both officials said Trump has expressed a willingness to strike targets on land, as well.",
      "As of Friday evening, Trump had not signed off on strikes on land, but that could change, the officials said. The military options are ready for him, and the United States has assets in the region now, so if he decides to move forward with strikes, they can begin quickly, the officials said.",
      "The strikes have generated controversy in Congress, as Democrats and some Republicans paint the administration's moves as heavy-handed overreach that circumvents lawmakers.",

      "Rain hammered the sprawling encampments across Gaza on Saturday, turning roads into rivers, soaking freezing families inside their tents and forcing people to sweep dirty water from their shelters as it pooled around their beds and belongings.",
      "The storms arrived as cold weather set in, adding new urgency to humanitarian concerns for the strip\u2019s 2 million residents, and as tensions flare up in Israel within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet.",
      "Sana Abu Harad, 38, cried out as she pointed to her shivering child and the drenched set of beds on the wet and muddied floor inside her tent in a Gaza City camp.",
      "\u201cEverything is underwater,\u201d she told NBC News. \u201cWhy must this little child sleep in floodwater? I struggled so much just to get this tent, and now nothing protects us. Where will I live with my children now?\u201d",
      "The crisis has been compounded by the collapse of water and sewage systems after two years of Israeli strikes destroyed key infrastructure, leaving hundreds of thousands of people crowded into areas with almost no toilets, drainage or sanitation.",
      "In Gaza, where an estimated 90% of the population has been displaced, more than 1.5 million people \u201curgently require emergency shelter assistance,\u201d the United Nations\u2019 migration agency IOM said last month.",
      "Mahmoud Basal, a spokesman for Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense agency, said Saturday that the enclave was facing a \u201ctrue catastrophe\u201d due to the heavy rains.",
      "\u201cThe mixing of rainwater with sewage has caused an environmental disaster and will lead to health catastrophes,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cThere is no sewage system, no rainwater drainage system, and no water reservoirs; all of them have been destroyed by Israel, along with all the infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The U.N. said last week that Israel has rejected over 100 requests for the entry of relief materials, including \u201cblankets, winter clothes, and tools and material to maintain and operate water, sanitation and hygiene services.\u201d",
      "Such restrictions continue to hamper humanitarian efforts, deputy U.N. spokesperson Farhan Haq told journalists in New York.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli body in charge of humanitarian aid in Gaza, said on X last week that \u201chundreds of trucks carrying food, water, fuel, gas, medicines, medical equipment, tents, and shelter supplies enter the Gaza Strip every day.\u201d",
      "The U.N. Security Council is expected to vote Monday on a U.S. proposal for a U.N. mandate for an international stabilization force in Gaza, which has faced pushback from Russia, China and some Arab countries.",
      "Tensions have flared up in Israel over a joint statement in support of the resolution, organized by the U.S., which said the ongoing peace process \u201coffers a pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\u201d",
      "The reference to Palestinian statehood has incensed two far-right members of the Israeli Cabinet, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who on Saturday pressed Netanyahu to disavow it.",
      "In a post on X, Ben-Gvir called on him to clarify that Israel \u201cwill not allow the establishment of a Palestinian state in any form,\u201d while Smotrich said in an X post that Netanyahu must \u201cmake it clear to the entire world\u201d no such state would ever exist.",
      "Netanyahu is reliant on continued support from ultranationalists to maintain his majority.",
      "The prime minister said at a government meeting on Sunday that Israel\u2019s opposition to a \u201cPalestinian state in any territory has not changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t need reinforcements and tweets and lectures from anyone,\u201d he added.",
      "The deployment of an international security force inside the enclave has proved a major obstacle in advancing negotiations for the next phase of the ceasefire, as well as Hamas\u2019 disarmament, the future governance of Gaza, and the remains of three Israeli hostages that have yet to be returned from Gaza.",
      "With Gaza\u2019s infrastructure still in ruin and storms battering its makeshift camps, those living there can only hope for future conditions to improve.",
      "Ma\u2019in Albuhteiti, 50, sleeps inside his Gaza City tent with seven of his children, but was awoken at 3 a.m. as rain swept over his family.",
      "\u201cLook at the bedding, the furniture, and the state of things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were completely flooded, we couldn\u2019t move.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf there were proper shelter for us, we would go, we cannot manage,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe situation is extremely tragic, and all the rain is pouring on us.\u201d"

      "BBC Chair Samir Shah sent a personal letter to the White House saying that he and the corporation were sorry for the edit, a spokesperson said, adding that while the broadcaster \u201csincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\u201d",
      "Tony Hall, director-general of the BBC from 2013 to 2020, said Saturday that the corporation should never agree to pay any money to Trump.",

      "LONDON \u2014 A flap of outrage is brewing over the fate of 15 residents of a cramped central London building, who critics say live out their lives indoors with no daylight, fresh air or adequately deep water.",
      "The gentoo penguins are one of the star attractions at the Sea Life London Aquarium, in one of the city\u2019s most popular tourist hot spots, across the river from the British Parliament and nestled between a \u201cShrek\u201d-themed experience and the popular London Eye landmark.",
      "British lawmakers this week joined campaigners in voicing mounting concerns for their 15 feathered neighbors, calling for government intervention over what they say is \u201cun-British\u201d treatment.",
      "The company that owns the aquarium says its penguin enclosure meets the standards of modern zoo practice set by the government.",
      "Visitors file past sharks, turtles and tropical fish in big tanks to reach the penguins, housed in a noticeably colder exhibit, built of rocks and artificial snow cliffs that hover over a pool of water.",
      "There, the 10 females and five males appear to spend their time mostly bobbing, jumping and swooshing through the water while visitors look on, children squealing with excitement while adults whip out their phones to take pictures.",
      "Most people filing by Thursday, largely families with children, told NBC News they were not aware of the brewing controversy.",
      "Shivani Gupta, visiting from Canada, said the conditions in the enclosure \u201cdid not seem right,\u201d although she added she would have still visited the aquarium as she has never seen penguins before.",
      "Chelsea Gibbons, 25, on vacation from Massachusetts, said she was not aware of the concerns raised by the campaigners, but noted there was no access to the outdoors for the penguins and the pool area appeared \u201ca bit small,\u201d although there is an additional area for the penguins to waddle around. Had she known about the efforts to free the birds ahead of time, Gibbon said, she would not have come. \u201cThe aquarium is saying it\u2019s meeting the standards, but we can always improve those standards,\u201d she added.",
      "Dozens of British lawmakers have signed an open letter to Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds asking her to \u201cconsider whether the penguins should be relocated to a more suitable facility better aligned with their behavioral, ecological and physiological needs,\u201d according to British media reports.",
      "David Taylor, a member of Parliament with the ruling Labour Party, has been spearheading the campaign, posting on X that \u201cabusing animals for money is un-British.\u201d",
      "The largest populations of gentoo penguins are found in the Falkland Islands and the South Georgia Islands in the South Atlantic, and on the Antarctic Peninsula, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "Rory Wilson, a professor of aquatic biology at Swansea University in the United Kingdom, told NBC News that in the wild, gentoo penguins routinely dive up to more than 160 feet deep.",
      "\u201cI know that the official guidelines for captive penguins is that they need at least 4 feet of water depth, which I don\u2019t know who thought of that. It clearly wasn\u2019t someone who thought much about penguins,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are monstrously efficient, wonderful swimmers. They are one of the fastest penguins, most athletic, and therefore any condition that they are being kept in captivity, which constrains their ability to move themselves, is obviously of concern,\u201d he said.",
      "As far as fresh air and daylight are concerned, Wilson said, some subspecies of gentoo could struggle to survive outside in the U.K. due to a risk of fungal infections.",
      "Freedom for Animals, a U.K. charity that opposes the captivity of animals in \u201czoos, aquariums, mobile zoos and circuses,\u201d launched a campaign to free the penguins in February 2024, but the movement has picked up steam with a protest held outside the facility last month and the intervention from MPs.",
      "A petition started by the charity has garnered more than 40,000 signatures and asks theme park operator Merlin Entertainments, which owns the aquarium, to guarantee the \u201csafe and permanent retirement of the penguins\u201d to a facility that can provide \u201ca much more suitable environment.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Merlin Entertainments said the penguin enclosure is located on the ground floor of the aquarium, not the basement, and was \u201ccarefully designed to reflect important elements of the penguins\u2019 natural environment as closely as possible to ensure good health, including climate-controlled temperature and filtered fresh air.\u201d",
      "The company also said the enclosure has technology that creates appropriate seasonal lighting, reflecting changing seasons. The penguin colony is regularly inspected by independent veterinarians, and local and national authorities, it added.",
      "\u201cThis is a complex issue,\u201d its statement said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to consider, and we take every decision seriously, always guided by what\u2019s best for the animals. We\u2019re open. We\u2019re listening. And we\u2019ve always done what\u2019s right for our animals based on expert advice and their individual needs. That\u2019s a commitment we stand by.\u201d"

      "The Chinese outrage is directed at Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who told lawmakers last week that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could force a military response from Tokyo, an unusually explicit statement that experts say is a first for a sitting Japanese prime minister.",
      "China, which claims the self-ruling island democracy as its territory and has not ruled out the use of force against it, has demanded that Takaichi retract her \u201cegregious\u201d remarks.",
      "Others have gone further: One prominent Chinese commentator called Takaichi an \u201cevil witch,\u201d while a Chinese diplomat in Japan talked about cutting off the \u201cdirty neck\u201d extending itself into what Beijing considers an internal matter.",
      "Both countries have summoned each other\u2019s ambassadors as the saga enters its second week, and on Friday China advised its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan, citing \"significant risks\" to their personal safety.",
      "The war of words underscores the complicated relationship between China and Japan, which are major trading partners but have modern territorial disputes as well as lasting historical tensions over Japan\u2019s World War II-era occupation of China.",
      "It was only two weeks ago that Takaichi, who last month became Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a regional summit in South Korea, during which they agreed to pursue stable ties.",
      "Like its ally the United States, Japan has traditionally been vague as to how far it would go to protect Taiwan \u2014 which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory \u2014 against Chinese military aggression.",
      "But Takaichi, a China hard-liner who has long advocated for Taiwan, told lawmakers last week that Chinese use of force around Taiwan could qualify as \u201can existential threat,\u201d triggering a military response.",
      "Though former Japanese leaders \u2014 including Takaichi\u2019s mentor, the late Shinzo Abe \u2014 have made similar comments about military action after leaving office, \u201cit\u2019s breaking new ground for a sitting prime minister to state this,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News.",
      "The reaction from China was strong and swift, with one comment in particular getting the most attention.",
      "\u201cThe dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,\u201d Xue Jian, the Chinese consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, said in a post on X that has since been deleted.",
      "The Japanese government says it continues to favor a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue and has criticized Xue\u2019s \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d remarks, which some interpreted as a death threat against Takaichi.",
      "The U.S. ambassador to Japan, George Glass, has also weighed in on Xue\u2019s comments. \u201cTime for Beijing to behave like the \u2018good neighbor\u2019 it talks repeatedly about \u2014 but fails repeatedly to become,\u201d he said in a post on X.",
      "On Friday, Tokyo summoned the Chinese ambassador to Japan, Wu Jianghao, to lodge a protest over Xue\u2019s post.",
      "China said later Friday that Wu had himself \u201csummoned Japan\u2019s Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Takehiro Funakoshi, to lodge solemn representations\u201d and assail Takaichi for failing to retract her comments, which it said \u201cviolated basic common sense, crossed China\u2019s red line, constituted a military threat, and amounted to war-mongering.\u201d",
      "A day earlier, Beijing summoned the Japanese ambassador, Kenji Kanasugi, to warn him over Taiwan.",
      "The Chinese Ministry of National Defense also issued a warning on Friday, saying that Japan would \u201cinevitably crash against the steel wall\u201d of the Chinese military if it intervenes in the Taiwan Strait, \u201cpaying a bitter and heavy price.\u201d",
      "Takaichi has also been excoriated in Chinese state media. A Friday editorial in the People\u2019s Daily newspaper said the Taiwan remarks by Takaichi, who has vowed to increase defense spending and favors revising Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution, were \u201caimed at finding an excuse for Japan\u2019s military expansion.\u201d",
      "Hu Xijin, a Chinese nationalist commentator, said Takaichi was an \u201cevil witch\u201d who had \u201csuccessfully ignited a new explosion of mutual hatred between Chinese and Japanese public opinion.\u201d",
      "Taiwan, which was ruled by China\u2019s Qing dynasty from 1683 to 1895 and by Japan from 1895 to 1945, has emphasized its sovereignty and noted Beijing\u2019s escalating military activity in the Taiwan Strait.",
      "China\u2019s warnings to Japan \u201cunderscore its hegemonic mindset and demonstrate that it is a troublemaker intent on unilaterally changing the international order,\u201d the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said this week.",
      "None of this may matter all that much to Takaichi, who was expected to clash with Beijing on Taiwan and other issues.",
      "China\u2019s harsh response will only \u201cenhance her reputation\u201d among conservatives in Japan, Kingston said. It could also give her a boost with President Donald Trump, who seemingly hit it off with Takaichi during his visit to Japan last month.",
      "\u201cTaking a hard line on China doesn\u2019t really hurt her in terms of bilateral relations with the United States,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Because China is so sensitive to the issue of Taiwan, which it describes as its \u201ccore of core interests,\u201d its rebuke of Takaichi\u2019s comments is also unsurprising, said Richard McGregor, senior fellow for East Asia at the Lowy Institute, a foreign policy think tank in Australia.",
      "And while Takaichi wants to be seen as firm on national security, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean that she wants a confrontation with China,\u201d he said in an interview Friday in Hong Kong.",
      "So for all the tense exchanges her Taiwan remarks have brought between the two Asian powers, McGregor said, \u201cit\u2019s not a cataclysmic event.\u201d",
      "Kingston agreed.",
      "Takaichi \u201cwent out of her way to be provocative,\u201d he said, \u201cand China responded as expected.\u201d"

      "As the director of the inaugural IndieChina Film Festival, Zhu was set to welcome filmmakers and directors from China to New York City for a small showcase of independent Chinese films this week, but he said concerns over harassment led to the event\u2019s suspension two days before it was scheduled to start on Nov. 8.",
      "Every day this week, Zhu has been showing up to the empty venue he had booked for the film festival as a form of protest.",
      "\u201cIt was not the film festival that I prepared for,\u201d the filmmaker told NBC News on Friday morning.",
      "In a statement ahead of the film festival\u2019s cancellation, the organizer said he received messages saying that filmmakers, directors and producers from China set to participate in the event, as well as their relatives, were facing harassment.",
      "Many participants who pulled out of the independent film festival did not say why or cited \u201cpersonal reasons,\u201d but a few said they or their family members had been told to do so by Chinese authorities, according to Zhu.",
      "\u201cI hope this announcement of the cancellation of IndieChina Film Festival will make certain unknown forces stop harassing all the directors, guests, former staff, volunteers and my friends and family,\u201d Zhu said in a statement on the festival\u2019s website.",
      "By the time Zhu suspended the film festival, it was too late for him to cancel the venue he had booked. Throughout the week, he has gone to the event space \u2014 sometimes by himself or with a handful of other filmmakers \u2014 to watch some films and discuss them.",
      "\u201cI am still a filmmaker. I\u2019m still a filmmaker from China and I\u2019m still an independent film curator,\u201d Zhu said, adding that independent filmmaking in China \u201cis really difficult; it is extremely different from before.\u201d",
      "Before moving to New York City a decade ago, Zhu had worked on independent film festivals in China for nearly 20 years and co-founded the Beijing Independent Film Festival.",
      "But independent film festivals in China began facing increasing crackdowns after Chinese President Xi Jinping, known for his stringent ideological control, stepped into power in 2012, according to Human Rights Watch. The nongovernmental organization investigating human rights abuses around the world has said that Chinese authorities have shut down all three major independent film festivals in China, including Zhu\u2019s Beijing Independent Film Festival.",
      "\u201cEventually, all of my film festivals were banned, none of them could continue,\u201d Zhu said.",
      "Following what happened to his film festival in Beijing, Zhu had been rethinking how to host a film festival focused on Chinese independent films that could avoid censorship \u2014 the New York City event was the first attempt at that.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government reached around the globe to shut down a film festival in New York City,\u201d Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cThis latest act of transnational repression demonstrates the Chinese government\u2019s aim to control what the world sees and learns about China.\u201d",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to an NBC News email seeking comment.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry told The New York Times this week that it wasn\u2019t familiar with the specific circumstances around the IndieChina Film Festival and that Human Rights Watch had \u201clong been prejudiced against China.\u201d"
