    "story": [
      "A former model who alleges that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her almost 20 years ago has taken the stand at his retrial",
      "NEW YORK -- Days into Harvey Weinstein 's first sexual assault trial in 2020, prosecutors privately spoke for the first time with a former model who alleged that he had forced oral sex on her.",
      "But that jury was never told about Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola's claim. Prosecutors have said they still were investigating the allegation when Weinstein, a onetime movie tycoon-turned- #MeToo pariah, was convicted in February 2020 of charges based on other women's accusations.",
      "On Wednesday, Sokola began to tell a new jury her story.",
      "Sokola didn't look at Weinstein as she walked past him and onto the witness stand in a Manhattan courtroom where he's on trial again. An appeals court overturned his 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction, sending those charges back for retrial, and prosecutors subsequently added another sexual assault charge based on Sokola's allegations.",
      "As she began testifying about her life before the alleged 2006 assault, Weinstein looked toward her, with his right hand across his mouth.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults.",
      "The women, meanwhile, say the Oscar-winning producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "The Polish-born Sokola, 39, sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and its calls for accountability for sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "She was introduced to Weinstein while on a modeling trip to New York in 2002, when she was 16, according to prosecutors.",
      "In her lawsuits, Sokola said that shortly after she met Weinstein, he invited her to lunch to discuss her career but then sexually assaulted her. The lawsuits alleged he sexually harassed and emotionally abused her for years afterward.",
      "The criminal charge stems from one instance when Sokola maintains that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel in May 2006.",
      "Prosecutors have said it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries\u201d and met her visiting older sister, whom she was trying to impress.",
      "\u201cShe was proud of knowing him,\u201d her sister, cardiologist Dr. Ewa (pronounced EH\u2019-vah) Sokola, told jurors Wednesday.",
      "She said the three of them met in a hotel lobby, chatted for about an hour about Italian movies and the heavyset Weinstein's heart health, and then he and the model left the table together.",
      "Kaja Sokola was tense when she returned about a half-hour later \u2014 \u201clike somebody waiting for the result of an exam\u201d or the Oscars \u2014 but didn't say anything about the alleged sexual assault, Dr. Sokola told jurors.",
      "She said she was shocked to learn about the claim over a decade later, when she read about it in a magazine article.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers will get a chance to question Kaja Sokola in the coming days. In an opening statement last month, defense attorney Arthur Aidala questioned why she waited years to come forward. Prosecutors have argued that accusers were reluctant to speak up because of Weinstein's wealth and influence.",
      "Prosecutors have said Sokola's attorneys contacted them on the eve of Weinstein's first trial to say she was willing to be interviewed. Prosecutors have said they soon spoke with her and began investigating, but didn't initially pursue charges because Weinstein was convicted and the coronavirus pandemic loomed.",
      "They revived the Sokola investigation after New York's highest court reversed Weinstein's conviction.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola's allegation out of the retrial. They accused prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case for the improper purpose of bolstering the credibility\u201d of other accusers.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",

      "FLOURTOWN, Pa. -- Jason Kelce flubbed his pitch shot from the thick rough next to a green on the ninth hole \u2014 on a round that featured more \u201cGo Birds\u201d chants than birdies \u2014 and muttered a common refrain from most weekend golf warriors:",
      "\u201cHey, that\u2019s why I\u2019m an amateur,\u201d Kelce said.",
      "Kelce could have crowd-sourced some golf tips from the scores of fans that followed him hole after humbling hole on Wednesday during a rare PGA Tour stop in the Philadelphia area.",
      "The retired Philadelphia Eagles center has tried in his first year of retirement to up his golf game and lower his score, taking the task of trying to get it in the hole as seriously as he did opening them as he once did on the offensive line. Kelce posted a video of his swing on Reddit this week and asked readers \u2014 anyone from pros to casual players \u2014 for advice on how to get better.",
      "\u201cJason Kelce here. Now that I\u2019ve hung up the cleats, I\u2019m trying to get serious about my golf game,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve uploaded 6 different angles of my swing from a session yesterday. Looking for any tips you can give me \u2014 especially on my backswing and follow-through.\"",
      "Kelce said the early feedback was \u201ccrazy.\"",
      "\u201cSome of this stuff is like stuff other pros have put out and it's kind of generic stuff that everybody can use,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cBut there's been some stuff so far that's been like, \u2018Holy cow, I never thought about it like that.' So I'm excited about that.\u201d",
      "Kelce \u2014 who retired following the 2023 season after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles, played his role as man of the people to perfection during a pro-am ahead of the Truist Championship. He took time to answer questions from 14-year-old Benji Panzer, a middle school student who had credentials as part of an area sports broadcasting camp. Panzer asked Kelce about his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast that he tapes with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.",
      "\u201cThe ability of players to connect with fans directly has never been greater,\u201d Kelce told Panzer.",
      "Kelce connected with plenty of Eagles fans, signing everything from aluminum beer bottles, T-shirts, golf balls and all types of Eagles memorabilia. He accepted gifts, too, including a Kelly green Eagles beer koozie. One fan who called himself T-Shirt Phil \u2014 did we mention the tourney was near Philly? \u2014 said he wanted to introduce Kelce to Phillies slugger Nick Castellanos.",
      "The 37-year-old Kelce \u2014 who with wife and social media star Kylie, welcomed their fourth child Finnley \u201cFinn\u201d Anne Kelce in March \u2014 refused to name his favorite golf course in the area but seemed to enjoy the fast greens his first time at Philly Cricket\u2019s Wissahickon Course.",
      "\u201cThe course is in great shape,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous. All the guys we played with agreed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe guys\u201d included PGA pros Stephan Jager and Shane Lowry.",
      "One unspecified member of the group sliced a ball into the crowd and struck the left hand of 25-year-old spectator Hudson Mokrejs, of Elverson, Pennsylvania, who needed an ice pack on his reddened wrist.",
      "\u201cWe were talking beforehand like, \u2018Man, wouldn\u2019t it be great to get hit by Jason Kelce's ball?' And then he shot it over the green,\u201d Mokrejs said. \u201cI was talking and all of a sudden I hear, \u2018Look out!\u2019 I turned and it just smacked me in the hand. I covered my hand. I didn't spill my drink. I had a Transfusion. Classic golf drink, you know what I mean? Chugged that real quick to get me healthy.\u201d",
      "Kelce noted the serene golf atmosphere made for more \u201cGo Birds\u201d chants more than the popular \u201cE-A-G-L-E-S\u201d chant that punctuates the Eagles\u2019 fight song.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so quick,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cThe \u2018E-A-G-L-E-S\u2019 you\u2019ve got start in halfway through. Someone\u2019s got to get it going.\u201d",
      "He can expect to hear more of them on the course on big-time golf events in the area.",
      "The 2026 PGA Championship will be held at Aronimink Golf Club in Newtown Square and the 2030 U.S. Open is at Merion Golf Club.",
      "\u201cPhilly is an unbelievable golf hub,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cThere's a lot of fans in the game. There's a lot of incredible courses with a lot of history to it.\u201d",
      "Who knows? Thanks to social media, Kelce the amateur golfer just might get good enough to take some swings when it counts.",

      "Actor Michael Pitt, known for his TV roles on \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d and \u201cDawson's Creek,\u201d is accused of sexually assaulting his ex-girlfriend, choking her, and attacking her with a cinder block and a piece of lumber at his New York City home, according to a grand jury indictment.",
      "Pitt, 44, whose lawyers denied the allegations, was arrested Friday on nine counts including first-degree sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, attempted assault and strangulation. The indictment cites four incidents between April 2020 and August 2021 at Pitt's home in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.",
      "Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez's office declined to comment Wednesday beyond the allegations listed in the indictment.",
      "Pitt's lawyer, Jason Goldman, said he already had exonerating evidence and expected the case to be dismissed.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, we live in a world where somebody like Mr. Pitt \u2014 an accomplished professional who would never so much as contemplate these crimes \u2014 can be arrested on the uncorroborated word of an unreliable individual,\u201d Goldman said in a text message to The Associated Press.",
      "He added, \u201cIn reality, this baseless claim is suspiciously raised some four or five years after the alleged incident, from a time when the two parties were in a completely consensual relationship.\u201d",
      "Pitt pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday and posted $100,000 bail, Goldman said. He is due back in court in Brooklyn on June 17.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, which the woman in Pitt's case has not done.",
      "The indictment alleges Pitt forcibly touched his ex-girlfriend sexually in April 2020. In August 2020, the grand jury alleges Pitt forced oral sex on the woman and assaulted her with a 4-inch-by-4-inch (10-centimeter-by-10-centimeter) piece of lumber.",
      "The indictment also says Pitt attacked her with a cinder block twice in June 2021 and choked her in August 2021.",
      "TMZ reported in 2022 that Pitt was arrested in Brooklyn for allegedly punching a man after taking his phone and, two months later, was brought to a hospital under police escort after a public outburst in New York.",
      "Pitt, who grew up in West Orange, New Jersey, played the character Jimmy Darmody for two seasons on HBO's \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d with the cast led by Steve Buscemi winning Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2011 and 2012 for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series. The show also won a Golden Globe for best drama series in 2011.",
      "His first major role came in the 2001 film \u201cHedwig and the Angry Inch.\u201d In 2005, he starred in \u201cLast Days,\u201d director Gus Van Sant's film about a fictional rock star inspired by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. He also played Henry Parker in one season of The WB's \u201cDawson's Creek\u201d in 1999-2000.",

      "NEW YORK -- Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, the hip-hop entrepreneur whose wildly successful career has been dotted by allegations of violence, will be brought to a New York courthouse Monday to be tried on charges that he used the influence and resources of his business empire to sexually abuse women. Jury selection is scheduled to begin in the morning and potentially take several days. Opening statements by the lawyers and the start of testimony is expected next week.",
      "The 17-page indictment against Combs reads like a charging document filed against a Mafia leader or the head of a drug gang, accusing him of engaging in sex trafficking and presiding over a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "The indictment says that with the help of people in his entourage and employees from his network of businesses, Combs engaged in a two-decade pattern of abusive behavior against women and others.",
      "Women were manipulated into participating in drug-fueled sexual performances with male sex workers that Combs called \u201cFreak Offs,\u201d prosecutors say.",
      "To keep women in line, prosecutors say Combs used a mix of influence and violence: He offered to boost their entertainment careers if they did what he asked \u2014 or cut them off if they didn't.",
      "And when he wasn't getting what he wanted, the indictment says Combs and his associates resorted to violent acts including beatings, kidnapping and arson. Once, the indictment alleges, he even dangled someone from a balcony.",
      "Combs and his lawyers say he is innocent.",
      "Any group sex was consensual, they say. There was no effort to coerce people into things they didn't want to do, and nothing that happened amounted to a criminal racket, they said.",
      "The trial is expected to take at least eight weeks.",
      "Combs, 55, has acknowledged one episode of violence that is likely to be featured in the trial. In 2016, a security camera recorded him beating up his former girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. Cassie filed a lawsuit in late 2023 saying Combs had subjected her to years of abuse, including beatings and rape.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, did.",
      "Combs\u2019 attorney, Marc Agnifilo has said Combs was \u201cnot a perfect person\u201d and that there had been drug use and toxic relationships, but said that all sexual activity between Combs, Cassie and other people was consensual.",
      "The trial is the latest and most serious in a long string of legal problems for Combs.",
      "In 1999 he was charged with bursting into the offices of an Interscope Records executive with his bodyguards and beating him with a champagne bottle and a chair. The executive, Steve Stoute, later asked prosecutors to go easy on Combs, who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and took an anger management class.",
      "Later that same year, Combs was stopped by police after he and his then-girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, fled a nightclub where three people were wounded by gunfire. Combs was acquitted of all charges related to the incident at a 2001 trial, but a rapper in his entourage, Jamal \u201cShyne\u201d Barrow, was convicted in the shooting and served nearly nine years in prison.",
      "Then in 2015, Combs was charged with assaulting someone with a weight-room kettlebell at the the University of California, Los Angeles, where one of his sons played football. Combs said he was defending himself and prosecutors dropped the case.",
      "Now, Combs faces his most serious case yet.",
      "If convicted, he faces the possibility of decades in prison.",

      "Jacques Agbobly has only been in the fashion business for five years",
      "NEW YORK -- When the email came from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Jacques Agbobly at first didn\u2019t quite believe it.",
      "The Brooklyn-based fashion designer had only been in the business for five years. Now, one of the world\u2019s top museums was asking for two of his designs to be shown in \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d the exhibit launched by the starry Met Gala.",
      "\u201cI was just floored with excitement,\u201d Agbobly said in an interview. \u201cI had to check to make sure it was from an official email. And then the excitement came, and I was like \u2026 am I allowed to say anything to anyone about it?\u201d",
      "Agbobly grew up in Togo, watching seamstresses and tailors create beautiful garments in part of the family home that they rented out. Studying fashion later in New York, the aspiring designer watched the Met Gala carpet from afar and dreamed of one day somehow being part of it.",
      "\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is the first Costume Institute exhibit to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years devoted to menswear. Unlike past shows that highlighted the work of very famous designers like Karl Lagerfeld or Charles James, this exhibit includes a number of up-and-coming designers like Agbobly.",
      "\u201cThe range is phenomenal,\u201d says guest curator Monica L. Miller, a Barnard College professor whose book, \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d is a foundation for the show.",
      "\u201cIt's super exciting to showcase the designs of these younger and emerging designers,\u201d says Miller, who took The Associated Press through the show over the weekend before its unveiling at Monday\u2019s Met Gala, \u201cand to see the way they've been thinking about Black representation across time and across geography.\u201d",
      "The exhibit covers Black style over several centuries, but the unifying theme is dandyism, and how designers have expressed that ethos through history.",
      "For Agbobly, dandyism is \u201cabout taking space. As a Black designer, as a queer person, a lot of it is rooted in people telling us who we should be or how we should act \u2026 dandyism really goes against that. It\u2019s about showing up and looking your best self and taking up space and announcing that you're here.\u201d",
      "The exhibit, which opens to the public May 10, begins with its own definition: someone who \u201cstudies above everything else to dress elegantly and fashionably.\u201d",
      "Miller has organized it into 12 conceptual sections: Ownership, presence, distinction, disguise, freedom, champion, respectability, jook, heritage, beauty, cool and cosmopolitanism.",
      "The \u201cownership\u201d section begins with two livery coats worn by enslaved people.",
      "One of them, from Maryland, looks lavish and elaborate, in purple velvet trimmed with gold metallic threading. The garments were intended to show the wealth of their owners. In other words, Miller says, the enslaved themselves were items of conspicuous consumption.",
      "The other is a livery coat of tan broadcloth, likely manufactured by Brooks Brothers and worn by an enslaved child or adolescent boy in Louisiana just before the Civil War.",
      "Elsewhere, there's a contemporary, glittering ensemble by British designer Grace Wales Bonner, made of crushed silk velvet and embroidered with crystals and the cowrie shells historically used as currency in Africa.",
      "There's also a so-called \u201cdollar bill suit\u201d by the label 3.Paradis \u2014 the jacket sporting a laminated one-dollar bill stitched to the breast pocket, meant to suggest the absence of wealth.",
      "The \u201cdisguise\u201d section includes a collection of 19th-century newspaper ads announcing rewards for catching runaway enslaved people.",
      "The ads, Miller notes, would often describe someone who was \u201cparticularly fond of dress\u201d \u2014 or note that the person had taken large wardrobes. The reason was twofold: The fancy clothes made it possible for an enslaved person to cloak their identity. But also, when they finally made it to freedom, they could sell the clothing to help fund their new lives, Miller says.",

      "Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, says her agent Mike Eisenstadt. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi's Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: \u201cShe wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.\u201d",

My favorite Gladys line was when she announced that the day of the office Christmas party, they sent her home early.\u201d",
      "The Gladys character used her purse as a weapon against anyone who bothered her, striking people over the head. On \u201cLaugh-In,\u201d her most frequent target was Arte Johnson\u2019s dirty old man character Tyrone F. Horneigh.",
      "\u201cGladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,\u201d Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. \u201cSo when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who\u2019s been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused.

If he doesn't abide by the conditions, he faces being remanded in custody.",
      "The comedian, author and \u201cGet Him To The Greek\u201d actor, who wore an open shirt and jeans, listened intently to the details of the charges as he sat in the dock. He spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth, address and that he understood his bail conditions.",

      "Brand is alleged to have raped a woman in 1999 at a hotel room in Bournemouth when she attended a Labour Party conference in the town.

Brand is alleged to have grabbed her by the face with both hands, pushed her against a wall and kissed her before grabbing her breasts and buttocks.",
      "The charges follow a September 2023 joint investigation by British media outlets Channel 4 and the Sunday Times.",
      "Known for his unbridled and risqu\u00e9 standup routines, Brand hosted shows on radio and television and wrote memoirs charting his battles with drugs and alcohol. He has appeared in several Hollywood movies and was briefly married to pop star Katy Perry between 2010 and 2012.",
      "In recent years, Brand has largely disappeared from mainstream media but has built up a large following online with videos mixing wellness and conspiracy theories. He recently said he had moved to the United States.",

    "story": [
      "A slab of Brooklyn wall that the artist Banksy emblazoned with a bandaged, heart-shaped balloon is emerging after more than a decade in storage",
      "NEW YORK -- When the enigmatic street artist Banksy spray-painted a heart-shaped balloon covered with a Band-Aid on the wall of a Brooklyn warehouse, the nondescript brick building was instantly transformed into an art destination and the canvas of an unlikely graffiti battle.",
      "Almost as soon as Banksy revealed the piece back in 2013, an anonymous tagger brazenly walked up and spray painted the words \u201cOmar NYC\u201d in red beside the balloon, to the dismay of onlookers.",
      "Days later, someone stenciled \u201cis a little girl\u201d in white and pink beside Omar\u2019s tag, followed by a seemingly sarcastic phrase in black: \u201cI remember MY first tag.\u201d Some think it was Banksy himself who secretly returned to the scene to add the rejoinder.",
      "The apparent graffiti battle didn\u2019t end there. Another tagger also attempted to leave his mark but was stymied by security guards. Today the phrase \u201cSHAN\u201d is still visible in light purple paint.",
      "Maria Georgiadis, whose family owned the now-demolished warehouse and ultimately removed the section of wall to preserve the artwork, says the graffiti pastiche is quintessentially New York.",
      "\u201cIt looks like a war going on,\u201d she said recently. \u201cThey\u2019re literally going at it on the wall.\u201d",
      "The preserved wall, dubbed \u201cBattle to Survive a Broken Heart,\u201d will be going up for sale May 21 at Guernsey\u2019s, the New York auction house.",
      "Georgiadis, a Brooklyn schoolteacher, says the sale is bittersweet. Her father, Vassilios Georgiadis, ran his roofing and asbestos abatement company from the warehouse adorned with the balloon.",
      "He died four years ago at age 67 from a heart attack, which is why some of the proceeds from the sale will be donated to the American Heart Association.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just very significant to us because he loved it and he was just so full of love,\u201d Maria Georgiadis said on a recent visit to the art warehouse where the piece was stored for more than a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s like the bandage heart. We all have love, but we\u2019ve all went through things and we just put a little Band-Aid over and just keep on moving, right? That\u2019s how I take it.\u201d",
      "The nearly 4-ton, 6-foot-tall (3.6-metric ton, 1.8-meter-tall) wall section is one of a number of guerrilla works the famously secretive British artist made during a New York residency in 2013.",
      "At the time, Banksy heralded the work by posting on his website photos and an audio track recorded partly in a squeaky, helium-induced voice.",
      "Guernsey auction house President Arlan Ettinger said it is impossible to know for certain because Banksy works clandestinely. But he said the neat stenciling and wording \u201cstrongly suggest that this was a gentle way for Banksy to put the other artist in his place.\u201d",
      "Ulrich Blanch\u00e9, an art history lecturer at Heidelberg University in Germany, called the piece a \u201cvery well executed\u201d stencil notable partly because of Banksy's decision to place it in Brooklyn\u2019s port area of Red Hook.",
      "\u201cThis part of NYC was not easy to reach at that time,\u201d he said by email. \u201cBanksy wanted people to go to places in NYC they never have seen and love them as well.\u201d",
      "But Blanche questioned whether the additional stenciled text was truly the work of Banksy, saying the word choice and design don\u2019t appear to comport with the artist\u2019s style at the time.",
      "\u201cTo call a graffiti guy a \u2018girl\u2019 is not something Banksy would do in 2013. This is misogynic and immature in a sexist way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThree different fonts that do not match and three colors \u2014 why should he do that? Too unnecessarily elaborated without reasons. So I think this was added by someone else.\u201d",
      "Blanch\u00e9 also said he is ambivalent about the pending sale, noting Banksy usually doesn't authorize his street pieces for sale. At the same time, he understands the burden placed on property owners to protect and maintain them.",
      "\u201cBanksy\u2019s works should be preserved, but for the community they were made for,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should not be turned into goods. They are made and thought for a specific location. Not portable. Not sellable.\u201d",
      "Spokespersons for Banksy didn't respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Maria Georgiadis\u2019 brother, Anastasios, said his father had also hoped to keep the piece in Red Hook after having cut it out of the wall and framed in thick steel for safekeeping.",
      "The elder Georgiadis, he said, envisioned the work as the centerpiece of a retail and housing development on the property, a dream he didn't realize. The property has since been sold off by the family.",
      "Ettinger said it is difficult to say what the piece might fetch. There is little precedent for a sale of a Banksy piece of this size, he said.",
      "In 2018, a canvas that was part of Banksy's \u201cGirl With Balloon\u201d series sold in London for 1.04 million pounds ($1.4 million), only to famously self-destruct in front of a stunned auction crowd.",
      "Maria Georgiadis said she hopes whoever buys the \u201dBroken Heart\u201d finds the same beauty and meaning her father drew from the piece.",
      "When Banksy painted it, the family business had been recovering from destructive floods caused by Hurricane Sandy the prior year. Georgiadis recalls her father had no idea who Banksy was but was moved by the simple image.",
      "\u201cMy dad had it in his head that Banksy knew what we went through,\u201d she said. \u201cHe goes, \u2018Can you believe it Maria? It\u2019s a heart.\u2019\u201d",

      "The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies \u201cto cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS\" and further requires that that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. The White House, in a social media posting announcing the signing, said the outlets \u201creceive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\u201d",
      "It's the latest move by Trump and his administration to utilize federal powers to control or hamstring institutions whose actions or viewpoints he disagrees with. Since taking office, Trump has ousted leaders, placed staff on administrative leave and cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to artists, libraries, museums, theaters and others, through takeovers of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has also pushed to withhold federal research and education funds from universities and punish law firms unless they agreed to eliminate diversity programs and other measures Trump has found objectionable.",
      "The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and have been preparing for the possibility of stiff cuts since Trump's election, as Republicans have long complained about them.",
      "Paula Kerger, PBS\u2019 CEO and president, said in a statement last month that the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rescind funding for public media would \u201cdisrupt the essential service PBS and local member stations provide to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cThis public-private partnership allows us to help prepare millions of children for success in school and in life and also supports enriching and inspiring programs of the highest quality.\u201d",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting sued Trump earlier this week over his move to fire three members of its five-person board, contending that the president was exceeding his authority and that the move would deprive the board of a quorum needed to conduct business.",
      "Just two weeks ago, the White House said it would be asking Congress to rescind funding for the CPB as part of a $9.1 billion package of cuts. That package, however, which budget director Russell Vought said would likely be the first of several, has not yet been sent to Capitol Hill.",
      "The move against PBS and NPR comes as his administration has been working to dismantle the U.S. Agency for Global Media, including Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which were designed to model independent news gathering globally in societies that restrict the press. Those efforts have faced pushback from federal courts, who have ruled in some cases that the Trump administration may have overstepped its authority in holding back funds appropriated to the outlets by Congress.",

      "He said ten million children under the age of five worldwide died when his foundation launched in 2000, with 90% of the deaths due to diarrhea, pneumonia or malaria. That number has now been cut in half to below five million, Gates said.",
      "\u201cIt's been an amazing time period. And there\u2019s many new tools coming,\u201d he told the meeting, which was also attended by prominent Indonesian businesspeople and philanthropists.",
      "Gates' foundation is currently developing a tuberculosis vaccine that's planned to be tested in Indonesia, Subianto said.",

      "Gates has granted more than $159 million to Indonesia since 2009. Much of it was allocated to the health sector, especially for vaccine procurement, Subianto said.

      "Research by Prasad and his colleagues showed that many cancer drugs fast-tracked by the FDA have never been shown to improve or extend patient lives. Instead, the drugs are often approved based on alternate measures, such as the ability to shrink tumors, which are thought to predict their long-term benefits.",
      "The FDA has long defended this practice as a way of accelerating approval of medicines for desperately ill patients.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Prasad reached a much broader audience as a critic of mask mandates, lockdowns and moves to speed the availability of vaccine boosters from Pfizer and Moderna. Many of his views mirror those of other Trump appointees, including Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya.",
      "In 2022, Prasad and Makary were co-authors on a paper attacking the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. Those patients received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild.",
      "The paper concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions, prompting pushback from many health experts.",
      "In recent years, Prasad become a regular on podcasts associated with Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, which often portrays the FDA as beholden to the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Prasad's appointment is likely to alarm drug and vaccine makers, who depend on the predictability of FDA standards and procedures to guide drug development plans that can span years or even decades.",

      "Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital have agreed to a $750 million settlement of hundreds of sexual abuse claims by patients of imprisoned former gynecologist Robert Hadden",
      "Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital have agreed to a $750 million settlement of hundreds of sexual abuse claims by patients of disgraced and imprisoned former gynecologist Robert Hadden, bringing total legal payouts in civil cases involving the ex-doctor to over $1 billion, according to the plaintiffs' lawyer.",
      "Hadden, now 66, was accused of molesting patients during a decades-long career at prestigious New York City hospitals including Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian. He was convicted by a jury in 2023 of federal sex crime charges and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.",
      "The new settlements, approved by a Manhattan judge Monday, come in 576 legal cases against the Ivy League school, the hospital and others over the abuse by Hadden, plaintiffs' attorney Anthony T. DiPietro said.",
      "\u201cThis victory is not just for the victims and survivors of Columbia University and The New York-Presbyterian Hospital\u2019s cover-up who bravely came forward, but for all of us who entrust medical institutions with our health care,\u201d DiPietro said in statement.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, Columbia and New York-Presbyterian have prioritized protecting their reputations over protecting their patients,\" he said. \"This settlement sends a powerful message that we\u2019re here to ensure that institutions covering up exploitation and abuse will be held fully accountable for their crimes.\u201d",
      "DiPietro said the average payout to plaintiffs from the new settlement will be about $1.3 million. Columbia previously agreed to $277 million in settlements with more than 200 other plaintiffs over Hadden's sexual abuse, he said.",
      "Columbia confirmed the settlement but not the amount Tuesday. Lawyers for the school and New York-Presbyterian did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "\u201cAs previously announced, Columbia is implementing a multi-pronged plan, including an external investigation, a survivors\u2019 settlement fund, and a series of new and updated patient safety policies and programs to address the abuses of Robert Hadden,\" the university said in statement responding to an Associated Press message specifically asking about the $750 million deal.",
      "\u201cWe deeply regret the pain that his patients suffered, and this settlement is another step forward in our ongoing work and commitment to repair harm and support survivors,\u201d it said. \"We commend the survivors for their bravery in coming forward.\u201d",
      "New York-Presbyterian referred questions about the settlement to Columbia, saying the school employed Hadden.",
      "One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits, Laurie Maldonado, who sued Columbia, New York-Presbyterian, Hadden and others, said her case was not about money.",
      "\u201cIt's about accountability,\u201d she said in a statement provided by DiPietro. \"Columbia University enabled sadistic abuse, and now, they\u2019ve been forced to face the truth. We hope this sends a clear message to every institution: survivors will not be silenced, and those who protect abusers will be held responsible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, like Maldonado has.",
      "Hadden\u2019s accusers also included Evelyn Yang, the wife of former presidential candidate and New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang, who said Hadden abused her when she was pregnant with her first child.",
      "During Hadden's criminal trial, nine victims testified about how Hadden molested them during gynecology treatments, starting in the late 1980s, at prominent hospitals.",
      "Allegations of misconduct during examinations first surfaced in 2012. Hadden was indicted on state charges in 2014 as women kept coming forward. But in 2016, the office of the Manhattan district attorney at the time, Cyrus Vance Jr., allowed Hadden to plead guilty to two low-level felonies and a misdemeanor in a deal that required him to give up his medical license but did not require jail time and kept him out of the state\u2019s sex offender registry.",
      "Some of the women who had gone to state prosecutors were outraged, but their stories did not start receiving public attention until the #MeToo movement began gaining steam in 2017.",
      "Federal prosecutors in Manhattan got a grand jury indictment against Hadden in 2020, charges based on the fact that some patients at his New York offices had come into the city from other states.",
      "In November 2023, Columbia and Columbia University Irving Medical Center announced they would be notifying 6,500 former patients of Hadden of his federal sex crime convictions and giving victims the opportunity to apply for compensation from a $100 million settlement fund. The deadline to apply has been extended to May 15.",

    "story": [
      "Utah dentists say they\u2019re bracing for an increase in tooth decay among the state\u2019s most vulnerable people",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- With Utah's first-in-the-nation ban on fluoride in public drinking water set to take effect Wednesday, dentists who treat children and low-income patients say they're bracing for an increase in tooth decay among the state's most vulnerable people.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed the law against the recommendation of many dentists and national health experts who warn removing fluoride will harm tooth development, especially in young patients without regular access to dental care.",
      "The bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius, said she does not dispute that fluoride can have some benefits but thinks people should not be given it by the government without their informed consent.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. applauded Utah for being the first state to enact a ban and said he plans to direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation nationwide.",
      "Florida could soon become the second state to ban fluoride under a bill awaiting Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 signature. The Ohio and South Carolina legislatures are considering similar measures.",
      "A majority of Utah water systems already did not add fluoride. The state ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents receiving fluoridated water, with about 2 in 5 receiving it in 2022, according to CDC data. The law will impact about 1.6 million people in Salt Lake City and elsewhere in northern Utah who are losing fluoridation, state officials say.",
      "Dentists in Salt Lake City over the past week said many patients were unaware of the upcoming ban, and most did not realize the city had been adding fluoride to their drinking water for nearly two decades.",
      "\u201cI did not know about a ban,\u201d said Noe Figueroa, a patient at Salt Lake Donated Dental Services, a clinic that provides free or heavily discounted dental treatment to low-income residents. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not good. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good at all.\u201d",
      "At Donated Dental, providers expect their monthslong waitlist for children's procedures to grow significantly and their need for volunteer dentists to skyrocket. The effects of the ban in children\u2019s teeth will likely be visible within the next year, said Sasha Harvey, the clinic\u2019s executive director.",
      "\u201cRight now, we\u2019re scheduling into August and September for some 2-, 3-, 4-year-olds that are in so much pain that they can\u2019t eat properly, and there\u2019s nothing we can do but tell parents, \u2018You\u2019re gonna have to wait.\u2019 It\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Harvey said, adding that it's likely to get much worse.",
      "The fluoridation process involves supplementing the low levels of naturally occurring fluoride in most water to reach the 0.7 milligrams per liter recommended by the CDC for cavity prevention. Water treatment plants dump fluoride into the water in liquid or powder form and often use dosing pumps to adjust the levels.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population receives fluoridated drinking water, according to health officials. It was long considered among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Fluoride fortifies teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. It\u2019s especially important to children whose teeth are still developing. For some low-income families, public drinking water containing fluoride may be their only source of preventative dental care.",
      "Some supporters of the Utah law pointed to studies linking high levels of fluoride exposure to illness and low IQ in kids. The National Institutes of Health says it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose from fluoride added to water or toothpaste at standard levels.",
      "The governor said that, like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his children in a community without fluoridated water. Before signing the bill, Cox said there is no difference in health outcomes between communities with and without fluoride \u2014 a statement Utah dentists say is false.",
      "\u201cAny dentist can look in someone\u2019s mouth in Utah and tell exactly where they grew up. Did you grow up in a fluoridated area or a non-fluoridated area? We can tell by the level of decay,\u201d said Dr. James Bekker, a pediatric dentist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.",
      "The law shifts responsibility to individuals, meaning all Utah residents will need to be proactive about their oral health, Harvey said. Most patients at her clinic only come in when a toothache becomes unbearable, and many cannot spare the few dollars a month needed to buy fluoride supplements to add to their drinking water at home.",
      "Figueroa, the free dental clinic patient, said other expenses take priority.",
      "Fluoride toothpaste alone is insufficient for children because it doesn't penetrate the tooth's outer layer, Bekker said. When a person regularly ingests fluoridated water, their saliva bathes the teeth in fluoride throughout the day and makes them stronger.",
      "Bekker said he recommends Utah parents add fluoride supplements to their children\u2019s drinking water. But for families who don\u2019t visit doctors regularly, that may prove difficult.",
      "Fluoride tablets require a prescription from a doctor or dentist. Utah providers are working to make the supplement accessible over the counter, but Bekker said that change may be months or years away.",

      "Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is running for governor in 2026 and sharing new anecdotes in her upcoming political memoir, \u201cThe Purposeful Warrior,\u201d including her experience with miscarriage",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Ahead of a nationally watched bid to become Michigan\u2019s next governor, Democrat Jocelyn Benson is releasing a memoir this month that includes her first public discussion of a miscarriage she had about eight years ago \u2014 an experience she says will shape her commitment to increasing access to reproductive healthcare in the swing state.",
      "Benson, Michigan\u2019s secretary of state, is part of a crowded field seeking to succeed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and she\u2019s the only woman in the running so far.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of Tuesday's release of her political memoir entitled, \u201cThe Purposeful Warrior,\u201d Benson said miscarrying made her value easy access to reproductive health care in an emotional and difficult situation, something she wants to deliver for the state if elected.",
      "\u201cIt opened my eyes to the need to not just protect reproductive freedom and rights, but actually make sure they\u2019re real,\u201d said Benson.",
      "In a chapter entitled \u201cGrit and Grace,\u201d Benson describes finding out she was pregnant shortly after her son\u2019s first birthday and shortly before she launched her bid for secretary of state in 2017. Waves of worry over the timing and elation over becoming a mother of two ensued. But just a day later, she began to miscarry.",
      "She writes about the doctor\u2019s appointment during her eighth week of pregnancy where she learned about her options: surgery, medication or stillbirth and what to expect as her miscarriage continued. By the following morning, she had miscarried on her own.",
      "\u201cThe emotional impact of that stays with you for your whole life,\u201d she told AP.",
      "Benson said she struggled with shame and guilt, emotions she has learned many women experience.",
      "\u201cI want to tell my story to say it\u2019s OK to tell yours as well,\u201d she said.",
      "In the years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, women seeking public office have shared personal stories of miscarriages and abortions. Democrats and Republicans alike have spoken about their pregnancies as reproductive and maternal health care became a central concern for Americans.",
      "In Michigan, voters approved a ballot measure in 2022 to protect abortion access, in an election that also saw Democrats sweep statewide and legislative elections. But Benson said that protection isn\u2019t enough.",
      "Step one is to incentivize talented physicians to work in Michigan, she said. Step two is to bolster reproductive health care in rural Michigan, she said, suggesting mobile clinics that can reach remote areas.",
      "She noted the recent closure of three Planned Parenthood locations in Michigan, including its only location in the Upper Peninsula. Some Planned Parenthood locations provide abortions in addition to services such as birth control, disease screenings and miscarriage management.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Michigan leaders cited financial challenges exacerbated by a freeze of federal dollars for the closures. Federal law already prohibited taxpayer dollars from paying for most abortions.",
      "Centering reproductive rights in the 2026 primary will be another test of the issue\u2019s importance to Democratic voters. Benson will face Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson in the gubernatorial primary. Whitmer, who is term limited, has said she does not plan to endorse in the race.",
      "On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. John James, state Senate Minority Leader Aaric Nesbitt and former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox are vying for the nomination and likely also the endorsement of President Donald Trump.",
      "And the twist \u2014 Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, is pursuing the office as an independent. The move comes as Democrats lost considerable ground in the 2024 election. The state swung back to Trump in the 2024 election and Republicans gained a majority in the state House of Representatives, splitting control of the legislature.",
      "Among anecdotes from her memoir that include her tenure as the state's chief election official during the 2020 election and her law career before, Benson took a swing at Duggan over his handling of the 2018 primary election for governor. She criticized him for not supporting Whitmer early in the race and encouraging other Democrats, who are men, to pursue a run, citing reporting in the New Yorker years later.",
      "\u201cI will never forget the message those efforts sent to women across our state,\u201d Benson wrote. She noted that her own primary campaign became tied to Whitmer\u2019s by gender.",
      "\u201cThe argument went something like, surely we can\u2019t have more than one woman on the ticket at the same time,\u201d Benson wrote.",
      "Benson\u2019s memoir comments on Duggan were first reported by the Detroit News. A spokesperson for Duggan\u2019s campaign told the publication that the Detroit mayor endorsed Whitmer in the Democratic primary over two men.",

      "Attorneys general in 19 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging cuts to the U.S. Health and Human Services agency, saying the Trump administration's massive restructuring has destroyed life-saving programs and left states to pick up the bill for mounting health crises.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Rhode Island on Monday, New York Attorney General Letitia James said. The attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia signed onto the complaint.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. restructured the agency in March, eliminating more than 10,000 employees and collapsing 28 agencies under the sprawling HHS umbrella into 15, the attorneys general said. An additional 10,000 employees had already been let go by President Donald Trump's administration, according to the lawsuit, and combined the cuts stripped 25% of the HHS workforce.",
      "\u201cIn its first three months, Secretary Kennedy and this administration deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job,\u201d the attorneys general wrote.",
      "Kennedy has said he is seeking to streamline the nation's public health agencies and reduce redundancies across them with the layoffs. The cuts were made as part of a directive the administration has dubbed, \u201c Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "HHS is one of the government's costliest federal agencies, with an annual budget of about $1.7 trillion that is mostly spent on health care coverage for millions of people enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "James, who is leading the lawsuit, called the restructuring a \u201csweeping and unlawful assault\u201d that would endanger lives.",
      "\u201cThis is not government reform. This is not efficiency,\u201d James said during a press conference Monday.",
      "The cuts have resulted in laboratories having limited testing for some infectious diseases, the federal government not tracking cancer risks among U.S. firefighters, early childhood learning programs left unsure of future funds and programs aimed at monitoring cancer and maternal health closing, the attorneys general say. Cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also have hampered states' ability to respond to one of the largest measles outbreaks in recent years, the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cThis chaos and abandonment of the Department\u2019s core functions was not an unintended side effect, but rather the intended result,\u201d of the \u201cMAHA Directive,\u201d they said. They want a judge to vacate the directive because they say the administration can't unilaterally eliminate programs and funding that have been created by Congress.",
      "The restructuring eliminated the entire team of people who maintain the federal poverty guidelines used by states to determine whether residents are eligible for Medicaid, nutrition assistance and other programs. A tobacco prevention agency was gutted. Staff losses also were significant at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
      "The Trump administration is already facing other legal challenges over cuts to public health agencies and research organizations.

      "More than a dozen data-gathering programs that track deaths and disease appear to have been eliminated in the tornado of layoffs and proposed budget cuts rolled out in the Trump administration's first 100 days.",
      "The Associated Press examined draft and final budget proposals and spoke to more than a dozen current and former federal employees to determine the scope of the cuts to programs tracking basic facts about Americans' health.",
      "Among those terminated at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were experts tracking abortions, pregnancies, job-related injuries, lead poisonings, sexual violence and youth smoking, the AP found.",
      "\"If you don\u2019t have staff, the program is gone,\u201d said Patrick Breysse, who used to oversee the CDC\u2019s environmental health programs.",
      "Federal officials have not given a public accounting of specific surveillance programs that are being eliminated.",
      "Instead, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman pointed the AP to a Trump administration budget proposal released Friday. It lacked specifics, but proposes to cut the CDC's core budget by more than half and vows to focus CDC surveillance only on emerging and infectious diseases.",
      "Kennedy has said some of the CDC's other work will be moved to a yet-to-be-created agency, the Administration for a Healthy America. He also has said that the cuts are designed to get rid of waste at a department that has seen its budget grow in recent years.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, this extra spending and staff has not improved our nation\u2019s health as a country,\" Kennedy wrote last month in The New York Post. \"Instead, it has only created more waste, administrative bloat and duplication.\"",
      "Yet some health experts say the eliminated programs are not duplicative, and erasing them will leave Americans in the dark.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. is interested in making itself healthier again, how is it going to know, if it cancels the programs that helps us understand these diseases?\u201d said Graham Mooney, a Johns Hopkins University public health historian.",
      "The core of the nation\u2019s health surveillance is done by the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. Relying on birth and death certificates, it generates information on birth rates, death trends and life expectancy. It also operates longstanding health surveys that provide basic data on obesity, asthma and other health issues.",
      "The center has been barely touched in layoffs, and seems intact under current budget plans.",
      "But many other efforts were targeted by the cuts, the AP found. Some examples:",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, which surveys women across the country, lost its entire staff \u2014 about 20 people.",
      "It\u2019s the most comprehensive collection of data on the health behaviors and outcomes before, during and after childbirth. Researchers have been using its data to investigate the nation's maternal mortality problem.",
      "Recent layoffs also wiped out the staffs collecting data on in vitro fertilizations and abortions.",
      "Those cuts are especially surprising given that President Donald Trump said he wants to expand IVF access and that the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 playbook for his administration called for more abortion surveillance.",
      "The CDC eliminated its program on lead poisoning in children, which helped local health departments \u2014 through funding and expertise \u2014 investigate lead poisoning clusters and find where risk is greatest.",
      "Lead poisoning in kids typically stems from exposure to bits of old paint, contaminated dust or drinking water that passes through lead pipes. But the program's staff also played an important role in the investigation of lead-tainted applesauce that affected 500 kids.",
      "Last year, Milwaukee health officials became aware that peeling paint in aging local elementary schools was endangering kids. The city health department began working with CDC to test tens of thousands of students. That assistance stopped last month when the CDC\u2019s lead program staff was terminated.",
      "City officials are particularly concerned about losing expertise to help them track the long-term effects.",
      "\"We don't know what we don't know,\" said Mike Totoraitis, the city\u2019s health commissioner.",
      "Also gone is the staff for the 23-year-old Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, which had information on concerns including possible cancer clusters and weather-related illnesses.",
      "\u201cThe loss of that program is going to greatly diminish the ability to make linkages between what might be in the environment and what health might be affected by that,\u201d Breysse said.",
      "In some cases, it\u2019s not a matter of staffers leaving, but rather the end of specific types of data collection.",
      "Transgender status is no longer being recorded in health-tracking systems, including ones focused on violent deaths and on risky behaviors by kids.",
      "Experts know transgender people are more likely to be victims of violence, but now \u201cit\u2019s going to be much more challenging to quantify the extent to which they are at higher risk,\u201d said Thomas Simon, the recently retired senior director for scientific programs at the CDC's Division of Violence Prevention.",
      "The staff and funding seems to have remained intact for a CDC data collection that provides insights into homicides, suicides and accidental deaths involving weapons.",
      "But CDC violence-prevention programs that acted on that information were halted. So, too, was work on a system that collects hospital data on nonfatal injuries from causes such as shootings, crashes and drownings.",
      "Also going away, apparently, is the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. The system is designed to pick up information that's not found in law enforcement statistics. Health officials see that work as important, because not all sexual violence victims go to police.",
      "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which tracks job-related illnesses and deaths and makes recommendations on how to prevent them, was gutted by the cuts.",
      "Kennedy has said that 20% of the people laid off might be reinstated as the agency tries to correct mistakes.",
      "That appeared to happen last month, when the American Federation of Government Employees said that NIOSH workers involved in a black lung disease program for coal miners had been temporarily called back.",
      "But HHS officials did not answer questions about the reinstatement. The AFGE's Micah Niemeier-Walsh later said the workers continued to have June termination dates and \u201cwe are concerned this is to give the appearance that the programs are still functioning, when effectively they are not.\u201d",
      "There's been no talk of salvaging some other NIOSH programs, including one focused on workplace deaths in the oil and gas industries or a research project into how common hearing loss is in that industry.",
      "The HHS cuts eliminated the 17-member team responsible for the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, one of the main ways the government measures drug use.",
      "Also axed were the CDC staff working on the National Youth Tobacco Survey.",
      "There are other surveys that look at youth smoking and drug use, including the University of Michigan's federally funded \u201cMonitoring the Future\u201d survey of schoolkids.",
      "But the federal studies looked at both adults and adolescents, and provided insights into drug use by high school dropouts. The CDC also delved into specific vaping and tobacco products in the ways that other surveys don't, and was a driver in the federal push to better regulate electronic cigarettes.",
      "\"There was overlap among the surveys, but each one had its own specific focus that the other ones didn\u2019t cover,\u201c said Richard Miech, who leads the Michigan study.",
      "Work to modernize data collection has been derailed. That includes an upgrade to a 22-year-old system that helps local public health departments track diseases and allows CDC to put together a national picture.",
      "Another casualty was the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which tries to predict disease trends.",
      "The center, created during the COVID-19 pandemic, was working on forecasting the current multi-state measles outbreak. That forecast hasn't been published partly because of the layoffs, according to two CDC officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss it and fear retribution for speaking to the press.",
      "Trump hasn't always supported widespread testing of health problems.",
      "In the spring of 2020, when COVID-19 diagnoses were exploding, the president groused that the nation\u2019s ability to do more testing was making the U.S. look like it had a worse problem than other countries. He called testing \u201ca double-edged sword.\u201d",
      "Mooney, the Johns Hopkins historian, wonders how interested the new administration is in reporting on health problems.",
      "\u201cYou could think it\u2019s deliberate,\" he said. \u201cIf you keep people from knowing, they\u2019re less likely to be concerned.\u201d",

      "It was an unusual study about trust, vaccines in a historically Black community.",
      "WASHINGTON -- Some Denver parents got texts during this winter\u2019s brutal flu season with videos sharing why people in their neighborhoods chose flu shots for their kids, an unusual study about trust and vaccines in a historically Black community.",
      "But no one will know how it worked out: The Trump administration canceled the project before the data could be analyzed -- and researchers aren\u2019t the only ones upset.",
      "\u201cFor someone like me, from the Black community who income-wise is on the lower end, we don\u2019t often have a voice,\u201d said Denver mom Chantyl Busby, one of the study\u2019s community advisers. \u201cHaving this funding taken away from this project sends a horrible, horrible message. It\u2019s almost like telling us all over again that our opinions don\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "How to talk about vaccines with parents \u2013 or anyone \u2013 is taking on new urgency: At least 216 U.S. children died of flu this season, the worst pediatric toll in 15 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unvaccinated children are fueling one of the country's largest measles outbreaks in decades, and another vaccine-preventable disease \u2014 whooping cough \u2014 is soaring, too.",
      "At the same time Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. questions vaccines long proven to be safe and effective. Moves by the Trump administration are making it increasingly uncertain that COVID-19 vaccines will be available this fall. And the administration has slashed funding for public health and medical research, including abruptly stopping studies of vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand what it is that is creating this challenge to vaccines and why,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy and worries the country is entering \u201cscientific dark ages.\"",
      "At Denver Health, Dr. Joshua Williams is a pediatrician who every day has vaccine conversations with confused or worried parents. Some even ask if they\u2019ll get kicked out of his practice for refusing immunizations.",
      "Nope, Williams says: Building trust takes time.",
      "\u201cThe most satisfying vaccine-related encounters I have are the ones in families who had significant concerns for a long time, came to trust me over the years as I cared for broken arms and ear infections \u2013 and ultimately vaccinated their child,\u201d he said.",
      "But in the TikTok age, Williams wondered if digital storytelling \u2013 seeing and hearing what led other families to choose vaccination \u2013 might help those decisions. He chose flu shots as the test case \u2014 just under half of U.S. children got one this season. And Black children are among those most at risk of getting seriously ill from influenza.",
      "With a grant from the National Institutes of Health, Williams partnered with Denver\u2019s nonprofit Center for African American Health to host workshops bringing volunteers together to discuss how influenza and the flu vaccine had impacted their lives. Professionals helped those who wanted to go the extra step turn them into 2- to 3-minute polished videos.",
      "After two years of community engagement, five of those videos were part of the pilot study sending text messages to 200 families who get care at two Denver Health clinics.",
      "In one video, a mother described getting her first flu vaccination along with her young daughter, making her own health decisions after leaving a controlling relationship.",
      "In another, a grandmother explained how she\u2019ll never again miss a vaccine appointment after her grandson spent his 4th birthday hospitalized with the flu.",
      "Seeing \u201cpeople that they look like, that they sound like, who have experiences they\u2019ve been through that can go, \u2018Hey, I felt like you felt but this changed my life,\u2019\u201d is powerful, said Busby, who OK'd her kids' flu vaccinations after questioning Williams during multiple family checkups.",
      "The study's sudden cancellation means Williams can\u2019t assess if the texted videos influenced families' vaccine decisions \u2013 lost data from more than two years of work and already-spent NIH dollars. It also jeopardizes the researchers' careers. While considering next steps, Williams has asked permission of community members to use some of the videos in his own practice as he discusses vaccination.",
      "Williams gets personal, too, telling families that his kids are vaccinated and how his 95-year-old grandmother reminisces about the terror of polio during her own childhood before those vaccinations were developed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost the collective memory about what it\u2019s like to have these diseases in our community,\u201d Williams said, ruefully noting the ongoing measles outbreak. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to take a collective voice from the community saying this is important, to remind those in power that we need to be allocating resources to infection prevention and vaccine hesitancy research.\u201d",

      "It's startling that the number already is this high, given that the flu season is still going on. The final pediatric death tally for the 2023-2024 flu season wasn't counted until autumn.",
      "\u201cThis number that we have now is almost certainly an undercount, and one that \u2014 when the season is declared over, and they compile all the data \u2014 it's almost certain to go up,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "There are likely several contributors to this season's severity, but a big one is that fewer children get flu shots, added O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.",
      "The flu vaccination rate for U.S. children has plummeted from about 64% five years ago to 49% this season.",
      "Flu vaccinations may not prevent people from coming down with symptoms, but research shows they are highly effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths, O'Leary said, adding that the decline in vaccinations \u201cis certainly playing a role\" in this season's loss of life.",
      "The season has not only been hard on children. CDC officials have described it as \u201c highly severe,\u201d and estimate that so far there have been at least 47 million illnesses, 610,000 hospitalizations and 26,000 deaths this season.",

    "summary": "Kentucky is reporting a 30.2% drop in drug overdose deaths in 2024",
    "story": [
      "Kentucky is reporting a 30.2% drop in drug overdose deaths in 2024",
      "The number of overdose deaths in Kentucky last year dropped by 30.2% \u2014 down to 1,410 lives lost \u2014 giving state leaders a surge of confidence that prevention and treatment efforts are making progress against an addiction epidemic they say is shattering families across the state.",
      "This was the third straight yearly decrease in drug overdose deaths for the state, although prior declines were substantially smaller. Kentucky has long been plagued by high rates of addiction to opioid painkillers, and fatal overdoses surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when treatment was hard to get and people were socially isolated.",
      "Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who announced the latest overdose statistics on Thursday, called the results a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d reflecting years of painstaking work to combat the spread and use of drugs.",
      "\u201cThis is what we have been hoping for and praying for,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here ought to give everyone who\u2019s worked so hard to get to this point ... hope that we can do even more.\"",
      "State Attorney General Russell Coleman, a Republican, said Kentuckians should \u201crejoice in every life saved from this scourge,\u201d but warned that powerful illicit drugs like fentanyl continue to pose a threat.",
      "\"As little as one pill can and is killing our sons and daughters,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "Fentanyl and methamphetamine continued to be the most prevalent drugs contributing to overdose deaths in Kentucky.",
      "Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has steered huge sums of federal funding to his home state to combat its addiction woes, said he was encouraged by the gains in combating the drug crisis, from stemming the flow of illicit drugs to offering treatment services in communities.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always worked to keep Kentucky at the forefront of our national response to the drug crisis,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \"We are finally making progress in restoring the Southern Border, but there\u2019s still a lot of work left to do in the commonwealth to help those struggling with addiction.\u201d",
      "Kentucky's drop reflected broader gains achieved in the U.S. There were about 97,000 U.S. overdose deaths in the 12 months that ended last June 30, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was down 14% from the estimated 113,000 for the prior 12-month period.",
      "Overdose death rates nationwide began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and more recently fentanyl.",
      "Beshear, seen as a potential candidate for the White House in 2028, said plenty of groups were deserving of credit for Kentucky's big decline in overdose deaths. He praised law enforcement efforts to remove dangerous drugs from circulation and the work of addiction treatment centers and other recovery services. And he credited those Kentuckians battling addiction who reached out for help.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s your first, fifth or 10th attempt, we want to stand behind you,\" the governor said. \"We want to provide you the best help that we can.\u201d",
      "Other factors, he said, include the distribution of Narcan, which can reverse overdoses of opioids, as well as the availability of addiction services through Medicaid and the work of syringe exchange programs.",
      "\u201cRegardless of what the politics say, syringe exchange programs work,\" Beshear said. \"They help us get to know people and they help us to save lives.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Coleman has rolled out a youth-focused initiative aimed at keeping young people away from deadly substances.",
      "With all those efforts, the challenge now is to continue driving down fatal overdoses, Beshear said.",
      "\u201cIt ought to tell us that an epidemic that arose in our time, we should be able to defeat in our time,\u201d the governor said.",

    "story": [
      "Brazil\u2019s Amazon state of Rondonia has passed a law in favor of cattle ranchers who converted a large area of rainforest inside the Jaci-Parana conservation zone and turned it into pasture",
      "SAO PAULO, Brazil -- With little fanfare and virtually no publicity, lawmakers in the Brazilian state of Rondonia have passed legislation in favor of hundreds of cattle ranchers who had illegally converted swathes of Amazon rainforest into pasture land.",
      "The new legislation, which was passed April 28 and took effect immediately, also grants amnesty to slaughterhouses that purchased cattle illegally raised inside what had been the Jaci-Parana conservation area, which the new law effectively dissolves.",
      "\u201cAll fines, notices of violation and other administrative penalties tied to the occupation and use of the area are automatically voided and carry no legal or financial consequences,\u201d declared the law.",
      "One of the beneficiaries of the amnesty is likely to be JBS SA, the world\u2019s largest meatpacker, which is poised to start selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange in June. According to a 2023 audit by Brazil\u00b4s Federal Prosecution Service, 12% of cattle purchased by JBS in Rondonia came from illegally deforested areas.",
      "In exchange for the amnesty, cattle ranchers must join Rondonia's environmental regularization program, which requires them to halt deforestation and submit a plan to reforest part of the area. The law does not give them the public land, but allows it to be used under concession for 30 years. They will also be allowed to sell cattle, despite a law forbidding commercial cattle in Brazil's protected areas. Around 216,000 head graze on pasture there, according to the state animal division.",
      "\u201cThe law is an affront. If it\u2019s not declared unconstitutional, it will pose one of the greatest threats to the protection of all conservation areas facing land invasions,\u201d said Wellington Lamburgini, a coordinator with the local chapter of the Pastoral Land Commission, a nonprofit affiliated with the Catholic Church. \u201cIt sends the message that this crime is tolerated and will eventually be legalized.\u201d",
      "State lawmaker Lu\u00eds do Hospital, who sponsored the bill, Alex Redano, president of the state parliament, and JBS all declined to comment.",
      "The expectation that illegally used land will become sanctioned has been the main driver of deforestation in the Amazon.",
      "Land-grabbers clear land in hopes it will eventually be legalized due to lax land laws or government amnesties. In most cases, the forest is cleared for pasture to show economic activity.",
      "In recent years, Rondonia\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office, state prosecutor\u2019s office and environmental agency have fined and prosecuted hundreds of cattle ranchers and four slaughterhouses for causing damage inside the Jaci-Parana conservation area, where large-scale cattle raising is forbidden.",
      "Fines and pending legal settlements total $280 million \u2014 a fraction of the more than $1 billion in damages estimated by Rondonia state. Many of the 778 identified land invaders have never been prosecuted. While several have been convicted, most have escaped punishment due to legal loopholes.",
      "The state prosecutor's office told The Associated Press it is considering appealing the new law.",
      "The attorney general's office declined to comment.",
      "In December 2023, the state's attorney sued JBS and three other slaughterhouses for buying cattle raised in Jaci-Parana. Months later, two of the slaughterhouses \u2014 Distriboi and Frigon \u2014 were ordered, along with three cattle ranchers, to pay $764,000 for causing environmental damage. Neither company responded to requests for comment.",
      "JBS is facing three lawsuits pending trial. In one of them, the company argued that it has an environmental monitoring program that has blocked over 20,000 farms in Rondonia alone, according to the company\u2019s defense included in the court filings. It also states that the lawsuit is based on purchasing only 73 heads of cattle, representing 0.0006% of the company\u00b4s purchases in the state.",
      "According to the company, the transaction, which took place 12 years ago, involved fraud from the cattle rancher, as he used geographic coordinates outside the Jaci-Parana reserve to make the sale appear legal. The producer has since been blocked from further sales.",
      "\u201cThe mere existence of this lawsuit \u2014 even if ultimately unsuccessful \u2014 could cause immeasurable harm to JBS and, by extension, to Brazil\u2019s economy, to which the company contributes significantly, accounting for roughly 2.1% of the national GDP,\" the company said in court filings.",
      "In a statement to AP, the meatpacker said that starting Jan. 1, 2026, it will only buy cattle from producers enrolled in its Transparent Livestock Platform, which allows ranchers to register information about their own suppliers, who will also be subject to JBS\u2019s socio-environmental compliance criteria.",
      "Last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the listing of JBS on the New York Stock Exchange despite strong opposition from environmental groups.",

It aims to transmit solar and wind-generated power developed specifically for the project in Egypt, with private sector involvement led by Greece\u2019s Copelouzos Group.",
      "El-Sissi highlighted the project\u2019s strategic importance. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a bilateral matter \u2013 it\u2019s a strategic regional project, as it creates a direct link that will extend to Europe via Greece,\u201d he said. \u201cWe count on the European Union\u2019s support for this major initiative.\u201d",
      "The EU has expressed strong interest in expanding energy partnerships with non-member countries to diversify its energy sources and reduce its historic dependence on Russian energy following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",

      "These are the need-to-know terms \u2014 some of them in Latin \u2014 to help make sense of news in the coming days:",
      "There are 252 cardinals worldwide, and as a body, they are in charge of the Holy See\u2019s affairs between popes, albeit with limits. Of them, 135 are \u201ccardinal electors,\u201d who gather in the Vatican to choose the new pope. Only 133 are participating in this conclave because two are sick. For centuries, they have chosen one of their own. The vast majority of the electors \u2014 108 \u2014 were made cardinals by Pope Francis, according to Vatican statistics.",
      "This is the closed-door meeting of the cardinal electors to choose the new pope in the Sistine Chapel. Its name, literally \"with a key,\u201d was used in the 13th century to describe the process of locking up the cardinals until the election is completed. It must begin no more than 20 days after the death or resignation of a pope. The electors are sequestered from all outsiders for the duration. The last three popes were chosen within days.",
      "The current dean is Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re. He is the head of the College of Cardinals who informs the rest of the cardinals and the ambassadors to the Holy See of the pope\u2019s death once he learns of it from the camerlengo. He convenes the conclave and presides as the electors take their oaths. Since Re is 91, he cannot vote, so he will leave the Sistine Chapel once the conclave begins and the most senior cardinal, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, takes over.",
      "The 16th century church, built over the traditional tomb of the apostle St. Peter, is one of the largest Catholic basilicas in the world and is the centerpiece of Vatican City, headquarters of the 1.4 billion-strong Catholic Church. The Renaissance masterpiece was built and decorated by some of the most illustrious architects and artists of the time. Its grottoes contain the remains of popes, and its vast, marbled interior is home to some of the Vatican\u2019s greatest treasures, including Michelangelo\u2019s Pieta sculpture and Gian Lorenzo Bernini\u2019s bronze baldacchino canopy over the main altar.",
      "This Vatican guesthouse, built in 1996, specifically houses cardinals during a conclave and is used at other times as a hotel for visiting priests and Vatican officials. Pope Francis never moved out after he was elected, choosing to live in suite 201 rather than the papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace. Because there are so many electors this time and not enough room in the main building, some are being housed in an adjacent residence.",
      "A Latin phrase for \u201call out,\u201d it's spoken by the master for papal liturgical celebrations, currently Italian Archbishop Diego Ravelli, to ask all those present except the cardinal electors to leave the Sistine Chapel to begin the voting process during the conclave.",

He then says the new pope's birth name and the name he has chosen to use as pope, also in Latin. The current protodeacon is French Cardinal Dominique Mamberti.",

      "These are the three cardinals, chosen by a random drawing from the electors, who are charged with reviewing the ballots during the conclave.",
      "These are the three cardinals, chosen by a random drawing from the electors, who are charged with reviewing each ballot and announcing it to the assembled conclave after each round of voting. They then tally the votes \u2014 to win the election, two-thirds of the votes are necessary \u2014 and they burn the ballots.",
      "This is Latin for \u201cvacant seat,\u201d the period between the pope\u2019s death or resignation and the election of a new one.",
      "This Latin phrase means \u201cthe Lord\u2019s whole flock.\u201d It\u2019s the Vatican constitution that regulates the processes from a pope\u2019s death until a new one is elected. St. John Paul II issued it in 1996 during his papacy, and Pope Benedict XVI twice amended it, most significantly by removing John Paul's provision that after about 12 days of balloting a simple majority could elect a new pope rather than a two-thirds majority. If the conclave lasts that long, the top two vote-getters go to a runoff, with a two-thirds majority required to win. Neither of the top two candidates casts a ballot in the runoff.",
      "After sessions of voting in the Sistine Chapel, the ballots are burned in a special furnace to indicate the outcome to the outside world. If no pope is chosen, the ballots are mixed with cartridges containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene (a component of coal tar), and sulfur to produce black smoke. If there is a winner, the burning ballots are mixed with potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin to produce the white smoke. Bells usually are rung to further signal there is a new pope.",

      "\u201cThe Czech government did not think of (EDF\u2019s claims) as a major problem and invited us for the scheduled,\u201d signing ceremony, Ahn said. \u201cIt seems that the Czech government\u2019s judgement did not align with the court\u2019s ruling.\u201d",
      "Lee Ju-Ho, South Korea's acting president, said that Seoul would communicate closely with the Czech side to ensure that the deal is finalized quickly.",
      "In July, CEZ selected KHNP over EDF as the preferred bidder to build two 1,000-megawatt nuclear reactors at the Dukovany plant. EDF filed a court complaint last week after the Czech Republic\u2019s competition regulator rejected its appeal over the bidding process.",
      "Before he was ousted last month over an ill-fated martial law imposition in December, former conservative South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol had pledged to boost the country\u2019s nuclear power exports, arguing that they had suffered under the previous liberal government\u2019s push to reduce domestic reliance on nuclear energy. Yoon\u2019s government had set a goal of exporting 10 nuclear power reactors by 2030.",

      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Two Belgian teenagers found with 5,000 ants in Kenya were given a choice of paying a fine of $7,700 or serving 12 months in prison \u2014 the maximum penalty for the offense \u2014 for violating wildlife conservation laws.",
      "Authorities said the ants were destined for European and Asian markets in an emerging trend of trafficking lesser-known wildlife species.",
      "Belgian nationals Lornoy David and Seppe Lodewijckx, both 19 years old, were arrested on April 5 with 5,000 ants at a guest house in Nakuru county, which is home to various national parks. They were charged on April 15.",
      "Magistrate Njeri Thuku, sitting at the court in Kenya\u2019s main airport on Wednesday, said in her ruling that despite the teenagers telling the court they were na\u00efve and collecting the ants as a hobby, the particular species of ants they collected is valuable and they had thousands of them \u2014 not just a few.",
      "The Kenya Wildlife Service had said the teenagers were involved in trafficking the ants to markets in Europe and Asia, and that the species included messor cephalotes, a distinctive, large and red-colored harvester ant native to East Africa.",
      "\u201cThis is beyond a hobby. Indeed, there is a biting shortage of messor cepholates online,\u201d Thuku said in her ruling.",
      "The illegal export of the ants \u201cnot only undermines Kenya\u2019s sovereign rights over its biodiversity but also deprives local communities and research institutions of potential ecological and economic benefits,\u201d KWS said in a statement.",
      "In a separate but related case, two other men charged after they were found with 400 ants were also fined $7,700 each with an option of serving 12 months in prison.",
      "Duh Hung Nguyen, a Vietnamese national, told the court that he was sent to pick up the ants and arrived at Kenya's main airport where he met his contact person, Dennis Ng'ang'a, and together they travelled to meet the locals who sell the ants.",
      "Ng'ang'a, who is from Kenya, had said he didn't know it was illegal because ants are sold and eaten locally.",
      "Magistrate Thuku during the ruling described Ng'ang'a and Nguyen's meet-up as \u201cpart of an elaborate scheme.\u201d",
      "Experts in Kenya have in recent days warned of an emerging trend to traffic lesser-known wildlife species.",
      "Entomologist Shadrack Muya, a senior lecturer at Kenya's Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, told The Associated Press that garden ants are important for aerating soils, enhancing soil fertility and dispersing seeds.",
      "\u201cAnts play a very important role in the environment and their disturbance, which is also their removal, will lead to disruption of the ecosystem,\u201d he said.",
      "Muya warned against taking ants from their natural habitats, saying they were unlikely to survive if not supported to adapt to their new environment.",
      "\u201cSurvival in the new environment will depend on the interventions that are likely to take place. Where it has been taken away from, there is a likelihood of an ecological disaster that may happen due to that disturbance,\u201d he said.",

      "BERLIN -- Friedrich Merz made his world-affairs debut Wednesday as Germany\u2019s new chancellor, with plans to immediately team up with allies France and Poland to present a united European front on support for Ukraine and against U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war.",
      "The new pairing of Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 both firm believers in the European Union \u2014 could help stiffen resistance from the 27-nation bloc against pressure from Trump and against Russia\u2019s ongoing war in Ukraine.",
      "With the EU\u2019s largest economies and populations, the tandem of Germany and France has long underpinned the 27-nation bloc, but lost some of its vigor in recent months as leaders in both countries wrestled with domestic issues.",
      "Merz and Macron are hoping to give the relationship fresh impetus at a crucial time, with Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin both exerting pressure on the EU, forcing it to rethink its own security.",
      "Merz's trips come the day after his historic defeat in the first round of voting in the German parliament. No other postwar candidate for German chancellor has failed to win on the first ballot. He won in the second round.",
      "Traditionally, newly elected German chancellors make a point of visiting their big neighbors in the west and east on the first day in office to stress European unity. French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said this week that Merz and Macron want their meeting to refire what he described as \u201cthe French-German motor.\u201d",
      "The French minister said that he expects the relationship between Paris and Berlin will be simpler under Merz than it was under his predecessor. In particular, France is looking for German backing for increased EU defense spending in the face of the perceived threat to European security by Russia and concerns that Trump is pivoting away from its post-World War II trans-Atlantic relationship with Europe to focus resources on countering China.",
      "Merz is expected to hold news conferences on Wednesday with Macron and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.",
      "Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer have separately hosted summits of European leaders to discuss Ukraine and European security in the wake of Trump's moves to cut out the continent on Russia-Ukraine negotiations.",

Macron\u2019s meeting with his third German chancellor as France\u2019s president will be particularly loaded with symbolism for the two countries that were bitter enemies in World War I and II.",
      "The first war ended with an armistice agreement signed in a railway car north of Paris. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler then used the same railway car in accepting France\u2019s capitulation in 1940, after its defenses succumbed to the German invasion.",

      "An F/A-18 fighter jet landing on the USS Harry S",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- An F/A-18 fighter jet landing on the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea went overboard, forcing its two pilots to eject, a defense official told The Associated Press on Wednesday.",
      "The incident Tuesday marks the latest mishap to mar the deployment of the Truman, which has been essential in the airstrike campaign by the United States against Yemen's Houthi rebels.",
      "On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump and Oman's foreign minister both said that a ceasefire had been reached with the Houthis, who would no longer target ships in the Red Sea corridor \u2014 something not immediately acknowledged by the rebels.",
      "Meanwhile, the Houthis continue to assess the damage after daytime Israeli airstrikes targeted Yemen's rebel-held capital of Sanaa.",
      "The F/A-18 Super Hornet landed on the Truman after a flight, but \u201cthe arrestment failed,\u201d said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about the incident now under investigation.",
      "\"Arrestment\" refers to the hook system used by aircraft landing on carriers, which catches steel wire ropes on the flight deck. It remains unclear what part of the system failed.",
      "The two pilots on board were later rescued by a helicopter and suffered minor injuries in the incident, the official added. No one on the flight deck was hurt.",
      "CNN first reported on the incident.",
      "Tuesday's incident was the latest to see the Navy lose an F/A-18, which cost about $60 million. In April, another F/A-18 fighter jet slipped off the hangar deck of the Truman and fell into the Red Sea. The crew members who were in the pilot seat of the Super Hornet and on the small towing tractor both jumped away.",
      "In December, the guided-missile cruiser USS Gettysburg mistakenly shot down an F/A-18 after ships earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Both aviators in that incident also survived.",
      "And in February, the Truman collided with a merchant vessel near Port Said, Egypt.",
      "The Truman, based out of Norfolk, Virginia, has seen its deployment extended multiple times amid the Houthi airstrike campaign. It had been joined recently by the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier operating out of the Arabian Sea.",
      "Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell wrote on the social platform X that an investigation was underway and that \u201cthis aircraft was not struck by the Houthis.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group remains fully mission-capable,\u201d he added.",
      "The Israeli attack on Tuesday that targeted Sanaa International Airport devastated the airfield. Khaled al-Shaif, the head of the airport, told the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel that the Israeli strike destroyed the airport's terminal and left craters in its runway.",
      "At least six passenger planes were struck, including three belonging to Yemenia Airways, the country's flag-carrying airline, he said. That leaves the airline with only one functional aircraft, which was spared only because it had left earlier in the day on a flight to Amman, Jordan. He put overall damage there at $500 million.",
      "With the damage, the airport was now out of service, al-Shaif said.",
      "The Houthis had been waging persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group\u2019s leadership has described as an effort to end Israel\u2019s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "From November 2023 until January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.",
      "The Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March.",

      "The sight of a large, carnivorous New Zealand snail laying an egg from its neck has been captured on camera for the first time",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- The strange reproductive habits of a large, carnivorous New Zealand snail were once shrouded in mystery. Now footage of the snail laying an egg from its neck has been captured for the first time, the country\u2019s conservation agency said Wednesday.",
      "What looks like a tiny hen\u2019s egg is seen emerging from an opening below the head of the Powelliphanta augusta snail, a threatened species endemic to New Zealand.",
      "The video was taken at a facility on the South Island\u2019s West Coast, where conservation rangers attempting to save the species from extinction have cared for a population of the snails in chilled containers for nearly two decades.",
      "The conditions in the containers mimic the alpine weather in their only former habitat \u2014 a remote mountain they were named for, on the West Coast of the South Island, that has been engulfed by mining.",
      "Lisa Flanagan from the Department of Conservation, who has worked with the creatures for 12 years, said the species still holds surprises.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that in all the time we\u2019ve spent caring for the snails, this is the first time we\u2019ve seen one lay an egg,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Like other snails, Powelliphanta augusta are hermaphrodites, which explains how the creatures can reproduce when encased in a hard shell. The invertebrate uses a genital pore on the right side of its body, just below the head, to simultaneously exchange sperm with another snail, which is stored until each creates an egg.",
      "Each snail takes eight years to reach sexual maturity, after which it lays about five eggs a year. The egg can take more than a year to hatch.",
      "\u201cSome of our captive snails are between 25 and 30 years old,\u201d said Flanagan. \u201cThey\u2019re polar opposites to the pest garden snail we introduced to New Zealand, which is like a weed, with thousands of offspring each year and a short life.\u201d",
      "The dozens of species and subspecies of Powelliphanta snails are only found in New Zealand, mostly in rugged forest and grassland settings where they are threatened by habitat loss.",
      "They are carnivores that slurp up earthworms like noodles, and are some of the world\u2019s largest snails , with oversized, distinctive shells in a range of rich earth colors and swirling patterns.",
      "The Powelliphanta augusta was the center of public uproar and legal proceedings in the early 2000s, when an energy company\u2019s plans to mine for coal threatened to destroy the snails\u2019 habitat.",
      "Some 4,000 were removed from the site and relocated, while 2,000 more were housed in chilled storage in the West Coast town of Hokitika to ensure the preservation of the species, which is slow to breed and doesn't adapt well to new habitats.",
      "In 2011, some 800 of the snails accidentally died in a Department of Conservation refrigerator with faulty temperature control.",
      "But the species\u2019 slow survival continues: In March this year, there were nearly 1,900 snails and nearly 2,200 eggs in captivity, the conservation agency said.",

      "Mexico City lawmakers recently voted to ban violent bullfighting in the country\u2019s capital",
      "AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico -- Mexican matador Diego Silveti performs a ritual ahead of each bullfight.",
      "In each hotel room where he dresses in the garment that may bring him glory or death, he sets up an altar where he leaves his wedding band and prays before heading to the arena.",
      "\u201cBy leaving my ring behind, I\u2019m telling God: Here\u2019s everything I am as a father, a husband, a son and a brother,\u201d Silveti said. \u201cI commit to what I was born to be \u2014 a bullfighter.\u201d",
      "He last encountered a bull in late April in Aguascalientes, a state in central Mexico where bullfighting is considered a cultural heritage. Weeks before, though, Mexico City lawmakers banned violent bullfighting in the nation\u2019s capital.",
      "While matadors there are still allowed to fight bulls, piercing their muscles with laces or running a sword through their body is prohibited under that ban.",
      "Animal rights advocates celebrated the ruling and Environment Secretary Julia \u00c1lvarez said the lawmakers made history. But matadors like Silveti, as well as fans and cattle breeders, contend this long-time Spanish tradition bears a profound significance that would be undermined if bulls can't be killed in the arena.",
      "\u201cWhat they propose goes against the essence and the rituals of bullfighting,\u201d Silveti said. \u201cIt\u2019s a veiled prohibition that opposes the ways in which it has been done since its origins.\u201d",
      "The European conquerors of Mesoamerican territories in the 16th century brought along Catholicism and cultural practices that are now intertwined with Indigenous customs.",
      "Researcher and bullfighting fan Antonio Rivera lives in Yucat\u00e1n, a southeastern state where bullfights reflect ancient Mayan traditions.",
      "\u201cIn local celebrations, the roots of bullfighting are sacrificial rites,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cAncient cultures believed the gods requested sacrifices and blood fertilizes the earth.\u201d",
      "Every year, the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula celebrates about 2,000 events featuring bulls, he said.",
      "In 2021, Yucat\u00e1n\u2019s Congress declared bullfighting part of its cultural heritage. It was a way to keep the ancestral memory alive, the official declaration said, and a way to honor its people\u2019s identity.",
      "\u201cWhen I see a bull, I feel an immense devotion,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mirror of myself. It\u2019s like looking at a living museum containing all the rituals from our collective memory.\u201d",
      "Instead of soccer balls, Silveti grew up playing with \u201cmuletas\u201d and \u201ccapotes\u201d \u2014 the brightly colored capes matadors use to channel the bull\u2019s charge.",
      "His father was one of Mexico\u2019s most beloved and renowned bullfighters. Until his death in 2003, fans called him \u201cKing David\u201d and many remember him fondly when his son is in the ring.",
      "\u201cNo one asked us where we wanted to be born,\u201d Silveti said. \u201cThe love towards the bull and the feast of bullfighting has been my life and my ancestors' life.\u201d",
      "His grandfather and his father before him were also matadors. Silveti emphasizes that his sons \u2014 now ages 6 and 2 \u2014 will decide their profession, but he would proudly support them if they followed in his footsteps.",
      "Neither the boys nor his wife watch him at the bullring, but Silveti conveys his passion in other ways. His family often visit ranches where bulls are breed. Occasionally, with his sons in his arms, Silveti bullfights baby cows.",
      "\u201cMy youngest loves it,\u201d the matador said. \u201cWhen he watches a bullfight, he plays with a napkin or a cloth and says \u2018Ol\u00e9!\u2019 How is that possible?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe King\u201d was no longer alive when Silveti became a professional bullfighter in Spain in 2011, but he senses his father's presence constantly.",
      "\u201cI feel his spirit in my soul,\u201d Silveti said. \u201cOn certain days, when I\u2019m alone and focused, I try to speak to him and follow his example.\u201d",
      "As a child, Silveti never watched his father at the ring. He stayed home with his mother and brothers. With no social media at hand to monitor live updates, they asked God to protect him.",
      "Many matadors, like Silveti, pray ahead of each bullfight. At the Aguascalientes plaza, the Rev. Ricardo Cu\u00e9llar blesses them.",
      "\u201cMy job is to attend the religious needs of the bullfighting family,\u201d Cu\u00e9llar said. \u201cNot only matadors, but also aficionados, those selling food at the arena and the bullfighters\u2019 assistants.\u201d",
      "According to Tauromaquia Mexicana, Mexico\u2019s biggest bullfighting organization, more than 20,000 jobs depend on this tradition.",
      "One of the organizations opposed to violent bullfighting, Cultura sin Tortura, was pleased by the Mexico City measure and said it would continue its efforts elsewhere. Another half a dozen Mexican states have also imposed bans.",
      "\u201cWe will keep advocating for the prohibition, given that no animal must be seen as entertainment,\u201d the group said on social media.",
      "Cattle breeders, meanwhile, say they view bulls not as sources of income but as fascinating creatures they spend years caring for. Manuel Sescosse, who owns a ranch, said that breeding this specific type of bull is as thrilling as bullfighting.",
      "\u201cThey must look good at the arena,\u201d Sescosse said. \u201cOffensive but noble. They must charge and simultaneously spark a sensitivity driving the crowds to deep emotion.\u201d",
      "The perfect bull for a fight is 4 or 5 years old and weighs between 900-1,200 pounds.",
      "According to Sescosse, each rainy season a bull is mated with 30 cows and their offspring are carefully monitored. Most receive a name. All are fed exclusively with grass and large areas are secured for them to exercise and grow strong. At the proper age, only a handful will be selected for bullfighting.",
      "\u201cYou watch them since they are born and become calves and grow,\u201d Sescosse said. \u201cThat affection grows when they turn out good for a bullfight, leave a mark and are revered.\u201d",
      "Not everyone attending bullfights is drawn to the sacred aspect, but some do find deeper purpose.",
      "Daniel Salinas says matadors follow strict norms to demonstrate their appreciation toward the bull's life, even as they end it. \u201cWe celebrate death deriving from a rite in which a human being confronts a wild animal,\" he said.",
      "At Aguascalientes, when his second bull died, Silveti caressed him and respectfully closed his eyes before stepping out of the arena.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m aware the bull is offering me everything he has and I\u2019m also willing to present him with my life,\u201d Silveti said. \u201cI\u2019ve been gored 13 times and I\u2019ve taken those hits willingly because I do this for a bigger purpose.\u201d",
      "It rarely happens, but when a bull has a unique, artistic connection with its matador, his life is spared. Instead of a sword, he gets a \u201cbanderilla\u201d (a dart-like stick). Then he returns to his ranch and breeds a progeny that fans will revere.",
      "Following Silveti\u2019s performance in Aguascalientes, Spanish matador Alejandro Talavante faced one of those bulls.",
      "Centinela \u2014 pitch-black hide, four years old, 1,140 pounds \u2014 won the fans' hearts as Talavante\u2019s passes made him spin and dance. The matador aimed to kill more than once, but the crowd pleaded for him not to. And in the end, the judge indulged.",
      "Centinela gave a final, vigorous run and vanished through the tunnel while thousands cheered. It was a day of glory for him as well.",

      "Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa arrived in Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Syria\u2019s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa arrived in Paris on Wednesday for talks with President Emmanuel Macron. It's his first trip to Europe since taking office in January, and a possible opening to broader ties with Western countries.",
      "It also comes amid renewed sectarian bloodshed in Syria, where al-Sharaa took power after his Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), led an offensive that toppled former President Bashar Assad in December. Assad, a member of Syria\u2019s Alawite minority, ruled for more than two decades.",
      "Al-Sharaa is scheduled to meet with Macron early evening, according to Syrian state media.",
      "He will discuss post-war reconstruction and economic cooperation, mainly in aviation and electricity, as well as ongoing Israeli airstrikes and Syria's relations with Lebanon, Syria's state news agency reported.",
      "The presidential Elysee Palace said Macron will restate France\u2019s support for \u201ca free, stable, sovereign Syria that respects all components of its society,\u201d while emphasizing the importance of regional stability, particularly in Lebanon, and the fight against terrorism.",
      "The visit comes a week after clashes between forces loyal to al-Sharaa and fighters from the minority Druze sect that left nearly 100 people dead. This followed earlier violence in Syria\u2019s coastal region between Sunni gunmen and members of the minority Alawite sect, which left more than 1,000 people dead, many of them Alawite civilians killed in revenge attacks.",
      "Religious minorities in Syria, including Alawites, Christians and Druze, fear persecution under the predominantly Sunni Muslim-led government. Al-Sharaa has repeatedly pledged that all Syrians will be treated equally regardless of religion or ethnicity.",
      "The 14-year conflict has killed nearly half a million people and displaced millions. Syria\u2019s infrastructure lies in ruins, and international sanctions remain a major barrier to reconstruction.",
      "The visit to Paris is being closely watched as a potential test of Europe\u2019s willingness to engage with Syria\u2019s new leadership.",
      "The European Union has begun easing sanctions, suspending measures targeting Syria\u2019s oil, gas and electricity sectors, as well as transport, including aviation, and banking restrictions.",
      "In late April, the British government announced it was lifting sanctions on a dozen Syrian entities, including government departments and state-run media outlets.",
      "The Trump administration has yet to formally recognize the new Syrian government led by al-Sharaa, and HTS remains a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Sanctions imposed on Damascus under Assad remain in place. However, Washington eased some restrictions in January when the U.S. Treasury issued a general license, valid for six months, authorizing certain transactions with the Syrian government, including some energy sales and incidental transfers.",

      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for his munitions industry to boost the production of artillery shells, as the country continues to supply arms and troops to support Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for his munitions industry to boost the production of artillery shells, state media said Wednesday, as the country continues to supply arms and troops to support Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said that Kim, during recent visits to unspecified munitions and machinery factories, praised modernization efforts that the agency claimed enabled the facilities to double their annual shell production capacity.",
      "Kim urged workers to further accelerate artillery shell production, calling it crucial to \u201cstrengthening the fighting efficiency\u201d of his armed forces, and also called for the development of more advanced machinery to boost munitions output. KCNA did not mention any comments from Kim regarding his support for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Recent South Korean intelligence assessments suggest that North Korea has sent about 15,000 soldiers to Russia, and that nearly 5,000 of them have been killed or injured while fighting against Ukrainian forces. Washington and Seoul have also accused North Korea of supplying Russia with various types of military equipment, including artillery systems and shells and ballistic missiles.",
      "After denying its war involvement for months, North Korea last month confirmed for the first time that it had sent combat troops to help Russia in recapturing parts of the Kursk region, which had fallen to a surprise Ukrainian incursion last year. Moscow also acknowledged the North Korean involvement, with Putin issuing a statement thanking the North for sending troops to support his forces and promising not to forget their sacrifices.",
      "Analysts say North Korea\u2019s official acknowledgment of its military support for Russia is likely aimed at cementing a deeper, long-term partnership with Moscow and securing greater compensation, potentially including advanced military technology that could enhance the threat posed by Kim\u2019s nuclear-armed forces.",
      "By formalizing its role as a participant in the war, North Korea may also be positioning itself to seek compensation in future negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine, according to a recent report by the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank affiliated with South Korea\u2019s intelligence agency.",
      "In a closed-door briefing to lawmakers last month, South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service also said it believes that North Korea has sent about 15,000 workers to Russia under bilateral industrial cooperation programs.",
      "While the value of North Korean artillery and missiles supplied to Russia likely amounts to billions of dollars, there are no immediate signs that Russia has provided direct cash payments in return, the agency said. Instead, Russia has likely compensated North Korea with air defense missiles, electronic warfare equipment, drones and technology for spy satellite launches, according to the assessment.",

      "Putin's foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov told reporters that the visit will be part of a \u201cgood tradition,\u201d in which Xi visits Moscow to attend celebrations of Russia's defeat over Nazi Germany in May 1945, and Putin travels to China to attend events marking the Allied defeat of Japan.",

      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry earlier this year announced that China and Russia would jointly mark this year\u2019s anniversary.",
      "Putin last visited China a year ago, in his first foreign trip after being sworn in for his fifth term in office. He also went in October 2023 and in February 2022, weeks before the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Xi\u2019s visit to Russia will be his third since then.

    "story": [
      "Missouri is poised to become the first state to repeal a common tax on profits from stocks and real estate sales",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Investors who profit from selling stocks, real estate and other assets soon could reap an even larger benefit in Missouri, which is poised to become the first U.S. state to exempt capital gains from its income tax.",
      "Legislation that won final approval Wednesday would halt the capital gains tax this year for individuals and could eventually eliminate it for corporations, if state revenues keep growing. The tax repeal now heads to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has said he's \u201cvery supportive\u201d of it.",
      "Though proponents hope it can spur the economy, detractors assert that the capital gains tax repeal will primarily benefit the rich and result in less tax revenue for public schools and services. The Republican-led Legislature overcame objections by Democrats only after expanding the bill with greater tax breaks for seniors and disabled residents and new sales tax exemptions for diapers and feminine hygiene products.",
      "Missouri's unique income tax carve-out comes as Republican-led legislatures in at least eight other states have passed more traditional income tax rate reductions this year. It also comes as Congress weighs whether to renew and expand income tax breaks enacted during President Donald Trump's first term in office.",
      "Capital gains are profits from the sale of assets such as stocks, cryptocurrency or property. The federal government taxes long-term capital gains, on assets held for more than a year, at a lower rate than ordinary income.",
      "All states that tax income also tax capital gains. Missouri currently is among 32 states and the District of Columbia that tax capital gains at the same rate as wages and other income, according to the nonprofit Tax Foundation. Eight states tax capital gains at a lower rate than other income.",
      "Some Democratic-led states have been moving in the opposite direction. Maryland lawmakers last month passed a bill that would impose a 2% capital gains tax on those with incomes over $350,000. And Washington lawmakers recently passed legislation to impose an extra 2.9% tax on capital gains over $1 million. Minnesota already imposes a surcharge on capital gains and other investment income over $1 million.",
      "Proponents of axing the capital gains tax say the tax discourages investment and incentivizes people to hold onto assets instead of selling them and spending money elsewhere in the economy.",
      "\u201cWhen you tax something you get less of it,\" said Jonathan Williams, president and chief economist at the American Legislative Exchange Council, an association of conservative lawmakers and businesses. \"The idea is, of course, you want more investment in your state.\u201d",
      "Though ALEC has long backed the repeal of state capital gains taxes, Missouri House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said the idea came to him last year from friends at an employee-owned construction company that was getting hit with the tax. He said his legislation also could benefit family farmers who want to sell their land.",
      "The capital gains tax results in \"lost economic opportunity, financial sclerosis, lower wages -- all of which serve to make Missouri less competitive both domestically and internationally,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Curtis Trent, who handled the bill in the Senate.",
      "Opponents say the wealthy will get the greatest reward.",
      "Repealing Missouri's tax on capital gains would set \u201ca worrisome precedent\u201d nationally and \u201cworsen economic and racial inequities,\u201d said Sam Waxman, deputy director of state policy research at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "One government study found that white families are more likely to report capital gains than some minorities. Among middle-income taxpayers, about 8% of white families benefited from the federal government's tax rates on capital gains and dividends compared to just 3% of Black families and 1% of Hispanic families, according to a 2023 U.S. Treasury Department report.",
      "In Missouri, about 542,000 individual income taxpayers reported capital gains in 2022, amounting to just one-fifth of all filers, according to the Missouri Budget Project, a nonprofit research group that opposes the capital gains tax repeal. The group estimates that 80% of the tax relief would go to the wealthiest 5% of taxpayers.",
      "Legislative researchers estimate Missouri's capital gains tax repeal could cost the state about $262 million annually when fully implemented. But that's disputed by both supporters and opponents.",
      "The Missouri Budget Project estimates the cost could be nearly $600 million annually.",
      "Trent predicts the tax repeal will trigger \u201cincreased economic growth (that) will translate into increased tax revenue\" over time.",
      "Owen Zidar, an economics and public affairs professor at Princeton University, studied the impacts of 584 capital gains tax rate changes in states over four decades. Capital gains tax cuts tend to result in more people selling assets for gains, but not so much as to offset the lost tax revenue, he said.",
      "Zidar said he is skeptical of claims that Missouri's capital gains tax repeal will attract a lot of investment and economic activity.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a substantial revenue decrease,\u201d he said.",

      "Researchers from vaccine-maker Moderna reported in a study published Wednesday that the new combo shot generated a stronger immune response against COVID-19 and most strains of flu than existing standalone shots in people 50 and older. Side effects were injection site pain, fatigue and headaches. Moderna previously reported a summary of the results from the company-sponsored trial in 8,000 people.",
      "The mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. Moderna believes mRNA could speed up production of flu shots compared with traditional processes that use chicken eggs or giant vats of cells. A combo shot also might improve vaccination rates, the researchers wrote in the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.",
      "Dr. Greg Poland, who studies vaccine response at Mayo Clinic and was not involved in the new study, said he's not convinced that a combo shot would be popular. And while flu comes in seasonal waves, COVID-19 has been spreading throughout the year, Poland said, posing challenges for how to time the shots to keep protection strong.",
      "He'd also like to see data on how well the new shot protected people from infection and hospitalization.",

      "An increasing number of American farmers are turning away from growing organic",
      "SKANEATELES, N.Y. -- Farmer Jeremy Brown taps the nose of a young calf. \u201cI love the ones with the pink noses,\u201d he says.",
      "This pink-nosed animal is just one of about 3,200 cattle at Twin Birch Dairy in Skaneateles, New York. In Brown\u2019s eyes, the cows on the farm aren\u2019t just workers: \u201cThey\u2019re the boss, they\u2019re the queen of the barn.\u201d",
      "Brown, a co-owner at Twin Birch, is outspoken on the importance of sustainability in his operation. The average dairy cow emits as much as 265 pounds (120 kilograms) of methane, a potent climate-warming gas, each year. Brown says Twin Birch has worked hard to cut its planet-warming emissions through a number of environmentally sound choices.",
      "\u201cRuminants are the solution, not the problem, to climate change,\u201d he said.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This story is a collaboration between Rochester Institute of Technology and The Associated Press.",
      "___",
      "Wearing a weathered hoodie and a hat promoting a brand of cow medicine, Brown was spending a windy Friday morning artificially inseminating some of the farm\u2019s massive Jerseys and Holsteins. He stepped over an electric manure scraper used to clean the animals' barn.",
      "The electric scraper means the dairy doesn't have to use a fuel-burning machine for that particular job. Twin Birch also recycles manure for use on crops, cools its milk with water that gets recirculated for cows to drink and grows most of its own feed.",
      "Despite all that, the farm has no desire to pursue a U.S. Department of Agriculture organic certification, Brown said. Doing so would add costs and require the farm to forego technology that makes the dairy business, and ultimately the customer\u2019s jug of milk, more affordable, he said.",
      "He raises a question many farmers have been asking: Is organic farming just a word?",
      "An increasing number of American farmers think so. America\u2019s certified organic acreage fell almost 11% between 2019 and 2021. Numerous farmers who implement sustainable practices told The Associated Press that they have stayed away from the certification because it\u2019s costly, doesn\u2019t do enough to combat climate change and appears to be losing cachet in the marketplace. Converting an existing farm from conventional to organic agriculture can cost tens of thousands of dollars and add labor costs.",
      "The rules governing the National Organic Program were published in 2000, and in the years after, organic farming boomed to eventually reach more than 5 million acres. But that has been declining in recent years.",
      "Any downward trend is significant, as organic farms make up less than 1% of the country's total acreage, and organic sales are typically only a tiny share of the nationwide total.",
      "Shannon Ratcliff, a farmer and co-owner of organically certified Shannon Brook Farms in Watkins Glen, New York, attributes the decline to a 2018 fraud case in Iowa involving a farmer selling grain mislabeled as certified organic. \u201cThe whole thing went crazy \u2014 work requirements for farmers ramped up and inspection levels were higher,\u201d she said.",
      "It's also just a tough business, Ratcliff said.",
      "Her co-owner, Walter Adam, also thinks younger generations' interest in farming of any kind is also declining.",
      "\u201cIt takes six months to learn everything,\u201d Adam said. \u201cWe can\u2019t find anybody as willing to work on the farm.\u201d",
      "Adam drives to Manhattan each week to sell their meat and eggs at markets, and spends Sunday mornings helping Ratcliff with business at the Brighton Farmers Market in Brighton, New York.",
      "Frank Mitloehner, a professor in animal science in the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences at University of California Davis, said lack of flexibility and efficiency are driving farmers away from organic in an era of rising prices for farmers. He said organic standards need to be overhauled or the marketplace risks organic going away completely.",
      "\u201cI am in awe that so many organic farmers were able to produce that way for that long,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems that they are losing consumer base in these financially troubling times.\u201d",
      "Still, there are consumers determined to buy organic. Aaron Swindle, a warehouse employee at a chain supermarket, spends every Sunday morning shopping for organic groceries at the Brighton Farmers Market.",
      "\u201cThe taste quality is different when it\u2019s growing nearby,\u201d Swindle said. He calls the Finger Lakes of New York a \u201ctrifecta,\u201d a region that contributes dairy, produce, and meat for its residents.",
      "John Bolton, owner of Bolton Farms in Hilton, New York, said he has some reservations about organic certification, but he\u2019s pursuing it for his hydroponic farm, which grows produce in nutrient-rich water instead of soil. It produces greens such as kale and chard and is popular as a supplier for restaurants in western New York, and draws waves of regular customers at the Rochester Public Market on weekends.",
      "Bolton doesn\u2019t use pesticides. On a chilly day this spring, he was at his greenhouse unloading 1,500 ladybugs to do the work of eliminating the operation\u2019s aphids. That's the kind of practice organic farms use to earn the certification, he said.",
      "He said his operations aren\u2019t immune to the dangers posed by climate change. Abnormally hot days affect their greenhouse, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to not only the people but the plants.\"",
      "But Bolton described the organic certification as economically and environmentally beneficial to his farm. Getting the certification will carry an expense, but he is confident it will be worth the price.",
      "\u201cIt helps with sales. And you feel good about it \u2013 you\u2019re doing the right practices,\u201d Bolton said.",

      "There\u2019s some irony in the first vehicle in a list of budget-performance cars not being a car at all. But Dodge\u2019s Hornet isn\u2019t your usual small SUV. First off, it has an Italian heritage. Though you wouldn\u2019t know it by its styling, the Hornet shares much of its mechanical design with the Alfa Romeo Tonale small luxury SUV. Second, it\u2019s genuinely powerful for a pint-size SUV. The GT version has a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that cranks out 268 horsepower and is good enough to get you from 0 to 60 mph in about 6.5 seconds. Another bonus: It has standard all-wheel drive for all-season driving and more cargo space than the typical performance car.",

      "A Ford Mustang GT with its rumbly V8 is well beyond our $35,000 price cap. But the less expensive Ford Mustang EcoBoost is a viable substitute. Having a turbocharged four-cylinder under the hood might seem like heresy, but you can\u2019t argue with the output of 315 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. With its 10-speed automatic spinning the rear wheels, the Mustang EcoBoost can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in a quick 5.6 seconds.

In both cases, the Miata\u2019s appeal comes down to the fun-to-drive fundamentals. A four-cylinder engine directs 181 horsepower to the rear wheels through either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. That\u2019s not much, but you don\u2019t need much when the car is as light as the Miata. A manual-equipped Miata went from 0 to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds at the Edmunds test track. Beyond the numbers, the Miata is all about playfulness. Quick steering, nimble handling and an easy-to-lower top combine to make any drive worthwhile.",

      "The Subaru BRZ and Toyota 86 are mechanically related. Both use a four-cylinder rated at 228 horsepower that sends its power to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. Edmunds found these cars can sprint to 60 mph in about 6 seconds when equipped with the manual. There\u2019s enough power to be entertaining but not enough to get a new driver in too much trouble, making these fantastic beginner\u2019s sports cars. And there\u2019s a low center of gravity and classic rear-wheel-drive balance to help drivers enjoyably learn about car control.

Few cars can do as many things as well as the GTI. Its turbocharged four-cylinder engine produces 241 horsepower. For 2025, every GTI has a seven-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. Edmunds has found it\u2019s good for a 5.9-second 0-60 mph sprint. Besides performance, the GTI has a spacious cabin and a generous cargo area for its size. The original hot hatch that traces its American lineage all the way back to 1983 is a solid performance value.",

You\u2019ll likely prefer the Hornet or Golf GTI if space and practicality are priorities. The Miata, BRZ and GR86 all provide a great feel and connection to the road; picking one of these comes down to whether you want a convertible top or the extra security of a coupe. The Mustang can\u2019t be beat for its classic pony car styling and heritage.",

      "In 2022, Prasad and Makary were co-authors on a paper attacking the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men.

      "As Congress looks to slash spending and raise revenue for President Donald Trump\u2019s tax bill, Republicans have turned attention to the huge endowments amassed by the country\u2019s wealthiest colleges",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's feud with America's elite universities is lending momentum to Republicans on Capitol Hill who want to increase a tax on wealthy college endowments by tenfold or more.",
      "House Republicans already were considering a hike in the tax on college endowments' earnings from 1.4% to 14% as part of Trump's tax bill. As the president raises the stakes in his fight with Harvard, Columbia and other Ivy League schools, lawmakers are floating raising the rate as high as 21% in line with the corporate tax rate. It appears no decisions have been made.",
      "In a letter blocking Harvard from new funding on Monday, the Trump administration drew attention to the school's \u201clargely tax-free\u201d $53 billion endowment, noting it's bigger than some nations' economies. Trump previously said he wants to see Harvard stripped of its tax-exempt status as he presses for reforms at colleges he accuses of \u201cindoctrinating\u201d students with \u201cradical left\u201d ideas.",
      "Similar rhetoric has been echoed by Republican lawmakers who question why wealthy colleges get tax breaks that businesses don't.",
      "In a letter to Brown University last month, Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas, who has proposed legislation with the higher rate, said lawmakers are concerned about the priorities of universities that operate in a \u201clargely tax-free\u201d world. He questioned whether their endowments contribute to the public good.",
      "Republicans appear to be chipping away at the long-held notion that colleges provide the kind of public benefit that deserves to be protected from heavy taxation. And it's happening just as the House looks to cut or offset $1.5 trillion in spending as part of the president's sweeping tax bill.",
      "Colleges weren\u2019t taxed on their investment gains until Trump\u2019s 2017 tax package, which applied a 1.4% levy to schools that enroll at least 500 students and have $500,000 per full-time student in the bank.",
      "A proposal floated by the House Ways and Means Committee in January called for a 14% endowment tax. Now lawmakers are looking at a 21% tax, among various options. As a senator, Vice President J.D. Vance proposed going further, to 35%.",
      "In 2023, the current tax generated $380 million from 56 colleges.",
      "Raising the tax to 14% would generate $10 billion for the federal government over 10 years, according to budget documents. On its own, it would have little impact on the House\u2019s goals for slashing government spending.",
      "The momentum for an increase reflects a broader attack on higher education, said Steven Bloom, an assistant vice president of the American Council on Education, which represents the presidents of hundreds of colleges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a lot of money, so that can\u2019t be the motivating factor,\u201d Bloom said.",
      "Colleges see their endowments as stability for the future. The wealthiest ones run massive investment portfolios, and they usually draw about 5% of their returns to cover scholarships and other operating costs.",
      "Critics say colleges have been allowed to amass huge, tax-free returns while charging students as much as $95,000 a year for tuition and fees. They point to Harvard, Yale and others with tens of billions stored away. In total, roughly 50 colleges have endowments worth more than $1 billion, while the vast majority are much smaller.",
      "The tax proposals heighten financial uncertainty for colleges, including some that already are drawing deeper into endowment reserves to make up for federal funding cuts or grappling with budget gaps amid enrollment decreases.",
      "At Davidson College, the most modest proposal would add $11 million a year to the school's tax bill, which was about $1 million last year, President Douglas Hicks said in an interview.",
      "\u201cThat amount of money would be astronomical for our budget,\u201d he said.",
      "Davidson is among a small group of colleges that don't consider students' income in admissions and agree to cover their full financial need. Hicks said the proposed tax hikes would take away the equivalent of full scholarships for up to 200 students.",
      "\u201cIf leaders are trying to reform higher education, there are much better incentives,\u201d Hicks said.",
      "Middlebury College in Vermont, a campus of about 3,000 students, cited the potential tax increase as a factor contributing to recent financial uncertainty. The school faces a budget deficit amid a dip in graduate school enrollment, but it\u2019s opting not to pull more from its endowment over concerns of a tax hike.",
      "\u201cEndowment tax increases that are currently under consideration could raise our tax bill from $1 million to $12 million,\u201d university leaders wrote in an April update.",

      "The deficit \u2014 which measures the gap between the value of goods and services the U.S. sells abroad against what it buys \u2014 has roughly doubled over the last year. In March 2024, Commerce Department records show, that gap was just under $68.6 billion.",
      "According to federal data released on Tuesday, U.S. exports for goods and services totaled about $278.5 billion in March, while imports climbed to nearly $419 billion. That's up $0.5 billion and $17.8 billion, respectively, from February trade.",
      "Consumer goods led the imports surge \u2014 increasing by $22.5 billion in March. And pharma products in particular climbed $20.9 billion, the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis noted, signaling fears about future levies impacting the sector.",
      "\u201cWhile we had known consumer goods accounted for the bulk of March\u2019s rise, we can now see pharmaceutical products were $20bn higher \u2014 almost all of which were imported from Ireland,\u201d a Tuesday note from analysts at Oxford Economics notes. \u201cUncertainty remains high, and broader signs of front-loading may be visible in coming months.\u201d",
      "Imports are flooding into the U.S. trade wars deepen abroad. Trump has threatened and imposed a series of steep tariffs in recent months \u2014 and much of March, in particular, was filled with anticipation and uncertainty leading up to what the president called \u201cLiberation Day\" on April 2, when he announced new import taxes on nearly all of America\u2019s trading partners. With the exception of China, higher tariff rates for many countries have since been postponed \u2014 but other sweeping levies remain.",
      "The White House insists that new tariffs will help close longstanding trade deficits (the U.S. hasn't sold the rest of the world more than it's bought since 1975), reinvigorate manufacturing in America and generate government revenue. But economists are warning of significant consequences for businesses, households and economies worldwide under the levies that Trump has proposed.",
      "These new tariffs are already increasing operating costs for businesses that rely on a global supply chain \u2014 which, in turn, will hike prices for a range of goods that consumers buy each day.",
      "The recent surge in imports reflects efforts by companies across the country to bring in foreign goods before more duties kicked in. New orders for manufactured durable goods, for example, jumped 9.2% to $315.7 billion in March, Census Bureau data released last month shows.",
      "March's trade deficit surpasses the last monthly record of $130.7 billion reported in January \u2014 also amid tariff uncertainty after Trump took office, marking a more than $32 billion jump from December.",
      "All of this contributed to shrinking economic growth in the first three months of the year. Last week, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. gross domestic product \u2014 or output of goods and services \u2014 fell at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March, marking the first drop in three years.",
      "Imports grew at a total 41% pace for that period, its fastest rate since 2020, shaving 5 percentage points off first-quarter growth. But that surge is likely to reverse in the second quarter, removing some weight on GDP.",

      "A bill winding its way through the Nebraska Legislature would criminalize the sale and possession of an array of products containing hemp-based THC",
      "LINCOLN, Neb. -- Kind Life Dispensary has been offering cannabinoid gummies, tinctures, ointments, now even canned beverages for seven years as one of the first businesses in Nebraska to offer such products. Founder and co-owner Andrea Watkins said her venture has been wildly successful, and she now has three locations in Nebraska's capital city that employ eight people and sell to hundreds of regulars who use the products to treat everything from aches and pains to anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder.",
      "But now, she's worried her livelihood will crumble as a bill winding its way through the Nebraska Legislature would outlaw most of the products she sells.",
      "The Nebraska bill would criminalize the sale and possession of an array of products containing hemp-based tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC \u2014 the same compound that gives marijuana its psychoactive properties. Any product containing more than a total weight of 0.3% THC or more than 10 milligrams total per package would be outlawed.",
      "\u201cIf that bill becomes law? We would have to close,\u201d Watkins said recently at her flagship store that looks like a cross between a pharmacy and a spa.",
      "She suspects many of the more than 300 businesses across the state offering similar products since hemp was legalized under the 2018 federal farm bill could face the same fate. That farm bill created a legal loophole that allows manufacturers to synthesize THC from hemp plants and sell it in products where marijuana isn't legal to sell.",
      "As the bill is currently written, it would even ban topical products like THC-containing lotions and creams intended to dull joint and muscle pains, leading opponents to accuse the bill's sponsors of making criminals of grandparents seeking a treatment for arthritis.",
      "\u201cWhat happens to all the grannies who have some kind of CBD with delta-8 in the back of their medicine cabinet?\u201d Omaha Sen. Wendy DeBoer asked during recent debate on the Nebraska bill, adding that the bill would \u201cmake felons of all the grannies\u201d using products with hemp-based THC for aching joints.",
      "The Nebraska bill includes a grace period through the end of 2025 to allow people who have such products to dispose of them.",
      "Republican lawmakers behind Nebraska's bill say it's needed to protect people \u2014 especially children \u2014 from dangerous products that use synthetic cannabinoids \u201cmasquerading as hemp\u201d and are infused into food and drink with candy and fruit flavors. Several lawmakers relayed accounts of children and others suffering ill effects and even hospitalization after consuming products containing synthesized THC.",
      "But those amount to scare tactics that mischaracterize the benefits of the products, said Dr. Andrea Holmes, an expert in organic chemistry with an emphasis in cannabis. Holmes is a co-owner of Kind Life Dispensaries and has traveled the country promoting regulated cannabis and cannabinoid products.",
      "\u201cWhat they leave out in these cases they talk about is that the person has also taken some other substance or has some underlying problem that leads to their condition,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cOur products aren't dangerous.\u201d",
      "Opponents of the bill say it is part of a yearslong effort by state Republicans \u2014 including Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers \u2014 to criminalize hemp products and thwart growing efforts to legalize marijuana both in Nebraska and across the country. Dozens of states have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use. In November, voters in Nebraska overwhelmingly approved medical marijuana use.",
      "\u201cWe need to look at that fact. Most people want these types of products,\u201d Holmes said.",
      "So far, Nebraska lawmakers have rejected efforts by Omaha state Sen. John Cavanaugh, a Democrat, to supplant the ban bill with a measure that would require strict regulation of hemp-based consumables, as several other states have done. The Nebraska Hemp Industries Association supports Cavanaugh's effort to regulate the industry.",
      "Cavanaugh and supporters of his measure say banning hemp products at a time when the state is suffering dramatic revenue shortfalls would just hit state coffers harder.",
      "Hemp-derived cannabinoid businesses employ more than 1,600 people in Nebraska and provide a tax revenue potential of nearly $8 million to the state, Cavanaugh said, citing figures from the 2023 U.S. National Cannabinoid Report.",
      "Despite the decriminalization of hemp and voters' approval of some marijuana use, Hilgers has been crisscrossing the state targeting businesses that sell hemp-based cannabinoid products. Many shops have received cease-and-desist letters. Some have been subject to raids by law enforcement. Hilgers insists he's protecting the public from dangerous products and unscrupulous dealers trading in plain sight.",
      "\u201cWith our new complaints, we are ramping up our efforts to clean up Nebraska,\u201d Hilgers said in September, when he sued four businesses in Norfolk selling hemp-based consumables. \u201cThese stores are misleading Nebraskans. Not one of the products we tested were accurately labeled, and many contained controlled substances.\u201d",
      "Nebraska is far from alone in the push to restrict access to consumable hemp and other THC products. It joins a slew of other states where similar efforts to regulate, criminalize or ban such products, including Alabama, Florida, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "But Democratic-led states also have led efforts to restrict hemp-derived products. In California, where recreational marijuana use is legal and heavily regulated and taxed, regulators issued a ban last year on food and beverage products with hemp-derived THC, citing health concerns.",

    "story": [
      "Among all U.S. allies being wooed by Beijing in its tariff stare-down with Washington, Japan stands out as a peculiar case",
      "WASHINGTON -- Just as Japan's top trade negotiator traveled to Washington for another round of tariff talks last week, a bipartisan delegation bearing the name of \u201cJapan-China Friendship\u201d wrapped up a visit to Beijing.",
      "A week earlier, the head of the junior party in Japan's ruling coalition was in Beijing delivering a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba addressed to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Details of the letter are unknown, but the two sides discussed U.S. tariffs in addition to bilateral issues.",
      "Among all U.S. allies being wooed by Beijing in its tariff stare-down with Washington, Japan stands out.",
      "It is a peculiar case not only for its staunch commitment to its alliance with the United States but also for its complicated and uneasy history with the neighboring Asian giant \u2014 particularly the war history from the 20th century that still casts a shadow over the politics of today.",
      "\u201cOn one hand, they are neighbors and they are important economic partners. There\u2019s a lot that connects Japan and China,\u201d said Matthew Goodman, director of the Greenberg Center for Geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cBut on the other hand, I think there are limits to how far they\u2019re going to lean into China.\u201d",
      "While Japan won't walk away from its alliance with the United States, the linchpin of the Asian country's diplomacy and security policies, \u201cit's also true that the tariffs and uncertainty that Trump has created for Japan is really shaking things up in Tokyo,\u201d Goodman said.",
      "Last month, President Donald Trump announced a 24% tariff on Japanese goods in a sweeping plan to levy duties on about 90 countries. The White House has since paused the tariffs but a 10% baseline duty on all countries except China, allowing time for negotiations. Still, Trump's 25% tax on aluminum, steel and auto exports have gone into effect for Japan.",
      "The tariff moves, as well as Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, have cast doubts among the Japanese if the United States is still a dependable ally, while China is rallying support from tariff-threatened countries \u2014 including Japan.",
      "When Tetsuo Saito led Japan's Komeito Party delegation to Beijing in late April, China hinted at difficulty in its tariff dispute with the United States, signaling its willingness to improve ties with Tokyo. An unnamed senior Chinese official said his country was \"in trouble\u201d when discussing Trump's 145% tariff on Chinese products, according to Japanese reports.",
      "Saito's visit was soon followed by that of the bipartisan delegation of Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians' Union. Zhao Leji, Beijing's top legislator, told the delegation that China's National People's Congress would be \u201cwilling to carry out various forms of dialogue and exchanges.\"",
      "Beijing did not lift a ban on Japan's seafood imports as the Japanese delegates hoped, but it signaled positive signs on its assessment of the safety of the discharges of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Beijing banned Japan's seafood products in 2023, citing those concerns.",
      "Ties between Tokyo and Beijing have long been rocky. In the past several years, they squabbled not only over the seafood ban but also long-standing territorial disputes over the Senkaku, or Diaoyu, islands in the East China Sea, Beijing's growing military assertiveness and violence against Japanese nationals in China \u2014 an issue complicated by the nations' uneasy history.",
      "Tokyo's closer ties with Washington during Joe Biden's presidency also upset Beijing, which saw it as part of the U.S. strategy to contain China and has lectured Tokyo to \u201cface squarely and reflect on the history of aggression.\u201d",
      "An imperial power in Asia for centuries, China fell behind Japan in the 19th century when Japan began to embrace Western industrialization and grew into a formidable economic and military power. It invaded China in the 1930s and controlled the northeastern territory known as Manchuria. War atrocities, including the Nanking Massacre and the use of chemical and biological weapons and human medical experiments in Manchuria, have left deep scars in China. They have yet to be healed, though Japan's conservative politicians today still attempt to deny the aggression.",
      "Ishiba, elected Japan's prime minister in October, has a more neutral view on his country's wartime history than the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his two successors. Weeks after taking office, Ishiba held talks with Xi on the sidelines of a leaders' summit.",
      "Chinese scholars, however, see Tokyo's recent engagements with Beijing as a pragmatic move to hedge against U.S. protectionism and not a long-term strategy for stability with China.",
      "The odds are low for Japan to move into China's orbit, Goodman said. \u201cThey have for a long time had to manage an important but challenging relationship with China,\" he said. \u201cAnd that is, again, a long-standing problem for Japan, going back centuries or millennia.\u201d",
      "While Japan might welcome the friendlier tone from Beijing, it is trying to stabilize Japan-U.S. relations under Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, and it is hoping to settle the tariff dispute without confronting Washington, with an eye on preventing Beijing from exploiting any fallout in Japan-U.S. relations.",
      "Japan was among the first countries to hold tariff talks with Washington. During the first round in mid-April, Trump inserted himself into the discussions, a sign of the high stakes for the United States to reach a deal with Japan. The Trump administration reportedly pushed for Japan to buy more U.S.-made cars and open its market to U.S. beef, rice and potatoes.",
      "After the second round of negotiation in Washington last week, Ryosei Akazawa, the country's chief tariff negotiator, said he pushed Japan's request that the U.S. drop tariffs and was continuing efforts toward an agreement acceptable to both sides. He said Japan's auto industry was already hurting from the 25% tariff and that he needed to be \u201cthorough but fast.\u201d",
      "Asked about China, Akazawa said only that his country keeps watching the U.S.-China tariff development \u201cwith great interest.\" He noted Japan's deep trade ties with China.",
      "While China and Japan are working to mend ties, the two are also competing in the Southeast Asia region, where Trump has threatened high tariffs as well. The region is deeply integrated into China's supply chain but under pressure from the West to diversify and reduce its reliance on China. With younger and growing populations as compared to East Asia, the region is considered an important growth center.",
      "Japan, as a major postwar development aid contributor, has gradually regained trust in the region, which also was scarred by Japan's World War II past.",
      "On Wednesday, Ishiba returned from Vietnam and the Philippines after agreeing with their leaders to further strengthen security and economic ties. During the visit, Ishiba stressed Japan\u2019s commitment to maintaining and strengthening a multilateral free-trade system in each country. Ishiba also had telephone talks with his Malaysian and Singaporean counterparts earlier this month about U.S. tariffs.",
      "Just weeks earlier, Xi was in Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia, also stressing free trade and seeking stronger supply chains.",
      "At a recent discussion at the Washington-based think tank Hudson Institute, Itsunori Onodera, Japan's governing party policy chief, warned of \u201cvery unstable\u201d feelings among many Asian countries faced with high tariffs from the United States.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a danger they might become more distant and become closer to China,\u201d Onodera said. \u201cThis is not something that Japan wants, either.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of state attorneys general has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to stop the development of wind energy",
      "A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy.",
      "Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states\u2019 economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.",
      "They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it.",
      "\u201cThis arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement.",
      "White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are \u201cusing lawfare to stop the president\u2019s popular energy agenda,\u201d instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.",
      "\u201cThe American people voted for the president to restore America\u2019s energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats\u2019 radical climate agenda,\u201d Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were \u201calleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government\u2019s leasing and permitting\u201d of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.",
      "The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world.",
      "The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.",
      "Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.",
      "Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation\u2019s largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump\u2019s order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a \u201cnational energy emergency,\u201d which called for expanding domestic energy production.",
      "The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate.",
      "Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation\u2019s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island.",
      "Massachusetts has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The state has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said.",
      "The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.",
      "Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmerannounced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.",

      "The Trump administration is swiftly remaking housing policy as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development retreats from long-established fair-housing protections for transgender people.",
      "In recent months, HUD has been targeting the Obama-era Equal Access Rule that expanded protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Also in the bull's-eye are fair-housing complaint investigations and federally funded homeless shelters.",
      "\u201cThis administration wants to pretend trans people don\u2019t exist,\u201d said Hannah Adams, a senior staff attorney at the National Housing Law Project. \u201cWhatever they\u2019re doing is not in line with HUD\u2019s supposed mission to provide a safety net for families that are struggling in this country.\u201d",
      "HUD said in a statement that it is upholding the landmark Fair Housing Act that guarantees equal access to housing for all Americans, as well as implementing what it called Trump\u2019s executive order \u201crestoring biological truth to the federal government.\u201d",
      "Here are key takeaways about how HUD is taking on the battle over transgender rights.",
      "The Fair Housing Act identifies sex as one of seven protected classes for housing discrimination. But it wasn\u2019t until the Obama administration established the Equal Access Rule in 2012 that those protections were extended to cover sexual orientation, gender identity and marital status.",
      "In 2016, the rule was expanded to include transgender people seeking help at federally funded emergency shelters.",
      "Four years later, a 2020 Supreme Court ruling established that a landmark civil rights law protects gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination in employment. Housing advocates and HUD in 2021 under the Biden administration interpreted that as broader affirmation that LGBTQ+ people were also protected in the fair housing law.",
      "Kim Johnson, public policy manager at the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said transgender people experience homelessness at a disproportionately higher rate despite being less than 1% of the general population. The spirit of the Fair Housing Act is to protect everyone who is vulnerable to discrimination, she said, even if the text of the law does not explicitly include gender identity as a protected class.",
      "\u201cWe really need to ensure we\u2019re upholding what the law means, and the fact is that transgender people are some of the most marginalized people in this country,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Since President Donald Trump appointed Scott Turner to take the helm at HUD, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity has instructed staff to pause investigations of all gender identity discrimination cases, according to two HUD attorneys who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs or benefits.",
      "One said letters were then issued closing the cases for lack of jurisdiction.",
      "HUD has not disclosed how many cases have been dropped. A National Fair Housing Alliance report identified at least 195 discrimination complaints involving gender identity in 2023, though HUD has not specified how many cases are still outstanding.",
      "With changes to the Equal Access rule and other guidance still unclear, what happens now often depends on where a case is filed. In blue states with laws offering protections beyond federal law, HUD can direct tenants facing LGBTQ+ discrimination to state-run offices still taking cases, said a HUD employee who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss the hot-button topic.",
      "To Sasha Samberg-Champion, HUD deputy general counsel in the Biden administration and now special counsel for civil rights at the National Fair Housing Alliance, \u201cThere is no public policy justification for permitting discrimination in the housing market against people because they are transgender. None.\u201d",
      "Community leaders say they\u2019re facing seemingly contradictory requirements in new HUD contracts with nonprofits that find permanent housing for the homeless and run shelters.",
      "One section stipulates that nonprofits can\u2019t promote \u201cgender ideology\u201d while at the same time another requires compliance with anti-discrimination law, according to a copy provided to the AP.",
      "In Memphis, Tennessee, a nonprofit that provides emergency shelter for transgender people is looking to increase capacity because of the uncertainty.",
      "Kayla Gore, executive director of My Sistah\u2019s House, said it can do that because it doesn\u2019t take federal funding. But other shelters are removing information from their websites about serving the LGBTQ+ community, fearful that federal funding will be stripped if they don\u2019t, she said.",
      "\u201cPeople are confused,\u201d Gore said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to do because they want to protect their bottom line.\u201d",
      "Soon after being sworn in as HUD secretary in February, Turner announced he was halting enforcement of the Equal Access Rule and quietly filed a proposal to revise the policy. HUD officials have declined to say what the proposed changes are.",
      "In 2020, the first Trump administration unsuccessfully moved to relieve shelters of any obligation to accommodate transgender people.",
      "With Trump back for a second term, advocates fear his administration will feel even more emboldened to go further and forbid shelters from accommodating gender identity altogether.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s making an already vulnerable class of people more vulnerable,\" said Seran Gee, an attorney for Advocates for Trans Equality.",
      "\"Our protections can\u2019t be a pingpong ball that changes every four years.\u201d",

      "The board of directors at the cash-rich conglomerate voted Sunday to keep the legendary 94-year-old investor as head of the board, a decision likely to relieve investors worried about Berkshire\u2019s remarkable winning streak as the U.S. and global economies are beset by tariff shocks, financial turmoil and a growing risk of recession.",
      "The board in the same meeting also approved Buffett\u2019s chosen successor as CEO, veteran Berkshire executive Greg Abel, 62. In a surprise announcement Saturday, Buffett said he would step down from that top spot by the end of the year.",
      "Berkshire shares fell more than 2% before the opening bell Monday.",
      "In six decades at the helm, Buffett turned a Massachusetts textile company into a sprawling but nimble conglomerate that owns everything from Daily Queen and See\u2019s Candies to BNSF Railway and giant insurers. As the company grew, Warren's reputation grew with it as shares of Berkshire Hathaway climbed steadily, exceeding major indexes by wide margins and returning an average 19.9% each year versus 10.4% for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500.",
      "The decision to continue with the so-called Sage of Omaha as head of the board came amid speculation that Howard Buffett, the second-born of the investor\u2019s three children, would move into that spot. The older Buffett has said that after he dies he would like Howard to take over as chairman.",
      "A current vice-chairman, Abel, will take over as CEO as big questions hover over the company. Buffett himself has said President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs were a big mistake. There are also worries that Berkshire might not able to avoid the fate of most conglomerates\u2014forced to break up to recapture focus.",
      "Then there is Berkshire\u2019s $348 billion in cash.",
      "Buffett says he doesn\u2019t see many bargains to invest that money in now, not even Berkshire\u2019s own stock, but assured some of the estimated 40,000 attendees of the company\u2019s celebratory weekend annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, that one day the company would be \u201cbombarded with opportunities.\u201d",
      "Abel, a low-key Canadian with a love a hockey, has been overseeing many of Berkshire\u2019s non-insurance businesses for years, but has not been deciding where to invest the company\u2019s cash.",
      "Buffett said his trust in Abel can seen in where he is putting his money.",
      "\u201cI have no intention \u2014 zero \u2014 of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cThe decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg\u2019s management than mine.\u201d",
      "What to do with that personal fortune, nearly $170 billion, will eventually be in the hands of Buffett\u2019s three children, including would-be Berkshire chairman, Howard Buffett.",
      "Howard was designated in June along with his siblings as manager of Buffett\u2019s trust when he dies and he said that they will decide where to donate that money. Buffett has already given away billions, most notable more than $40 billion to the Gates Foundation started by Bill and Melinda French Gates.",
      "Howard, 70, has his own foundation through which he has donated billions to humanitarian and food security causes, including helping coffee farms in El Salvador and clearing landmines in Ukraine.",
      "Tributes to Buffett came tumbling in over the weekend praising his investment savvy and folksy management style.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Golden State Warriors are planning to play without Stephen Curry for at least the next three games of their second-round series against Minnesota, after an MRI exam on Wednesday confirmed a mild strain of the star guard\u2019s left hamstring.",
      "The Warriors said Curry would be sidelined at least a week after the injury Tuesday night forced him out early in second quarter of Game 1, which they went on to win 99-88. He had 13 points in 13 minutes to help Golden State build a comfortable lead and take home-court advantage away from the Timberwolves.",
      "Game 2 is in Minneapolis on Thursday, before the series moves west to San Francisco for Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 on Monday. The earliest return for Curry appears to be Game 5 on May 14, which is conveniently followed by three straight off days before Game 6 on May 18.",
      "Curry missed multiple games because of injuries during the 2016 and 2018 playoffs, absences the Warriors endured on their way to the NBA Finals. They lost to Cleveland in seven games for the 2016 championship, and they swept the Cavaliers in 2018 for a third title in four years.",
      "This Golden State roster hardly stacks up to those predecessors, however, when Curry and Draymond Green were much younger and other standouts like Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala were integral to their success. In 2018, they had Kevin Durant, too.",
      "For now, the Warriors were feeling good about the all-hands-on-deck effort led by Jimmy Butler, Buddy Hield and Green in Game 1, in which coach Steve Kerr played 12 different players.",

      "Owners Ryan and Ashley Smith unveiled the franchise\u2019s permanent name Thursday morning after more than a year of fan input and voting.",
      "\u201cFrom Day 1, we committed that this team would be built with and for the people of Utah, and we are excited to celebrate today\u2019s launch with the entire state,\u201d they said in a statement announcing the name. \u201cThe community chose the Utah Mammoth brand, and it stands as a symbol of who we are, where we came from and the unstoppable force we\u2019re building together.\u201d",
      "Mammoth replaces the inaugural season placeholder name Utah Hockey Club, which was also one of the three finalists. Yeti was taken out of consideration when the cooler company bearing that name could not come to a copyright agreement with Utah ownership, and Wasatch \u2014 a reference to the state\u2019s mountain range \u2014 was quickly replaced as an option by Outlaws.",
      "The Mammoth are maintaining the same black, light blue and white color scheme and the road jerseys with UTAH diagonally down the front. The logo includes a nod to the mountains, the shape of the state and a curved tusk that forms a \u201cU.\u201d",
      "Mammoth fossils have been found throughout Utah, including a complete skeleton in Huntington Canyon in 1988.",
      "Utah has an exciting summer ahead holding the fourth pick in the draft, the first phase of arena renovations taking place and more than $20 million in salary cap space for general manager Bill Armstrong to make a splash in free agency and trades. With young talent like captain Clayton Keller, budding star forward Logan Cooley, two-time Stanley Cup champion Mikhail Sergachev and emerging goaltender Karel Vejmelka, the Mammoth could contend for a playoff spot as soon as next season.",
      "The rebranding comes less than 13 months since Smith Entertainment group bought the team previously known as the Arizona Coyotes from former owner Alex Meruelo and moved it to Salt Lake City. The Coyotes played in the Phoenix area since 1996 after moving there from Winnipeg, where the team was the original Jets.",

      "The Pittsburgh Steelers have run out of patience with wide receiver George Pickens",
      "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers have run out patience with wide receiver George Pickens, agreeing Wednesday on a trade that sends the talented but mercurial 24-year-old to the Dallas Cowboys.",
      "The Steelers will get a third-round pick in the 2026 draft and a fifth-rounder in 2027. The Cowboys get a sixth-round choice in two years.",
      "The trade was first reported by ESPN.",
      "Pickens is about to enter the final year of the rookie deal he signed in 2022 when the Steelers took the former Georgia star in the second round. The 6-foot-3, 200-pound Pickens has spent his first three seasons in the NFL being equal parts productive and petulant, mixing highlight-reel catches with bouts of immaturity along the way.",
      "Pickens joins a Cowboys offense that could use another downfield threat to pair with star CeeDee Lamb. Dallas\u2019 second-leading pass catcher behind Lamb last year was tight end Jake Ferguson, with Jalen Tolbert\u2019s modest 49 receptions a distant third.",
      "Dallas didn't address the need for a No. 2 receiver in the draft, with first-year coach Brian Schottenheimer saying he liked the youth that was already on the roster. Owner and general manager Jerry Jones made reference before the draft to \u201csubstantive\u201d trades the Cowboys were pursuing. This qualifies as one.",
      "The Steelers, particularly head coach Mike Tomlin, frequently backed Pickens as he endured what the team frequently described as a version of growing pains while he adjusted to life in the NFL.",
      "Pickens has been one of the most dynamic receivers in the league when he's on the field and engaged, which is not always a given. Pickens led the league by averaging 18.1 yards per catch in 2023 and has 174 receptions for 2,841 yards and 12 scores in 48 games.",
      "Yet he's also consistently struggled to keep his emotions in check. Last season alone he twice ended games by getting into dust-ups with opposing defensive backs, first when he grabbed Dallas' Jourdan Lewis by the facemask and then when he tussled with Cleveland's Greg Newsome II rather than try to get in position for a last-second Hail Mary.",
      "That doesn't include a fine for using an expletive on his eye black against the Cowboys, a rule he said he was unaware of at the time. Pickens also drew widespread criticism in 2023 for what could generously be described as inattentive downfield blocking for his teammates.",
      "Considering his volatility, the Steelers didn't seem interested in signing Pickens to a contract extension and he became expendable when they traded for two-time Pro Bowler DK Metcalf in March, whom they promptly signed to a five-year contract.",

    "story": [
      "Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty is not running in the Preakness Stakes and that means for a fifth time in the past seven years there is no chance of a Triple Crown champion going into the race",
      "Just a few days after winning the Kentucky Derby, Sovereignty was ruled out of running in the Preakness Stakes.",
      "It is the second time in four years the owner and trainer of the Derby champion opted to skip the Preakness in favor of the Belmont Stakes in June. Rich Strike also bypassed the Preakness in 2022 after winning at Churchill Downs at odds of 80-1.",
      "Country House did not run in 2019 because of illness after getting elevated to Derby winner when Maximum Security was disqualified for interference, the races were run out of order in 2020 and Medina Spirit ran and finished third in the 2021 Preakness after being DQed from his first-place finish in the Derby for a positive drug test.",
      "That means this is the fifth time in seven years that the Preakness gates open at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore without even a chance at a Triple Crown. That was only the case once in the previous 33 years from to 1986-2018, and that happened because a horse was retired because of injury after taking the Run for the Roses.",
      "Horse racing has changed from its heyday, when stars of the sport like War Admiral, Secretariat and Seattle Slew were used to running every couple of weeks. Breeding, money and other factors have changed that, and the top 3-year-old horses eligible for the Triple Crown race far less often, with bigger stretches in between.",
      "\u201cMost trainers hate running their horses back in two weeks,\u201d NBC Sports analyst Randy Moss said. \u201cThey feel like it\u2019s bad for the horses.\u201d",
      "Beginning in the early 21st century, many of the Derby horses who finish between second and 20th started getting more rest to wait five weeks for the Belmont. It was essentially automatic that the Derby winner would go, though not anymore.",
      "\u201cThe trainers of Derby winners that do run back in the Preakness do it out of a sense of tradition \u2014 not because they like it,\u201d Moss said.",
      "Sovereignty's Bill Mott made that clear the morning after his horse passed Journalism down the stretch in the mud at Churchill Downs with a record audience watching, casting doubt on the Preakness.",
      "\u201cWe want to do what\u2019s best for the horse,\u201d Mott told reporters in Louisville, Kentucky, on Sunday. \u201cOf course, you always think about a Triple Crown, and that\u2019s not something we\u2019re not going to think about.\u201d",
      "The debate has been raging for decades about horses not being able to handle the grind of three premier races over a span of five weeks. That was primarily because no one swept the Triple Crown between Affirmed in 1978 and American Pharoah in 2015, a 37-year drought that made industry stakeholders question tradition versus modern-day changes.",
      "Justify doing it in 2018 to give the sport a pair of Triple Crown champions in four years quieted that talk. The recent uncertainty about Derby winners going to the Preakness reignited the chatter.",
      "Prominent owner Mike Repole shared a proposal on social media Tuesday that would move the Belmont up to second in the rotation and shift the Preakness back to provide more spacing. Others have suggested moving the Preakness back to the first Saturday in June and the Belmont to the first Saturday in July.",
      "No one really knows. And does there need to be seismic change like the pitch clock in baseball?",
      "Maybe, maybe not. After all, the previous two Derby winners \u2014 Mystik Dan last year and Mage in 2023 \u2014 wheeled back after two weeks to finish in the money at the Preakness.",
      "They didn't win, but their trainers wanted to give it a shot. And Bob Baffert-trained American Pharoah and Justify completing the Triple Crown showed it was possible.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see Triple Crown winners because there will occasionally be horses like American Pharoah and like Justify who are good enough to blow up any of the current thoughts about spacing,\u201d Moss said.",
      "And trainers who aren't worried about it. Baffert and 89-year-old fellow Hall of Famer D. Wayne Lukas have shown a willingness to go for it after winning the Derby \u2014 and even when they don't. Lukas intends to run American Promise in the Preakness after a 16th place finish in Kentucky.",
      "Others have chosen to play it more safe, which, if that becomes the trend, puts the future of the Preakness in peril.",

      "It is Presti's first time winning the award and the first time since 1994 that the franchise \u2014 which was then called the Seattle SuperSonics \u2014 had its top executive voted as the winner. Bob Whitsitt won it that season.",
      "Presti, the Thunder's executive vice president and general manager, got 10 first-place votes from a panel of 30 basketball executives \u2014 one from each of the NBA\u2019s teams \u2014 who ranked their top three choices in order. Presti appeared on 22 of those 30 ballots.",
      "\u201cI look at it like it\u2019s a tremendous privilege to be able to do it,\u201d Presti said at the start of the season when asked about his job. \u201cEventually someone else is going to be the person that\u2019s doing it, and for me, while I\u2019m serving the position, I think I\u2019ve said this in the past, it\u2019s not my job, it\u2019s the Thunder\u2019s job. I\u2019m just serving the position the best that I can and hopefully doing a good job with it for as many people as possible, and I enjoy it.\u201d",
      "Cleveland\u2019s Koby Altman was second with six first-place votes, after the Cavaliers won 64 games and finished atop the Eastern Conference standings. Detroit\u2019s Trajan Langdon also got six first-place votes and was third, after the Pistons went from a 14-win team to a 44-win playoff team in his first year leading that front office.",
      "Houston\u2019s Rafael Stone (four first-place votes) was fourth, the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 Lawrence Frank (one first-place vote) was fifth and the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 Rob Pelinka (also one first-place vote) was sixth. Pelinka engineered the biggest trade of the season, the one that brought Luka Doncic to the Lakers from the Dallas Mavericks \u2014 but was listed on only five of the 30 ballots cast.",
      "Golden State\u2019s Mike Dunleavy was seventh, Brooklyn\u2019s Sean Marks and 2024 award winner Brad Stevens of the Boston Celtics (both of whom got one first-place vote) tied for eighth, and New York\u2019s Leon Rose was 10th.",
      "Sacramento\u2019s Monte McNair was 11th, while Orlando\u2019s Jeff Weltman and San Antonio\u2019s Brian Wright tied for 12th.",
      "The executive of the year award is not like most NBA season honors that are voted on by a global panel of 100 writers and broadcasters who cover the league and cast ballots shortly after the end of the regular season.",
      "Awards that were part of that voting process and have already had their results unveiled: Cleveland's Kenny Atkinson winning Coach of the Year, Atlanta\u2019s Dyson Daniels winning Most Improved Player, San Antonio\u2019s Stephon Castle winning Rookie of the Year, Cleveland\u2019s Evan Mobley winning Defensive Player of the Year, New York\u2019s Jalen Brunson winning Clutch Player of the Year, and Boston\u2019s Payton Pritchard winning Sixth Man of the Year.",

      "GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- Florida basketball coach Todd Golden has signed a contract extension that raises his annual salary to $6 million, a lucrative bump nearly a month after the Gators won the national championship.",
      "Golden inked a six-year, $40.5 million extension Tuesday night, adding a year to his current deal and putting him under contract through the 2030-31 season. He signed a two-year extension in March 2024 that increased his average salary to $4.1 million annually.",
      "His latest raise is a significant commitment from Florida and puts Golden nearly on par with football coach Billy Napier, who is scheduled to make $7.4 million in 2025.",
      "Golden\u2019s deal pays $6 million a year (beginning April 16, 2025), with a $300,000 pay hike every year after.",
      "The new money makes the 39-year-old Golden the second-highest-paid basketball coach in the Southeastern Conference behind Arkansas\u2019 John Calipari, who earns $8 million annually. Golden, once an assistant under Bruce Pearl at Auburn who got his first head coaching job at San Francisco in 2019, previously ranked 12th out of 16 coaches in the league.",
      "He now jumps to fifth among the seven active coaches with national titles, behind Bill Self of Kansas, Calipari, UConn\u2019s Dan Hurley and Michigan State\u2019s Tom Izzo.",
      "Golden\u2019s new deal is nearly fully guaranteed. Florida would owe him 85% of the remaining value if the school fired him without cause at any point.",
      "Golden\u2019s buyout to leave Gainesville starts at $16 million next season and drops annually: $11 million in 2026-27; $4 million in 2027-28; $3 million in 2028-29; $2 million in 2029-30; and $1 million in 2030-31.",
      "However, Golden can leave for the NBA at a much lower price. His NBA buyout begins at $3 million next season and drops to $2 million (2026-28) and then $1 million in 2028-29.",
      "Included in Golden\u2019s annual compensation is a $500,000 signing bonus, a $500,000 annual longevity incentive and a $60,000 annual expense account. In addition to that, he gets $70,000 annually in travel allowance for using the university athletic association\u2019s plane and other fringe benefits valued at $62,000.",
      "He would get a $100,000 bonus for winning the SEC regular-season championship, a $50,000 bonus for winning the SEC Tournament, a $100,000 bonus for making the NCAA Tournament and a $50,000 bonus for every NCAA Tournament victory.",
      "With Golden at the helm for his third season in Gainesville, the Gators finished 36-4 and beat Houston to clinch the program\u2019s third national title. They won their final 12 games, including four in the NCAA Tournament in come-from-behind fashion.",
      "Florida\u2019s style of play under Golden has drawn rave reviews, leading to sellouts in eight of the team\u2019s last 10 home games. Florida averaged 84.8 points a game this season after setting the program record (85.6) during the 2023-24 campaign.",
      "Golden became the third coach this century to win a national title within his first three seasons on the job, joining North Carolina\u2019s Roy Williams (2005) and UConn\u2019s Kevin Ollie (2014). Williams and Ollie accomplished the feat in their second seasons.",
      "Golden has a modest rebuild on his hands now. Leading scorer Walter Clayton, the Final Four\u2019s Most Outstanding Player, is headed to the NBA along with fellow guards Alijah Martin and Will Richard. Forwards Alex Condon and Rueben Chinyelu are going through the NBA draft process with the potential to stay in school and return for next season.",
      "Backup guard Denzel Aberdeen (Kentucky) and backup forward Sam Alexis (Indiana) transferred, and assistant coaches Kevin Hovde (Columbia) and John Andrzejek (Campbell) took head coaching jobs.",

I learned a lot, because I don\u2019t know anything about the Catholic religion. With the whole smoke thing, I thought that was cool. I would like to go and see it and be around it since we\u2019re here.\u201d",
      "During the conclave, ballots are burned and black smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney means no decision; white smoke signals the cardinals have chosen a pope and that he has accepted.",
      "Swiatek, the three-time Rome champion from Poland, said, \u201cI would love to (go) just to have the experience. But I\u2019ll see logistically how it\u2019s going to look like.\u201d She noted how there was no way to know exactly when a pope will be elected or how long the conclave will last.",
      "The conclave starts on Wednesday and the Italian Open lasts through May 18.",
      "Gauff is a devout Christian and often makes mention of her faith in post-match speeches, such as when she lost the Madrid Open final to Aryna Sabalenka on Saturday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s super important for me,\u201d Gauff said of her faith. \u201cI\u2019m not out here trying to force anybody to believe in anything.",
      "\u201cWhere you start criticizing people for saying anything, whether it\u2019s religion, or pride in their sexuality or anything like that, that\u2019s a bit of censorship. I think we all should be able to do what we want to do as long as it\u2019s not harming other people. For me it\u2019s important to share it and let other people know it helps me. It could also help someone else in their life.\"",

      "MILAN -- Inter Milan has another Champions League final to look forward to. Once the players catch their breath, that is.",
      "In the end it took extra time, two astonishing comebacks and 13 goals to separate Barcelona and Inter and see the Italian club \u2014 which was a mere seconds away from elimination \u2014 prevail 7-6 on aggregate after winning another rollercoaster encounter 4-3 on Tuesday.",
      "Substitute Davide Frattesi was the extra-time star for Inter, firing home in the 99th minute to leave the Barcelona players slumped to the ground while his Nerazzurri teammates \u2014 including those on the bench \u2014 were racing to celebrate with him.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened tonight. I\u2019m lucky I managed to finish the game, I screamed so much (in celebration) that I saw everything black,\u201d Frattesi told Italian broadcaster Sky.",
      "Moments earlier, he'd been encouraging the already loud San Siro crowd to make more noise and the atmosphere grew more feverish after Frattesi delivered on his super-sub reputation again.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s part of my career,\" the midfielder said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t given so much incredible talent, but I am always the last one to give up and the first one to believe we can do it. At 3-3, I told Marcus (Thuram) that we would go through.\u201d",
      "Three-time European champion Inter, which lost the 2023 final to Manchester City, will face either Paris Saint-Germain or Arsenal in Munich on May 31 for the title. PSG beat Arsenal 1-0 in London last week in their first match. The return leg is Wednesday in Paris.",
      "Inter coach Simone Inzaghi thinks his squad has shown in wins over Barcelona in the semis and Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals that it can compete against the very best.",
      "\u201cMy players have been extraordinary, they've put out there two monstrous performances to get to this final,\u201d he said. \"We have to continue. The final will be played against a really great team, whether it's Arsenal or PSG. Barcelona and Bayern are probably the best teams in Europe at the moment, but it will still be difficult.\"",
      "There was little sign at halftime of the drama to play out. Inter was comfortably leading 2-0 after Lautaro Mart\u00ednez scored and earned a penalty, which was converted by Hakan \u00c7alhano\u011flu.",
      "But Barcelona had been in that position before, having gone 2-0 down early last week in the first leg before securing a thrilling 3-3 draw.",
      "And Eric Garc\u00eda scored nine minutes after the break before Dani Olmo headed in the equalizer six minutes later.",
      "Raphina appeared to have secured the win for Barcelona when he put the Spanish club ahead two minutes before full time, tucking away the rebound after Yann Sommer had saved his initial shot.",
      "However, 37-year-old Francesco Acerbi astonishingly leveled in stoppage time \u2014 with his first goal in European competition \u2014 to add another 30 minutes of time.",
      "Frattesi had proved crucial off the substitutes' bench before, both for Italy and Inter, and so he was again, controlling Mehdi Taremi's pass and beating Pau Cubars\u00ed before curling past Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny.",
      "Barcelona almost leveled again but Sommer made a fingertip save to push Lamine Yamal's shot past his post.",
      "Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said he told his players \u201cI know everyone is disappointed \u2026 but at the end we can be proud of our performance.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud of my team,\" he said. \"We have to accept it and we start again next season.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Mike Shildt had seen enough, and he was so angry with plate umpire Adrian Johnson that he made a spectacle by tossing his spectacles.",
      "A tantrum by San Diego's manager following the first major league ejection of star slugger Fernando Tatis Jr. fired up the Padres, who overcame a three-run deficit in the eighth inning to beat the New York Yankees 4-3 on a soggy Monday night and extend their winning streak to six.",
      "\u201cShilty came down the tunnel and he was still chirping,\u201d said Xander Bogaerts, who hit a go-ahead, two-run single off Luke Weaver that followed Manny Machado's two-run double. \u201cI think he was ready to fight.\u201d",
      "Tatis was ejected after a strikeout, causing Shildt to rush out onto the field, throwing his lineup card and then his glasses. He argued so vociferously with Johnson and first base ump Quinn Wolcott that third base coach Tim Leiper ran over in case intervention was needed.",
      "\u201cMy glasses made it. I did have my head about me to make sure,\u201d Shildt said after the game. \u201cI got some \u2014 a lot of BPs on my shoulders \u2014 not as operable as I\u2019d like but it came into play, and I made sure it stayed in the grass. I didn\u2019t want them scratched. I like these glasses a lot.\u201d",
      "Devin Williams entered with a 3-0 lead and walked Tyler Wade with one out in the eighth, then allowed a single to Brandon Lockridge. Williams threw four straight changeups, his famous Airbender, to Tatis. The two-time All-Star took the third at the bottom of the strike zone for strike two, then swung over an even lower pitch.",
      "He said something in Johnson's left ear before taking a turn to the dugout and was immediately tossed. Tatis said it was his first ejection since winter ball as an 18-year-old.",
      "\u201cAh, what did I say? I forgot,\u201d Tatis said, laughing. \u201cI'm just happy I got the boys hyped.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d just been complaining all game. It was a rough night,\u201d he added. \u201cAfter the strikeout I just let him know what I thought.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou can feel it. It\u2019s energy,\u201d Wade said.",
      "Three-time batting champion Luis Arraez then walked on four straight fastballs.",
      "\u201cTatis made me hot,\u201d Arraez said. \u201cI love Mike Shildt. He supports his players, and when I saw that thing, I said: `We come back!'\u201d",
      "Yankees manager Aaron Boone brought in Weaver, who had not allowed a run in 13 prior appearances this year. Machado doubled on a 1-1 fastball, cutting the deficit to 3-2, and Bogaerts singled on a first-pitch cutter.",
      "\u201cTati had some pitches that (he) didn\u2019t agree with \u2014 I didn\u2019t agree with earlier and made my comments from the dugout known, which I don\u2019t do a ton,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cDid it. Walks away, hand over his mouth, and next thing you know he\u2019s ejected walking away with his back turned for his first major league ejection.\u201d",
      "Shildt's ejection was the 15th of his six-season big league managerial career.",
      "\u201cI probably have the fewest amount of player ejections in my time managing, so our players play, they stay in the game, they\u2019re very respectful, rightfully so, to the umpires,\u201d he said. \u201cI'll let the body of the work for the umpire grade speak for itself, and we\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d",
      "A two-time All-Star acquired from Milwaukee in December, Williams has a 10.03 ERA in 14 games with the Yankees, walking 10 in 11 2/3 innings. On a night with near-constant rain that caused a pair of 28-minute delays, Williams said he had trouble with his landing spot.",
      "\u201cI couldn't figure it out with the release point on my fastball,\u201d he said.",
      "He had pitched three hitless innings in his three prior appearances since losing his closer role and felt he had turned around his season.",

      "\u201cIt's part of the business. It's part of being in New York,\" said starter Carlos Rod\u00f3n, booed during a poor first season with the Yankees in 2023. \u201cIf you don't pitch well, you're going to be get booed but if you pitch well, they're going to praise you. They're going to love you.\u201d",

They weren\u2019t taking real good swings at it,\" Braves manager Brian Snitker said. \"I told him, too, that I was prepared to let him go for a little bit to try and get (the no-hitter) if it continued on.",
      "\u201cI could tell, I don\u2019t know, probably in the seventh, I said, \u2018He knows what\u2019s going on.\u2019 Because he had a couple of reactions when that inning was over that he knew he was nearing something which is so hard to do.\u201d",
      "Smith-Shawver (2-2), who was trying for the first no-hitter in the majors this season, struck five and walked four. He was a high school teammate of Kansas City star shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. \u2014 they won a state championship together at Colleyville-Heritage High School in Texas in 2019, when Smith-Shawver was a sophomore and Witt was a senior before becoming the No. 2 pick in that summer's MLB draft.",
      "It was Smith-Shawver's fifth start for Atlanta this season, the second since being recalled from the minor leagues, and it came six days after he won at Colorado. He pitched 5 1/3 innings against the Rockies before leaving that game after taking a liner off his right arm.",
      "The Braves haven't had a no-hitter since Kent Mercker pitched one at Dodger Stadium on April 8, 1994. They haven't thrown one at home since Sept. 11, 1991, when Mercker went the first six innings in a combined no-no with Mark Wohlers (two innings) and Alejandro Pe\u00f1a (one inning) in a 1-0 win against the Padres.",
      "Braves shortstop Nick Allen made a nifty play on a hard-hit grounder with one out in the third to keep the latest no-hit bid intact for a while.",
      "\u201cAll you want as a defender is just to make plays for him, when you kind of look up at the board and you\u2019re seeing what you\u2019re seeing, no hits or something like that,\u201d Allen said. \u201cYou want to get everything, dive for anything. Unfortunately, they got the one in the eighth. But he threw it so well today, and with conviction. And that\u2019s all you can ask for. And when he does that, I mean, look what happens.\u201d",
      "Smith-Shawver walked two batters in the first before striking out Spencer Steer to end the inning. He also issued two walks with two outs in the fourth, then retired the next 10 batters before Espinal\u2019s hit.",
      "\u201cI feel like I used my heater pretty well today. I feel like I had good results on it all day. And then it was curveball-split,\" Smith-Shawver said. \u201cIt was really just kind of leaning on that (fastball) and getting myself into good counts and getting myself out of bad counts. But I thought everything was kind of working today.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Winning the second draw at the NHL draft lottery and moving up from having the 14th pick to No. 4 is the latest development setting up a momentous summer for the Utah Hockey Club",
      "When the Utah Hockey Club selected Tij Iginla with the sixth pick and took 10 other players in the first draft since the team moved to Salt Lake City, fans were excited, thinking they would be in the NHL right away.",
      "General manager Bill Armstrong tried to temper expectations, telling them, \u201cNo, it takes some time.\u201d After an unexpected victory off the ice Monday night in the draft lottery, the expectations for the club's future are Rocky Mountain high once again.",
      "Utah won the second random draw of lottery balls to move up from the 14th pick to No. 4, adding to an already momentous summer that could feature a free agent spending spree with tons of salary cap space and an owner not afraid to spend money, the first phase of massive arena renovations taking place and the full-time name getting unveiled before next season.",
      "\u201cIt's a game-changer for us,\u201d Armstrong said on a post-lottery video call with reporters. \"These are exciting times for Utah. ... Just great stuff for the franchise. I can\u2019t express in words on the excitement of when that happened and the opportunity in front of us.\u201d",
      "Armstrong has over $22 million in room, and with Ryan Smith's ownership group in charge, there's every indication Utah can spend to the annually increasing cap. That was never the case under a procession of penny-pinching owners over the past decade as the Arizona Coyotes.",
      "Utah committed $80 million-plus in player salaries this past season, and Smith Entertainment Group along with the city are investing plenty to upgrade downtown Delta Center and increase the capacity of full-ice views to over 16,000 for hockey in an arena initially designed and built primarily for basketball for the NBA's Jazz.",
      "\u201cWe are excited for the challenge as we kick off this never-before-done renovation project,\u201d Ryan and wife Ashley Smith said last week. \u201cThis transformation will create the most compelling, welcoming and exciting experience for hockey fans, while also allowing us to maintain the steep vertical seating for basketball that has made Delta Center such a dynamic venue.\u201d",
      "And, possibly soon, a venue for playoff hockey. Utah was in the race until the final few weeks of the season before finishing seven points out of the second and final wild-card spot in the Western Conference.",
      "\u201cWe were a pretty good team that chased it down the stretch playing meaningful games and chasing a playoff spot,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to that point where we\u2019re becoming a really good team that\u2019s going to have a chance to get into the playoffs.\u201d",
      "Not counting the expanded pandemic playoffs in 2020, this organization has not qualified since 2012. The building blocks to end that decade-plus drought are there, from captain Clayton Keller and 2022 No. 3 pick and budding star Logan Cooley to two-time Stanley Cup-winning defenseman Mikhail Sergachev \u2014 acquired at the draft last year \u2014 and top goaltender Karel Vejmelka.",
      "And after drafting a league-high 42 players over the past four years, there might be a temptation to use the fourth pick for immediate help, like someone who is established but still young and entering or in his prime.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something that obviously we\u2019ll always talk about,\" Armstrong said. \"We\u2019ll never shut that door. That\u2019s always been an avenue for us to get players, and we\u2019re at the position right now as a team where we\u2019re trying to make that next step, so we\u2019ll always look at that. That\u2019s part of the process.\u201d",
      "The final step in the naming process is happening, too. The finalists have been narrowed down to Mammoth, Outlaws and Utah Hockey Club, complete with a permanent logo and new jerseys.",
      "If the branding process goes as swimmingly as the first year with Smith's group in charge, the results on the business side could even exceed the hockey progress.",
      "\u201cThey made a lot of promises, and they exceeded them with what they accomplished in a short period of time,\u201d Commissioner Gary Bettman said last week at a meeting of Associated Press Sports Editors in New York. \u201cWhat they accomplished is a testament to Ryan and everybody out there. They dreamed big and they accomplished everything they needed to do, and we\u2019re thrilled to have them in the league. It\u2019s been an incredibly positive experience, and the players love it, too.\"",
      "More high-quality players are coming next year and into the future, though Armstrong cautioned that the lottery doesn't speed up the building process and, \u201cOne pick's not going to change our franchise.\u201d But that doesn't dull the internal excitement.",
      "\"You\u2019ve got a chance to get a real game-changer,\" Armstrong said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have the opportunity to pick a real good player high in the draft and take a big swing here.\u201d",

      "An attorney in the $2.8 billion legal case reshaping college sports says he thinks an updated agreement with the NCAA will solve the judge\u2019s concerns over roster limits that have delayed the settlement\u2019s approval",
      "An attorney in the $2.8 billion legal case reshaping college sports said Monday he thinks \u201cthe agreement we will reach with the NCAA will solve the judge's concerns\u201d over roster limits that have delayed final approval.",
      "Steve Berman, co-lead counsel for the defendants, told The Associated Press that all is on track to file paperwork by Wednesday, which is U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken's deadline for addressing concerns that prevented her from granting approval to the deal last month.",
      "Berman said he created a chart listing the several dozen athletes who lodged objections to the agreement based on roster limits. He said he thinks almost every one will be offered a solution.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still negotiating, and I\u2019m confident that everyone who lost a roster spot will have a chance to get a spot back,\u201d he said.",
      "He did not go into detail about whether those spots would be on their previous teams or new ones.",
      "NCAA vice president of external affairs Tim Buckley said the NCAA would not comment on the litigation while negotiations are ongoing.",
      "Wilken looked favorably on other key components of the settlement \u2014 namely, the up to $20.5 million some schools can pay their athletes for name, image likeness (NIL) deals and the nearly $2.8 billion in back pay that will go to players who said the NCAA and five biggest conferences wrongly kept them from earning NIL money.",
      "But she asked lawyers to rework the part of the deal that will replace scholarship limits with roster limits. It's a proposal that could make more overall scholarship money available but could cost thousands of athletes their spots on rosters in moves that began shortly after Wilken gave preliminary approval to the deal last fall.",
      "The NCAA's first response to Wilken's request \u2014 which included the idea of \u201cgrandfathering in\u201d current players to their roster spots \u2014 was to change nothing, arguing that undoing roster moves already in play would create more turmoil in an already chaotic process.",
      "Wilken wasn't moved, saying in her April 24 order that \u201cany disruption that may occur is a problem of Defendants\u2019 and NCAA members schools\u2019 own making.\u201d",
      "Berman acknowledged that the objectors likely wouldn't approve of the new deal being worked on.",
      "\u201cBut I don't think it's going to be a big deal,\u201d he said, because it is designed to find roster spots for virtually all the individual athletes who objected.",
      "Berman also criticized Nick Saban after reports emerged that the retired Alabama football coach was urging President Donald Trump to undo damage he says has been caused by all the money flowing into college sports.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported Trump is considering an executive order that would call for some sort of structure behind NIL compensation now going toward players who are now able to move more freely between schools.",
      "Berman said he believes an executive order would be subject to lawsuits \u201clike there are against so many of his other orders.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut here, the question is, \u2018Why does the president need to get involved?\u2019\" Berman said, while outlining the financial gains players have made in the NIL era. \u201cJust because Nick Saban thinks he knows better and resents change? This is a coach who made more money off college football than any other coach, did absolutely nothing to make it right for these student-athletes. Why should he drive the president's thinking?\u201d",
      "Saban, who made more than $11 million in his last year at Alabama and who some have said should become the commissioner of college football \u2014 a position that doesn't exist \u2014 has said he isn't completely against players making money.",
      "But he has argued for rules and laws to keep things from looking like the \u201cpay for play\u201d model that the NCAA hopes to avoid but that is often what NIL payments look like.",

      "The Baltimore Ravens are describing it as a football decision, and it came before the NFL completed its investigation into Justin Tucker.",
      "Whatever the underlying reasons, the team is moving on from its star kicker.",
      "The Ravens announced Monday they've decided to release Tucker, months after reports that he was accused of inappropriate sexual behavior by massage therapists. A five-time All-Pro, the 35-year-old Tucker has played his entire 13-year career with Baltimore. He's considered one of the best kickers in NFL history, although 2024 was his worst season.",
      "The Baltimore Banner has reported that over a dozen massage therapists have accused Tucker of inappropriate sexual behavior. The NFL said it would investigate, and the Ravens drafted kicker Tyler Loop late last month.",
      "\u201cSometimes football decisions are incredibly difficult, and this is one of those instances,\u201d Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said in a statement issued by the club. \u201cConsidering our current roster, we have made the tough decision to release Justin Tucker.\u201d",
      "That comment was consistent with what coach John Harbaugh said at rookie camp Sunday, when he indicated a decision on Tucker might come before the NFL completed its investigation.",
      "\u201cEvery decision we make has to be based on football,\u201d Harbaugh said. \"You\u2019ve got a rookie kicker in here. You took him in the sixth round, early in the sixth round. He\u2019s a talented guy. Just from a football standpoint \u2014 salary cap, all the different things that you just take into consideration \u2014 whatever we decide to do over the next few weeks will be based on football.\u201d",
      "Tucker has maintained he did not act inappropriately while receiving professional treatment. A message seeking comment was left with his publicist Monday.",
      "Tucker holds the record for the longest kick in NFL history at 66 yards, and his success rate of 89.1% on field goals is the best all-time among players with at least 100 attempts. He was the last remaining player on the Ravens from their most recent Super Bowl title, which occurred when he was a rookie.",
      "In 2022, he agreed to a four-year contract extension through the 2027 season. That deal included $17.5 million guaranteed.",
      "Tucker missed a career-high eight field goal attempts last season, although he rebounded a bit down the stretch. Then came the Banner's report in January that left his future in doubt.",
      "\u201cJustin created many significant and unforgettable moments in Ravens history,\u201d DeCosta said. \u201cHis reliability, focus, drive, resilience and extraordinary talent made him one of the league's best kickers for over a decade. We are grateful for Justin's many contributions while playing for the Ravens. We sincerely wish him and his family the very best in this next chapter of their lives.\u201d",

      "SAN ANTONIO -- Gregg Popovich spoke publicly Monday for the first time since suffering a stroke six months ago, saying at the news conference where the San Antonio Spurs formally introduced Mitch Johnson as his replacement that the time was right to make that move.",
      "Flanked by Spurs greats Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili, the 76-year-old Popovich \u2014 speaking far more softly than he has in the past \u2014 said his health is improving and that he fully believes in Johnson.",
      "\u201cThings are getting better by the day, but it\u2019s not good enough for what we plan ahead,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s time to make this change.\u201d",
      "Popovich will remain with the Spurs as team president, and the leadership of the team \u2014 including CEO R.C. Buford and general manager Brian Wright \u2014 isn't changing. Nor will the team's ideals, Popovich said.",
      "\u201cThat's the goal, to make sure we keep it going,\u201d Popovich said, adding that he will do everything he can to help Johnson going forward.",
      "Popovich removed his jacket before bringing Johnson to the podium, revealing a T-shirt with his new title: \u201cEl jefe,\u201d it said, the Spanish phrase for \u201cthe boss.\u201d",
      "\u201cI'm no longer coach,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cI'm 'El Jefe.'\u201d",
      "Johnson took his seat at a microphone moments later, not before Popovich reminded those present that \u201che's going to do a great job.\u201d",
      "Johnson looked in Popovich's direction and took a deep breath. \u201cI am honored by this opportunity and even more humbled by the people that I'll be able to partner with and serve,\u201d the new coach of the Spurs said.",
      "Popovich\u2019s public appearance was a bit of a surprise. Surrounded by a slew of Spurs past and present \u2014 Victor Wembanyama leading the way \u2014 Popovich walked into the practice facility shortly before managing partner Peter J. Holt spoke to open the news conference.",
      "Holt struggled to get words out at times, the emotion of the day very clear.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t be him or \u2018El Jefe,\u2019\u201d Johnson said when asked what he\u2019ll take from Popovich. \u201cBut to be able to commit and invest in people and relationships \u2014 that can be having to yell and hold someone accountable, and that can be to put your arm around someone\u2019s shoulder and love them \u2014 and he did it better than anybody that\u2019s ever walked the sidelines. And I will attempt to do it my way, whatever that looks like going forward.\u201d",
      "Popovich \u2014 the NBA's all-time wins leader, someone who coached the Spurs from 1996 until now and won five NBA titles in that span \u2014 spoke for about seven minutes, starting by cracking a few jokes, not uncommon for him.",
      "He also turned reflective, at times even a bit emotional. He suffered the stroke on Nov. 2, hours before the Spurs were playing the Minnesota Timberwolves that night. Johnson took over as acting coach for the final 77 games of the season and his promotion was formally announced Friday.",
      "\u201cI can never express the gratitude that I have for so many people caring about the organization and sending me thoughts and prayers, that sort of thing, since I had this stroke,\u201d Popovich said.",
      "Popovich also thanked several of those involved in his rehabilitation, some of whom were at Monday's news conference at the team's The Rock at La Cantera training facility.",
      "\u201cTimmy and Manu have been here for all of my workouts here at the Rock,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThey say it\u2019s because they love me and they want to be there in case I fall and they want to catch me, that sort of thing. I call it payback. They give the rehab people new ideas for things to do to me. They\u2019re not fooling anybody.\u201d",
      "Popovich thanked former players and coaches for being there, and noted that everyone in the Spurs organization \u2014 including the in-game time-out performers, those in the ticket office, custodians, window-washers and more \u2014 plays a role in the team\u2019s success. He also lauded the fans for their years of support, and vowed that the Spurs won\u2019t let them down.",
      "\u201cWe all have a part in this,\" Popovich said. \"It\u2019s not just the players and the coaches.\u201d",
      "The Spurs\u2019 core principles \u2014 doing things the right way, honoring continuity, always welcoming former players back into the fold \u2014 will remain in place, Johnson said.",
      "\u201cThe theme of the book isn\u2019t changing,\u201d Johnson said.",

    "story": [
      "More than a dozen states are suing the Trump administration for withholding funds from for the buildout of electric vehicle chargers across the U.S. The federal lawsuit says $5 billion allocated to states under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed ...",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Seventeen states are suing President Donald Trump 's administration for withholding billions of dollars in funding for the buildout of electric vehicle chargers, according to a federal lawsuit announced Wednesday.",
      "The move comes after the Trump administration in February directed states to stop spending money for electric vehicle charging infrastructure that was allocated under President Joe Biden. The program set out to allocate $5 billion over five years to states, of which an estimated $3.3 billion had already been made available.",
      "The lawsuit challenges the Federal Highway Administration's authority to halt the funding, said California Attorney General Rob Bonta's office. He led the suit alongside attorneys general from Colorado and Washington. They argue Congress, which approved the money in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, holds that authority.",
      "\u201cThe President continues to roll back environmental and climate change protections, this time illegally stripping away billions of dollars for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, all to line the pockets of his Big Oil friends,\u201d Bonta, a Democrat, said in a statement.",
      "Some states with projects running under the program have already been reimbursed by the federal government. Others are still contracting for their sites. Still others had halted their plans by the time the Trump administration ordered states to stop their spending. Regardless, getting these chargers installed and operating has been a slow process with contracting challenges, permitting delays and complex electrical upgrades.",
      "It was expected that states would fight against the federal government\u2019s efforts to slow the nation\u2019s electric vehicle charger buildout. New York, for example, part of the suit, has been awarded over $175 million in federal funds from the program, and state officials say $120 million is currently being withheld by the Trump administration.",
      "Even electric carmaker Tesla, run by Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency efforts, benefited greatly from funding under the program, receiving millions of dollars to expand its already-massive footprint of chargers in the U.S.",
      "Despite threats to the program, experts have said they expect the nation\u2019s EV charging buildout to continue as automakers look to make good on massive electrification ambitions.",
      "Consumers considering an EV cite concerns over charging infrastructure availability. Infrastructure remains a hurdle to adoption for people in multifamily dwellings, rural areas or what are otherwise known as \u201ccharging deserts,\u201d as well as people are without access to local or workplace charging, or who often drive longer highway routes.",
      "EVs stood at about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com, a sign the market is growing although the pace has slowed as the auto industry looks to convince mainstream buyers about choosing EVs. The program was meant to assuage some concerns and build infrastructure along highway corridors first, then address gaps elsewhere once the state highway obligations were met.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called withholding the funds illegal and said it would kill thousands of U.S. jobs \u2014 ceding them to China.",
      "\"Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon \u2014 and the nation \u2014 by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding,\u201d Newsom said, referencing Trump's recent purchase of a Tesla in a show of support for Musk.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to withdraw funding for electric vehicle chargers is part of a broader push to roll back environmental policies advanced under Biden.",
      "During the Republican president\u2019s first week back in office, he signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again, reverse a 2030 target for electric vehicles to make up half of new cars sold, and end environmental justice efforts. At the same time, federal agencies under Trump have rolled back key rules and regulations and supported the build-out of the fossil fuel industry.",
      "The U.S. House also advanced proposals last week aimed at blocking California from enforcing vehicle-emission rules, including a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The Senate parliamentarian says the California policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",

      "A new study out in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment finds that wildfires fueled by climate change are linked to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic burden",
      "Wildfires driven by climate change contribute to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic costs from wildfire smoke in the United States, according to a new study.",
      "The paper, published Friday in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment, found that from 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to about 15,000 deaths from exposure to small particulate matter from wildfires and cost about $160 billion. The annual range of deaths was 130 to 5,100, the study showed, with the highest in states such as Oregon and California.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more of these wildfire smoke events,\u201d said Nicholas Nassikas, a study author and a physician and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. So he and multidisciplinary team of researchers wanted to know: \"What does it really mean in a changing environment for things like mortality, which is kind of the worst possible health outcome?\u201d",
      "Lisa Thompson, a professor at Emory University who studies air pollution and climate change and was not involved in the paper, said it is one of the first studies she has seen to isolate the effect of climate change on mortality. Looking at the impacts across time and space also made it unique, she said.",
      "The paper's researchers focused on deaths linked to exposure to fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 \u2014 the main concern from wildfire smoke.",
      "These particles can lodge deep into lungs and trigger coughing and itchy eyes with short-term exposure. But longer term they can make existing health problems worse and lead to a range of chronic and deadly health issues. Children, pregnant people, the elderly and outdoor workers are among the most vulnerable. The Health Effects Institute estimated the pollutant caused 4 million deaths worldwide.",
      "Evidence is emerging that PM2.5 from wildfire smoke is more toxic than other pollution sources. When wildfires encroach into cities, burning cars and other toxics-containing materials, it adds to the danger.",
      "Numerous studies have tied human-caused climate change \u2014 caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas \u2014 to a growth in fires in North America. Global warming is increasing drought, especially in the West, and other extreme weather. Drier conditions suck moisture from plants, which act as fuel for fires. When drier vegetation and seasons are mixed with hotter temperatures, that increases the frequency, extent and severity of wildfires and the smoke they spew.",
      "Jacob Bendix, professor emeritus of geography and environment at Syracuse University, said he was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the findings but not surprised.",
      "\u201c(T) hese numbers are really significant. I think there\u2019s a tendency for people outside of the areas actually burning to see increasing fires as a distant inconvenience \u2026 This study drives home how far-reaching the impacts are,\u201d said Bendix in an email. He wasn't involved in the study.",
      "The study\u2019s authors drew on modeled and existing data to reach their findings. First, they sought to understand how much area burned by wildfires was attributable to climate change. They did that by analyzing the real climate conditions \u2014 heat and rain, for instance \u2014 when wildfires erupted from 2006 to 2020, and compared that to a scenario where weather measurements would be different without climate change.",
      "From there, they estimated the levels of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke tied to climate change using the same approach. Lastly, integrating the current understanding of how particulate matter affects mortality based on published research, they quantified the number of deaths related to PM2.5 from wildfires and calculated their economic impact.",
      "This framework showed that of 164,000 deaths related to wildfire-PM2.5 exposure from 2006 to 2020, 10% were attributable to climate change. The mortalities were 30% to 50% higher in some western states and counties.",
      "Marshall Burke, global environmental policy professor at Stanford University, said the evidence linking climate change to burned areas was \u201crock solid,\u201d but the subsequent steps were harder.",
      "\u201cLinking burned area to smoke is trickier because you never know exactly which way the wind\u2019s going to blow,\u201d he said, and he wondered how the death estimates compared to fatalities tied to general air pollution.",
      "Still, their approach was sensible and reasonable, Burke said.",
      "Johns Hopkins University lecturer in climate and energy policy Patrick Brown said he had some concerns about the study. One was conceptual. The study acknowledges the power non-climate drivers have on wildfires, but it doesn't give them proper weight, he said in an email.",
      "Brown, who was not involved in the study, worries decision-makers could wrongly conclude that mitigating planet-warming carbon emissions is the only solution. \u201cYet in many regions, the more immediate life\u2011saving action may be fuel breaks, prescribed burns, ignition\u2011source regulation, public health efforts, etc.,\u201d he said.",
      "Land management practices such as prescribed burns can reduce wildfire fuel, Nassikas said. But ultimately, the study notes, the problem of deaths from wildfire smoke will only get worse without the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\u201cPart of the study is raising awareness,\" he said. \u201cAnd then once we kind of understand that \u2026 now what are the interventions that we can deploy at a personal level, at a community level, and then obviously at a larger level across the country and across the world?\u201d",

      "Skype users are scrambling to find an alternative after Microsoft shut down the pioneering internet phone service which let people make cheap long distance calls and chat with other users",
      "LONDON -- Skype is dead. What now?",
      "Microsoft's shutdown of Skype on May 5 sent millions of users scrambling to find an alternative to the pioneering internet phone service.",
      "Skype, which Microsoft bought in 2011, was beloved by a dwindling group of users who appreciated how it let them make cheap long-distance calls as well as communicate with other users through chat messages, voice or video calls.",
      "Some liked its simplicity and ease of use \u2014 an advantage, for example, when setting up a communications app for an elderly parent living far away.",
      "Or they just used it out of habit.",
      "Skype was founded in 2003 and was among the first in a wave of communication services that used voice over internet protocol technology (VoIP), which converts audio into a digital signal.",
      "Skype's disappearance also inconveniences Americans and other expatriates living overseas who signed up because they needed an U.S.-based number to receive text authentication codes from, say, a bank back home. It was also handy for calling 800 numbers for free even if you weren't living in North America.",
      "Here is a guide for life after Skype:",
      "Microsoft announced in late February that it was shutting down Skype on May 5 and shifting some of its services to Microsoft Teams, its flagship office videoconferencing and group collaboration platform.",
      "Skype users can use their existing accounts to log into Teams and have the option to automatically migrate their contacts and chats.",
      "If you had a Skype number or a calling subscription, it stopped automatically renewing on April 3.",
      "If your account still has credit, you can access Skype's dial pad from the web portal or Teams to make calls.",
      "Skype numbers won't immediately expire on May 5 so you'll still be able to receive calls until your subscription expires. But you'll have to use Teams or keep the Skype dial pad open on the web portal to receive them.",
      "If your Skype number hasn't expired and you don't want to lose it, you should transfer it to another provider.",
      "Skype numbers can be ported to a phone carrier or any number of other VoIP services. But you'll have to start the process through the new provider, not Skype.",
      "Google users can access the online search giant's internet phone service to make calls from a smartphone or a desktop web browser. You can get your own Google Voice phone number and use features like call forwarding and voicemail. Or you can port your number from another service like Skype, but it will cost $20.",
      "Calls to U.S., Canadian or Puerto Rican numbers are free. Rates for other countries vary.",
      "The free version of Google Voice is only available to U.S. residents physically located in the 48 contiguous states, so that means expatriate Americans can only use it if they registered before they moved overseas.",
      "\u201cYou cannot sign up for a Google Voice number while outside the USA,\u201d according to a help page. \u201cDo not try to circumvent this by using a VPN.\u201d",
      "Owned by Japan's Rakuten, Viber was long considered one of the closest competitors to Skype. One key difference is that Skype users don't need a phone number and are identified by their usernames, while Viber users need a number to register for service.",
      "Similar to Skype, Viber users can buy credit or packages to call phone numbers around the world but it's no longer possible to get a Viber number to receive calls.",
      "The videoconferencing service that\u2019s become a byword for online company meetings offers a calling service, Zoom Phone, and features like number porting and the ability to send and receive SMS text messages.",
      "Take note that Zoom Phone isn't free. There are various calling plans that involve a monthly subscription cost and extra fees for international calls.",
      "Microsoft users have the option of making calls on Teams, dubbed Teams Phone. Like Zoom Phone, you'll need to buy a subscription and pay extra for international calls.",
      "But it's not an option for regular people because Microsoft says Teams Phone isn't for consumer use and is only available to small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "If you absolutely need a U.S. number but live overseas, sign up for service with a low-cost virtual wireless carrier that offers cheap cellphone plans or pay-as-you-go rates.",
      "One provider, Tello, offers monthly plans for as little as $5 and says users can activate its service even if they're living outside the U.S.",
      "Because mobile virtual network operators like Tello are essentially wireless phone companies that piggyback off a bigger carrier's physical network, you can't use it to make calls on a computer or an app.",
      "There are a slew of Skype pretenders offering phone calls over the internet, such as Zoiper, VoIP.ms, CallCentric, Mytello, and Virtual Landline. Many are aimed at business users.",
      "Some are capitalizing on Skype\u2019s disappearance. Hushed, which started as an anonymous calling app, bills itself as a Skype alternative. Users can buy a phone number from the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom or Puerto Rico or port their own number.",
      "It warns that some of its numbers aren't guaranteed to work with third-party verification text messages.",
      "\u201cWe do not intentionally block anyone from receiving these codes, but it\u2019s common that some services will prevent verification texts from being sent to certain phone numbers due to their own security policies,\" Hushed says on its website.",
      "Maybe you can't decide which calling service you want to switch to. If you want to save your current number, there are services to just park your number like NumberBarn.com and Parkmyphone.com.",
      "They let you store a phone number for a monthly fee while relaying any text messages sent to that number. You can port the number to another service whenever you want.",
      "Beware, you can only port in U.S. or Canadian phone numbers.",
      "What about an international eSIM? They're the virtual version of the mobile phone SIM card that you can buy and add to your phone when you're on a trip to save on roaming fees.",
      "They offer cheap data access rates so you can use the internet without worrying about racking up a huge bill when you get home.",
      "Unfortunately, you can't port a Skype number to an international eSIM because of \u201cthe fundamental differences\" between VoIP services and traditional mobile networks, said Pedro Maiquez, co-founder of eSIM provider Holafly. \u201cSkype numbers are not tied to a mobile carrier\u2019s physical infrastructure, making them incompatible with mobile eSIM solutions.\"",

      "The U.S. Justice Department is doubling down on its attempt to break up Google by asking it to give up the underlying technology powering the company\u2019s digital ad network",
      "The U.S. Justice Department is doubling down on its attempt to break up Google by asking it to give up the underlying technology powering the company's digital ad network. The proposed remedy joins a separate federal effort to separate the Chrome browser from its dominant search engine.",
      "The government's latest proposal was filed late Monday in a Virginia federal court two-and-half weeks after a federal judge ruled that parts of its lucrative digital ad network have been improperly abusing its market power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers.",
      "In a 17-page filing, Justice Department lawyers argued that U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema should punish Google by ordering the company to offload its AdX business and DFP ad platform, tools that bring together advertisers, who want to market their products, and publishers, who want to sell commercial space on their sites, to bring in revenue.",
      "Not surprisingly, it's an idea that Google vehemently plans to oppose when the penalty phase of the antitrust case \u2014known as remedy hearings \u2014 begins in late September. Google already has vowed to appeal Brinkema's ruling that the technology powering the ad network has been breaking the law, but can't do that until the judge rules on its punishment in a decision expected late this year or early next year.",
      "Google said in its own filing Monday that divestiture of AdX and DFP wouldn\u2019t be technically feasible because neither piece of technology is capable of working outside of Google's proprietary infrastructure. The company proposed its own remedies to restore competition, and reiterated its intent to appeal the ruling.",
      "\u201cDivestiture is not as simple as selling either the AdX or DFP source code to a willing buyer,\u201d Google wrote.",
      "The attempt to tear down Google's ad network comes on top of the Justice Department's ongoing effort to have the company part with its popular Chrome browser and impose other restrictions to curtail the power of its ubiquitous search engine, which another federal judge branded an illegal monopoly in a ruling last August.",
      "The remedy hearings in the search case are scheduled to conclude later this month, with a ruling from U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta expected by Labor Day.",
      "If the Justice Department is able to persuade the two different judges to order its proposed dismantling of Google, it would be the biggest breakup of a U.S. company since AT&T was forced to spin off its phone service into seven separate regional companies more than 40 years ago.",
      "Google's Play Store for apps running on its Android software that powers most of the world's smartphones also was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal jury in 2023 and is battling a judge's order that would require it to overhaul a commission system that generates billions of dollars in annual revenue.",
      "But hobbling its search engine and digital ad network would be far bigger blows because they are the key cogs in a business that generated $265 billion in revenue last year.",
      "Google is confronting the breakup threats at the same time the advent of artificial intelligence is changing the way consumers are using technology and seeking information online \u2014 a shift that could also siphon traffic and money away from a powerhouse that began in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Despite the adversity, Google is still delivering robust financial growth to its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., which is currently valued at $2 trillion.",

      "Pananastasiou told The Associated Press that Cyprus would soon have the capacity to generate around four gigawatts of electricity from fossil fuels as well as solar and wind sources, while consuming only 0.5 GW.",
      "Wind turbines and photovoltaics generate 1 GW of electricity, but licenses have been issued for construction of new wind and solar energy parks with a capacity of 2.8 GW. Conventional fuels generate 1.4 GW.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- In a country celebrated for its ancient wisdom, Greece is offering a modern solution to a pressing household challenge: empowering parents to oversee their children\u2019s online activity.",
      "On Monday, the government launched a state-operated mobile app, marking one of Europe\u2019s most assertive steps toward digital age verification.",
      "Kids Wallet, now available on iOS and Android, gives parents tools to verify their children\u2019s ages on digital platforms and monitor their browsing activity, officials said.",
      "\u201cThis is an application that Greece \u2014 and Europe \u2014 needs to confirm children\u2019s ages when they use social media,\u201d said Digital Governance Minister Dimitris Papastergiou. \u201cIt will also serve as an identification tool for upcoming initiatives.\u201d",
      "Unlike stricter approaches adopted in some European countries, Greece has made the app\u2019s use voluntary, though officials argue it offers more powerful controls. The initiative aligns with broader EU-wide efforts to standardize age verification across member states.",
      "The app is integrated with Greece\u2019s government services platform, already widely used to pay taxes, navigate bureaucracy, and even buy soccer tickets, and works with existing digital ID systems for adults.",

      "Judges in several states may soon get a new tool to stop dangerous drivers from speeding again",
      "A teenager who admitted being \u201caddicted to speed\u201d behind the wheel had totaled two other cars in the year before he slammed into a minivan at 112 mph (180 kph) in a Seattle suburb, killing the driver and three of the five children she was transporting for a homeschool co-op.",
      "After sentencing Chase Daniel Jones last month to more than 17 years in prison, the judge tacked on a novel condition should he drive again: His vehicle must be equipped with a device that prevents accelerating far beyond the speed limit.",
      "Virginia this year became the first state to give its judges such a tool to deal with the most dangerous drivers on the road. Washington, D.C., already is using it and similar measures await governors' signatures in Washington state and Georgia. New York and California also could soon tap the GPS-based technology to help combat a recent national spike in traffic deaths.",
      "\u201cIt's a horror no one should have to experience,\u201d said Amy Cohen, who founded the victims' advocacy group Families for Safe Streets after her 12-year-old son, Sammy Cohen Eckstein, was killed by a speeding driver in front of their New York home more than a decade ago.",
      "Andrea Hudson, 38, the minivan driver who was killed when Jones ran a red light, was building a backyard greenhouse with her husband to help educate several kids who shuttle between homes during the school day, her father, Ted Smith, said.",
      "Also killed in the March 2024 crash near Hudson's home in Renton, Washington, were Boyd \u201cBuster\u201d Brown and Eloise Wilcoxson, both 12, and Matilda Wilcoxson, 13. Hudson's two children were sitting on the passenger side and survived, but they spent weeks in a hospital.",
      "\u201cYou always hear of these horrific accidents, and it\u2019s always far away, you don\u2019t know anybody. But all of a sudden, that\u2019s my daughter,\" Smith said. \u201cThis guy did not swerve or brake. And it was just a missile.\u201d",
      "Smith knew Washington state Rep. Mari Leavitt, who reached out to offer condolences and tell him she was sponsoring legislation to mandate intelligent speed assistance devices as a condition for habitual speeders to get back their suspended licenses.",
      "Leavitt predicts it will have an even more powerful impact than revoking driving privileges, citing studies showing around three-quarters of people who lose their licenses get behind a wheel anyway.",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, the state saw a 200% increase in drivers cited for going at least 50 mph (80 kph) over the speed limit, according to the Washington Traffic Safety Commission.",
      "\u201cI guess I don\u2019t understand why someone is compelled to want to drive that fast,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cBut if they choose to drive that fast with the speed limiter, they can\u2019t. It's going to stop them in their tracks.\u201d",
      "The measure, which Washington legislators passed last month and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson is expected to soon sign, is called the BEAM Act, using the first letters of the names of the four victims: Buster, Eloise, Andrea and Matilda.",
      "Because Jones, 19, didn't receive a speeding ticket in his two previous crashes, he likely wouldn't have been required to use the speed-limiter ahead of the fatal one. And because it could be 2029 before the law takes effect, the judge's requirement at sentencing only applies to his time on probation after being released from prison, Smith said.",
      "Competing tech companies that joined forces to lobby for ignition interlock requirements for drunken drivers have been working in unison again the last few years to pitch intelligent speed assistance.",
      "Brandy Nannini, chief government affairs officer at one manufacturer, Grapevine, Texas-based Smart Start, said fleet vehicles including school buses in the nation's capital have been trying it out for years.",
      "But it took a lot of refinement before the GPS technology could instantly recognize speed limit changes and compel vehicles with the devices installed to adjust accordingly.",
      "\u201cWe've got a lot more satellites in the sky now,\u201d said Ken Denton, a retired police officer who is the chief compliance officer at Cincinnati-based LifeSafer, part of the coalition of companies.",
      "When court-mandated, the devices would prevent cars from exceeding speed limits or whatever threshold regulators set. An override button allows speeding in emergencies, but states can decide whether to activate it and authorities would be alerted any time the button is pushed.",
      "A more passive version, which beeps to alert drivers when they are going too fast, is required for new cars in the European Union. California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a similar proposal last year, explaining vehicle safety requirements are set by the federal government and he was concerned a patchwork of state laws could stir confusion.",
      "Before Del. Patrick Hope agreed to sponsor the proposal in the Virginia Legislature, he tried out the device in Nannini's car, which was calibrated to not go more than 9 mph (14 kph) over the speed limit.",
      "\u201cThat was my first question: Is it safe?\u201d Hope said.",
      "Not only did he come away convinced it was safe, Hope is now pondering whether to install it on the cars of his three children, all of whom are new drivers.",
      "For those mandated by a court, the price could be hefty: $4 per day and a $100 installation fee. The fee would be reduced for low-income offenders.",
      "Cohen with Families for Safe Streets, which provides support services to the loved ones of crash victims, knows firsthand the kind of impact slowing down speeders can make. A year after her son was struck and killed in front of their New York apartment, another boy was injured in the same spot.",
      "By then, the road's speed limit had been lowered.",
      "\u201cThat boy lived when he was hit, and mine did not,\u201d she said. \"When you are going a few miles slower, there's more time to stop. And when you hit somebody, it's much less likely to be deadly.\u201d",

      "The release of Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed again \u2014 until May 26, 2026",
      "BOSTON -- Fans of the hugely popular video game series Grand Theft Auto will have to wait a little longer to play the latest version.",
      "In a post on X Friday, Rockstar Games said it delayed the launch of Grand Theft Auto VI until May 26, 2026. It apologized for the delay of a game, the release of which has been talked about for several years. It didn't provide any specifics on why the release date has been pushed back from fall of this year.",
      "\u201cWith every game we have released, the goal has been to try and exceed your expectations and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe hope you understand we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.\u201d",
      "Shares of Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar\u2019s parent company, fell Friday by nearly 7%.",
      "Strauss Zelnick, the chairman and CEO for Take-Two Interactive Software, stood by Rockstar in a statement and said it supports the company taking additional time to realize their creative vision. He said it still expects a \u201cgroundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence,\u201d Zelnick said in a statement. \"As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders.\u201d",
      "Fans of the game reacted to the delay with disappointment but also a shrug -- since it has been suggested the game would be released in 2024 and then this year.",
      "On a Reddit discussion forum dedicated to the game, several fans noted they had seen this before and wouldn't be surprised if the release was delayed again. Others took a more optimistic tone, saying an exact release date means it will actually happen this time around.",
      "One of the last times the game garnered this much buzz was in 2023, when a trailer for the game was leaked online. At the time, Rockstar released the first look of the sixth game 15 hours earlier than planned, citing the leak.",
      "That 90-second trailer gave fans a taste of what comes next for the game. The trailer suggested the next installment would be set in the Miami-inspired Vice City and star a female protagonist, a first for the franchise, named Lucia.",
      "It is unclear whether the delay means any, or all, of these details will remain part of Grand Theft Auto VI.",

      "Two major scientific societies say they will fill the void from the Trump administration\u2019s dismissal of scientists writing a cornerstone federal report on what climate change is doing to the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two major scientific societies on Friday said they will fill the void from the Trump administration's dismissal of scientists writing a cornerstone federal report on what climate change is doing to the United States.",
      "The American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union said they will work together to produce peer-reviewed research documents assessing the current and future national impacts of climate change because a science-based report required by law is suddenly in question and being reassessed by President Donald Trump's White House.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump's Republican administration told about 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment that they were no longer needed and that the report was being reevaluated. That report, coming once every four to five years, is required by a 1990 federal law and was due out around 2027. Preliminary budget documents show slashing funding or eliminating offices involved in coordinating that report, scientists and activists said.",
      "\u201cWe are filling in a gap in the scientific process,\u201d AGU President Brandon Jones said. \u201cIt's more about ensuring that science continues.\u201d",
      "Meteorological society past president Anjuli Bamzi, a retired federal atmospheric scientist who has worked on previous National Climate Assessments, said one of the most important parts of the federal report is that it projects 25 and 100 years into the future.",
      "With the assessment \u201cwe're better equipped to deal with the future,\u201d Bamzi said. \u201cWe can't be an ostrich and put our head in the sand and let it go.\u201d",
      "Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, also chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy, said the two organizations joining to do this report \u201cis a testament to how important it is that the latest science be summarized and available.\u201d",
      "Hayhoe, who was a lead author of reports in 2009, 2018 and 2023, said \u201cpeople are not aware of how climate change is impacting the decisions that they are making today, whether it\u2019s the size of the storm sewer pipes they\u2019re installing, whether it is the expansion of the flood zone where people are building, whether it is the increases in extreme heat.\"",
      "They need that knowledge to figure out how to adapt to harms in the future and even the present, Hayhoe said.",
      "The national assessment, unlike global United Nations documents, highlights what\u2019s happening to weather not just in the nation but at regional and local levels.",
      "Jones said he hopes the societies' version of the assessment can be done in just one year.",
      "The last climate assessment report, released in 2023, said that climate change is \u201dharming physical, mental, spiritual, and community health and well-being through the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events, increasing cases of infectious and vector-borne diseases, and declines in food and water quality and security.\"",
      "In 2018, during Trump's first term, the assessment was just as blunt, saying: \"Climate change creates new risks and exacerbates existing vulnerabilities in communities across the United States, presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth.\"",
      "But University of Illinois climate scientist Donald Wuebbles, who led one of 2018's two national reports, said he worries about what kind of document this new administration will try to issue, if any.",
      "\u201cI think they'll put out something that will, like, it'll be be scientifically based, but it will be pretty crappy,\u201d Wuebbles told The Associated Press.",
      "Watering down or killing the national assessment will not keep the message about the importance of climate change from getting out, Wuebbles said. The scientific societies' efforts to fill the void will have some value because it will be a statement of the scientific community, and, in the end, he said, science is about data and observations.",
      "\u201cWe know this is an extremely important problem. We know it is human activities driving it. So the question is: What do you do about it?\u201d Wuebbles said.",
      "Storms and wildfires don't care if it's a red state or a blue state, Hayhoe said.",
      "\u201cClimate change affects us all,\u201d Hayhoe said. \u201cIt doesn't matter how we vote.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Wisconsin man has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times, and scientists are studying his blood to treat snakebite",
      "NEW YORK -- Tim Friede has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times \u2014 often on purpose. Now scientists are studying his blood in hopes of creating a better treatment for snake bites.",
      "Friede has long had a fascination with reptiles and other venomous creatures. He used to milk scorpions' and spiders' venom as a hobby and kept dozens of snakes at his Wisconsin home.",
      "Hoping to protect himself from snake bites \u2014 and out of what he calls \u201csimple curiosity\u201d \u2014 he began injecting himself with small doses of snake venom and then slowly increased the amount to try to build up tolerance. He would then let snakes bite him.",
      "\u201cAt first, it was very scary,\" Friede said. \u201cBut the more you do it, the better you get at it, the more calm you become with it.\u201d",
      "While no doctor or emergency medical technician \u2014 or anyone, really \u2014 would ever suggest this is a remotely good idea, experts say his method tracks how the body works. When the immune system is exposed to the toxins in snake venom, it develops antibodies that can neutralize the poison. If it's a small amount of venom the body can react before it's overwhelmed. And if it's venom the body has seen before, it can react more quickly and handle larger exposures.",
      "Friede has withstood snakebites and injections for nearly two decades and still has a refrigerator full of venom. In videos posted to his YouTube channel, he shows off swollen fang marks on his arms from black mamba, taipan and water cobra bites.",
      "\u201cI wanted to push the limits as close to death as possible to where I\u2019m just basically teetering right there and then back off of it,\" he said.",
      "But Friede also wanted to help. He emailed every scientist he could find, asking them to study the tolerance he'd built up.",
      "And there is a need: Around 110,000 people die from snakebite every year, according to the World Health Organization. And making antivenom is expensive and difficult. It is often created by injecting large mammals like horses with venom and collecting the antibodies they produce. These antivenoms are usually only effective against specific snake species, and can sometimes produce bad reactions due to their nonhuman origins.",
      "When Columbia University's Peter Kwong heard of Friede, he said, \u201cOh, wow, this is very unusual. We had a very special individual with amazing antibodies that he created over 18 years.\u201d",
      "In a study published Friday in the journal Cell, Kwong and collaborators shared what they were able to do with Friede's unique blood: They identified two antibodies that neutralize venom from many different snake species with the aim of someday producing a treatment that could offer broad protection.",
      "It's very early research \u2014 the antivenom was only tested in mice, and researchers are still years away from human trials. And while their experimental treatment shows promise against the group of snakes that include mambas and cobras, it's not effective against vipers, which include snakes like rattlers.",
      "\u201cDespite the promise, there is much work to do,\u201d said Nicholas Casewell, a snakebite researcher at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in an email. Casewell was not involved with the new study.",
      "Friede's journey has not been without its missteps. Among them: He said after one bad snake bite he had to cut off part of his finger. And some particularly nasty cobra bites sent him to the hospital.",
      "Friede is now employed by Centivax, which is trying to develop the treatment, and he's excited that his 18-year odyssey could one day save lives from snakebite. But his message to those inspired to follow in his footsteps is quite simple: \u201cDon't do it,\" he said.",

      "Last Friday, it also said it would no longer be able to take orders through its website or app in order to deal with the problem. And the company, which has around 65,000 employees, has been unable to hire new workers after pulling job postings from its website.",
      "London's Metropolitan Police force has launched an investigation into the attack on M&S.",

      "\u201cComing on the heels of recent breaches at Co-op and M&S, it highlights an alarming trend,\" said Cody Barrow, chief executive of cybersecurity experts EclecticIQ. \u201cThe flurry of attacks showed cybercriminals are becoming bolder, exploiting weaknesses across complex, highly interconnected supply chains.\u201d",
      "Experts are saying that generative artificial intelligence is accelerating the threat landscape, and that firms and individuals have to stay on top of developments and shore up their defenses against cyberattacks.",
      "The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre said that it was working with organizations affected as well as providing expert advice to others in the sector.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus in the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth, possibly within the first two weeks of May.",
      "It\u2019s too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph (242 kph), if it remains intact.",
      "\u201cWhile not without risk, we should not be too worried,\u201d Langbroek said in an email.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\u201d",
      "The Soviet Union launched the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus (nearly 500-kilogram) spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics' Jonathan McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \u201cit'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\u201d",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, \u201cchances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,\u201d Langbroek said.",

    "story": [
      "Trump has called on the Fed to lower rates, despite its political independence.",
      "The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, just weeks after President Donald Trump intensified calls for lower borrowing costs and voiced eagerness about the potential \"termination\" of Fed Chair Jerome Powell.",
      "In recent days, Trump has dialed back his attacks on Powell, saying he will not fire Powell before the end of the top central banker's term next year. Trump has reiterated his displeasure with the level of interest rates, however, urging the central bank to lower them.",
      "Speaking at a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Powell said the economy remains in \"solid shape\" but warned Trump's tariff policy could cause higher inflation and an economic slowdown.",
      "\"If the large increase in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they're likely to generate a rise in inflation and a slowdown of economic growth,\" Powell said Wednesday.",
      "\"All of these policies are evolving, however, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain,\" Powell added.",
      "When asked about Trump's call for lower rates, Powell shrugged off criticism from the president.",
      "\"It doesn\u2019t affect our doing our job at all,\" Powell said. \"We\u2019re always going to consider only the economic data, the outlook, the balance of risks \u2013 and that\u2019s it.\"",
      "The move marked the Fed's second consecutive decision to maintain the current level of interest rates, repeating an approach taken in January. Before that, the Fed had cut rates at three consecutive meetings.",
      "\"For now, it does seem like a fairly clear decision for us to wait and see,\" Powell said.",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), a policymaking body at the Fed, said Wednesday that key economic indicators had improved but it cautioned of heightened economic uncertainty.",
      "\"Risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen,\" the FOMC said in a statement.",
      "Last month, Powell raised the possibility that Trump's tariffs may cause what economists call \"stagflation,\" which is when inflation rises and the economy slows.",
      "If the Fed raises interest rates as a means of protecting against tariff-induced inflation under such a scenario, it risks stifling borrowing and slowing the economy further. On the other hand, if the Fed lowers rates to stimulate the economy in the face of a potential slowdown, it threatens to boost spending and worsen inflation.",
      "Still, Powell pointed to solid economic performance as a reason to take a patient approach as policymakers await the impact of tariffs.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well-positioned to wait for greater clarity,\" Powell told an audience at the Economic Club of Chicago.",
      "Powell noted the possibility of a shift in economic conditions, saying, \"Life moves pretty fast.\"",
      "The rate decision arrives days after fresh data showed robust job growth in April.",
      "Despite flagging consumer sentiment and market turmoil, the labor market has provided a bright spot since Trump took office. Meanwhile, inflation cooled in March, the most recent month for which data is available.",
      "Even so, recession fears are mounting on Wall Street as Trump's tariffs threaten to upend global trade. Goldman Sachs earlier this month hiked its odds of a recession from 35% to 45%. JPMorgan pegged the probability of a recession this year at 60%.",
      "A government report last week showed the U.S. economy shrank over the first three months of 2025, much of which took place as Trump's flurry of tariff proposals stoked uncertainty among businesses and consumers.",
      "U.S. gross domestic product, or GDP, declined at a 0.3% annualized rate over three months ending in March, according to government data released on Wednesday. The figure marked a sharp dropoff from 2.4% annualized growth over the final three months of 2024.",
      "The rate decision on Wednesday also marks the first adjustment of borrowing costs since Trump's closely watched \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2, which triggered the biggest single-day stock market drop since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Days later, Trump suspended a major swathe of the tariffs, sending the market to one of its largest ever single-day increases. A simultaneous escalation of tariffs on Chinese goods kept the effective tariff rate at its highest level in more than a century, the Yale Budget Lab found.",
      "The White House is seeking to strike trade agreements with dozens of U.S. trade partners before the 90-day suspension of so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" expires in July.",
      "\"As we gain a better understanding of the policy changes, we will have a better sense of the implications for the economy,\" Powell said last month.",

      "U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein on Tuesday granted a preliminary injunction in the case of two plaintiffs identified by their initials, GFF and JGO, who were pulled off planes to El Salvador and transferred back to New York from Texas, where they had been detained on suspicion of alignment with the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.",

      "The Trump administration has invoked the Alien Enemies Act -- an 18th century wartime authority used to remove noncitizens with little-to-no due process -- to deport alleged migrant gang members by arguing that Tren de Aragua is a \"hybrid criminal state\" that is invading the United States.",

      "Ferguson also signed nine other bills to help homeowners and renters. He said when he campaigned for governor, affordable housing was the top issue voters raised, so he supports bills to help make it easier to secure housing.",

      "Sending noncitizens to Libya or Saudi Arabia without giving them a chance to raise concerns about their safety \"blatantly defies this Court's preliminary injunctions,\" lawyers representing the migrants argued in an emergency motion filed in federal court in Boston, where U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy last month issued a preliminary injunction barring the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens to any country other than their place of origin without due process.",
      "In his order Wednesday, Judge Murphy clarified that any \"allegedly imminent removals\" to a country like Libya or Saudi Arabia would violate the preliminary injunction he issued last month.",

      "\"Any Class Member who is removed to Libya faces a strong likelihood of imprisonment followed by torture and even disappearance or death,\" the plaintiffs' motion said. \"Indeed, given Libya's human rights record, it is inconceivable that Class Members from other countries would ever agree to removal to Libya, but instead would uniformly seek protection from being removed to Libya.\"",
      "To support their application for the emergency order, lawyers representing the noncitizens included a series of exhibits showing the scramble that played out over the last day as the attorneys sought to determine if any of their clients were bound for Libya. According to the lawyers, Laotian, Vietnamese and Philippine immigrants are at risk of removal.",
      "According to two lawyers whose correspondence was included as exhibits, their clients were informed that they would be removed to Libya and were asked to sign documents agreeing to the deportations. When one of the men and a group of other migrants declined to sign the document, they were allegedly handcuffed in separate rooms \"in order to get them to sign it,\" according to one lawyer.",

      "The letter -- delivered on Tuesday from Sens. Jeff Merkley (D- Ore.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) -- expressed concern over the IHS' ability to take care for more than 2.8 million American Indians and Alaska Natives.",

      "D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said she was \"disturbed\" by the reports.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted raids targeting businesses in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, sources confirmed to ABC News.",
      "A coalition of activists had warned delivery drivers and restaurants of the planned enforcement one day prior.",
      "\"I have heard those reports, I've been getting them all morning. I am disturbed by them,\" Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters on Tuesday. \"It appears that ICE is at restaurants or even in neighborhoods, and it doesn't look like they're targeting criminals. It is disrupting.\"",
      "She also emphasized that the Metropolitan Police Department was not involved.",
      "Multiple sources told ABC News that federal law enforcement officials visited dozens of restaurants, carry-out spots and bars across several neighborhoods in Washington, including U Street, 14th Street, Chinatown, Dupont Circle and Mount Vernon Triangle. The visits spanned a wide range of establishments, from fast-casual spots to fine-dining restaurants and luxury cocktail bars, reflecting the breadth of the operation.",
      "At many restaurants, agents distributed information and pamphlets requesting to see I-9 forms to verify the identities and employment authorizations for all employees dating back to one year ago. Some restaurants were told that federal officials would return in three days.\u2028Following Tuesday's visits, some restaurant owners chose to close preemptively.",
      "George Escobar, chief of programs and services at CASA, an organization geared toward improving the quality of life for the working class, told ABC News on Tuesday that the organization regularly receives tips about planned raids -- but that this one was different.",
      "\"This one, to be honest, alarmed us a little bit because it was really specific,\" Escobar said.",
      "The organization has run a 24-hour tip hot line since the first Trump administration.",
      "\"We're experienced. We don't get alarmed by, like, you know, any old threat because, you know, they're frequent, right? And they come in all different types of forms,\" he said.",
      "However, in this instance, CASA was warned that ICE would be using President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at the \"beautification\" of Washington, D.C., to justify the raids, Escobar said.",
      "\"We received notice about a specific kind of operation on how they were going to be conducted: what the pretense of maybe entering some of these small businesses were going to be, the fact that they were looking specifically at food businesses and possibly delivery workers,\" he explained.",
      "ABC News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for comment but did not receive a response.",
      "\"If ICE wants to snatch up every single immigrant working in food service and delivery, then the entire industry will collapse,\" Amy Fischer, a core organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network, which supports migrants arriving in the capital, said in a statement.",
      "The Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington, which represents the more than 60,000 restaurant workers in the area, said in a statement shared with ABC News that it is \"deeply concerned\" by the reports of ICE raids and drop-ins across Washington, D.C.",
      "RAMW said it urges \"policymakers on a local and federal level to consider the real-world impact on local businesses and communities.\"",
      "\"Immigrants make up a significant portion of our workforce at all levels. From dishwashers to executive chefs to restaurant owners, immigrants are irreplaceable contributors to our most celebrated restaurants and beloved neighborhood establishments,\" it added. \"The immigrant workforce has been essential to sustaining and growing our local restaurant industry and has been a major contributor to our local economy.",
      "\"At a time when our economy is already fragile, losing even one staff member at a single establishment has a profound impact on the operations of a restaurant and its ability to serve patrons,\" RAMW added. \"Disrupting restaurant staffing across the industry can create a damaging ripple effect felt immediately throughout the entire local economy.\"",

      "Former President Joe Biden has said in his first interview since leaving the White House that President Donald Trump's pressure on Ukraine to give up territory to Russia amounts to \u201cmodern-day appeasement.\u201d",
      "LONDON -- Joe Biden said in his first post-presidential interview that President Donald Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to give up territory to Russia amounts to \u201c modern-day appeasement,\u201d a historically fraught term that refers to a failed effort to stop the Nazis from annexing land in Europe in the 1930s.",
      "Biden told BBC Radio 4's \u201cToday\u201d program in remarks aired Wednesday that Trump's statements about acquiring Panama, Greenland and Canada have bred distrust of the United States in Europe.",
      "\u201cWhat president ever talks like that?\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s not who we are. We\u2019re about freedom, democracy, opportunity \u2014 not about confiscation.\u201d",
      "He also said it was a \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to leave the U.S. presidential race in 2024 four months from Election Day to allow former Vice President Kamala Harris to challenge Trump. But, he added, making that move earlier as some critics had suggested \u201cwould(n't) have mattered.\u201d",
      "The term appeasement refers to former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain\u2019s efforts in the 1930s to appease Adolf Hitler\u2019s moves to annex land in Europe, which failed to prevent World War II.",
      "Trump has long dismissed the war in Ukraine as a waste of lives and American taxpayer money. Early in his presidency, Trump ordered a pause in American aid to Ukraine \u2014 then resumed it. The two countries last week signed an agreement granting American access to Ukraine\u2019s vast mineral resources \u2014 a return on investment, Trump suggested, that could pave the way for more U.S. aid.",
      "He has also said that Crimea, a strategic peninsula along the Black Sea in southern Ukraine that was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, \u201cwill stay with Russia.\u201d",
      "Biden said he worried that relations between the U.S. and Europe was eroding under Trump, with NATO member nations reconsidering whether they trust the U.S.",
      "\u201cEurope is going to lose confidence in the certainty of America and the leadership of America,\" Biden told the BBC. The continent\u2019s leaders, he added, were asking: \"'Can I rely on the United States? Are they going to be there?'\u201d",
      "Of special concern, Biden said, was the administration's proposal to let Russia keep some Ukrainian territory in an effort to strike a peace deal that would put an end to fighting.",
      "\u201cIt is modern-day appeasement,\u201d Biden said.",
      "Biden said Trump's thrashing of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office in February was \u201cbeneath America.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t understand how they fail to understand that there\u2019s strength in alliances,\u201d Biden said of the Trump administration on Monday.",
      "Asked about Trump's triumphant celebration of his first 100 days in office, Biden replied that he'll let history render the judgement.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anything that was triumphant,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Krishnamoorthi is the third high-profile Illinois Democrat to jump in the race.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois has announced his bid to run for Senate in 2026, confirming speculations that he would join the quickly expanding field of primary competitors looking to win the safe Democratic seat left open by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who is retiring at the end of his term.",
      "In an interview with ABC News, the five-term congressman said he's running on a record of confronting \"bullies\" like Donald Trump and is keenly focused on opposing the efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency and Elon Musk to slash federal agencies, programs and jobs.",
      "\"I have a track record of standing up to Donald Trump in Congress. I voted for impeaching him twice, but I also \u2026 played a big role in the first impeachment hearings on Capitol Hill,\" said Krishnamoorthi, who entered the House in 2016, now serves as the top Democrat on the House China select committee on the Chinese Communist Party and is a senior member of the Intelligence and Oversight committees.",
      "\"But I have a track record of standing up to lots of bullies, whether it's the e-cigarette companies that prey on our youth and try to hook them on vapes or it's Purdue pharmaceuticals that try to hook a generation to Oxycontin. I've gone after all of them. They put a target on my back, but I got results, and now we need results with Donald Trump, Elon Musk and DOGE,\" he added.",
      "Krishnamoorthi added that he is running to fight for the economic prosperity of Illinoisans who are \"suffering under the economic chaos unleashed by Donald Trump, Elon Musk and DOGE.\"",
      "\"We need to focus like a laser on their economic problems right now, even at the same time that we're standing up to Donald Trump,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Krishnamoorthi's bid will kick off with three campaign stops on Friday as he \"vows to 'stand up and fight back' against Trump's agenda. The congressman, who represents much of Chicago's northwestern suburbs, will make stops in his hometown of Peoria, Illinois, and in Schaumburg, Illinois, where he currently lives.",
      "\"My roots are in Peoria. I represent the suburbs. I've worked in the city for many years. So I want to try to trace that journey that I've had in Illinois but also speak to as many people as possible across Illinois,\" he told ABC News.",
      "In an announcement video released on Wednesday, Krishnamoorthi called the actions occurring within the White House \"insanity\" and suggested that he is a Democrat who can \"fight back\" against the Trump administration. The Democratic Party is grappling with questions over its political direction following the startling loss of all three branches of government during the 2024 elections.",
      "\"People want to know, at this moment, in this time, where is the power to fight back? What does it look like?\" Krishnamoorthi said in the video. \"Well, I'll tell you: It looks like you and you and you, all of us ready to stand up and fight back. I spent my life standing up to bullies, fighting for everyday people. So I'll never be quiet while billionaires like Elon Musk and a convicted felon deny the dreams of the next generation for their own egos and personal profit. That's why I'm running for the United States Senate.\"",
      "The Harvard University-educated lawyer who received his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from Princeton University was born in central Illinois to Indian immigrants.",
      "Ahead of his election to Congress, Krishnamoorthi served in a number of state roles and as a policy director in the Obama administration. In his announcement video released on Wednesday, the congressman referred to himself as \"Raja\" and referenced the fact that former President Barack Obama, too, had an ethnically ambiguous sounding name, saying, \"I worked on a friend's campaign who showed that Illinois will give you a shot even if you have a funny name. And inspired by Barack's example, I was elected to Congress.\"",
      "\"Yes, I know the name is long, so like always, just call me Raja,\" he concluded the video.",
      "Krishnamoorthi, one of the front-runners in the already hotly contested race, has amassed over a $19 million war chest ahead of his launch, with a stunning $3 million raised in just the first three months of 2025.",
      "His bid comes after Durbin announced in April that he would not seek a sixth term. Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton jumped in the race less than 48 hours after Durbin's announcement and quickly earned the endorsements of billionaire Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Illinois' other senator, Tammy Duckworth.",
      "\"At the end of the day, the most important thing is I get the endorsement from the people of Illinois,\" Krishnamoorthi told ABC News when asked about his posture among the already crowded primary field.",
      "\"They need to have their say. \u2026 We need to make sure that the process plays out, unfolds, that they are able to kick the tires and assess who they want to hire to represent them in the U.S. Senate, and I'm going to do everything in my power to earn their support,\" he added.",
      "Krishnamoorthi's announcement also comes just a day after his colleague, Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., declared her own bid for the seat. In an announcement video posted on Tuesday, Kelly brought up how in Congress, she does not stand up during moments of silence to mark mass shootings because, she said, \"moments of silence in Congress just aren't going to cut it anymore.\"",
      "Kelly is also the former Illinois Democratic Party chairwoman and a member of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' leadership team. It's reported that Rep. Lauren Underwood, who is also a member of Jeffries' leadership circle, is still exploring a run for the seat.",
      "Krishnamoorthi told ABC News that his record, paired with his ability to \"stand up\" to Trump distinctly, makes him uniquely positioned for the role.",
      "\"I think that your track record matters. I think that the diversity of your experiences, plus \u2026 where you come from, I think that matters,\" he said. \"I think that most of all, who is going to be the most effective at standing up to Donald Trump but also delivering for constituents?\"",
      "Durbin said he doesn't plan on endorsing any particular candidate but is not ruling out the possibility in an \"extreme case.\"",
      "\"I hope I do not have to,\" Durbin said.",
      "Still, Krishnamoorthi linked himself to Durbin as he launched his bid for Senate on Wednesday, lauding him as a \"titan\" who was a \"fellow son of downstate.\"",
      "\"Senator Dick Durbin is a titan who will go down as one of the most effective and dedicated public servants in Illinois history. I am deeply humbled by the encouragement I have received from friends, family members, and community leaders encouraging me, a fellow son of downstate, to run for the U.S. Senate,\" Krishnamoorthi said in a statement announcing his candidacy.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has dispatched Vice President JD Vance all over the world in the opening months of the administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- When JD Vance was running for vice president, he walked across an airport tarmac in Wisconsin one August day when his campaign travels happened to intersect those of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and approached Air Force Two. Besides wanting to take a poke at Republican Donald Trump's rival for avoiding the press, Vance said, \"I just wanted to check out my future plane.\u201d",
      "It's an aircraft he now knows well.",
      "In the opening months of Trump's term, Vice President Vance has traveled all over the globe \u2014 family in tow \u2014 to conduct top-level diplomacy for the administration, in addition to taking a number of domestic trips. His international forays have featured a mix of meetings with world leaders, sharply crafted speeches advancing U.S. policy, \u201csoft power\u201d appearances to build goodwill and family time at tourist sites along the way.",
      "Vance's trips have included a five-day trip to Europe in February, a hastily reorganized trek to Greenland in March and a tour of Italy and India in April that was notable for the vice president's brief meeting with Pope Francis the day before the pontiff died.",
      "In his first big moment on the world stage in February, Vance pressed Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d message at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris and spoke of maintaining U.S. dominance in the surging industry. From there, he attended a security conference in Munich, where the vice president left his audience stunned with his lecturing remarks about democracy and scant focus on Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "In March, Vance delivered pointed remarks while in Greenland, scolding Denmark for not investing more in the security of its territory and demanding a new approach. Trump has upset many Greenlanders with his aggressive claims that the U.S. needs to take control of the island away from Denmark.",
      "There's been dealmaking, too.",
      "In India last month, Vance announced after meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they had agreed on a negotiating framework for a U.S.-India trade deal. In Italy, he held talks with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, in addition to his separate audiences with the pope and a top Vatican official.",
      "Vance has been accompanied on his overseas trips by his wife, Usha, and their 7- and 5-year-old sons and 3-year-old daughter. The kids are usually in pajamas as they board Air Force Two for the overnight flights.",
      "The Vances have gazed aloft at the newly restored Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City and been photographed, with the children in traditional Indian dress, in front of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Without their children, the Vances also visited Dachau in Germany.",
      "Brad Blakeman, a former senior official in George W. Bush's administration who has provided planning advice to Vance\u2019s office for some of his foreign travel, said that, while some personal time is woven in, these are not vacations.",
      "\u201cYou try and balance the policy with the culture aspect of the trip so that you\u2019re honoring the customs and culture of the places that you are visiting,\u201d he said. Visiting iconic cultural sites while abroad shows respect and builds rapport with host nations that can enhance diplomacy.",
      "It\u2019s also important to be mindful that the president and vice president travel at the public\u2019s expense, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the balancing act that always has to be done because of the stewardship of the taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d he said.",
      "Joel Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University who specializes in the U.S. vice presidency, said the journeys also could be intended to build Vance's foreign policy chops.",
      "\u201cPart of foreign travel for a vice president is establishing a national security and diplomatic credential,\u201d he said, noting that it's particularly important for Vance.",
      "At age 40, Vance served just two years in the Senate before ascending to the office.",
      "Vance is also the second-youngest person and the first of the millennial generation to hold the job.",
      "\u201cGenerations\u201d author Jean Twenge, a San Diego State University psychology professor who studies generational differences, said the ease with which Vance moves between work and leisure is emblematic of his generation.",
      "\u201cThe research suggests that, just with internet use and social media use, the lines between work time and family time blur, that you switch tasks much more quickly than, say, Gen Xers or boomers,\u201d she said.",
      "Vance frequently switches gears on the road. Last week, he wedged in a quick beer with service members in Germany \u2014 and autographed the \u201ckegerator\u201d built by one airman \u2014 after days of wall-to-wall official and cultural activities throughout Italy and India.",
      "Usha Vance was originally slated for a solo trip to Greenland with one of their sons to attend a dogsled race. But that plan was scrapped amid growing discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark over the visit and Trump\u2019s tough talk of the U.S. taking the territory away from a NATO ally. Instead, the vice president joined the trip, and their visit was limited to a U.S. military base there.",
      "On his Italy trip, Vance took heat on X for being photographed inside the Sistine Chapel. Photography there is usually forbidden, but the session turned out to have been sanctioned by the Vatican, as has happened on past visits by U.S. dignitaries.",
      "A decision during the same trip to close the Roman Colosseum to the public so Usha Vance and the children could take a tour drew some grumbling from tourists stranded outside. A consumer group has since filed a legal complaint.",
      "In India, the Taj Mahal, normally swarming with tourists, was also closed to visitors to accommodate the Vances, according to local media reports.",
      "American officials are often formally invited to make such cultural diversions, and it\u2019s not unusual for the U.S. Secret Service, which provides protection for top U.S. officials, to ask for the sites to be closed to the public for security reasons during presidential and vice presidential tours.",
      "The Vances appear to have tried on occasion to avoid such disruptions. In France, the family visited the Louvre on a Tuesday, a day when the museum is closed to the public.",
      "Other recent vice presidents also have taken family members along on trips. Presidents do, as well.",
      "As vice president, Democrat Joe Biden often took one of his older granddaughters on trips, a practice he continued as president. Presidents' children, including Malia and Sasha Obama and Chelsea Clinton, went along on some trips with their parents, too.",
      "Practices differ, but the idea is the same: Time in office is short, so make the most of it and expose your children to the world.",
      "Usha Vance said as much during the family visit to India, where her parents were born. She hadn't visited in decades, and her husband and children had never been there.",
      "In an interview with India's NDTV, she said she'd been anxious to make the \u201ctrip of a lifetime\u201d with them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve wanted to share with my new nuclear family,\u201d the U.S. second lady said, adding that they knew Vance would have a chance to visit India as vice president. \"We always knew that, when that opportunity arose, we would all come with him.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe think of it as sort of a gateway, the first of many trips to come, I hope,\" she said.",
      "One aim of vice presidential travel abroad is often soft diplomacy, or the building of favorable attitudes toward the U.S. through imagery and symbolism.",
      "When Vance, with his wife of Indian descent and their children, is photographed at the Taj Mahal, it sends a message of solidarity with that nation. When he visits the Vatican and worships there, it emphasizes common ground with Catholics around the world.",
      "Likewise, when Vance appears in public with his children, it could help drive home his quest to encourage large families and build goodwill among American voters, said University of Dayton political scientist Christopher Devine, co-author of \u201cDo Running Mates Matter?\u201d",
      "\u201cI wonder, with JD Vance, if it's an effort to soften his image,\" Devine said. \u201cHe's someone who has not been particularly popular ever since he entered the national scene, and appearing with family tends to make people a little more likable, harder to hate.\u201d",

      "BOISE, Idaho -- Bryan Kohberger's immediate family members may attend his upcoming quadruple-murder trial in the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students, even if they might be called to testify, a judge ruled in an order made public Thursday.",
      "Witnesses in criminal cases are sometimes excluded from attending trials to prevent them from shaping their testimony in response to what other witnesses have said or what evidence has been presented. But Judge Steven Hippler wrote that Kohberger's Sixth Amendment right to a public trial also entitles him to have his parents and siblings present if they want to attend.",
      "\u201cCourts recognize that having defendant\u2019s family members present at trial advances the values served by the right to public trial, i.e., ensuring fair proceedings; reminding the prosecutor and judge of their grave responsibilities; discouraging perjury; and encouraging witnesses to come forward,\u201d Hippler wrote.",
      "Kohberger, 30, a former graduate student in criminal justice at nearby Washington State University, is charged in the stabbing deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 13, 2022.",
      "Prosecutors have said they intended to seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted at his trial, which is set to begin in August.",
      "Hippler said the court must balance Kohberger's right to a public trial with the state's interest in obtaining forthright testimony from witnesses. But, he added, there is little risk of Kohberger's family members shaping what they might say from the witness stand in response to what they observe at the trial: The scope of their proposed testimony is narrow, and they have previously given recorded interviews that will help guard against them altering what they say.",
      "Hippler previously ruled that family members of the victims may attend the trial.",

      "The rent stabilization measure, House Bill 1217, adds Washington to states like Oregon and California that have sought new ways to curb homelessness.",
      "Bill sponsor Sen. Emily Alvarado, a West Seattle Democrat, said the measure sets common-sense guardrails on the state\u2019s rental-housing market \u201cso that hardworking families and older adults don\u2019t get unchecked excessive rent increases.\u201d",

Opponents of the bill argued that developers would leave the state if it became law and said similar policies in Oregon and California added to those states\u2019 financial burdens instead of slowing the homeless crisis.",
      "Oregon's rent-control bill was passed in 2019 and later updated to cap rent increases at either 7% plus the annual 12-month average change in the consumer price index for the U.S. West, or 10% \u2014 whichever is lower.",
      "The conference committee got the cap down to 7% plus inflation or 10% \u2014 whichever is lower, and restored protections for the 38% of renters who live in single-family homes. With Ferguson's signature, it's now law.",

      "___",
      "NOTE CONTENTS: This story contains a term that refers to a racial slur.",
      "___",
      "A video showing a Minnesota woman at a playground last week openly admitting to using a racist slur against a Black child has garnered millions of views. But what's been equally appalling for some is that the woman has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in crowdfunds.",
      "In the video, a man in Rochester, a city roughly 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of Minneapolis, confronts the woman for calling a 5-year-old boy the N-word. The woman appears to double-down on the racist term and flips off the man confronting her with both of her middle fingers.",
      "The woman, who could not be reached for comment, has since amassed over $700,000 through Christian fundraising platform GiveSendGo for relocation expenses because of threats she received over the video. The fundraising page said she used the word out of frustration because the boy went through her 18-month-old child's diaper bag. The Associated Press has not verified this assertion.",
      "\u201cI called the kid out for what he was,\u201d she wrote, adding that the online videos have \u201ccaused my family, and myself, great turmoil.\u201d",
      "The flurry of monetary contributions has reignited multiple debates, from whether racist language and attacks are becoming more permissible to the differences between \u201ccancel culture\u201d and \u201cconsequence culture.\u201d Many want to see the woman face some sort of comeuppance for using a slur, especially toward a child. Others say despite her words, she does not deserve to be harassed. The confrontation is reminiscent of others from the internet age in which the instigator of assaults or verbal attacks obtained almost folk hero status, while the victim received a tepid show of support by comparison.",
      "The NAACP Rochester chapter started its own fundraising campaign for the child\u2019s family. The GoFundMe page had raised $340,000 when it was closed Saturday per the wishes of the family, who want privacy, said the civil rights organization. It was speaking on behalf of the family of the child, who the organization said was on the autism spectrum.",
      "\u201cThis was not simply offensive behavior\u2014it was an intentional racist, threatening, hateful and verbal attack against a child, and it must be treated as such,\u201d the NAACP Rochester chapter said in a statement.",
      "The Rochester Police Department investigated and submitted findings to the Rochester City Attorney\u2019s Office for \u201cconsideration of a charging decision,\u201d spokesperson Amanda Grayson said in a statement Monday.",
      "GiveSendGo did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The donations did and did not surprise Dr. Henry Taylor, director for the Center of Urban Studies at the University at Buffalo.",
      "But shifts in the political and cultural climate have emboldened some people to express racist and bigoted views against people of color or those they consider outsiders. A more recent backlash, from the White House to corporate boardrooms, against diversity, equality and inclusion initiatives have amplified those feelings.",
      "The racism \u201chovering beneath the surface\" comes from blame, Taylor said. \"People are given someone to hate and someone to blame for all of the problems and challenges that they are facing themselves,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "The volume of monetary contributions in the Rochester case is reminiscent of the surge of support for individuals like Kyle Rittenhouse, Daniel Penny and George Zimmerman. All three men were legally found to have acted in self-defense or in defense of others after the death of a Black victim \u2014 except Rittenhouse, who killed two white protesters at a racial justice demonstration against police.",
      "The support and opposition in these cases has often been split along party lines.",
      "In the woman\u2019s case, a contingent of supporters just want to fight cancel culture, said Franciska Coleman, an assistant professor of law at University of Wisconsin Law School, who has written about cancel culture and social regulation of speech. For some it can include donating \u201cto everyone who they in quotes try to \u2018cancel.\u2019\u201d",
      "Some people are fixated on how \u201cit just seems too much that this mother of two young kids is getting death threats and rape threats,\u201d Coleman said.",
      "Conservative commentators have gone online to applaud her for not capitulating to angry internet mobs while acknowledging she used a hateful word. \u201cNo one\u2019s excusing it. But she didn\u2019t deserve to be treated like a domestic terrorist,\u201d conservative podcast host Matt Walsh said in a Facebook post.",
      "There\u2019s an important distinction, Coleman said, between \u201ccancel culture\u201d and \u201cconsequence culture.\u201d The latter is about holding people accountable for actions and words that cause injury such as with \u201cthis poor child.\u201d",
      "That is what many people want to see in this Rochester woman\u2019s case. Because a formal system of punishment may not impose consequences for the woman\u2019s racist behavior, \u201cwe have to do it informally,\u201d Colman said.",
      "She and Taylor agree that, in conventional societal thinking, using racist slurs against someone who has frustrated or even provoked you is never acceptable. Those who think otherwise, even now, are seen as being on the fringes.",
      "But donors on the woman\u2019s GiveSendGo page unabashedly used racist language against the boy, prompting the site to turn off the comments section. Others excused her behavior as acting out of aggravation. There are communities where the racial slur is only unacceptable in \u201cracially mixed company,\u201d Coleman said.",
      "Social media websites and crowdfunding platforms have helped people around the world speak with each other and with their wallets. It\u2019s intensified by the anonymity these platforms allow.",
      "\u201cFeeling that no one will know who you are enables you to act on your feelings, on your beliefs in an aggressive and even mean-spirited way that you might not do if you were exposed,\u201d Taylor said.",

A separate ban containing some exemptions for school buildings takes effect July 1.",
      "Supporters said the laws would encourage political neutrality from teachers and other government employees. Opponents argued they aimed to erase LGBTQ+ expression and wrest authority from cities and towns that did not align politically with the Republican Legislatures.",
      "More than a dozen other states are considering similar measures.",
      "The pride flag has regularly flown over Boise's City Hall for years, and Mayor Lauren McLean kept the flag aloft even after Idaho's law took effect. McLean said she believed the law was unenforceable.",

He said he thought it went too far in regulating local governments but chose not to reject it because his veto would likely be overridden by the Legislature.",
      "Utah's law does not explicitly mention LGBTQ+ pride flags, but the bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican Rep. Trevor Lee, repeatedly stated he aimed to ban them.",
      "Council members in Salt Lake City unanimously approved new designs Tuesday evening, adding the city\u2019s emblem \u2014 a sego lily \u2014 atop the traditional rainbow LGBTQ+ pride flag and the blue, pink and white transgender flag.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday that Russia was \u201casking for too much\u201d in its initial peace offer as the United States looks to bring about an end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "The vice president, speaking at a Washington meeting hosted by the Munich Security Conference, did not elaborate on Moscow's terms, but said he was not pessimistic about the possibility of a peace deal. That is a more sanguine assessment than President Donald Trump's recent skepticism that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to end the war that begin in February 2022 when Russia invaded.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that the Russians are uninterested in bringing this thing to a resolution,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWhat I would say is right now: the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict. We think they\u2019re asking for too much,\u201d he said.",
      "Vance did not repeat any of the criticisms of Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Vance had aired during an Oval Office blowup in February with the Ukrainian leader, and he made a point of saying the U.S. appreciated Ukraine's willingness to have a 30-day ceasefire. But the Republican vice president, citing Russia\u2019s unwillingness on that point, said the U.S. would like to move past that and have the Russian and Ukrainian leaders sit down directly to negotiate a long-term settlement that would end the fighting.",
      "\u201cWhat the Russians have said is, \u2018A 30-day ceasefire is not in our strategic interests.\u2019 So we\u2019ve tried to move beyond the obsession with the 30-day ceasefire and more on the, what would a long-term settlement look like,\u201d Vance said.",
      "Vance's talk at the conference event followed his appearance at the organization's February summit in Germany, where he ruffled feathers for his comments that free speech is \u201cin retreat\u201d across Europe. Vance addressed that Wednesday and said his comments applied to the U.S. under Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, just as they did to Europe.",

      "On the Middle East, Vance did not shed light on the timing of planned talks between the U.S. and Iran over Iran's nuclear program. He said the Trump administration felt the inspection and enforcement provisions in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal negotiated under Democratic President Barack Obama were \u201cincredibly weak\u201d and \u201callowed Iran to sort of stay on this glide path toward a nuclear weapon if they flip the switch and press go.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe think that there is a deal here that would reintegrate Iran into the global economy, that would be really good for the Iranian people, but would result in the complete cessation of any chance that they can get a nuclear weapon. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re negotiating toward,\u201d Vance said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The crash of a Marine Corps helicopter last year that killed five service members was ultimately caused by pilot error, but the use of night vision goggles and unsafe flying conditions also likely were factors, according to an investigation report obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The CH-53 Super Stallion crashed Feb. 6, 2024, during a late night flight when it hit a mountain near Pine Valley, California, on its way back to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.",
      "Investigators found that multiple factors likely led to the crash. But as with several previous military aviation accidents, investigators had to make some assumptions because the CH-53 was not equipped with a flight data recorder capable of surviving a crash.",
      "The limits of night vision goggles also have been identified as a potential factor in the fatal collision of an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger jet near Reagan Washington National Airport in January that killed 67 people. The goggles can reduce a pilot's ability to determine distance and can be degraded by weather or light pollution.",
      "The Marine helicopter was flying in icing conditions with low cloud cover that obscured the mountainous terrain along the flight path. The crew was using night vision goggles, which likely did not give them the clear picture needed to avoid a crash into terrain, investigators found.",
      "The precipitation and clouds probably degraded the goggles' performance and possibly gave the crew a false sense that they were maintaining the safe distances needed in the flight, investigators found.",
      "The pilot and crew chief \u201cmost likely believed they were operating legally and within their comfort level,\u201d investigators found.",
      "Ultimately, though, investigators found that the pilot's failure to avoid the terrain was the primary cause of the crash. They also found that the commanding officer, who was relieved of duty due to a loss of confidence in an ability to lead, should not have given the crew approval to fly.",
      "The Super Stallion vanished during the overnight flight on its way back to Miramar from Creech Air Force Base. The helicopter was discovered in the morning near the mountain community of Pine Valley.",
      "All five Marines aboard were killed in the crash: Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Donovan Davis, 21, of Olathe, Kansas; Sgt. Alec Langen, 23, of Chandler, Arizona; Capt. Miguel Nava, 28, of Traverse City, Michigan; Capt. Jack Casey, 26, of Dover, New Hampshire; and Capt. Benjamin Moulton, 27, of Emmett, Idaho",
      "In interviews contained in the report, multiple members of the squadron said that the crews had been stretched thin because their unit had to fly additional missions to compensate for last year's monthslong grounding of the V-22 Osprey fleet.",

      "Three former Memphis officers have been acquitted of state charges, including second-degree murder, in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols after he ran away from a traffic stop",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Three former Memphis officers were acquitted Wednesday of state charges, including second-degree murder, in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols after he ran away from a traffic stop, a death that sparked nationwide protests and prompted renewed calls for police reforms in the U.S.",
      "A jury, which appeared to be all white, took about 8 1/2 hours over two days to find Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith not guilty on all charges after a nine-day trial in state court in Memphis. After the jury's verdict was read, the defendants hugged their lawyers as relatives of the former officers cried. One relative yelled, \u201cThank you, Jesus!\u201d",
      "The three defendants still face the prospect of years in prison after they were convicted of federal charges last year, though they were acquitted of the most serious charges then, too.",
      "Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, fled a traffic stop after he was yanked out of his car, pepper-sprayed and hit with a Taser. Five officers who are also Black caught up with him and punched, kicked and hit Nichols with a police baton, struggling to handcuff him as he called out for his mother just steps from his home. Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating and the incident directed intense scrutiny of police in Memphis, a majority-Black city.",
      "Footage of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled.",
      "Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Nichols\u2019 family, issued a statement expressing outrage at the verdict.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s verdicts are a devastating miscarriage of justice,\u201d the statement reads. \u201dThe world watched as Tyre Nichols was beaten to death by those sworn to protect and serve.\u201d",
      "Former Memphis officer Desmond Mills Jr., who was also charged in Nichols\u2019 death, testified as a prosecution witness.",
      "Mills and another officer involved in the beating, Emmitt Martin, have agreed to plead guilty to the state charges and did not stand trial under deals with prosecutors. They also pleaded guilty in federal court, where sentencing for all five officers is pending.",
      "The officers had been charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression.",
      "The officers were accused of using unnecessary force during the arrest of Nichols. They were frustrated, angry and full of adrenaline after Nichols fled the traffic stop, prosecutor Paul Hagerman said in opening statements.",
      "They were \u201covercome by the moment,\u201d the prosecutor said.",
      "\u201cNobody is going to call them monsters,\u201d Hagerman said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take monsters to kill a man.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors argued that the officers used excessive, deadly force in trying to handcuff Nichols and were criminally responsible for each others\u2019 actions. They also said the officers had a duty to intervene and stop the beating and tell medical personnel that Nichols had been hit repeatedly in the head, but they failed to do so.",
      "Defense attorneys attempted to refute accusations that the officers used excessive force to subdue Nichols and followed police policies and standards. Defense attorneys have said the officer who acted with the most violence was Martin, who kicked and punched Nichols several times in the head but is not standing trial.",
      "The defense also seemed to score points with their use-of-force experts, who testified that officers on trial acted in compliance with police department policies and widely accepted law enforcement standards. Attorneys for Bean and Smith called character witnesses who testified that the men were good men and officers who did their job the right way.",
      "Mills testified that he regrets his failure to stop the beating, which led to Nichols\u2019 death from blunt force trauma. Nichols suffered tears and bleeding in the brain, Dr. Marco Ross, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, said in court testimony.",
      "As Nichols struggled with Bean and Smith, who were holding him on the ground, Mills tried to pepper-spray Nichols, but he ended up spraying himself, he said.",
      "After stepping away to try to recover, Mills then walked up to Nichols and hit his arm three times with a police baton. Mills told prosecutor Paul Hagerman that he hit Nichols with the baton because he was angry over the pepper spray.",
      "Mills acknowledged on the stand that he had a duty to intervene to stop the beating, but didn\u2019t.",
      "But Mills also said Nichols was actively resisting arrest and not complying with orders to present his hands to be cuffed.",
      "During the trial, defense attorney John Keith Perry asked Mills if he would have struck Nichols with the baton if Nichols had just put his hands behind his back. Mills said no.",
      "Martin Zummach, Smith\u2019s attorney, asked Mills if an officer is safe if a suspect is not handcuffed and searched for a weapon. Mills said they were not safe in that circumstance. Nichols was not searched before he ran from the traffic stop.",
      "Mills acknowledged that the officers were afraid and exhausted, but said some of the methods used on Nichols complied with police department policies, including using wrist locks and hitting with a baton.",
      "Zummach noted in closing arguments that credit and debit cards that did not belong to Nichols were found in his car when it was searched after the beating and said it was likely why Nichols ran from the traffic stop. Defense lawyers have argued that the fatal beating would not have taken place if Nichols had just allowed himself to be handcuffed.",
      "\u201cThis is Emmitt Martin\u2019s and Tyre Nichols\u2019 doing,\u201d Zummach said.",
      "The defense also suggested Nichols was on drugs, giving him the strength to fight off five strong officers. Some mushrooms containing the hallucinogenic psilocybin were also found in his car, a TBI agent testified. However, a toxicology report showed Nichols only had alcohol and a small amount of marijuana in his system.",
      "Mills admitted Nichols never punched or kicked any of the officers.",
      "Defense lawyers also claimed Bean and Smith could not see the strikes to Nichols\u2019 head because they were blinded by pepper spray and they had tunnel vision as they tried to restrain Nichols.",
      "But prosecutors sowed doubt on that claim by pointing to comments the defendants made after the beating. According to footage from the scene, Bean said Nichols was \u201ceating\u201d the blows and Smith said they hit Nichols with \u201cso many pieces,\u201d or punches. Smith also said \u201chit him\u201d and Haley said \u201cbeat that man,\u201d prosecutor Tanisha Johnson said.",
      "In December, the U.S. Justice Department said a 17-month investigation showed the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people.",

      "Attorneys for a Utah man who has been on death row for 37 years are due before a state judge as they seek to spare the convicted murderer from execution because he has dementia",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Attorneys for a Utah man who has been on death row for 37 years are due before a state judge Wednesday as they seek to spare the convicted murderer from execution because he has dementia.",
      "Ralph Leroy Menzies was sentenced to die in 1988 for the killing of Maurine Hunsaker, a mother of three. His attorneys say the 67-year-old inmate's dementia is so severe that he cannot understand why he's facing execution.",
      "If he is deemed competent, Menzies could be one of the next U.S. prisoners executed by firing squad after the method was used on two South Carolina men in recent weeks: a man convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend\u2019s parents in 2001 and a man who killed an off duty police officer in 2004.",
      "Medical experts brought in by prosecutors say Menzies still has the mental capacity to understand his situation, while those brought in by the defense say he does not. The hearing Wednesday will be the last in Menzies' competency case before Judge Matthew Bates issues an opinion, said Eric Zuckerman, a lawyer for Menzies.",
      "Menzies is not the first person to receive a dementia diagnosis while awaiting execution.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in 2019 blocked the execution of a man with dementia in Alabama, ruling Vernon Madison was protected against execution under a constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Madison, who killed a police officer in 1985, died in prison in 2020.",
      "That case followed earlier Supreme Court rulings barring executions of people with severe mental illness. If a defendant cannot understand why they are dying, the Supreme Court said, then an execution is not carrying out the retribution that society is seeking.",
      "\u201cIt's not just about mental illness. It can be also the consequence of brain damage or stroke or dementia \u2014 the fundamental question being whether he has a rational understanding of the reasons he is being executed,\u201d said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "More than half of all pris\u00adon\u00aders sen\u00adtenced to death in the U.S. spend more than 18 years on death row, according to the organization.",
      "Menzies earlier chose a firing squad as his method of execution. Utah death row inmates sentenced before May 2004 were given a choice between that and lethal injection. For inmates sentenced in the state after that date, lethal injection is the default method of execution unless the drugs are unavailable.",
      "Since 1977 only five prisoners in the U.S have been executed by firing squad. Three were in Utah, most recently in 2010, and the others in South Carolina.",
      "Hunsaker, a 26-year-old married mother of three, was abducted by Menzies from the gas station where she worked. She was later found strangled and her throat cut at a picnic area in the Wasatch Mountains of northern Utah. Menzies had Hunsaker\u2019s wallet and several other belongings when he was jailed on unrelated matters. He was convicted of first-degree murder and other crimes.",
      "Over nearly four decades, attorneys for Menzies filed multiple appeals that delayed his death sentence, which had been scheduled at least twice before it was pushed back.",
      "Zuckerman said there will be further hearings before any execution warrant can be issued.",

      "Those without the IDs were given pieces of paper informing them that going forward they would need to present REAL ID or other federally accepted ID for air travel within the U.S. It includes a QR code travelers can use to see a list of acceptable identifications.",

      "Airport security checkpoints also accepted passports and tribal identification as usual.",
      "Many airports reported wait times of a few minutes at security checkpoints on their websites on Wednesday morning. LaGuardia Airport in New York City reported no wait at one TSA PreCheck checkpoint and wait times ranging from 2 to 11 minutes in the general lines. Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport\u2019s website showed wait times at its security checkpoints ranging from 5 to 16 minutes.",

      "Park rangers found the body of the male bear, known as Grizzly No. 1058, about 125 yards (114 meters) from Highway 26 near the Buffalo Fork River on Tuesday. The bear was one of four cubs that emerged in May 2020 with their mother, Grizzly No. 399, who was often called the world's most famous grizzly bear.",
      "Grizzly No. 399, who was beloved for decades by countless tourists, biologists and professional wildlife photographers, was hit and killed by a vehicle in October on a highway south of Jackson, Wyoming. Park officials used wildlife tags to confirm the relationship between the two bears.",
      "Grizzly No. 1058 had been seen occasionally in the park since he was weened in 2022, but no sightings of him had been reported this spring. After he was hit by the vehicle, he made his way to a patch of willows, where he died.",
      "Park officials said Tuesday he may have been dead for several days before his body was found.",
      "At 28 years old, No. 399 was the oldest known reproducing female grizzly in the Yellowstone ecosystem. Each spring, wildlife enthusiasts eagerly awaited her emergence from her den to see how many cubs she had birthed over the winter \u2014 then quickly shared the news online. The bear had 18 known cubs in eight litters over the years, including the litter of four in 2020. She stood around 7 feet (2.1 meters) tall and weighed about 400 pounds (180 kilograms).",
      "Named for the identity tag attached to her ear by researchers, the grizzly was often seen near roads in Grand Teton, drawing crowds and creating traffic jams.",
      "The driver who struck and killed No. 399 was not speeding, and the bear\u2019s death was ruled an accident. Park officials have not released any additional details about the crash that killed No. 1058.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump plans to announce while on his trip to Saudi Arabia next week that the United States will now refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia, according to two U.S. officials.",

      "The two U.S. officials spoke with The Associated Press on Tuesday on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. The White House and National Security Council did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "The Persian Gulf has been widely known by that name since the 16th century, although usage of \u201cGulf of Arabia\u201d and \u201cArabian Gulf\u201d is dominant in many countries in the Middle East.

      "The name of the body of water has become an emotive issue for Iranians who embrace their country\u2019s long history as the Persian Empire. A spat developed in 2017 during Trump\u2019s first term when he used the name Arabian Gulf for the waterway.

      "In addition to Saudi Arabia, Trump is also set to visit Doha, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, which also lie on the body of water. Originally planned as Trump\u2019s first trip overseas since he took office on Jan. 20, it comes as Trump has tried to draw closer to the Gulf countries as he seeks their financial investment in the U.S. and support in regional conflicts, including resolving the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and limiting Iran\u2019s advancing nuclear program.",
      "The U.S. president also has significant financial ties to the countries through his personal businesses, over which he has retained ownership from the Oval Office.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A retired U.S. brigadier general who failed to get through the confirmation process in the first Trump administration got renewed scrutiny for his political and anti-Islamic social media posts during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Tuesday .",
      "Anthony Tata, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, has been nominated to become the defense undersecretary for personnel. His nomination to be defense undersecretary for policy in 2020 was stalled when senators canceled the hearing after a furor over remarks he made about Islam and other inflammatory comments.",
      "Tata was criticized for tweets in 2018 calling Islam the \u201cmost oppressive violent religion I know of,\u201d and calling former President Barack Obama a \u201cterrorist leader\u201d and referring to him as Muslim. The tweets were later taken down.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate your partisan tweets, your partisan statements,\" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., during Tuesday's hearing, referring to remarks Tata made on Fox News in 2020. \"I don\u2019t appreciate that because I\u2019m a Democrat, you say that I would support Hamas or Hezbollah or Iran.\u201d",
      "Tata responded that, \u201cThose were out of character comments. I regret making those comments. Five years ago, I submitted an apology letter to this committee about those comments. I have 45 years of solutions-oriented leadership.\"",
      "He said that if confirmed he'd focus on taking care of service members, their families and department civilians.",
      "Tata also would be responsible for implementing and advising on planned cuts of thousands of civilian personnel and the recently ordered elimination of 10% to 20% of the general officer positions across the military.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., spoke on behalf of Tata at the start of the hearing, acknowledging there would be \u201csome tough questions about Tony\u2019s past comments.\u201d But he said Tata learns from his mistakes, \u201cwhich is a testament of a good leader.\u201d",
      "Democrats grilled Tata on whether he would support efforts by the Trump administration to purge military leaders it doesn't like or that it doesn't believe are loyal enough to the president.",
      "\u201cYou called for a complete purge of Pentagon leadership, including firing all four-star general officers and senior career civilian employees,\u201d said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I. \u201cThis gives me concern that you have a misguided, biased view of the military and civilian workforce that you would oversee.\u201d",
      "Tata said those comments were in response to a published report that said senior generals and admirals were discussing \u201chow to resist\u201d Trump, adding that military leaders don't get to choose which lawful orders they follow. Reed said the report specified that the military officers were discussing what to do if Trump issued \u201cunlawful\u201d orders, such as requiring troops to conduct law enforcement duties in a U.S. city.",
      "If confirmed Tata also would be involved in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s plans to slash diversity and equity programs, review military standards and ban transgender men and women from serving.",
      "He was asked if he would remove military leaders he considers woke or politically misguided for carrying out lawful orders during a past administration. Tata said he sees no reason why that would impact a promotion, and instead would base decisions on merit.",
      "Tata, who had been a Fox News commentator, withdrew his name from consideration for the undersecretary job in August 2020, during the final months of Trump's presidency. He was then appointed by Trump to serve temporarily as the deputy undersecretary for defense policy, bypassing the hearing process.",

      "The fate of three former Memphis police officers charged in the beating of Tyre Nichols is in the hands of 12 jurors as deliberations began in the Black man's death",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The fate of three former Memphis police officers charged in the beating of Tyre Nichols was in the hands of 12 people who do not live in the city as jury deliberations began Tuesday in the 29-year-old Black man\u2019s death.",
      "The jury began deliberating after a prosecutor and defense lawyers presented closing arguments in the trial of Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith, who have pleaded not guilty to state charges including second-degree murder. They already face the possibility of years in prison after they were convicted of federal charges last year.",
      "Nichols fled a Jan. 7, 2023, traffic stop after he was yanked out of his car, pepper-sprayed and hit with a Taser. Five officers who are also Black caught up with him and punched, kicked and hit Nichols with a police baton, struggling to handcuff him as he called out for his mother near his home.",
      "Footage of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled. His death led to nationwide protests, calls for police reforms in the U.S., and intense scrutiny of police in Memphis, a majority-Black city.",
      "The sequestered jury ended its deliberations for the day at around 5 p.m., after having the case for four hours. They will resume Wednesday.",
      "The jury for the state trial was chosen in Hamilton County, which includes Chattanooga, after Judge James Jones Jr. ordered the case be heard from people outside of Shelby County, which includes Memphis. Defense lawyers for the officers had argued that intense publicity made seating a fair jury difficult.",
      "The officers are charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. Prosecutors have argued that the officers used excessive, deadly force in trying to handcuff Nichols and were criminally responsible for each others' actions.",
      "The officers also had a duty to intervene and stop the beating and tell medical personnel that Nichols had been struck in the head, but they failed to do so, prosecutors said.",
      "Former Memphis officers Desmond Mills Jr. and Emmitt Martin also were charged in the case. They have agreed to plead guilty to the state charges and are not standing trial. They already pleaded guilty in federal court, where sentencing for all five officers is pending.",
      "Defense attorneys have sought to chip away at accusations that the officers used unnecessary force to subdue Nichols. They have argued that Nichols was actively resisting arrest by running away and failing to give his hands to officers so that he could be handcuffed. They also say their use of force complied with police department policies.",
      "Mills testified that he regrets his failure to stop the beating, which led to Nichols\u2019 death three days later from blunt-force trauma. Dr. Marco Ross, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, testified that Nichols suffered tears and bleeding in the brain.",
      "As Nichols struggled with Bean and Smith, who were holding him on the ground, Mills tried to pepper-spray Nichols, but he ended up spraying himself, he said.",
      "After stepping away to try to recover, Mills then walked up to Nichols and hit his arm three times with a police baton. Mills told prosecutor Paul Hagerman that he hit Nichols with the baton because he was angry over the pepper spray. Defense attorneys have said the the officer who acted with the most violence was Martin, who kicked and punched Nichols several times in the head but is not standing trial.",
      "Mills acknowledged on the stand that he had a duty to intervene to stop the beating, but didn\u2019t. But Mills also said Nichols was actively resisting arrest and not complying with orders to present his hands to be cuffed.",
      "Martin Zummach, Smith\u2019s lawyer, noted in closing arguments that credit and debit cards that did not belong to Nichols were found in his car when it was searched after the beating and said it was likely why Nichols ran from the traffic stop. Defense lawyers have argued that the fatal beating would not have taken place if Nichols had just allowed himself to be handcuffed.",
      "\u201cThis is Emmitt Martin\u2019s and Tyre Nichols\u2019 doing,\u201d Zummach said.",
      "Mills acknowledged that the officers were afraid and exhausted, but said wrist locks and the baton strikes complied with police department policies.",
      "Mills admitted Nichols never punched or kicked any officers.",
      "Defense lawyers also claimed Bean and Smith could not see the strikes to Nichols\u2019 head because they were blinded by pepper spray and they had tunnel vision as they tried to restrain Nichols.",
      "But prosecutors sowed doubt on that claim by pointing to comments the defendants made after the beating. According to footage from the scene, Bean said Nichols was \u201ceating\u201d the blows and Smith said they hit Nichols with \u201cso many pieces,\u201d or punches. Smith also said \u201chit him\u201d and Haley said \u201cbeat that man,\u201d prosecutor Tanisha Johnson said.",
      "The five officers were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit that was disbanded after Nichols' death. The team targeted drugs, illegal guns and violent offenders to amass arrests, while sometimes using force against unarmed people",
      "The trial comes months after the U.S. Justice Department said in December that a 17-month investigation found that the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people.",

The crash occurred when a southbound SUV driven by the trainer, carrying the teammates, collided with a northbound sedan with the St. Louis family as passengers, the Kansas Highway Patrol reported.",
      "A third teenager from the Tulsa area survived the crash and was hospitalized with what the Highway Patrol described as potentially a minor injury.",

      "The Kansas Highway Patrol said the crash occurred a few miles outside of Greeley, Kansas, a town of fewer than 300 people, at about 5:45 p.m. Sunday, as Gilstrap, the driver of the SUV, attempted to pass a slow-moving vehicle. He and the sedan driven by Ernst were headed toward each other in the northbound lane, and both drivers swerved to avoid a collision, but both went into the northbound shoulder of the highway.",

      "The Scripps National Spelling Bee won\u2019t be so quick to force spellers into a lightning-round tiebreaker to decide a champion this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Scripps National Spelling Bee won't be so quick to force spellers into a lightning-round tiebreaker to decide a champion this year, a shift that follows criticism of the abrupt ending to last year's competition.",
      "Scripps has eliminated its requirement that the tiebreaker known as a \u201cspell-off\u201d be used when the bee finals are nearing the end of their two-hour broadcast window and a champion has not been decided. Instead, judges will have more discretion to let the bee play out, even if it runs into overtime.",
      "\u201cWe don't have those constraints in place that will force us into a spell-off situation based on time. It takes a lot of pressure off of that moment,\u201d Corrie Loeffler, the bee's executive director, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe can keep going with regular competition, rather than saying, \u2018It\u2019s 9:50, we're going to a spell-off.'\u201d",
      "Last year, the top two spellers were tossed into the spell-off without even competing head-to-head in the traditional spelling bee format, a move that rankled former champions and other bee aficionados. Bruhat Soma, who said afterward that he practiced the tiebreaker every day for six months, easily defeated Faizan Zaki.",
      "Faizan returns for another crack at the title in this year's bee, which begins May 27.",
      "\u201cOnce you reach a certain point in the finals, the drama is really in watching the spellers take on the dictionary word by word,\u201d said Scott Remer, a prolific spelling coach who works with Faizan. \u201cTraditionally, the idea behind the spelling bee has been that you use the information you\u2019re given, you gather the clues, you process the information, you think about the word, and then you take all of that synthesis of information and you provide a spelling. The spell-off obviously tests a different set of skills.\u201d",
      "The spell-off was first used in 2022. Harini Logan beat Vikram Raju during that contest, but only after the pair had a traditional, lengthy duel in which each misspelled four words. Dev Shah didn't need a spell-off to win two years ago, and he was outspoken about the 2024 edition, saying, \u201cI don't think it was a good bee.\u201d",
      "There was no tiebreaker throughout most of the 2010s, and the bee had co-champions in three straight years from 2014-16. Then came the infamous 2019 bee, which ended in an eight-way tie when Scripps ran out of words difficult enough to challenge an unusually strong group of competitors.",
      "The 2020 bee was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it returned the next year under new leaders who made it clear they wanted a sole champion.",
      "Another rule change has already proven popular among the spelling community: the return of a written test during the preliminary rounds.",
      "Spellers who spell one word correctly and get one multiple-choice vocabulary question right on stage will then sit for a 40-question written test at the end of the first day. Results of that test will be used to pare the field to about 100 quarterfinalists \u2014 and Scripps will also use the test scores to gauge the strength of the remaining spellers and inform the difficulty of words used in subsequent rounds.",
      "Current and former spellers say the written test is a fairer way to move the competition along than doing everything at the microphone during lengthy rounds with wild variations in word difficulty.",
      "\u201cI think having a written test as well as oral rounds allows for a better snapshot of a speller's holistic skills,\u201d Shah said.",
      "During the 2010s, a written test reduced the field to about 50 spellers, making it even higher-stakes. Scripps editorial director Molly Becker believes this version, with a \u201cgentler cut,\u201d strikes the right balance.",
      "\u201cWe've heard from spellers that we like the fairness of the test because they're all being examined on the same exact words,\u201d Becker said. \u201cAlso, the primary driver for bringing back the test is that the program can continue to grow with the number of spellers.\u201d",

      "The U.S. trade deficit soared to a monthly record of $140.5 billion in March, signaling a rush for imports from businesses and consumers alike ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s latest \u2014 and most sweeping \u2014 tariffs taking effect",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. trade deficit soared to a record $140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses alike tried to get ahead of President Donald Trump's latest and most sweeping tariffs \u2014 with federal data showing an enormous stockpiling of pharmaceutical products.",
      "The deficit \u2014 which measures the gap between the value of goods and services the U.S. sells abroad against what it buys \u2014 has roughly doubled over the last year. In March 2024, Commerce Department records show, that gap was just under $68.6 billion.",
      "According to federal data released on Tuesday, U.S. exports for goods and services totaled about $278.5 billion in March, while imports climbed to nearly $419 billion. That's up $0.5 billion and $17.8 billion, respectively, from February trade.",
      "Consumer goods led the imports surge \u2014 increasing by $22.5 billion in March. And pharma products in particular climbed $20.9 billion, the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis noted, signaling fears about future levies impacting the sector.",
      "\u201cWhile we had known consumer goods accounted for the bulk of March\u2019s rise, we can now see pharmaceutical products were $20bn higher \u2014 almost all of which were imported from Ireland,\u201d a Tuesday note from analysts at Oxford Economics notes. \u201cUncertainty remains high, and broader signs of front-loading may be visible in coming months.\u201d",
      "Imports are flooding into the U.S. trade wars deepen abroad. Trump has threatened and imposed a series of steep tariffs in recent months \u2014 and much of March, in particular, was filled with anticipation and uncertainty leading up to what the president called \u201cLiberation Day\" on April 2, when he announced new import taxes on nearly all of America\u2019s trading partners. With the exception of China, higher tariff rates for many countries have since been postponed \u2014 but other sweeping levies remain.",
      "The White House insists that new tariffs will help close longstanding trade deficits (the U.S. hasn't sold the rest of the world more than it's bought since 1975), reinvigorate manufacturing in America and generate government revenue. But economists are warning of significant consequences for businesses, households and economies worldwide under the levies that Trump has proposed.",
      "These new tariffs are already increasing operating costs for businesses that rely on a global supply chain \u2014 which, in turn, will hike prices for a range of goods that consumers buy each day.",
      "The recent surge in imports reflects efforts by companies across the country to bring in foreign goods before more duties kicked in. New orders for manufactured durable goods, for example, jumped 9.2% to $315.7 billion in March, Census Bureau data released last month shows.",
      "March's trade deficit surpasses the last monthly record of $130.7 billion reported in January \u2014 also amid tariff uncertainty after Trump took office, marking a more than $32 billion jump from December.",
      "All of this contributed to shrinking economic growth in the first three months of the year. Last week, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. gross domestic product \u2014 or output of goods and services \u2014 fell at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March, marking the first drop in three years.",
      "Imports grew at a total 41% pace for that period, its fastest rate since 2020, shaving 5 percentage points off first-quarter growth. But that surge is likely to reverse in the second quarter, removing some weight on GDP.",

      "The head of Homeland Security says travelers who aren\u2019t REAL ID compliant by the upcoming deadline this week will still be able to fly but should be prepared for extra scrutiny",
      "WASHINGTON -- Travelers who haven\u2019t obtained a REAL ID by this week\u2019s deadline received assurances from the head of Homeland Security that they will be able to fly after additional identity checks. But that didn\u2019t prevent long lines of people at some government offices trying to get the identification card.",
      "Kristi Noem told a congressional panel that 81% of travelers already have IDs that comply with the REAL ID requirements. She said security checkpoints will also be accepting passports and tribal identification when the deadline hits Wednesday.",
      "Those who still lack an identification that complies with the REAL ID law \u201cmay be diverted to a different line, have an extra step,\u201d Noem said.",
      "\u201cBut people will be allowed to fly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will make sure it\u2019s as seamless as possible.\u201d",
      "Across the country, Department of Motor Vehicle offices extended their hours to help meet the demand. But despite that, some people waited for hours Tuesday to get a REAL ID ahead of the long-delayed deadline.",
      "Renel Leggett, a college student from West Chester, Pennsylvania, spent hours getting her REAL ID and was not happy about it.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been out here for three hours to get one ID when I\u2019ve already had one that should have lasted me until about 2029,\u201d Leggett said.",
      "\"You have to do it. But it feels like a waste of time,\u201d she said.",
      "REAL ID is a federally compliant state-issued license or identification card that Homeland Security says is a more secure form of identification. It was a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission and signed into law in 2005.",
      "The commission recommended the government set security standards for state-issued driver\u2019s licenses and IDs. It was supposed to be rolled out in 2008. But the implementation has been repeatedly delayed.",
      "Besides needing a REAL ID to fly domestically, people will also need one to access certain federal buildings and facilities.",
      "In recent weeks, Noem has been warning the American public about the upcoming deadline. In a television ad put out by Homeland Security, she warned that these IDs were needed for air travel and for entering public buildings, adding: \u201cThese IDs keep our country safe.\u201d",
      "A REAL ID-compliant driver\u2019s license has a symbol ( in most states, a star ) in the top corner of the card.",
      "In California, about 58% of all driver\u2019s license and ID cardholders have a REAL ID. The state has extended the hours of some Department of Motor Vehicles offices through June 27 to help more people get the federally required identification. Officials are also reminding residents that if they already have a valid U.S. passport, they can use that and wait to upgrade to a REAL ID when their ID or driver\u2019s license is due for renewal.",
      "Lucas Krump was traveling Tuesday to San Francisco on business from Newark, New Jersey, and said he was using a passport to get through security.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a license that is Real ID,\" he said. \u201cI question the bureaucracy around it. It feels like attacks on everyday people, having to upgrade their licenses and all of their identification for something that really, you know, seems like we\u2019ve been fine without it.\u201d",
      "At the Driver Services Bureau in Jackson, Mississippi, there were no long lines Tuesday, and people were getting their REAL IDs fairly quickly.",
      "Marion Henderson said before going in that she planned to travel to California, Michigan, Chicago and New York this year and wanted to be prepared.",
      "\u201cEven though I have my license, now that it\u2019s required, I wanted to go ahead and get it done\u201d ahead of the deadline, Henderson said.",

      "A lawyer says the teen accused of killing four people in a shooting at Georgia\u2019s Apalachee High School is moving toward pleading guilty",
      "WINDER, Ga. -- A lawyer on Tuesday said the teen accused of killing four people in a shooting at Georgia\u2019s Apalachee High School is moving toward pleading guilty.",
      "Defense attorney Alfonso D. Kraft told Barrow County Superior Court Judge Nick Primm in a brief hearing that Colt Gray could be ready for a plea hearing in October. A psychologist is scheduled to meet with Gray soon, Kraft said, adding that his client would likely be ready for a plea hearing after the psychologist's report is ready.",
      "\u201cWe should be good to go,\u201d Kraft said.",
      "The Sept. 4 shooting killed teachers Richard \u201cRicky\u201d Aspinwall, 39, and Cristina Irimie, 53, and students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14. Another teacher and eight more students were wounded, seven of them hit by gunfire.",
      "Colt Gray, then 14, was indicted on a total of 55 counts, including murder in the deaths of four people and 25 counts of aggravated assault. Grand jurors formally charged his father, Colin Gray, with 29 counts, including two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of involuntary manslaughter. Both also face multiple counts of cruelty to children.",
      "Colt Gray was charged as an adult. Both initially pleaded not guilty.",
      "Prosecutors said in court Tuesday they were looking to accept a non-negotiated plea, which would mean they would not recommend a lower sentence. The key issue in any plea is likely to be whether Gray is sentenced to life without parole or will get a chance at later parole. As a juvenile, he cannot be sentenced to death.",
      "Primm told Kraft and prosecutors to work out a date after the scheduled September trial of Colin Gray.",
      "\u201cI think the October timing works well because Colin Gray\u2019s trial is scheduled in September,\u201d Primm said, saying a later plea would avoid pretrial publicity that could be taint the ability to find unbiased jurors in Colin Gray\u2019s case.",
      "Primm in April ordered that jurors in Colin Gray\u2019s trial would not be drawn from Barrow County, granting a rare change of venue.",
      "Colt Gray appeared by video Tuesday from a juvenile detention center where he is being held.",
      "Relatives of Aspinwall said after the hearing they want a sentence of life without parole for Gray.",
      "\u201cIf he wants to plead guilty it would be a better route for everybody, get it behind us,\u201d said Kevin Zink, Aspinwall's father-in law. \u201cI'd like to see it end. The sooner it ends, the better for all of us.\u201d",
      "Zink said District Attorney Brad Smith had told relatives he would not accept a lighter sentence in exchange for a guilty plea.",
      "Richard Aspinwall Sr., Ricky's father, said he might favor a trial to make an example of Gray.",
      "\u201cMaybe it'll make other people think twice about trying to pull something.\u201d Aspinwall said.",
      "Investigators have testified that Colt Gray carried a semiautomatic assault-style rifle given to him by his father onto the school bus with the barrel wrapped in a poster board. They say the boy left his second-period class and emerged from a bathroom with the rifle, shooting people in a classroom and hallway.",
      "Investigators have said the teenager carefully plotted the shooting at the 1,900-student high school northeast of Atlanta. A Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent testified that the boy left a notebook in his classroom with step-by-step instructions and a diagram to prepare for the assault, including an estimate that he could kill as many as 26 people and wound as many as 13 others.",
      "Colt and Colin Gray were interviewed about an online threat linked to Colt Gray in May 2023. Colt Gray denied making the threat at the time. He skipped eighth grade, enrolled as a freshman at Apalachee after the academic year began, and then skipped multiple days of school.",
      "Family members had been seeking psychological help for Colt Gray before the shooting, but it appears he never saw a counselor.",
      "Colt\u2019s mother, Marcee Gray, who lives separately, told investigators that she had argued with Colin Gray in August, asking him to secure his guns and restrict Colt\u2019s access. Instead, over time, he bought the boy ammunition, a gun sight and other shooting accessories, records show.",
      "Colt Gray even created a \u201cshrine\u201d to school shooters over his home computer, Georgia Bureau of Investigation Agent Kelsey Ward said in court.",

      "The Catholic bishop of a New Jersey diocese said he would no longer oppose a state grand jury investigation of clergy sexual abuse that the church has been fighting behind closed doors in court for years.",
      "It's not clear, however, that the grand jury investigation will go forward because the state Supreme Court is already considering the diocese's earlier argument against seating one.",
      "In a letter Monday to the state Supreme Court, an attorney for the diocese said Camden Bishop Joseph Williams wished to inform the seven justices that \u201cthe Diocese of Camden will not object to the empanelment of a grand jury for the purpose of considering a presentment.\u201d",
      "Williams took over the diocese in March and first said in an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer on Monday that the diocese no longer wished to prevent the attorney general\u2019s office from seating a grand jury to investigate allegations of sexual assault by priests and other religious officials.",
      "Williams told the newspaper it was important to help those harmed by the church and that he doesn't want to stop their voices from being heard.",
      "\u201cOur people need to hear this, the clergy needs to hear this, so that it never happens again, first of all,\u201d Williams said.",
      "A message seeking comment Tuesday was left with the diocese.",
      "The change comes a week after attorneys for the diocese argued before the state Supreme Court that prosecutors did not have the authority under court rules to use a grand jury to investigate private church officials. Instead, the lawyers argued, the rule requires grand jury presentments to tackle public officials and government.",
      "The high court has not yet issued an opinion on the arguments. It's not immediately clear how the bishop's new position would affect their ruling and whether the court might side with the diocese's previous position.",
      "The state attorney general's office said in an emailed statement Tuesday that it welcomes the \u201cintrospection that produced this shift in the Diocese of Camden's position.\u201d",
      "The statement pointed out that prosecutors are still subject to lower court orders that blocked the investigation.",
      "Mark Crawford, state director of Survivors Network for those Abused by Priests, said in a text message Tuesday that the change was \u201clong overdue.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are cautiously optimistic as this is certainly the right thing to do and for the right reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should have happened long ago and seeing Bishop Williams take a different approach is encouraging.\u201d",
      "The issue dates to a Pennsylvania grand jury report in 2018 that found more than 1,000 children had been abused in that state since the 1940s, prompting the New Jersey attorney general to announce a similar investigation.",
      "But the results of New Jersey\u2019s inquiry never became public partly because a legal battle led by the Diocese of Camden was unfolding behind closed doors amid sealed proceedings.",
      "Then, this year the Bergen Record obtained records disclosing a trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of the diocese and revealing the diocese\u2019s objection to the grand jury. And in March, the Supreme Court ordered more documents in the case unsealed.",
      "The core disagreement is over whether a court rule permits grand juries in New Jersey to issue findings in cases involving private individuals. Trial and appellate courts found for the diocese.",
      "In oral arguments, Supreme Court justices at times sounded skeptical of the diocese's then-position that the grand jury investigation would amount to a condemnation of the church and its officials.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what a grand jury would say, am I right?\u201d Justice Anne Patterson asked at the time.",

      "Interest rates are widely expected to be cut on Thursday, with further falls predicted for later in the year.",
      "Analysts say a cut to 4.25% from 4.5% by the Bank of England is highly likely, although no change or a bigger reduction remain possibilities.",
      "Such a move would make borrowing money by businesses and individuals less expensive, but there are likely to be lower returns for savers.",
      "The announcement will come at 12:02 BST, following a two-minute silence to mark VE Day.",
      "If a cut is confirmed, it would be the fourth rate reduction from last year's peak of 5.25%, and the second this year.",

      "The committee will also be alert to wider global economic uncertainty. President Trump's tariff policy in the US was unveiled after the MPC's last meeting in March.",
      "Many analysts say inconsistency and uncertainty regarding the policy may push down growth and inflation, leading to expectations of the MPC responding with more interest rate cuts this year.",
      "How a cut would affect you",
      "The likelihood of an immediate cut, with more to come, has been reflected in the markets and, in turn, on mortgage pricing.",
      "Eight in 10 homeowners with a mortgage have a fixed-rate deal and will pay close attention to the interest on new deals when they first buy or when they shop around ahead of a current deal expiring.",
      "Lenders have been cutting the mortgage rates on these new fixed deals in recent weeks, although not down to the levels seen during most of the 2010s. Given that lenders have already \"priced in\" a cut in interest rates, further falls in mortgage rates are not guaranteed.",
      "The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.15%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.08%.",

      "A fall in interest rates are also likely have an impact on the returns people like Samren receive on their savings.",
      "Base rate cuts generally lead to reductions in the interest provided by savings providers, particularly on instant-access accounts.",
      "Anna Bowes, savings expert at financial advice firm The Private Office, said it was \"encouraging\" that fixed savings rates were still competitive, with relatively high interest paid.",
      "However, she said that required people being willing to lock their savings into an account and to leave them untouched for the term of the deal, generally between one and five years.",
      "A rate cut would guarantee some mortgage-holders lower monthly repayments.",
      "Nearly 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that \"tracks\" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change would have an immediate impact.",
      "A typical tracker mortgage-holder is likely to see about \u00a329 knocked off their monthly repayments if the Bank rate is reduced by 0.25 percentage points, according to calculations by banking trade body UK Finance.",
      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC: \"I had a really good rate, then all of a sudden it changed and I got caught out.",
      "\"A drop would help because I've just been made redundant, so that would help a wee bit. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was, though.\"",

      "The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday it would keep interest rates unchanged, despite pressure from Trump to lower borrowing costs.",
      "But Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the economic fallout from Trump's tariffs meant it was \"not at all clear\" what the bank should do next.",
      "The decision marked the third in a row without action, leaving the bank's key lending rate hovering around 4.3%.",
      "Powell said if Trump's tariff policies remain in place they were likely \"to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and a rise in unemployment\".",
      "Typically, the Fed cuts rates if it believes the economy is struggling and raises them if prices start to rise too quickly.",
      "But the bank - which is set up to make policy independent of the White House -said tariffs had raised the risk of both an economic slowdown and faster price rises, complicating its next move.",
      "\"It's really not at all clear what it is we should do,\" Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday. \"There's so much uncertainty.\"",

      "The deal will also allow British firms to compete for more services contracts in India.",
      "What will be the impact on people in the UK and India?",
      "The trade deal won't come into force for up to a year, so don't expect to notice any immediate changes.",
      "Over time though, the UK government says lowering tariffs on the likes of clothing, jewellery, and frozen prawns \"could\" lead to cheaper prices and more choice.",
      "This deal could also be a big win for UK businesses which manufacture the goods which have seen tariffs slashed, such as car makers and whisky distillers.",
      "For example, tariffs on whisky and gin being imported to India from the UK will be halved from 150% to 75% before reducing to 40% by the 10th year of the deal. Car tariffs will fall from more than 100% to 10%.",
      "That will provide a boost to those two industries, which look set to be hit hard by US tariffs, as it will mean Indian companies wanting to import those products will pay less import charges than before.",
      "If businesses end up exporting more goods to India and make higher profits, this could lead to them spending more on hiring staff, investing and also paying more tax.",
      "In India, consumers could see much more choice among the goods which have been included under the deal. Clothing manufacturing businesses and jewellers will also be able to access the UK market which will boost their margins.",
      "How important is this for the UK and India?",
      "This deal has been a long time in the making, with on-off negotiations going on for some three years.",
      "However it appears US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on goods entering America has prompted other world leaders to consider striking free-trade deals with one another.",
      "The UK's deal with India is its third biggest after its agreements with Australia and Japan. For context, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU.",
      "The EU is the biggest trade partner for both the UK and India. Therefore, a free trade agreement between India and the EU would be more significant than the one with the UK. Both India and the EU have said they aim to finalise this by the end of 2025.",
      "Last year trade between the UK and India totalled \u00a342bn. The UK government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.",
      "It is said over time it will boost the UK economy by \u00a34.8bn. This is a tiny proportion of the UK economy which was worth \u00a32,851bn last year.",
      "However, India is also forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. It is also home to 1.45bn people - about 20 times the population of the UK -which is a lot of potential customers.",
      "The UK is also a high priority trading partner for India, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1tn (\u00a3750bn) by 2030.",
      "What does this mean for visas?",
      "One of the reasons the UK India free trade deal has taken so long to reach is that India had made big demands about visas for Indian professionals and students to work and study abroad.",
      "The British government said this deal does not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK.",
      "But it does includes a three-year exemption on the social security paid by Indian employees working in the UK, on short-term visas.",
      "This agreement, known as the Double Contribution Convention, designed to ensure social security contributions are not made in more than one country, was one of the elements India had pushed for during negotiations.",
      "The UK's Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the deal would make it easier for people with certain skills to work in the UK temporarily.",

      "The takeover of Deliveroo by its US counterpart DoorDash is an illuminating example of the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets.",
      "DoorDash's offer for Deliveroo values the business at \u00a32.9bn and will create a  company with operations in more than 40 countries.",
      "While both are similar companies, their fortunes have dramatically diverged over the past few years.",
      "Both started out as food delivery services offering customers convenient and speedy access to their favourite restaurants and offering restaurants the ability to more fully utilise the capacity of their kitchens.",
      "Both extended their offerings to include other convenience shopping items \u2013 like nappies, flowers and pet food.",
      "Both raised money by selling shares to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) around the same time \u2013 Deliveroo on the London stock market, DoorDash on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much.",
      "This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value \u2013 its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets.",
      "Let's look at another measure \u2013 the price of each share.",
      "An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%.",
      "An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%.",
      "What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival \u2013 just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit.",
      "One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets.",
      "UK's Deliveroo to be bought by US firm DoorDash",
      "This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing.",
      "There are many reasons.",
      "Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half.",
      "How can there be such a huge disparity?",
      "Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies \u2013 the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla)",
      "Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings \u2013 still a massive premium to the UK.",
      "One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand.",
      "UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled.",
      "Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds.",
      "But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets \u2013 and they have been dead right.",
      "In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%.",
      "Positive comments",
      "But there are changes afoot.",
      "The government's so-called \"Edinburgh Reforms\", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others.",
      "There have also been positive comments on the attractiveness of the UK from financial giants like Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan.",
      "They both noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year.",
      "The secret that UK stocks are cheap has been out there for some time. That is precisely why private buyers from the US and elsewhere have swooped on UK-listed companies meaning they disappear from the UK stock market.",
      "Even some of the biggest ones left are considered candidates for a move. Shell boss Wael Sawan told the BBC that while he had \"no immediate\" plans to move, he and his company \"got a very warm welcome\" when they held their big reception for investors in New York. Shell trades at a 35% discount to its US-listed peers and many of its shareholders aren't happy about it.",
      "What the DoorDash swoop on Deliveroo seems to highlight once again is that companies listed in the US can summon greater financial firepower with which to expand or acquire their rivals.",
      "Deliveroo will join the likes of Arm Holdings, Morrisons, CRH Holdings, Ultra, Meggitt and many others as companies who used to be listed on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "Does it matter? Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges.",
      "But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here.",
      "Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate.",
      "Trading on the London Stock Exchange is dwarfed by the trading of currencies, bonds and complex contracts but it has always been a centre of gravity for financial activity and one which many argue has lost its power to attract."

      "Mr Altman had put forward a similar plan in December - but without clarifying the control of the non-profit.",

    "story": [
      "The pace at 64-year-old Thirunavkarsu's spinning mill in southern India's Tamil Nadu state has noticeably slowed down.",
      "The viscose yarn \u2013 a popular material that goes into making woven garments \u2013 he produces, now sits in storage, as orders from local factories have dropped nearly 40% in the last month.",
      "That's because Chinese imports of the material have become cheaper by 15 rupees ($0.18; \u00a30.13) per kilo and flooded Indian ports.",
      "With Donald Trump imposing tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods going into the US, manufacturers in China have begun looking for alternative markets.",
      "India's textiles makers say they are bearing the brunt of the trade tensions as Chinese producers are dumping yarn in key production hubs.",
      "While China is the leading producer of viscose yarn, India makes most of the viscose yarn the country needs locally with imports only bridging supply gaps.",
      "Mill owners like Thirunavkarsu fear their yarn won't survive the onslaught of such competition.",
      "\"We can't match these rates. Our raw material is not as cheap,\" he says.",
      "Jagadesh Chandran, of the South India Spinners Association, told the BBC nearly 50 small spinning mills in the textile hubs of Pallipalayam, Karur and Tirupur in southern India are \"slowing production\". Many say they'll be forced to scale down further if the issue isn't addressed.",
      "China's Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, has sent assurances to India that his country will not dump products and in fact wants to buy more high-quality Indian products for Chinese consumers.",
      "\"We will not engage in market dumping or cut-throat competition, nor will we disrupt other countries' industries and economic development,\" he wrote in an opinion piece for the Indian Express newspaper.",
      "But anxieties about dumping are spread across sectors in India, as China - Asia's biggest economy - is the world's largest exporter of practically all industrial goods, from textiles and metals, to chemicals and rare minerals.",
      "While pharmaceuticals - and later phones, laptops, and semiconductor chips - were exempted from steep tariffs, large chunks of Chinese exports still run into Trump's 145% tariff wall. It is these goods that are expected to chase other markets like India.",
      "Their sudden inflow will prove \"very disruptive\" to emerging economies in Asia, according to Japanese broking house Nomura, whose research earlier revealed that China was flooding global markets with cheap goods even before Donald Trump took office earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, investigations against unfair Chinese imports rose to a record high. Data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) shows nearly 200 complaints were filed against China at the forum - a record - including 37 from India.",
      "India, in particular, with heavy dependencies on Chinese raw materials and intermediate goods, could be hit hard. Its trade deficit with China - the difference between what it imports and exports - has already ballooned to $100bn (\u00a375bn). And imports in March jumped 25%, driven by electronics, batteries and solar cells.",
      "In response, India's trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods, with its quasi-judicial arm probing imports across sectors, including viscose yarn.",
      "India also recently imposed a 12% tax on some steel imports, locally known as a safeguard duty, to help halt an increase in cheap shipments primarily from China, which were pushing some Indian mills to scale down.",
      "Despite such protections - and a loud marketing campaign by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to boost manufacturing locally - India has found it hard to reduce its reliance on China, with imports rising even when border tensions between the two neighbours peaked after 2020.",
      "That's because the government has only had \"limited success\" with its plans to turn India into the world's factory through things like the production linked subsidies, says Biswajit Dhar, a Delhi-based trade expert. And India continues to depend heavily on China for the intermediate goods that go into manufacturing finished products.",
      "While western multi-national companies like Apple are increasingly looking towards India to diversify their assembly lines away from China, India is still dependent on Chinese components to make these phones. As a result, imports in sectors like electronics have risen significantly, pushing up its trade deficit.",
      "India's burgeoning deficit is a \"worrying story\", says Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) think tank, all the more so because its exports to China have dropped to below 2014 levels despite a weaker currency, which should ideally help exporters.",
      "\"This isn't just a trade imbalance. It's a structural warning. Our industrial growth, including through PLI (production linked incentive) schemes, is fuelling imports, not building domestic depth,\" Srivastava wrote in a social media post. In other words, the subsidies are not helping India export more.",
      "\"We can't bridge this deficit without bridging our competitiveness gap.\"",
      "India needs to get its act together quickly to do that, given the opportunity US trade tensions with China have presented. But also because countries with a large rise in imports from China generally tend to see the sharpest slowdown in manufacturing growth, according to Nomura.",
      "Akash Prakash of Amansa Capital agrees. A key reason why Indian private companies were not investing enough, was because they feared being \"swamped by China\", he wrote in a column in the Business Standard newspaper. A recent study by the ratings agency Icra also corroborates this view.",
      "With fears of Chinese dumping becoming more widespread and the likes of the European Union seeking firm guarantees from Beijing that its markets will not be flooded, pressure is mounting on China - which is now urgently looking to secure newer trading partners outside the US.",
      "China wants to completely shift the narrative, says Mr Dhar, \"It is trying to come clean amidst increased scrutiny\".",
      "Despite the reassurances from Beijing, Delhi should use thawing relations with its larger neighbour to kickstart a proper dialogue on its firm stance about dumping, says Mr Dhar.",
      "\"This is an issue that India must flag, like most of the Western countries have.\"",

      "Trump said in an announcement overnight that he would apply tariffs to foreign-made films to help America's movie industry, which he said was dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "In response, the UK government said trade negotiations with Washington were ongoing and it was taking a \"calm and steady approach\" to talks in a bid to \"ease pressure on UK businesses\".",
      "UK filmmakers warned freelancers in the industry risked being \"jobless\" if US productions were pulled, with one union saying the tariffs could be a \"knock-out blow\".",
      "The UK film sector is worth \u00a31.36 billion and employs more than 195,000 people, the government said in October.",
      "Much of the detail of the new tariff has yet to be confirmed.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said later on Monday: \"Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again.\"",
      "But there is worry that UK film companies, which often produce movies with US firms - including recent blockbusters like Barbie and Wicked - could be badly hit.",
      "\"If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,\" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of UK production company Goldfinch, said.",
      "Philippa Childs, head of media and entertainment trade union, Bectu, echoed those fears: \"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\"",
      "A parliamentary committee's report published last month noted the UK's film and high-end television industry is \"dominated\" by inward investment from US studios and that this \"brings significant economic and social benefits to the UK\".",
      "Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) chairwoman Dame Caroline Dinenage said on Monday that MPs had warned \"against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe\" when the report came out.",
      "\"President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real,\" she said.",
      "Dame Caroline argued that making it more difficult to produce films in the UK was not in the interests of American businesses, many of which have invested in UK facilities, such as sound stages and studios.",
      "She urged ministers to \"urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way\".",
      "Shadow culture secretary Stuart Andrew said Labour must \"get a grip\" to secure a trade deal with the US and \"protect the UK film industry, otherwise we risk seeing long-term damage to a sector that is a global success\".",
      "Trump says non-US movies to be hit with 100% tariffs",
      "What impact might Trump's Hollywood tariffs plan have?",
      "Hollywood's big boom has gone bust",
      "It is still not entirely clear whether Trump's plans will affect only British films exported to the US or if it will also have an impact on co-productions, as referenced by Bell and others. The uncertainty itself is worrying for many.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Tim Richards, CEO and founder of Vue Entertainment, said: \"The devil will be in the details and we need to parcel through exactly what [Trump] means.",
      "\"A big part of this is what constitutes US film, is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?",
      "\"Hollywood\u2026 has been in decline for some time,\" he said. \"A lot of films are being shot in other states and in other markets, principally Canada, the UK and Australia.\"",
      "He added: \"One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world.\"",
      "Bell concurred that \"the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places\" and lower costs.",
      "\"People aren't going to the cinema as much and decline in subscription services and rise of social media platforms and content creators... the industry is entirely changed.\"",
      "She added: \"The answer is not tariffs if [Trump is] trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood.\"",
      "According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Californian film commission offers a 20\u202f percent base credit to feature films and TV series - lower than most other US states and countries like the UK and has a $330m (\u00a3248m) cap on the programme, which can make countries like the UK more attractive.",
      "A government spokesperson said on Monday: \"The film sector is a key part of the UK's world-class creative industries, which employ millions of people, generate billions for our economy and showcase the best of our creativity and culture to the world.",
      "\"We are absolutely committed to ensuring these sectors can continue to thrive and create good jobs right across the country, and will set this out through a new Creative Industries Sector Plan to be published soon.",
      "\"Talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK are ongoing - but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest.

    "published": "Sun, 04 May 2025 23:03:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The South American country is turning to wind power, but some local people are unhappy.",
    "story": [
      "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.",
      "With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.",
      "But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.",
      "\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.",
      "His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.",
      "\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.",
      "The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.",
      "Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.",
      "Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.",
      "Mr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.",
      "\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.",
      "His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.",
      "\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.",
      "These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.",
      "\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.",
      "\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"",
      "In December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.",
      "One factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.",
      "EDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.",
      "Guajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.",
      "And think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.",
      "\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.",
      "For Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.",
      "\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.",
      "This gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.",
      "\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"",
      "By contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.",
      "While Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.",
      "For energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.",
      "One such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.",
      "The company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.",
      "But it says good community relations are not enough.",
      "\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"",
      "On the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.",
      "Education and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.",
      "Some people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.",
      "His community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.",
      "Despite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.",
      "The plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.",
      "While the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark."

      "The likelihood of an immediate cut, with more to come, has been reflected in the markets and, in turn, on mortgage pricing.",
      "Eight in 10 homeowners with a mortgage have a fixed-rate deal and will pay close attention to the interest on new deals when they first buy or when they shop around ahead of a current deal expiring.",
      "Lenders have been cutting the mortgage rates on these new fixed deals in recent weeks, although not down to the levels seen during most of the 2010s. Given that lenders have already \"priced in\" a cut in interest rates, further falls in mortgage rates are not guaranteed.",
      "The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.15%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.08%.",
      "Samren Reddy, a medical student at the University of Liverpool who got in touch with Your Voice, Your BBC News, is saving to buy a first home.",
      "\"I don't think a small decrease will be a game changer. We're saving for the initial upfront deposit,\" the 21-year-old said.",
      "\"If I'm trying to save for a home, alongside my day-to-day living, even if I may be paying less on a loan and could get a cheaper mortgage, it's swallowed up by the pressures of living.\"",
      "A fall in interest rates are also likely have an impact on the returns people like Samren receive on their savings.",

      "Anna Bowes, savings expert at financial advice firm The Private Office, said it was \"encouraging\" that fixed savings rates were still competitive, with relatively high interest paid.",
      "However, she said that required people being willing to lock their savings into an account and to leave them untouched for the term of the deal, generally between one and five years.",
      "A rate cut would guarantee some mortgage-holders lower monthly repayments.",
      "Nearly 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that \"tracks\" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change would have an immediate impact.",
      "A typical tracker mortgage-holder is likely to see about \u00a329 knocked off their monthly repayments if the Bank rate is reduced by 0.25 percentage points, according to calculations by banking trade body UK Finance.",
      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC: \"I had a really good rate, then all of a sudden it changed and I got caught out.",
      "\"A drop would help because I've just been made redundant, so that would help a wee bit. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was, though.\"",
      "Those on standard variable rate mortgages will need to wait for the lender to decide on any changes to the home loan rate if the Bank's base rate changes.",

      "The Last of Us star Bella Ramsey has voiced support for awards shows keeping separate categories for male and female performers.",
      "The British star, who identifies as non-binary and asks to be referred to with they/them pronouns, said it was important that \"recognition for women in the industry is preserved\".",
      "\"But then, where do non-binary or gender non-conforming people fit into that? I don't know,\" Ramsey added.",
      "Ramsey has been nominated for best actress at the Baftas and Emmys. Other ceremonies such the MTV and Brit Awards have switched to all-encompassing gender-neutral prizes as the entertainment industry grapples with how non-binary actors should be treated by awards shows.",
      "Organisers of the Oscars said last year they were \"exploring\" the idea of merging the best actor and actress categories.",
      "Ramsey told Louis Theroux's podcast: \"If people call me an actress, I have a guttural 'ugh, that's not quite right' instinct to it.",
      "\"But I just don't take it too seriously. It doesn't feel like an attack on my identity. It's just a funny thing that doesn't really fit.\"",
      "'I've tried to think my way to the answer'",
      "Ramsey said they \"didn't find it insulting\" to be nominated for best actress at the Emmys.",
      "Theroux suggested that having a single category would mean \"basically a lot of women wouldn't get nominated\" - as happened when the Brits scrapped their best male and female categories in favour of a best artist award, and no women were nominated in 2023.",

      "\"I was so stressed out about it because I didn't know, and I didn't really care.\"",
      "Ramsey said they rejected the term non-binary \"for so long\" because they didn't want to be seen as being \"trendy\".",
      "\"It was just something that had been very obvious since I was young. I'd always call myself a tomboy, but it wasn't that I was like a boyish girl. I was always a bit of an inbetween, leaning more to the boy's side to be honest.",
      "\"I feel like I grew up more as a little boy than I did a little girl. I always felt more masculine or... yeah, more on that side of the spectrum, I guess.\"",
      "The question of how to categorise awards has been a long-running debate in the entertainment industry.",
      "Currently, most awards shows invite actors to submit themselves for the category they feel comfortable in.",
      "In 2022, The Crown's Emma Corrin, who identifies as non-binary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I don't think the categories are inclusive enough at the moment. It's about everyone being able to feel acknowledged and represented.\"",
      "In 2023, Yellowjackets star Liv Hewson, also non-binary, didn't enter the Emmys, saying: \"There's not a place for me in the acting categories. It would be inaccurate for me to submit myself as an actress. It neither makes sense for me to be lumped in with the boys.\"",

    "story": [
      "A final shortlist of five proposed designs for the national memorial to Queen Elizabeth II has been revealed by the government.",
      "The memorial, commemorating the life of Britain's longest-reigning monarch who died in September 2022, will be built in St James's Park in central London.",
      "Illustrations of the design concepts are being put online by the Cabinet Office and the public will be invited to have their say about the ideas for the major new monument.",
      "Three of the five proposed designs feature the late Queen riding a horse, reflecting her lifelong enthusiasm for equestrianism.",
      "There are other features proposed by the competing teams of artists and architects, such as incorporating recordings of the late Queen's voice into a memorial, and large sculptures of lilies around a figure of the late Queen.",
      "One of the proposed designs uses an oak tree to represent Queen Elizabeth's strength and resilience. Another suggests building symbolic pathways and a pair of bridges over the lake in the park.",
      "The winning entry will be chosen later this year, but there is no date yet set for when the finished memorial will be unveiled. The construction budget will be between \u00a323m and \u00a346m, depending on the selected design, says the Cabinet Office.",
      "The public will get a chance to say whether they want a more traditional representation of the late Queen, or something more experimental, in what will become an important London landmark.",
      "The new memorial will be placed not too far from statues of the late Queen's parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.",
      "Also nearby is the memorial to Queen Victoria outside Buckingham Palace.",
      "The location for the monument will be a section of St James's Park close to the Mall and across to a bridge over a lake in the park. The entries include plans to landscape and redesign this area and the construction process is expected to mean replacing the current bridge.",
      "The memorial scheme will also provide community projects and facilities around the country.",
      "This will follow in the tradition of legacy schemes such as the King George V Playing Fields, which saw almost 500 sports grounds opened in memory of the monarch who died in 1936.",
      "Many of those playing fields are still in use, dotted around the country.",
      "The public is being encouraged to contribute ideas about the memorial and to give feedback on the shortlisted designs.",

      "Baroness Amos, a former leader of the House of Lords, said the memorial should be a fitting tribute to the late Queen, who died at the age of 96 after seven decades on the throne.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has said he will hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he ramps up trade disputes with nations around the world.",
      "Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he was authorising the US Department of Commerce and Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "He later said he would consult Hollywood executives to see if \"they're happy\" with his proposal, after the news sent shockwaves through the industry.",

      "Is Hollywood 'dying'?",
      "Announcing the new tariffs, Trump declared that Hollywood was \"dying\". So is it?",
      "It's true that the industry has been through a really rough time in recent years.",
      "The pandemic saw production close down and the impact is ongoing.",
      "Hollywood studios spent $11.3 billion on productions in the second quarter of 2024, a 20% drop from the same period in 2022, as studios continued to cut costs in an attempt to recover from Covid losses.",
      "Any shoots of recovery were then severely stifled by the 2023 actors and writers strikes.",
      "Then the wildfires struck earlier this year.",
      "And for several years now, more and more people - not just youngsters - have been turning to YouTube and other streaming platforms for content.",
      "The US remains a major film production hub and according to Variety, 2025 has seen a rebound in box office numbers since last year, with overall domestic revenues up 15.8% on 2024 so far.",
      "Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?",
      "Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?",
      "The latest Marvel superhero film, Thunderbolts*, topped the North American box office this weekend, raking in an estimated $76 million, marking a promising start to the summer season.",
      "But Hollywood is definitely still up against it.",
      "What is Trump proposing?",
      "The president says he wants to \"immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands. We want movies made in America again!\"",
      "This has led to questions about whether the tariffs would also apply to American film companies producing films abroad.",
      "Several recent major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. Hit franchises like Mission Impossible also shoot overseas.",
      "We also don't yet know if the tariffs will be applied retrospectively.",
      "Trump later told reporters that \"other nations have been stealing the movies and movie-making capabilities from the United States\", which may suggest he was only referring to non-US films.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai told the BBC that \"no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made\", and added that the administration is \"exploring all options\".",
      "We will have to wait for more detail.",
      "What incentives do other countries offer?",
      "Many countries offer tax breaks to encourage film production such as New Zealand, Australia and the UK and that's something Trump wants to take on.",
      "But it's not the only reason a US film company might wish to film abroad.",
      "Some choose to do so for the specific location, exotic and exciting backdrops for example. Who could forget Tom Cruise's ascent of the Burj Khalifa, Dubai, in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol?",
      "What could it mean for the next James Bond movie, a franchise now owned by US giant Amazon, but based on an iconic British character who works for MI6, based in London?",
      "And it's not just other countries that offer incentives - other US states are luring film production away from Hollywood.",
      "Georgia, Illinois and Kentucky are among the many other US states which California are now competing with.",
      "Gavin Newsom, California's governor, who Trump described as \"grossly incompetent\" when speaking about the movie tariffs on Monday, is currently pushing for his plan to more than double the state's film and TV tax incentives to $750 million annually.",
      "While Newsom has made no comment yet on Trump's proposal, his senior communications advisor told Deadline: \"We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law.\"",
      "How would any such tariffs actually work?",
      "There are more questions than answers at this stage.",
      "The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a moratorium on tariffs for digital goods until 2026. Presumably films count as digital goods.",
      "And what would they base the tariffs on? Box office revenue or production costs? Is streaming content included? That would have a huge impact on US companies like Netflix. What about post-production ie editing?",
      "Tim Richards, Vue Entertainment CEO and founder, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"A big part of this is what constitutes US film - is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?\"",
      "And how do you even classify a foreign film when so many are co-productions and are often shot in several countries?",
      "Trump appeared to be talking about film and not TV but it's not 100% clear at this stage. Would tariffs apply to films made for streaming or just cinema releases? We'll have to wait for more detail. And of course, Trump may rollback on the proposals as he has done with some other tariffs.",
      "What could it mean for other countries?",
      "Obviously, putting a 100% tariff on foreign films means a huge cost increase for those production companies who want to sell to the US market.",
      "Commenting on Trump's announcement, the UK government's Culture Media and Sport Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage MP said: \"Last month the Culture, Media and Sport Committee warned against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe. President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real.",
      "\"Making it more difficult to make films in the UK is not in the interests of American businesses. Their investment in facilities and talent in the UK, based on US-owned IP, is showing fantastic returns on both sides of the Atlantic. Ministers must urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way.\"",
      "Head of media and entertainment trade union Bectu in the UK, Philippa Childs, said in a statement: \"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\"",
      "Kirsty Bell, chief executive of production company Goldfinch, questioned how the tariffs would work, pointing out that blockbusters like Barbie, which was distributed by US film studio Warner Bros Pictures, \"was actually shot virtually entirely in the UK\".",
      "\"If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,\" she told PA.",
      "The governments of Australia and New Zealand have also spoken out in support of their countries' film industries.",
      "\"Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry,\" Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said.",
      "New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference that his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs.",
      "\"But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,\" he added.",
      "And with the Cannes film festival just around the corner, uncertainty hangs in the air with many US film producers looking to sell foreign distribution rights.",
      "Could such tariffs work?",
      "Tariffs could incentivise US film companies to make more films on home soil but the risk is that if it's more expensive than to do so abroad, some films just won't get made.",
      "More incentives or rebates could help offset this but we just don't know at this stage if that's under discussion on a national scale.",
      "NPR Radio film critic Eric Deggans warned that the tariffs, should they be introduced, could further harm the industry.",
      "Other countries may respond by placing tariffs on American films, he told the BBC, making it \"harder for these films to make profits overseas\".",

    "story": [
      "The trial of US rapper and music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has begun in New York with jury selection.",
      "If jurors are chosen this week, lawyers on both sides are expected to deliver their opening statements on Monday 12 May.",
      "The charges against Mr Combs include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted, he could face life in prison.",
      "The rapper also faces dozens of civil lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people.",
      "Mr Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and rejected the individual lawsuits as attempts \"for a quick payday\".",
      "How long will the Diddy trial last?",
      "Proceedings got under way on Monday 5 May in front of US District Judge Arun Subramanian, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in lower Manhattan.",
      "Choosing a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates is expected to take a week.",
      "The judge told jurors the trial itself could last around eight weeks.",
      "The court is expected to be open to the public, but proceedings won't be televised or streamed online.",
      "Cameras, phones and electronic devices are normally not allowed in US federal courtrooms.",
      "How are jurors selected?",
      "Attorneys began picking through dozens of potential jurors on Monday.",
      "Judge Subramanian reminded the court several times of the importance of choosing a fair and impartial jury.",
      "Nearly all the potential jurors had read news reports of the allegations in the case and many had seen footage of Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a hotel hallway.",
      "Several women in the selection pool said they had been victims of sexual abuse or assault or knew someone close who had.",
      "But more than a dozen said they could go into the case with an open mind and pledged not to form an opinion until they heard all the evidence.",
      "At the end of the first day, 19 jurors moved to the next stage of questioning. They range in age from 30 to 75, and are from Manhattan, the Bronx and Westchester, and include financial analysts, teachers, scientists and cashiers.",
      "What are the charges and allegations against Diddy?",
      "In the federal criminal case being heard in New York, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Many of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.",
      "This includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.",
      "In a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.",
      "Separately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.",
      "Tony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US had either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or intended to do so.",
      "In December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack.",
      "Mr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"",
      "Mr Combs' current legal issues began in late 2023 when he was sued by Ms Ventura, also known as Cassie, for violent abuse and rape.",
      "That lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.",
      "Since then, dozens of other people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all the claims.",
      "His controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CNN leaked CCTV footage from 2016 showing Mr Combs kicking his ex-girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor.",
      "He apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"",

      "Diddy's violence left me broken, says Cassie",
      "What has Diddy said about the charges against him?",
      "In a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, Mr Combs' lawyer said: \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.",
      "\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"",
      "Diddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss one part of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.",
      "In a hearing in New York a week before the trial officially began, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal.",
      "They said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers.",
      "At the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal.",
      "Mr Combs' lawyers have consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".",
      "How long could Diddy spend in jail if he is found guilty?",
      "If convicted on the racketeering charge, Mr Combs faces up to life in prison.",
      "He faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.",
      "Transportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",
      "Mr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.",
      "Critics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence.",
      "His lawyers argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions, but a New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.",
      "Prosecutors previously alleged that Mr Combs had broken prison rules by contacting potential witnesses.",
      "They accused him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".",
      "A judge granted Mr Combs permission to wear non-prison clothing during his trial rather than the jumpsuits he wears in jail.",
      "When he appeared in court for jury selection, the rapper wore a blue sweater and white shirt with glasses on his head.",
      "How did 'Sean 'Diddy' Combs become successful?",
      "Mr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged in the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.",
      "His early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or The Notorious B.I.G.",
      "His music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.",
      "Mr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand C\u00eeroc.",
      "In 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.",

    "summary": "The US singer says she feels \"bruised\" after weeks of online backlash - what's sparked the change?",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this week American singer Katy Perry, best known for her bubblegum pop, said she felt like a \"human Pi\u00f1ata\" after weeks of online backlash.",
      "The description felt suitably colourful - but the acknowledgement was serious. A decade on from headlining the Superbowl, Perry's part in a much-derided Blue Origin spaceflight has seen her star crash down to Earth.",
      "Mockery over the apparent worthiness of her reaction, including kissing the ground after landing and saying she felt \"so connected to love\", spread online. Fast food chain Wendy's even posted to ask: \"Can we send her back?\"",
      "Trolls have now taken aim at her world tour, which began in Mexico on 23 April, criticising her dance moves and performances.",
      "It seems the star who first broke through singing about a boyfriend's mood swings now faces an icy reception. Perry's blamed an \"unhinged and unhealed\" internet - but is toxic social media the only reason?",
      "'A pattern of failed reinvention'",
      "The music writer Michael Cragg, author of Reach for the Stars, believes Perry's problem is that she's stuck between pop cultures and feels increasingly out of touch.",
      "\"Her pop star persona was cemented in the 2010s as cartoon-y, fun and playful, all whipped cream bras and goofy videos where she wore oversized braces on her teeth,\" he says.",
      "For a period this worked. Her second album Teenage Dream, which doubled down on Perry's staple cheeky, sexualised girl-next-door image, scored five Billboard number one singles to match a record set by Michael Jackson. Its follow-up, 2013's Prism, bore transatlantic smash single Roar (her fourth solo UK number one), as well as Dark Horse in the US (her ninth domestically). Perry hasn't topped charts under her own steam since.",
      "\"That was a long time ago in pop terms and it feels like she hasn't evolved,\" adds Cragg.",
      "In the past year, her comeback single Woman's World, touted as a female empowerment anthem, struck critics as lyrically shallow.",
      "Some fans also seemed unimpressed that it was produced by Dr. Luke, who previously faced sexual assault allegations from the singer Kesha. The producer denied the claims and the pair reached an agreement to settle a defamation lawsuit in 2023, but Perry remained tainted by association.",
      "The track failed to land in the top 50 in the US and only just managed in the UK, at 47. \"Her sort of spiritual 'let love lead the way' messages she posts don't really hold sway with very online pop fans in the face of that decision,\" says Cragg.",
      "\"The regressive girl boss feel of Woman's World, and then the album not being great hasn't helped,\" he adds, pointing to rapper Doja Cat's success working with Dr. Luke without the same negative response.",
      "It followed a pattern of failed reinvention attempts stretching back to 2017's Witness, where Perry attempted to launch her socially conscious \"purposeful pop\" era.",
      "But its Sia-written lead single Chained to the Rhythm, which boldly attacked mindless pop culture, appeared to be undermined by Bon Appetit, a song openly objectifying Perry as a sexual meal.",
      "The 'pop girlie' has changed",
      "Female pop stardom has shifted. Last year's biggest breakout music stars \u2013 Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX \u2013 were women joined by a thread of fierce self-assurance, underpinned by relatability and authenticity.",
      "In contrast, Perry wanted distance from her pop persona - as the headline for Cragg's 2017 Guardian interview with her put it: \"I created this character called Katy Perry. I didn't want to be Katheryn Hudson. It was too scary.\"",
      "Perry's first hit I Kissed A Girl caused controversy for the fetishisation of lesbians even back in 2008 when it was released. But today Roan's had global success telling her genuine queer awakening.",
      "\"The flip flopping has jarred in an era where... very defined pop star personas are the ones cutting through,\" argues Cragg.",
      "Perry's 2021-2023 playground-styled Las Vegas residency embraced her surreal, fantastical image to commercial and critical success.",
      "But it's not translating to a new generation of fans. \"I think ultimately people see her as a bit cringeworthy now,\" Cragg adds. \"Being shot into space on a billionaire's jolly while everyone watches that on social media platforms interspersed with war and the climate crisis... just feels tonally not ideal,\" he says.",
      "Perry may have misjudged the public mood, but at the same time, the venom in the blowback points to deeper issues in pop culture beyond her control.",
      "There is no doubt that the social media landscape has become more frenzied in recent years, with stars like Roan speaking against toxic fandoms.",
      "Simon Diego, the creator of Brazil's Portal Katy Perry fan community, described the scale of the abuse towards the 40-year-old as \"unbelievable\".",
      "The group showed their support by clubbing together with other fan pages to pay for a digital billboard message in New York's Times Square for 24 hours.",
      "\"We're so proud of you and your magical journey and we love you to the moon and back,\" it read.",
      "\"Know that you are safe, seen and celebrated. We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning.\"",
      "It was this that Perry replied to directly with her Pi\u00f1ata remark acknowledging the backlash.",
      "\"I think Katy and many other celebrities are feeling unsafe in the one space that used to connect them to fans,\" Diego tells BBC News.",
      "He believes that's why Perry has never posted photos of her daughter's face online.",
      "But even that boundary was ignored in the wake of the spaceflight criticism, as commenters began targeting her four-year-old child simply because \"it's cool now\", he says. \"They don't understand how bad it could affect her.\"",
      "Others, like Marie Claire Australia editor Georgie McCourt, think pervasive misogyny plays a part.",
      "\"There's a particular ire reserved for women like Perry: ambitious, unapologetic, hyper-visible,\" she wrote in a column, noting that male celebrities have already gone into space without such surveillant reaction.",
      "So where next for Perry? Cragg says a hit single would help.",
      "\"I'm not saying it will return her to the commercial highs of old, because that ship has sailed for a lot of pre-streaming artists, but it will steady the ship.\"",

    "story": [
      "While most 13-year-olds were spending their Monday evening stressing over homework, awkward school crushes and what to post on TikTok, Blue Ivy Carter was performing in front of a crowd of 70,000 people alongside her mother Beyonc\u00e9 on the opening night of her Cowboy Carter tour.",
      "Her numerous cameos throughout the show \u2013 particularly her solo dance during D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu \u2013 were highly praised.",
      "\"She must be one of the most self-disciplined 13-year-olds in America,\" Variety's Chris Willman wrote. On social media, fans said the child prodigy was the \"greatest nepo baby of all time\" as they marvelled at her flawless dance routines.",
      "Being a nepo baby - shorthand for the children of celebrities who often find themselves fast-tracked into industries such as film, fashion, and music - may have been scorned at in the past, but Blue Ivy's performance may have complicated the narrative.",
      "The teen had access to a stage that most could only dream of, but she also delivered a performance that fans and critics agreed was very impressive, which raises the question: Is this just another example of a celebrity child given an unearned spotlight, or could Blue Ivy be a genuine star in her own right?",
      "'An easier ride'",
      "This is also not the first time Blue Ivy has performed in public \u2013 she joined her mother on stage two years ago on the Renaissance tour and last year voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King.",
      "But music journalist Caroline Sullivan says Blue Ivy's trajectory to stardom \"has very little to do with her and everything to do with the parent\".",
      "\"It's about how much we like or dislike the parent \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is well liked so fans will praise Blue Ivy,\" she explains. \"Of course, it helps that she's good at what she does but even if she wasn't, she'd be given an easier ride.\"",
      "Sullivan also says that the authenticity of Blue Ivy wanting to perform instead of being forced to do it by her mother adds to how we perceive her.",
      "Speaking to the BBC last month, Beyonc\u00e9's mother, Tina Knowles, said Blue Ivy and her siblings were being nurtured to do \"anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed into show business\".",
      "She added that her granddaughter had had to \"work for\" her role in The Lion King prequel and she \"worries about the fame\" impacting her grandchildren.",
      "Blue Ivy is hardly the first child to have performed on stage with a famous parent. Madonna's 17-year-old daughter played the piano on her mother's Celebration tour in 2023, Dave Grohl's 19-year-old daughter has often sung with him on stage and Phil Collins' son was the drummer on his 2019 tour.",
      "\"It's not because he's the boss's son that he's playing the drums, it's because he's good enough,\" the former Genesis drummer said in 2019 as he defended his decision to take his 17-year-old son on his world tour.",
      "Sullivan says it can often be \"naff and cringy\" if a musician brings their child on stage \"just for the sake of it\", but if done right, it can be \"incredibly sweet and show a lot of love\".",
      "Many critics, including Tomas Mier from Rolling Stone, said Beyonc\u00e9's youngest daughter Rumi joining her on stage for Protector was \"one of the most heartwarming moments of the evening\".",
      "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's 11-year-old daughter, North West, has also forged the beginnings of a music career, recently delivering a rap verse in Japanese on FKA Twigs' single Childlike Things.",
      "Twigs said she chose to collaborate with North West because her \"energy is so inspiring\" and she was \"so confident\".",
      "\"I wasn't that confident when I was a kid. I was so shy, I was scared of the dark, I was very different to the other kids at my school. It suddenly occurred to me that I would have loved to have a friend like North, who could speak up for themselves.\"",
      "North West also appeared as Young Simba in the Hollywood Bowl's The Lion King 30th anniversary concert last year but her singing was criticised on social media.",
      "\"Given how controversial her parents are, I think North West will struggle to break away from the nepo baby claims because unless she is unbelievably talented, she will be slated,\" Sullivan says.",
      "In December 2022, New York magazine's cover story on nepo babies caused a stir in the showbusiness industry.",
      "The cover featured the faces of famous actors including Dakota Johnson, Jack Quaid, Zo\u00eb Kravitz and Lily Rose-Depp edited onto the bodies of babies, with the headline: \"She has her mother's eyes. And agent.\"",
      "The story claimed that \"a nepo baby is physical proof that meritocracy is a lie\" and that \"today, they're not only abundant - they're thriving\".",
      "It was met with backlash by many stars who claimed the label was unfair and diminished their hard work.",
      "Gwyneth Paltrow, a nepo baby herself as the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and film director Bruce Paltrow, said the term was an \"ugly moniker\" and that children of famous people should not be judged negatively because \"there's nothing wrong with doing or wanting to do what your parents do\".",
      "Similarly, Zoe Kravitz told GQ that it was \"completely normal for people to be in the family business\", while Stranger Things actress Maya Hawke said a famous family name \"definitely gives you massive advantages in this life but the chances will not be infinite; so you have to keep working and do a good job. If you do a bad job, the chances will stop\".",
      "Almost Famous star Kate Hudson, daughter of actors Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, said in a 2022 interview with the Independent that \"people call it whatever they want\", but the idea that children will follow in the footsteps of their parents is \"not going to change\".",
      "Hudson was right that, in the three years since New York magazine's cover story caused so much controversy, nepo babies haven't slunk off into the background. In fact, they continue to thrive, particularly those with real talent.",
      "Pam Lyddon, a PR executive in the entertainment industry says that there's \"no denying that being well-connected can absolutely help you succeed in the industry\" but \"while connections might get you noticed, you do still need genuine talent, hard work, and resilience to stay in the game - results speak for themselves and reputations are everything.\"",
      "She explains that for the new wave of nepo babies, talent is even more important as the \"scrutiny is more intense and people are more media savvy\" so you can't get away with mediocrity.",

    "story": [
      "More victims of the infected blood scandal will die without ever receiving full compensation, a government minister has said.",
      "The paymaster general Nick Thomas-Symonds was giving evidence to a special session of the public inquiry into what's been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history.",
      "It's thought 30,000 patients in the UK were infected with HIV or hepatitis B and C after being treated with a contaminated blood clotting product or given a blood transfusion in the 1970s and 80s.",
      "Mr Thomas-Symonds agreed it was \"profoundly unsatisfactory\" that just 106 final compensation awards have been paid, almost a year after a damning report into the scandal was published.",
      "What is the infected blood scandal?",
      "'Infected blood has ruined my life for 40 years'",
      "\"I'm never going to think this is satisfactory until everybody has received the compensation that is due,\" the Cabinet Office minister said.",
      "\"The objective should be absolutely to pay [people] as soon as possible.\"",
      "A final report into the scandal, published last year, found that the disaster could largely have been avoided if different decisions had been taken by the health authorities at the time.",
      "The report said too little was done to stop the importing of contaminated blood products from abroad in the 1970s and 80s, and there was evidence that elements of the scandal had been covered up.",
      "Last month the chair of the public inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff, ordered two days of extra hearings after he received \"letter after letter, email after email\" expressing concerns about the way the government's compensation scheme has been managed.",
      "The Chancellor Rachel Reeves set aside \u00a311.8bn in the last budget to make final awards to victims and their family members, but the latest figures show less than 1% of that total, some \u00a397m, has been paid out to date.",
      "Survivors of the scandal and some bereaved relatives have also received a series of smaller interim compensation payments over the last three years.",
      "Eleven victims and their representatives gave evidence in an emotional panel session in front of an audience of around 300 people in Westminster.",
      "'Betrayed and disappointed'",
      "Andrew Evans, chair of the campaign group Tainted Blood, told the hearing many victims and their families had been left feeling \"betrayed and disappointed\".",
      "\"People have given up on any expectation of receiving anything,\" he said.",
      "\"They have lost all hope of ever getting justice and we can't be doing this for much longer.\"",
      "Other witnesses criticised the way in which individuals were being contacted and \"invited\" to come forward to claim final compensation, describing it as \"waiting for your lottery ticket to come up\".",
      "Gary Webster, a haemophiliac who was infected with HIV and hepatitis C when a pupil at Treloar's School in Hampshire in the 1970s and 80s, said that \"[some] people will not get their compensation and a lot of claims will die with them.\"",
      "\"It's just too slow and people won't get the justice they deserve,\" he added.",
      "Under the current rules, if someone infected with HIV or hepatitis B or C dies before receiving full compensation, then any final award can be passed on to their relatives through their estate.",
      "But compensation can also be claimed by those affected by the scandal \u2013 a partner, sibling or parent of a child, for example \u2013 for the separate impact on their lives.",
      "And if they die before that compensation is agreed, then their claim will die with them and cannot be passed on.",
      "In questioning later in the day, Mr Thomas-Symonds, who leads on the response for the government, said he was \"restless for further progress on payments\".",
      "The Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA), an independent body set up to pay victims of the scandal, has said it expects the \"bulk\" of awards to be made to infected survivors by the end of 2027, with most of those affected, such as family members and carers, paid by the end of 2029.",
      "Mr Thomas-Symonds said he regarded that timeline as a \"backstop\" rather than a target to work towards.",
      "\"The logic for that is there may be other people who have not yet come forward at this stage [to claim],\" he said.",

      "Sir Rob said it was \"a disgrace\" how Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) had failed in its care of 20-year-old Matthew Leahy, who died in 2012, and a 20-year-old man referred to as Mr R, who died in 2008.",
      "\"This was the National Health Service at its worst and needed calling out,\" Sir Rob said.",
      "'Near-complete failure'",
      "Sir Rob referred in his inquiry appearance to several reports made during his tenure, including \"Missed Opportunities\", which looked into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Mr Leahy and Mr R.",
      "Mr Leahy was found unresponsive at the Linden Centre in Chelmsford. He reported being raped there just days before he died.",
      "Sir Rob told the inquiry the PHSO identified \"19 instances of maladministration\" in Mr Leahy's case by North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust - a predecessor to EPUT - including that his care plan was falsified.",
      "The former ombudsman said there had been \"a near-complete failure of the leadership of this trust, certainly before it was merged\" with South Essex Partnership Trust to become EPUT.",
      "\"This was an indictment of the health service,\" he added.",
      "Sir Rob paid tribute to Matthew's mother, Melanie Leahy, who campaigned for more than a decade for a public inquiry, calling her \"an exemplary complainant\".",
      "\"She was very well prepared for every meeting, she was courteous but assertive. She knew what she wanted out of an investigation.",
      "\"Given the tragedy that she'd been through, it was a remarkable contribution to public life that she performed over many years,\" Sir Rob said.",
      "He also said that the way some doctors spoke about Mr R was \"staggering\".",
      "Mr R was found unresponsive in the Linden Centre in December 2008 and died afterwards. Sir Rob Behrens found he had been failed multiple times by those treating him.",
      "\"Some clinicians were interviewed after he died, and they had a very patronising approach to him\" he told the inquiry.",
      "\"In their view, [Mr R] didn't have mental health problems at all, and he had been admitted because he wanted somewhere to live because he was homeless. That is staggering.\"",
      "'No confidence'",
      "In a report called \"Broken Trust\", published in 2023, Sir Rob referenced there were more than a dozen different health and care regulators playing important roles in patient safety.",
      "\"Political leaders have created a confusing landscapes of organisations, often in knee-jerk reaction to patient safety crisis points,\" the report said.",
      "Sir Rob agreed with a suggestion put to him by Nicholas Griffin KC, chief counsel to the inquiry, that some incidents \"fall through the gaps\" due to the complexity of the complaints process and therefore are not investigated.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who simply don't know where to go,\" Sir Rob said.",
      "\"At the moment, I have no confidence that people trust the system because they don't know where to go when they want to make a complaint.\"",
      "Sir Rob said that Essex was \"not exceptional\" and the issues he had discovered there could be seen in other places as well.",
      "\"The absence of leadership\u2026 not communicating effectively with patients, the safety issues around ligature points\u2026 and the absence of training and development - these are still issues which the NHS has to address generally, not just in Essex,\" he said.",
      "The former ombudsman also told the inquiry that he was prevented from investigating a significant number of deaths\u00a0due to a \"serious limitation\" in his office's powers.",
      "Sir Rob Behrens explained the ombudsman could only investigate following a complaint, but that for understandable reasons of bereavement or trauma, many families in Essex did not complain following the deaths of loved ones.",

      "The \"big baby\" trial aimed to find out if starting labour earlier than 38 weeks made it less likely for infants who appeared large in the womb to be born with shoulder dystocia, where the shoulder becomes stuck during delivery.",
      "Study findings from between 2018 and 2022 showed giving birth a week to 10 days earlier reduced the risk, researchers said.",
      "It is hoped the data from the \u00a32.5m Coventry-based trial will give doctors and midwives more confidence in facilitating natural births.",
      "Coventry nurse Eve Morgan took part in the study 2018 after monitoring found her baby could reach 9lb (4kg).",

      "Shoulder dystocia occurs in 1 in 150 vaginal deliveries, delaying birth and leading to possible complications, including a stretching in the nerves of the infant's neck.",
      "The NHS says the condition occurs more often in bigger babies but there is uncertainty over how often.",
      "It is estimated it could affect 1 in 25 women with a big baby who have a vaginal delivery.",

      "Prof Quenby said the trial findings empowered women to decide \"how and when they want to deliver their baby\".",
      "Trial data crucially revealed babies did not suffer more harm if they were delivered later. It also showed earlier delivery reduced the need for emergency Caesarean section and did not increase the risk of tearing.",
      "\"Whether you're induced at 38 weeks or whether you choose to wait for a natural labour, in both groups the baby's outcomes were the same,\" Prof Quenby said.",
      "\"Both groups had a risk of shoulder dystocia, it was actually slightly higher if you waited for labour naturally - but babies didn't do any worse if you wait for labour naturally.\"",

      "The impact assessment says that the total number of assisted deaths is estimated to range from between 164 and 787 in the first (half) year of the service to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, and assuming a start date to the policy of October 2029.",
      "The upper estimate  of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said.",
      "The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved \u2013 it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy.",
      "It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June.",
      "Costs and savings",
      "In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around \u00a3919,000 to \u00a310.3m.",
      "This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need.",
      "By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from \u00a35.84m to \u00a359.6m.",
      "But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of \u00a310m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over \u00a311m.",
      "One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours.",
      "It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain.",
      "And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost \u00a32,000 a day.",
      "Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is \"workable, effective and enforceable\".",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment.",
      "She said she was still \"firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"For me, assisted dying and giving people a choice at the end of their life when they are facing a terminal illness is about the human cost, it's not about pounds and pence.\"",
      "But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: \"This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'.\"",
      "Leadbeater told Today the eligibility criteria under the bill was \"extremely strict\".",
      "She said: \"You have to be terminally ill. There are multiple layers of safeguarding built into the bill, including a multi-disciplinary panel of experts.",
      "\"So we are assessing mental capacity, we are checking for coercion at every level of this process to make sure that this is the clear and settled informed wish of the person who is terminally ill.\"",
      "She said that the bill was \"only about terminally ill adults who have less than six months to live\". \"The bill does not cover people with disabilities,\" she added.",
      "Prof Katherine Sleeman, professor of palliative care at King's College London, said the cost of end of life care was \"very, very high\", adding \"obviously if someone is not living those last months of life then it's lower\".",
      "However, she cautioned that the figures in the assessment were estimates."

      "However, attempts to make the UK more self-sufficient in blood products failed, so the NHS continued using foreign supplies.",
      "Campaigners say haemophiliacs could have been offered an alternative treatment called Cryoprecipitate. This was much harder to administer, but was made from the blood plasma of a single donor, lowering the infection risk.",
      "BBC News has also uncovered evidence children were infected with hepatitis C and HIV after being placed on clinical trials of new treatments - often, without their family's consent.",
      "As late as November 1983, the government insisted there was no \"conclusive proof\" that HIV could be transmitted in blood, a line robustly defended by former Conservative health minister Ken Clarke when he appeared before the inquiry.",

    "summary": "Why is the number of autism diagnoses changing? And what does it mean for autistic people?",
    "story": [
      "You might have seen the social media videos: the \"five signs you're autistic\". You may have heard about long waiting lists for autism diagnosis. You might know, or sense, that the numbers of people deemed autistic are going up, fast.",
      "There's a lot at stake. These numbers mean fiercely different things to different people. To some, autism is a fear (what if this happens to my child?); to others it's an identity, maybe even a superpower.",
      "So what's the truth about the number of autistic people - and what does it mean?",
      "To count something, you first need to say what it is you're counting.",
      "For someone to be diagnosed with autism, they need to have \"persistent difficulties in social life and in social communication,\" says Ginny Russell, an associate professor in psychiatry at University College London (UCL) and the author of The Rise of Autism. She's using the criteria for autism from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM.",
      "She says examples of this behaviour can range from a lack of turn-taking in conversation to being completely non-verbal.",
      "Restricted interests and repetitive behaviours are part of a second group of traits required to meet the criteria, she says. So things like \"hand flapping or rocking or skin picking, but also sticking to repeated routines, like eating the same food every day.\"",
      "The data",
      "But what evidence is there that the number of people meeting those criteria has risen?",
      "Ms Russell led a study that looked at changes in rates of autism diagnosis in the UK over 20 years. It drew on a big sample of data from about nine million patients who were registered at GP surgeries.",
      "They found eight times as many new autism diagnoses in 2018 as in 1998. \"It was an enormous increase,\" she says, \"best described as exponential.\"",
      "And it's not just happening in the UK. Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".",
      "But - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.",
      "Ms Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?",
      "Why are diagnoses rising?",
      "The definition of autism has not been static. The first studies to describe autism appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, says Francesca Happ\u00e9, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London, who's been researching autism since 1988.",
      "\"The original descriptions of autism are of children who have pretty high support needs, typically are very late to talk,\" she says. \"Some don't talk at all. And the focus really was on children, of course, and largely on males.\"",
      "But the definition was broadened, Prof Happ\u00e9 says, when in the 1990s Asperger's syndrome was added to diagnostic manuals. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.",
      "The eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.",
      "Another subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.",
      "Today, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.",
      "The autism net has been cast wider.",
      "Autism in women and girls",
      "One group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.",
      "Studies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.",
      "It's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism.",
      "\"I've been doing this maybe 15, 20 years or so,\" she says. \"In the early days, they were virtually all males that were coming forward for diagnosis. And now they're nearly all females who I see.\"",
      "Ms Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.",
      "She says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".",
      "Because autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).",
      "Now we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.",
      "She says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.",
      "More adults diagnosed",
      "The rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Ms Hendrickx says this shows another way the autism net has been cast wider: it now includes more people with lower support needs.",
      "\"We are talking, I think, more about individuals with no intellectual disability,\" she says. \"I think people with delays in their development, in their speech, are much more likely to have been diagnosed much, much earlier because the signs were much clearer at a very young age.\"",
      "There's data to back this up. One study shows that between 2000 and 2018, new autism diagnoses of those with intellectual disability rose about 20%, while autism diagnoses in those without intellectual disability rose 700%. Autism's centre of gravity has shifted.",
      "For Ellie Middleton, an autistic and ADHD content creator and author, that's a good thing.",
      "The 27-year-old says that sceptics questioning the increase in diagnoses should instead be asking: \"how did all of these people spend so much of their life undiagnosed, unsupported and let down?\"",
      "She says she became very mentally unwell before being diagnosed with autism. \"I was on the maximum dose of antidepressants that any fully grown adult could be on at the age of 17,\" she says. \"I couldn't be left alone, I couldn't go out.\"",
      "Her autism diagnosis three years ago helped her to change the way she lives her life and to keep her mental health in a better place.",
      "But others worry that the version of autism people now see in the media and in their social media feeds is distorting public perceptions.",
      "A focus on celebrities can \"glamorise\" autism, says Venessa Swaby, who is also autistic and runs support groups for autistic children and their parents through her organisation A2ndvoice. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".",
      "As the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.",
      "Environmental causes",
      "There's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.",
      "The internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.",
      "Disproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger. Others say there must be something in what we eat, drink, or breathe that's causing more autism.",
      "But, as we've seen, the data suggest the rise in diagnoses can be explained by a broadening autism definition rather than an increase in the amount of underlying autism. And there's solid research showing that autism is largely a product of the genes you inherit from your parents.",
      "Is there any evidence that environmental causes could be playing some part in the rise, even if a small one?",
      "Ginny Russell looked at research into different potential environmental factors and found only a few that were plausible to explain some of the rise.",
      "\"There is definitely a quite well established link between autism and the age of the parent,\" she says. \"If the parent is older you're more likely to have an autistic child, but it's not a huge effect.\"",
      "She also says that there's some evidence around \"preterm birth and infection during pregnancy and also some birth complications\".",
      "But Ms Russell says it's important to put those possible factors into perspective.",
      "\"I honestly believe that the vast majority of the increase is due to what I would call a diagnostic culture,\" she says. \"Our conception of the condition has changed, and that's meant that there's been an increase.\"",

      "But Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman told reporters there \"will not be a change to the government's policy\".",
      "He insisted last year's move to restrict eligibility for the annual payments was required to \"ensure economic stability and repair the public finances\".",

      "Streeting acknowledged many voters \"aren't happy\" with the cuts.",
      "Labour Welsh First Minister Baroness Eluned Morgan called on the UK government to \"rethink\" the policy in a speech on Tuesday, adding it \"comes up time and again\" with voters.",

      "Last year, the government restricted the payments to those who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits, in a bid save \u00a31.4bn.",
      "The move, which did not feature in Labour's general election manifesto, means around 9 million pensioners will no longer qualify for the top-up.",
      "It has been seen as a key issue at last week's local elections, at which Labour lost 187 council seats and control of the only council it was defending.",
      "'Totemic' issue",

      "Former cabinet minister Louise Haigh, who resigned last year, has hit out at the winter fuel cuts, adding that they had become a \"totemic\" issue for many voters.",
      "Writing in the Sunday Times over the weekend, she argued that winter fuel and proposed benefits cuts were \"primary examples offered as to why the Labour government simply did not look like it understood their priorities\".",
      "The move has also been opposed by unions and the main opposition parties.",

      "\"I know that people aren't happy about the winter fuel allowance in lots of cases,\" he said.",
      "\"We did protect it for the poorest pensioners, but there are a lot of people saying they disagree with it regardless.\"",
      "However, he also defended the move as part of a wider package of changes, that would provide the \"means of raising the investment\" in public services.",
      "\"Unfortunately when you look across the board at the breadth and depth of the multiple crises that we've inherited, in order to deliver the change that people voted for we have had to do heavy lifting at the Budget,\" he added.",
      "But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper said the government's decision to rule out a change was a \"tone deaf response\" to last week's polls.",

      "The winter fuel payment was introduced in 1997 by New Labour as a universal payment for all pensioners.",
      "It was billed as a way to guarantee they would be able to pay for increased heating costs over the winter - although in practice it is a pension top-up, which recipients can spend on whatever they want.",
      "From 2010 onwards, the state pension gained additional protection under the \"triple lock\" policy - under which pensions go up each year by the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.",

      "The Supreme court ruled last month that sex is defined by biological sex under equality law.",
      "Sturgeon said the court's authority could not be questioned, but said the key issue was how the ruling was translated into practice.",

      "\"It certainly doesn't make a single woman any safer to do that because the threat to women, as I think we all know, comes from predatory and abusive men.\"",
      "She said it was not \"inevitable\" that the judgement makes the lives of trans people \"impossibly difficult\", but said there was a danger that could happen depending on the way the ruling was interpreted.",
      "The SNP MSP told reporters if that happened then changes to the law as it stands would need to be considered.",
      "The Scottish government has said it accepts the Supreme Court ruling and is awaiting full EHRC guidance, which is expected in the summer.",

      "Trump said in an announcement overnight that he would apply tariffs to foreign-made films to help America's movie industry, which he said was dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "In response, the UK government said trade negotiations with Washington were ongoing and it was taking a \"calm and steady approach\" to talks in a bid to \"ease pressure on UK businesses\".",
      "UK filmmakers warned freelancers in the industry risked being \"jobless\" if US productions were pulled, with one union saying the tariffs could be a \"knock-out blow\".",
      "The UK film sector is worth \u00a31.36 billion and employs more than 195,000 people, the government said in October.",
      "Much of the detail of the new tariff has yet to be confirmed.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said later on Monday: \"Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again.\"",
      "But there is worry that UK film companies, which often produce movies with US firms - including recent blockbusters like Barbie and Wicked - could be badly hit.",
      "\"If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,\" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of UK production company Goldfinch, said.",
      "Philippa Childs, head of media and entertainment trade union, Bectu, echoed those fears: \"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\"",
      "A parliamentary committee's report published last month noted the UK's film and high-end television industry is \"dominated\" by inward investment from US studios and that this \"brings significant economic and social benefits to the UK\".",

      "She urged ministers to \"urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way\".",

      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Tim Richards, CEO and founder of Vue Entertainment, said: \"The devil will be in the details and we need to parcel through exactly what [Trump] means.",
      "\"A big part of this is what constitutes US film, is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?",
      "\"Hollywood\u2026 has been in decline for some time,\" he said. \"A lot of films are being shot in other states and in other markets, principally Canada, the UK and Australia.\"",
      "He added: \"One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world.\"",
      "Bell concurred that \"the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places\" and lower costs.",
      "\"People aren't going to the cinema as much and decline in subscription services and rise of social media platforms and content creators... the industry is entirely changed.\"",
      "She added: \"The answer is not tariffs if [Trump is] trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood.\"",
      "According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Californian film commission offers a 20\u202f percent base credit to feature films and TV series - lower than most other US states and countries like the UK and has a $330m (\u00a3248m) cap on the programme, which can make countries like the UK more attractive.",

      "Asked if it was feasible that Reform UK leader Nigel Farage could be the next prime minister, she  said \"anything is feasible\", noting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had won re-election this week after trailing in the polls.",
      "But she added: \"My job is to make sure that he [Farage] does not become prime minister because he does not have the answers to the problems the country is facing.\"",
      "Badenoch was a cabinet minister in the previous Conservative government and took over as party leader last November, following its worst defeat ever in a general election.",

      "Reform UK was the big winner, taking control of 10 councils and gaining 677 councillors, as the party seemed able to tap into widespread dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and Labour.",
      "The Lib Dems were the other standout winners, gaining 163 seats and control of three councils. They seized Shropshire from the Tories and gained control of Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire after both previously had no party in overall control.",
      "The Green Party made some gains, winning 44 seats in total - however it suffered disappointment in the West of England mayoral race.",
      "The BBC is estimating that, if elections had taken place across the UK on Thursday, the Conservatives would have slumped to just 15% of the national vote, its worst-ever share of such a projection, behind the Liberal Democrats on 17%.",
      "Labour would have won 20% of the vote, according to the projection, equalling its lowest previous recorded performance in 2009.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Laura Kuenssberg Labour had \"got the message\" in these local elections and asked voters to \"give us a bit of time\" to change things.",

      "Opponents accuse Reform of simply being a protest party, something that would be denied by Jones. She told BBC Wales that another former UKIP Senedd politician, and one-time Tory MP and ex-Abolish the Assembly AM, Mark Reckless, was working with a team on policy for the Senedd.",
      "\"At the moment, there's so much frustration among the public - we are offering something different.\"",
      "Jones added: \"You have to have a party that's representative of the people, as opposed to just representing their own interests.\"",
      "UKIP's time in the Senedd was characterised by two changes in leadership, rows, and splits. At one point there were more UKIP AMs who had been leader than had not - including Jones herself.",
      "\"The Reform party is united,\" she said. \"There are hardly any arguments at all, and anything that people disagree on.\"",
      "Other parties may try to capitalise on Farage's relationship with the controversial US president Donald Trump to galvanise opposition to Reform.",
      "Jones said that was not a negative: \"If we've got special links with America, then I think it's to be capitalised on.\"",
      "Asked if she thought the party needed a Welsh figurehead, she said: \"That's above my pay grade.\"",
      "'This is what we're for'",
      "The Conservatives have a relatively new leader in the Senedd - Darren Millar, who took over late last year after a row over the leadership of Andrew RT Davies.",
      "Under Millar the party has tried to present itself as a serious alternative to Labour, with the Senedd leader keen to show he can be the next first minister and not simply an opposition force.",
      "But the Tories are still in the shadow of a disastrous general election, where the party went from having won 14 seats in the 2019 vote to zero. Recently it has been polling in fourth place. It came second in the Senedd election in 2021.",
      "Samuel Kurtz, chairman of the Tory group in the Senedd, said he was excited by the prospect of the election and the \"opportunities of a different political landscape come 8 May 2026\".",
      "The MS for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire said: \"We need to put forward a positive vision for what Wales could look like. We have had 25 years of the same party in charge, the same government, and a tried and tested method of pretty much trying the same thing.",
      "\"It's saying, look, this is what we're for. We're for a stronger economy, we're for the ability for families to have choice over certain things like education, we're for agriculture, we're for tourism.\"",
      "He added: \"What we've really done with Darren is really hunker down as to what is our USP as Welsh Conservatives, what are we for... rather than just saying we are against the 20mph speed limit for example, or we're against the tourism tax.\"",
      "Asked why he thought the Welsh Conservatives were struggling in polls, former Senedd Tory adviser Anthony Pickles said: \"Because the national party is still so involved in trying to work out its future strategy, its very difficult for the Welsh Conservatives to be diverging, and creating their own brand proposition\".",
      "Smaller parties are thought to be at a disadvantage in the new system - with experts suggesting parties need 13% to 15% to win seats.",
      "That is not to say they won't try - with the Greens among those who will be hoping to enter the Welsh Parliament for the first time.",
      "The Liberal Democrats, who won one regional seat at the last Senedd election and one at the last general election, are hoping to win more.",
      "Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds previously told the BBC: \"We'll have gold everywhere. Look at what we did in England [at the last general election].",
      "\"No-one thought we would win 72 seats. The results were coming in fast and furious that night and I reckon it is going to be like that next May as well.\"",
      "Who could work with who?",
      "It is early days, but the prospect of the electorate being split four ways or more raises questions about how the next government could be formed.",
      "Politicians can be reluctant to talk about the topic with 12 months to go, but for Labour, you would assume a deal with the Conservatives or Reform would be unthinkable. Ministers have instead worked with Plaid and the Lib Dems in the past.",
      "Plaid have ruled out working with Reform, but not Labour or the Tories.",
      "The Conservative's Kurtz declined to talk about who the party might work with, but said the likelihood of a coalition is \"nailed on - it'll have to be a coalition. No one party will reach the threshold of governing on their own\".",
      "Plaid's Gruffydd said a rotating first ministership - similar to how the coalition running the Irish government has operated with rotating prime ministers - \"could be on the agenda\".",
      "\"It depends on the arithmetic,\" he said, suggesting it could be discussed if there are \"two parties thoroughly at the same kind of level\".",
      "But Ms Owens said if Labour held at 27% as in some recent polls, you are \"more likely to have a Labour first minister\", with the party a few seats or more ahead of Plaid.",
      "Prof Wyn Jones also argued the upheaval in geopolitics could play a role.",
      "It could not be predicted, he argued, whether something happening worldwide could make people feel more positive about Labour.",
      "The expert added: \"This is such a hugely uncertain time that everything that we are saying needs to be caveated.\""

    "story": [
      "\"It's all depressing to be honest\". Those are the words of one Labour MP, hitherto proudly supportive of the government, as they returned to Parliament on Tuesday morning.",
      "The anger among Labour MPs in the aftermath of the party's local elections drubbing was striking in its breadth and depth. The evidence so far is that it did not dissipate over the long weekend.",
      "The focus of many MPs' rage - and it is rage - is the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance.",
      "It is not just the view of critical MPs that this harmed Labour in the elections, but of cabinet ministers too.",
      "Earlier Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Breakfast: \"I'm not going to insult your viewers by pretending that winter fuel didn't come up on the doorstep, of course it did, and I know that people aren't happy about winter fuel allowance in lots of cases.\"",
      "Government sources spent Tuesday morning scotching the suggestion that a formal review of the policy is under way, and by the afternoon they were adamant.",
      "\"There will not be a change to the government's policy,\" the prime minister's official spokesman said.",

      "Henry Zeffman: Seven things we have learnt from the election results",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "That will be a disappointment to those Labour MPs who believed that reversing the policy on winter fuel would be the clearest sign to the public that the prime minister, as he said on Friday morning, \"gets it\".",
      "Others closer to government thinking questioned whether there would be any political benefit to changing course at this stage, believing the damage has been done.",
      "Given the categorical denial of any wiggle room on winter fuel, more topical perhaps is the debate over the government's welfare reforms.",
      "The changes in eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) were announced in March but require parliamentary approval. A vote in the House of Commons is likely next month.",
      "Given Sir Keir's colossal majority there is no prospect of the government losing that vote. But there is the possibility that it becomes the locus of broader disaffection with the government's direction.",
      "One Labour MP who identified winter fuel and Pip as the two key reasons for Labour's poor showing last week said the latter was a more acute problem.",
      "\"When people were complaining about winter fuel on the doorstep you'd look at the [canvassing] sheet and often it's people who have never voted for us or haven't voted for us for a long time. With Pip, they were our people.\"",
      "Even those Labour MPs who are more frustrated than angry at the decline in the party's support over the past ten months believe that Sir Keir and his team need to do more to carry their parliamentary ranks with them.",
      "\"There's still a lot of goodwill,\" one said. \"But if we don't have a sense of what the strategic direction is soon then the PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party] will become unmanageable.\"",
      "Pat McFadden, one of the most senior cabinet ministers but also the director of Labour's successful 2024 general election campaign, will deliver a presentation to MPs about the local election results on Wednesday evening.",
      "Questions about the party's strategic direction will be paramount. Though the principal beneficiary of Thursday's local elections at Labour's expense was Reform UK, there are plenty in Labour who worry just as much about bleeding votes on their left flank to more progressive parties such as the Greens.",
      "Many are noting that in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election the Conservative vote more than halved, at least partly due to defections to Labour to stop Reform. Meanwhile, the Green vote actually nudged upwards.",
      "\"We couldn't squeeze the progressive vote - and we'll need to do that at the general election,\" one government source said.",
      "Cooler heads believe that in the scenario of a general election where the most plausible prime ministers were Sir Keir or Nigel Farage, voters on the broad left would inevitably coalesce around Labour.",
      "And whereas the next general election is as much as four years away, events over the next few weeks could help.",
      "A UK-EU summit on May 19 is seen as an opportunity to put significant meat on the bones of the European \"reset\" for which the prime minister has spent much of the past year pushing.",
      "Party strategists believe that a clear demonstration from the prime minister that he believes the UK should be more closely allied to Europe will boost progressive support.",
      "It could also solve other problems. If the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) were to upgrade its forecasts for economic growth as a result of closer ties to the EU, then that would give Rachel Reeves more money to spend in this autumn's Budget.",
      "Before the EU summit, however, comes next week's immigration white paper - which will contain more detail of the government's plans to reduce legal migration and improve the asylum system.",
      "This is seen in government both as a crucial way to demonstrate to sceptical voters that Labour is serious about dealing with their concerns about immigration, as well as a potentially tricky moment for the progressive segment of Labour's coalition.",
      "\"We can't be sheepish about this, we need to make an argument to our own people that there's nothing progressive about letting people smugglers run the English Channel or letting cheap foreign labour undercut good wages,\" one government source said.",
      "And once the rage subsides, many in the Labour Party remember that things could be worse.",
      "Unlike the Conservatives, confronting arguably a much deeper malaise, Labour are in government at control of the levers of power.",
      "\"Things are going to materially improve over the coming years,\" a senior government source said. \"There is no way through this that doesn't involve making people feel better off.\"",

    "story": [
      "There is no doubt that Reform performed well in Thursday's local council elections. The party won most votes, most seats and overall control of most councils.",
      "True, the party's share of the votes cast across all 23 councils where elections took place on Thursday was no more than 31%. So despite doing well, it secured far from a majority of those voting.",
      "However, its performance was enough to put Reform well ahead of the Conservatives \u2013 who traditionally dominate county councils - on 23%, the Liberal Democrats on 17% and Labour on 14% when you tally up the votes in those parts of England that went to the polls on Thursday.",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "At the 2024 general election Reform secured 14% of the vote but just 5 out of 650 seats at Westminster. But crucially, being ahead of everyone else in 2025 ensured the first-past-the-post election system helped Reform.",
      "Its tally of 677 council seats represented 41% of all those being contested on Thursday, 10 points above its share of the vote, a nod to both the nature of the voting system and Reform's ability to cluster votes. That boost helped the party win control of as many as 10 councils, something that Reform's predecessor, UKIP, never managed at the height of its popularity in the run up to the 2015 general election.",
      "In Staffordshire, Reform won 72% of the seats on 41% of the vote. In Kent, 37% of the vote delivered it 70% of the seats, while in Derbyshire the same share was rewarded with 66% of all the councillors.",
      "Instead of insulating Conservative and Labour from the impact of a third-party challenge, as it has done so often before, first past the post exacerbated their losses. In both cases Reform took nearly half of all the seats those parties were defending.",
      "The map above is the most detailed local election mapping ever produced by the BBC. It details the strength of the Reform vote in every ward that voted on Thursday and shows support for Reform varied considerably.",
      "That variation has some striking and important features. They suggest the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019 - and that Reform's success cannot simply be dismissed as a short-lived protest vote.",
      "Brexit still a fault line",
      "Reflecting the party's anti-EU stance, Reform did much better in wards that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum than it did in wards that backed Remain.",
      "In wards where more than 65% voted Leave in 2016, Reform won on average as much as 45% of the vote. In contrast, in places where a majority backed Remain, only 19% voted for Reform.",
      "Although talked about much less by politicians nowadays, Brexit is still an important fault line in our politics. Reform's appeal is significantly concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right.",
      "Even so, the fact that even in pro-Remain wards the party was able to win as much as a fifth of the vote was testimony to the scale of the swing that it enjoyed on Thursday.",
      "The Brexit division is also evident in the demographic character of the places where Reform did best and those where it did less well.",
      "University graduates and those in professional and managerial jobs were least likely to vote for Brexit in 2016. Reform found it more difficult to do well in places where they are most numerous.",
      "Reform won 39% of the vote in heavily working-class wards but only 19% in the most middle-class ones.",
      "The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining. Next highest was Romney Marsh in Kent and Chadsmoor in Staffordshire.",
      "Meanwhile, support for the party averaged 43% in wards where more than half of adults have few, if any, educational qualifications. In contrast, it polled just 19% where more than two in five have a degree.",
      "Reform's lowest share of the vote, 3.7%, was in the Parks ward in Oxford, situated in the heart of the famous university city.",
      "Immigration is also a key issue for Reform. However, this perhaps makes the party less appealing to those from a minority background.",
      "Certainly, on average the party only polled 22% in wards where more than one in five identify as other than 'white', compared with a tally of 33% in places where more than 95% told the 2021 Census that they were 'white'.",
      "In summary, Reform did best in what has sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' Britain \u2013 places that have profited less from globalisation and university expansion and where a more conservative outlook on immigration is more common.",
      "A problem for the two main parties",
      "Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are likely to recover from the drubbing they received on Thursday unless they can appeal more to this slice of Britain.",
      "Although polls indicate that Reform finds it easier to win over former Conservative voters than their Labour counterparts, Reform's average share of the vote was strikingly just as high in wards that Labour were defending as it was in places that the Conservatives were trying to retain.",
      "The party on average won 32% of the vote in previously Labour wards and 32% in Conservative ones.",
      "As a result, Labour lost seats to Reform at much the same rate as the Conservatives, a pattern that cost Labour control of the one council they were defending, Doncaster.",
      "In contrast, Reform's advance was more muted in wards that the Liberal Democrats and the Greens were defending.  The party's average share in these wards was just 22%. As a result, Reform had relatively little success in taking seats from these two parties.",
      "Liberal Democrat and Green wards \u2013 unlike many Conservative and Labour ones - are heavily populated by university graduates.",
      "Reform's success on Thursday undoubtedly reflects the mood of an electorate that still has little faith in the Conservatives and which now is disappointed by Labour's performance in office.",
      "However, it is evidently proving most popular in a very distinctive part of Britain that overturned the political tables a decade ago in voting for Brexit - and which now has done so again.",

      "Regional mayors are now commonplace in England: Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, Ben Houchen in the Tees Valley and Tracy Brabin in West Yorkshire are all well-known spokespeople for their areas.",
      "But the most prominent directly-elected mayor in Britain was also the first: London.",
      "As is fitting for a city as exciting as London, the first election for that coveted position included allegations of betrayal, stitch ups and intrigue \u2013 and one candidate ended up in prison.",
      "Twenty five years ago Tony Blair's government, elected in 1997 and known as New Labour, was very keen on a new form of devolution.",
      "They wanted mayors like those in America, big personalities elected with powers and budgets (but not too many powers, or too big a budget).",
      "In the end, only one was created by Blair's government.",
      "The 1998 Greater London Authority referendum, held in May that year, asked whether there was support for creating a Greater London Authority with a directly elected mayor and Assembly.",
      "The voters were less keen than New Labour - just 34% turned out to vote, but the majority was clear nonetheless: 72% in favour.",
      "The 'Yes' vote won in every London borough, with support lowest in Bromley with 57% and highest in Haringey with 84%.",
      "Now London was to have a mayor, who would it be?",
      "The obvious candidate was Ken Livingstone, the former left-wing firebrand (and publicity-friendly) leader of the Greater London Council (GLC), who went toe-to-toe with the Thatcher government - and lost.",
      "The GLC was abolished in 1986, leaving London in the unenviable position of having 32 boroughs (and the City of London) but no overall strategic elected body for the largest city in Europe.",
      "However, Livingstone's ability to alienate prime ministers wasn't confined to Conservatives.",
      "Tony Blair was also not a Ken fan.",
      "\"Red\" Ken, as he was known, was Old Labour, not New Labour.",
      "The message from Downing St was clear: Stop Ken.",
      "The party management tried to get the very popular Mo Mowlam to stand, then switched to Frank Dobson.",
      "A bearded, avuncular figure who was serving as New Labour's first health secretary, he was 'persuaded' to stand against his old comrade Ken.",
      "Dobson had initially, and somewhat bravely, declared his desire to remain at health, but then had to give up his cabinet seat to run for a job he didn't want.",
      "The internal workings of Labour can be difficult for outsiders - and many insiders - to navigate.",
      "In this case, an electoral college was mandated which led to the popular Livingstone not winning selection.",
      "The vote was a third each for party members, trade unions and London MPs and other elected representatives.",
      "In the final ballot Livingstone won 60% of party members and 72% of affiliated unions, but Dobson won 86% of MPs, MEPs and Greater London Assembly candidates.",
      "Dobson therefore won a narrow overall victory, and the Blairites were accused of rigging the whole thing to keep Old Labour Ken from the nomination.",
      "Livingstone for his part had promised not to run as an independent, then decided that that was what he was going to do after all.",
      "The Tories also had a colourful time choosing their candidate.",
      "In September 1999 the novelist Jeffrey Archer was selected by party members, beating Steve Norris.",
      "But in a plot twist reminiscent of one of his books, Archer withdrew from the race a few months later after it was alleged he had committed perjury in a famous libel case.",
      "Lord Archer had secured the Conservative nomination with backing from former prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, who in 1992 had made him a peer.",
      "Five years earlier, in 1987, Archer had won a libel case against The Daily Star which published a story that he had paid off a sex worker called Monica Coghlan.",
      "After his selection as a mayoral candidate, a former friend of Archer's told the News of the World that he had lied in the libel trial and asked him to provide a false alibi.",
      "Archer stood down from the race, and starred in a production of his courtroom play, The Accused, in London's West End while waiting for his trial to start.",
      "In July 2001 he was found guilty and spent two years in jail, but retained his peerage and membership of the House of Lords as there was no mechanism to remove them at the time.",
      "Norris was selected as the Conservative Party candidate to replace Archer.",
      "A very different type of Tory, Norris advocated for gay rights and had a relaxed approach to monogamy.",
      "He was also a former transport minister who was obsessed with buses.",
      "In that role, he had a hand in approving the Jubilee line extension from Green Park to Stratford, and the privatisation of London's bus services.",
      "In the rough and tumble world of turn of the century politics, he was given the nickname \"Shagger\".",
      "A brief snippet from a Guardian profile piece published during that first mayoral campaign gives a flavour of Norris' complex appeal.",
      "\"The day his original candidature was announced was marked by a letter to the Times from his father-in-law, a retired rear-admiral, expressing astonishment at Norris's public plans to marry the fourth of his famous five mistresses \u2026 since as far as the rear-admiral knew, Norris was still married to his daughter.\"",
      "Norris was a self-made man, a millionaire car salesman who grew up in working class Liverpool, attending the same school as Paul McCartney.",
      "Not many 2025 Tories can boast that sort of hinterland.",
      "There may have been some intrigue in the Lib Dem selection process, but it is lost to history if there was.",
      "Their candidate was the estimable Susan Kramer, who was subjected to condescension and mansplaining throughout the campaign - this was a time when female Labour MPs were referred to as \"Blair's Babes\" by tabloid and broadsheet newspapers alike.",
      "Livingstone was to mount the first - and so far only - successful independent bid for Mayor of London.",
      "Dobson ran a campaign that never really captured the imagination of London's voters, and his old comrade won the historic poll despite a late surge in support for the Tory candidate.",
      "The May 2000 election was a disaster for New Labour: Dobson got just 13% of the vote and was eliminated in the first round along with Susan Kramer, who polled a respectable 11.9% for the Lib Dems.",
      "Livingstone led by 39% to 27% of first preference votes and polled a total of 776,427 votes to 564,137 for Norris, after second preferences were calculated.",
      "It was a bloody nose and a notable defeat for the previously unassailable Tony Blair.",
      "The BBC News website has an archive of reports from this election, a time capsule of the way politics used to be.",
      "It reported that Dobson's \"humiliation in the mayoral poll was underlined as he came fourth in the mayoral contest in Barnet and Camden - the seat which includes his parliamentary constituency\".",
      "The 2000 election reports reveal Livingstone said he would \"fight for the interests of Londoners as mayor, demanding more money from the government and telling ministers they were wrong over plans to partially privatise the London Underground\".",
      "London Underground, now part of Transport for London, remains in public hands under the control of the Mayor of London.",
      "It also reported that Blair \"made it clear Mr Livingstone would not be allowed to return to Labour after standing against an official party candidate\".",
      "Blair was wrong about that: in 2004 Livingstone was the Labour candidate, and he won, again defeating Norris.",
      "Livingstone was his party's standard bearer again in both 2008 and 2012, on both occasions losing to a young Conservative contender called Boris Johnson.",

      "The patchwork of different election results across England has been truly fascinating, throwing up all sorts of lessons.",
      "Here are seven things we have learnt from the contests:",
      "These are really bad results for the Labour Party",
      "Sometimes in politics what is most obvious is most important. These are a bad set of results for the Labour Party at their first electoral test since being swept to office ten months ago in a landslide of epic proportions.",
      "\"We did it!\" the prime minister told his jubilant supporters back then as seat after seat fell to Labour, adding: \"It feels good, I have to be honest.\"",
      "That's not so much the vibe these days.",
      "Leaving the eight-hour count after the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, Labour campaigners were utterly dejected, not least at having lost by only six votes, the closest result in any by-election ever.",
      "Yet even if they had won by six votes, the trend would have been the same -  a governing party which has burnt through goodwill at an unimaginable pace.",
      "It's possible to overstate how dramatic the contrast with the 2024 general election is, though.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer's victory was broad but shallow, his 411 seats procured on just over a third of the vote. Perhaps it's not surprising that the so-called loveless landslide has been followed by a rude awakening.",
      "Labour's debate on what to do next is just beginning",
      "\"On every door it was the same story - winter fuel and Pip.\"",
      "That's what a Labour campaigner in Runcorn told me, referring to the early decision this government made to means-test the winter fuel allowance and the more recent announcement that eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment will be tightened.",
      "Speaking to Labour MPs from different wings of the party over the course of the day, it's been surprising how many have pretty much stuck to that same theme. For almost all of them, the original sin of this government was the decision on winter fuel.",
      "There are nuances within that position. Some believe the cut could have been communicated better, making the case that some pensioners were receiving the benefit who simply didn't need it. Others think it was never worth the political risk for the amount of money it would raise.",
      "To stress, it is not just the left of the Labour Party, comprised of a handful of MPs willing to criticise Starmer publicly, who are saying this. I had a conversation with an MP on the right of the party who believes the situation is so dire, the damage so fundamental, that Rachel Reeves should simply reverse the cut.",
      "That is extremely unlikely. But it is where the debate may be headed when MPs return to the Commons and compare notes next week.",
      "And of course a crucial part of that debate is the parlous economic situation inherited by the government which, those around the prime minister insist, necessitated unpleasant decisions which were always bound to be unpopular. If it had not been winter fuel, it would have been something else \u2013 the argument goes.",
      "The consolation of sorts for Labour is that fixing their political predicament is in their hands. They are the government and the levers of power are at their command. The next general election is up to four years away. All in Labour agree that people need to be made to feel better off - and they hope that if that can be achieved, the political challenges melt away.",
      "For the Conservatives, things are somehow getting worse",
      "Turns out the only way wasn't up. The Conservatives were reduced to their fewest MPs ever last July. That annihilation is now being visited on their local politicians.",
      "Kemi Badenoch took charge of a crushed Conservative Party and has only had six months to begin trying to turn things round. Still, I am yet to meet a Conservative who will sincerely argue that she has made a good start.",
      "I have, though, lost count of Conservative MPs and advisers who say to me that, in a funny way, they need Labour to be doing better. The Conservatives are still tarnished in many voters' eyes by their governing record, meaning that the receptacle for voters' immediate frustration with Labour, in Runcorn and elsewhere, is Reform UK.",
      "But it's more than just a story about the government's woes, as longstanding Conservative strongholds such as Staffordshire and Lincolnshire falling to Reform show. Some of the results simply need to be stated to see how startling they are.",
      "Conservatives had run Staffordshire County Council since 2009. They had 56 of the 62 councillors on Thursday morning. Now they have only 10.",
      "The Lib Dems have taken dozens of seats from the Tories. They have pushed the party into third place in this set of elections. Leader Sir Ed Davey is claiming to have seized the title of the party of \"Middle England\".",
      "There does not seem to be any appetite at all in the Conservative Party to even begin a conversation about changing leader yet again. Robert Jenrick throwing his support behind the woman who beat him to the leadership was a significant moment.",
      "Whoever is leader, a Conservative Party performing at this level is a Conservative Party in an existential crisis.",
      "'Not Labour enough': MPs' despair at voters' verdict on government",
      "Sir John Curtice: Reform challenging traditional party dominance",
      "For Reform, with victory comes responsibility",
      "It's hard to come up with the right superlatives for Nigel Farage's political achievement. Suffice to say the Reform surge evident in opinion polling has turned out to be real.",
      "Yes, under Farage's leadership Ukip won the European elections in 2014 and the Brexit Party did the same in 2019.",
      "Their success in five constituencies at the general election - including Farage himself finally making it into parliament at the eighth attempt - suggested Reform UK was something different to his previous incarnations. That is surely now proven beyond all reasonable doubt.",
      "Reform has now won control of ten councils, and with victory comes responsibility.",
      "When Ukip ran up victories in the European elections, its mandate was to scrutinise the Brussels institutions its voters loathed.",
      "Now its mandate is to make its own voters' lives better. That is a different task. The traditional main parties will be hoping that following responsibility comes accountability, and that if Reform councils and mayors fail, the party's brand will suffer.",
      "It's not just Reform benefitting from the main parties' unpopularity",
      "The Liberal Democrats have made solid gains across what was once traditional Tory territory, which is essentially local politics catching up with what happened at the general election last July.",
      "In Devon they gained 18 council seats, mostly at the Conservatives' expense, to become the largest party, and have won control of Oxfordshire, Shropshire and Cambridgeshire.",
      "They are ecstatic to have leapfrogged the Conservatives into third place in the BBC's Projected National Share.",
      "The Greens are making gains too, although their failure to win or even come second in the West of England mayoral contest will sting. The battle between the Greens and Labour for younger, urban progressives is likely to come to the fore in future local elections.",
      "Whoever is the change candidate wins",
      "Labour's general election slogan was just one word: change. No wonder that it appeared at the start of new MP Sarah Pochin's victory speech in Runcorn too.",
      "If there's one thing every politician and strategist from every party seems to agree on, it is that people are crying out for things to be better. In other words, for change.",
      "It was the mantle Keir Starmer managed to seize in opposition. His challenge is to reclaim it while being in government.",
      "The task facing each opposition party in their different ways is to stop him doing so and convince voters that they have the best shot of improving their lives.",

      "Who won the local election in my area?",
      "Sir John Curtice: Reform challenging traditional party dominance",
      "The era of fragmentation is here...at least for now",
      "The two-party double act which has governed Britain for a century appears to be under massive strain. It may be time to get used to elections in this country - parliamentary, mayoral, council - being won on low shares of the vote by very fine margins. Under our First Past The Post system (where the winner is simply the person with the most votes), if you have lots of parties with relatively even support, things can get really unpredictable.",
      "Yet if there's another lesson of British politics in recent years it's that politics is volatile. The death of the two-party system has been pronounced before. At the 2010 general election, Labour and the Conservatives only got 65% of the vote combined. By 2017 that figure was back up to 82%. In 2024 it was back to 57%. Things can change fast in politics - they have done, again and again.",
      "As politics begins to move at social media speed, who's to say Reform cannot fall away as fast as they rose?",
      "It's a counter-argument worth bearing in mind. On the other hand, it is no longer preposterous to say that Nigel Farage could be the next prime minister.",
      "The range of possible political futures which could unfold in the UK over the next few years is simply vast. Anyone who tells you what is going to happen next needs a whopping great dose of humility.",

      "\"I think you all better really be seeking alternative careers,\" he warned council staff who were \"working on climate change initiatives, or Diversity, Equality and Inclusion\" or opting to work from home.",

      "Asylum seeker accommodation",
      "Reform has railed against high levels of immigration and the numbers coming to the UK in small boats across the channel.",
      "In its general election manifesto it said it would implement a freeze on non-essential immigration. Those with certain skills - for example in healthcare - would still be allowed to come to the UK.",
      "Local councils don't have control over nationwide immigration policy, but Farage has said his party will \"resist central government plonking hundreds of these young men in these counties that we now run\".",
      "Grimes said Reform would not \"allow our communities to be a dumping ground for illegal migrants\".",
      "In her victory speech, Reform's new mayor for Greater Lincolnshire Dame Andrea Jenkyns said: \"I say 'no' to putting people in hotels. Tents are good enough for France; they should be good enough for you in Britain.\"",
      "The Home Office is responsible for housing adult asylum seekers and while councils can object, they have little power to stop people being housed in their areas.",
      "A rise in the numbers of people seeking asylum has led to hotels being increasingly used for accommodation.",
      "In its manifesto the Labour government promised to stop using hotels for this purpose, which in 2023/24 cost \u00a33.1bn; however early this year a minister confirmed the number of hotels had risen since the election.",

      "Many of the party's newly elected councillors have little political experience, however Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice says that will be \"an advantage\".",

      "Though some of the results are still to be reported, Reform are clearly the winners of Thursday's local elections.",
      "Across the 23 councils where a ballot was held, the party won more votes and more seats than any of its opponents by a clear margin. The party is probably heading for around 700 seat gains and won two mayoral contests.",
      "Meanwhile, it has won overall control of no less than seven councils, including the once Labour fiefdom of Durham and the two largest counties,  Kent and Lancashire.",
      "The party performed best in wards which voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 referendum. Yet even in places which voted to remain in the EU, the party was still routinely able to win as much as a fifth of the vote.",

That easily beats the 23% that Ukip scored at the height of their popularity in 2013. It is the first time that a party other than Conservative or Labour has been placed first.",
      "Meanwhile, Reform also won the Runcorn by-election, albeit by the narrowest of margins. Never before has a pro-Brexit party candidate won a by-election, other than two local Tory MPs who defected to Ukip in 2014.",
      "For both the Conservatives and Labour the result was worse than their spokespersons feared. The Conservatives lost two in three of the seats they were defending and at best are likely to be left with control of just one council, Buckinghamshire.",
      "In a clear indication of the Conservatives' vulnerability to the challenge from Nigel Farage's party, its vote fell most heavily in places where the Reform advance was strongest. Their score in the BBC projection is by far a record low.",
      "Labour also lost two in three of the seats they were defending, though it had the consolation of winning three mayoral elections, albeit only by a narrow margin. Their projected share is the lowest since 2008, when the party suffered from the financial crash and the MPs' expenses scandal.",
      "In contrast, the Liberal Democrats were able to withstand the Reform tide, recording over 100 net gains. The party was particularly successful in councils that it had targeted, most notably Devon and Shropshire. Overall, however, the party's performance in votes was largely in line with that of other recent local elections. Much the same was true of the Greens, who made a modest gain of 38 seats.",

      "Once May had stood aside, Jenkyns found favour with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who appointed her as an assistant government whip in 2021 and a junior education minister a year later.",
      "A loyal ally, Jenkyns consistently defended Johnson, including during her appearance on the BBC's Have I Got News For You programme, when she described him as \"one of our better prime ministers\".",
      "When Johnson resigned in 2022, Jenkyns lost her composure outside Downing Street.",
      "She was filmed giving the middle finger to protesters shortly before Johnson's resignation.",
      "A backlash followed and in her defence, Jenkyns said she was \"only human\" and had received \"huge amounts of abuse from some of the people who were there over the years\".",
      "\"I responded and stood up for myself,\" she said.",
      "She was made a dame in Johnson's resignation honours in 2023.",
      "Jenkyns retained her ministerial role under Liz Truss but was later dismissed by the following prime minister, Rishi Sunak.",
      "She then failed to win re-election to the successor seat of Leeds South West and Morley at the 2024 general election.",
      "Bouncing back with Reform",
      "Back in the political wilderness, Jenkyns began flirting with Reform UK last year.",

      "Kosmos 482 was launched in 1972 as part of a mission to Venus but it never escaped low Earth orbit and separated into four pieces, according to Nasa.",
      "One of those pieces, believed to be the lander probe, is expected to re-enter our atmosphere around 10 May and at least part of it could survive the journey without burning up, according to Nasa.",
      "There is much we don't know about the re-entry, including where it might land, but even if any of it does survive, 70% of the planet is covered by sea so it is unlikely to cause significant damage.",
      "\"It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris.\" said Mr Stijn Lemmens, Senior Space Debris Mitigation Analyst at the European Space Agency.",
      "The lander capsule is a tough, spherical object about a metre wide and weighs nearly half a tonne.",
      "It was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it has a robust heat shield and durable structure.",
      "This is why experts think it may survive an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely long since degraded after more than 50 years in space.",
      "The risk to people on the ground is considered low, but the capsule's projected flight path could see it land anywhere between 51.7\u00b0 north and south latitude, covering most of the inhabited world.",
      "This means it could potentially land anywhere from as far north as London to as far south as the southern tip of South America.",
      "Uncontrolled space debris incidents have occurred before.",
      "Mr Lemmens explained that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently,\" happening weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones. Objects typically burn up in the earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground.",

      "Kosmos 482 is now being closely tracked by international space agencies.",
      "Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft \"should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entries\".",
      "This allows for precise predictions of landing locations, reducing the risk of any debris impacting populated areas, thereby protecting people and property while \"managing the environmental impact of space debris.\""

      "A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild.",
      "Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction.",
      "But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo.",
      "It has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge.",
      "This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany.",
      "Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home.",
      "\"I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,\" he said. \" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.\"",
      "Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.",
      "Though not officially classed as a \"big cat\" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food.",
      "Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction.",

      "\"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says.",
      "To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind.",
      "But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males.",
      "So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available.",
      "\"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo.",
      "Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem.",

      "There are puncture marks on its throat \u2013 a sure sign.",
      "\"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.",
      "The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction.",
      "\"Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals.\" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure.",
      "\"We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements.\"",

      "Sandeels comprise a number of species of small fish and are caught commercially for use in animal feed and in oil production.",

      "In a significant blow to the government's clean energy ambitions the Danish energy company Orsted has cancelled plans for a huge windfarm off the coast of East Yorkshire.",
      "The Hornsea 4 project would have become one of the biggest offshore wind farms in the world with a potential capacity of 2.4GW \u2013 enough to power more than a million homes.",
      "Orsted said the project no longer made economic sense, despite signing a 15-year contract with the UK government guaranteeing to sell power at an agreed price.",
      "The UK's offshore wind sector has faced soaring costs in recent years, as the government has acknowledged.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it recognised \"the effect that globally high inflation and supply chain constraints are having on industry across Europe.\"",
      "But this is the second developer to pull out of a major offshore project.",
      "The Swedish company Vattenfall halted development of a 1.4GW wind farm off the coast of Norfolk in July 2023, again due to rising costs.",
      "Thay project was sold to the German energy company RWE, which has said it plans to see the project through.",

    "summary": "Sir David says his new film Ocean is one of the most important of his career.",
    "story": [
      "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.",
      "He believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.",
      "Sir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"",
      "The ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.",
      "The blue carpet was rolled out for the premiere the Royal Festival Hall in London.",
      "In attendance was the King, told Sir David he \"can't believe\" his 99th birthday was on Thursday.",
      "The pair posed for photos before they entered the auditorium for the screening.",
      "A host of celebrities also attended, including singer Geri Halliwell-Horner, astronaut Tim Peake, singer James Blunt and model Cara Delevingne.",
      "Earlier, Prince William attended a matinee in a \"private capacity\", along with hundreds of children from schools across the country.",
      "Toby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.",
      "The film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.",
      "Sir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"",
      "Since then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.",
      "Ocean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.",
      "The new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. They are often seeking a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.",
      "\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.",
      "The process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.",
      "Sir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".",
      "Sir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.",
      "It is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.",
      "Just one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"",
      "But in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.",
      "One of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"",
      "Despite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"",
      "Sir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.",
      "He believes that could be transformational.",
      "\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"",
      "A healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.",
      "\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.",

      "When the UK became the first major economy in the world to commit to reducing its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, there was so little disagreement among MPs it was simply 'nodded through' without a vote.",
      "Six years on, the political climate is very different, the consensus at Westminster has shattered and reaching net zero is fast becoming a political dividing line.",
      "Labour has committed itself to an extra deadline: reaching clean power by 2030.",
      "The Greens and Liberal Democrats want to hit net zero faster, the Conservatives are slamming the brakes on their policy and, for the first time, there is now a mainstream party, Reform UK, openly questioning the need to reach net zero at all.",
      "Even a former Labour prime minister, Sir Tony Blair, has said that existing global approaches to tackling climate change aren't working (although it was later clarified that his institute supports the government's targets).",

      "Blair says current net zero policies 'doomed to fail'",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "In 2019, when the target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 was set, public concern about climate change was very visible.",
      "Thousands of people had joined Extinction Rebellion marches and the then-teenage activist Greta Thunberg was so influential she was invited to address MPs in Parliament.",
      "Luke Tryl, pollster for More in Common, says he has not found a significant drop in concern about climate change or support for net zero, even if we're not seeing people on the streets.",
      "What has changed, he says, is the conversation around it which, after the rising cost of living and the war in Ukraine, has switched to \"how does this reflect on people's pockets and does it make people think the country is safer as a result?\"",
      "He also says the debate has become \"more polarised between left and right\" with Labour and Lib Dem voters seeing it as a \"top three\" issue, while Reform voters are more opposed to net zero but less motivated by it: only one in 10 people vote Nigel Farage's party because of net zero, Tryl's research suggests.",
      "He also says that politicians are more divided than everyone else.",
      "\"The fracturing of the consensus has been far more profound at what we'd call 'elite level' rather than at public level,\" he says.",
      "Undoubtedly, part of the rise in the conversation about climate targets has been driven by the rise of Reform, which has made what it calls \"net stupid zero\" one of its major campaign issues.",
      "Deputy leader Richard Tice says his party - which has just won a by-election and made major gains in local elections - has forced the issue onto the political agenda.",
      "\"On the doors, people are talking about immigration but the next thing they talk about is the price of everything, the bills, the cost of living. When you drill into it, the message is getting across that the increase in the cost of living is significantly due to the increase in energy costs.",

      "He says people do need to feel they are included in climate measures and believes there is a \"sensible climate majority\" within Parliament, whose job it is to make the right policies to bring people along with them.",
      "\"Of course it has to be done in a way that brings people with us and there is a risk that there's too much onus put on individuals so when it comes to things like public transport, for instance....the greener option needs to be the cheaper option.\"",
      "There are also those that think the UK is starting to import the more partisan politics on the issue from the US.",

      "Her party's policy is currently to reach net zero by 2045 although she says they are looking at it to make sure it is still \"do-able\" after the previous Conservative administration shifted the government's timeline.",
      "The most marked political shift has come from the Conservatives, who have moved from setting the 2050 target, enthusiastically embracing green goals set by Boris Johnson, to a slowing of some targets under Rishi Sunak and, finally, abandoning 2050 under Kemi Badenoch.",
      "She has described the 2050 plans as \"impossible\" and said that what Keir Starmer needed to do was to \"scrap what [Energy Secretary] Ed Miliband is planning which is actually going to bankrupt the country\".",

      "While much of the Labour Party does seem to be on board with the leadership's position, there are some in the broader Labour movement who have issued warning shots that suggest their support for net zero is conditional.",
      "Some trade unions have become increasingly vocal about the need to ensure that there is a plan to protect jobs in any transition to green energy.",
      "As the union Unite put it: \"If they fail to do this, then Labour cannot expect workers to support their net zero plan.\"",
      "While the net zero by 2050 target is currently set in law, Labour's \"clean power by 2030\" push is self-imposed, leading to regular rumours that it could be watered down.",
      "Government sources are adamant the party is committed to it, and they point to investments that have already been made.",
      "Other Labour sources, who back the targets, say they believe the prime minister is invested in it and that it is intrinsically linked to the government's growth agenda.",
      "They also warn that any watering down of targets would shake confidence in foreign investment.",
      "Former Labour advisor John McTernan believes that keeping the clean power commitment is also key to the government's political survival beyond the next election.",

    "story": [
      "In a dramatic overnight operation, India said it launched missile and air strikes on  nine sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, targeting what it called militant positions based on \"credible intelligence\".",
      "The strikes, lasting just 25 minutes between 01:05 and 01:30 India time (19:35 and 20:00 GMT on Tuesday), sent shockwaves through the region, with residents jolted awake by thunderous explosions.",
      "Pakistan said only six locations were hit and claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and a drone - a claim India has not confirmed.",
      "Islamabad said 26 people were killed and 46 injured in Indian air strikes and shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, India's army reported that 10 civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.",

      "What we know about the air strikes",
      "This sharp escalation comes after last month's deadly militant attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, pushing tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals to dangerous new heights. India says it has clear evidence linking Pakistan-based terrorists and external actors to the attack - a claim Pakistan flatly denies. Islamabad has also pointed out that India has not offered any evidence to support its claim.",
      "Does this attack mark a new escalation?",
      "In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the LoC.",
      "In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.",
      "Experts say the retaliation for the Pahalgam attack stands out for its broader scope, targeting the infrastructure of three major Pakistan-based militant groups simultaneously.",
      "India says it struck nine militant targets across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, hitting deep into key hubs of Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen.",
      "Among the closest targets were two camps in Sialkot, just 6-18km from the border, according to an Indian spokesperson.",
      "The deepest hit, says India, was a Jaish-e-Mohammed headquarters in Bahawalpur, 100km inside Pakistan. A LeT camp in Muzaffarabad, 30km from the LoC and capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was linked to recent attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, the spokesperson said.",
      "Pakistan says six locations have been hit, but denies allegations of there being terror camps.",
      "\"What's striking this time is the expansion of India's targets beyond past patterns. Previously, strikes like Balakot focused on Pakistan-administered Kashmir across the Line of Control - a militarised boundary,\" Srinath Raghavan, a Delhi-based historian, told the BBC.",
      "\"This time, India has hit into Pakistan's Punjab, across the International Border, targeting terrorist infrastructure, headquarters, and known locations in Bahawalpur and Muridke linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. They've also struck Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen assets. This suggests a broader, more geographically expansive response, signalling that multiple groups are now in India's crosshairs - and sending a wider message,\" he says.",
      "The India-Pakistan International Border is the officially recognised boundary separating the two countries, stretching from Gujarat to Jammu.",
      "Ajay Bisaria, a former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, told the BBC that what India did was a \"Balakot plus response meant to establish deterrence, targeting known terrorist hubs, but accompanied by a strong de-escalatory message\".",
      "\"These strikes were more precise, targeted and more visible than in the past. Therefore, [they are] less deniable by Pakistan,\" Mr Bisaria says.",
      "Indian sources say the strikes were aimed at \"re-establishing deterrence\".",
      "\"The Indian government thinks that the deterrence established in 2019 has worn thin and needs to be re-established,\" says Prof Raghavan.",
      "\"This seems to mirror Israel's doctrine that deterrence requires periodic, repeated strikes. But if we assume that hitting back alone will deter terrorism, we risk giving Pakistan every incentive to retaliate - and that can quickly spiral out of control.\"",
      "Could this spiral into a broader conflict?",
      "The majority of experts agree that a retaliation from Pakistan is inevitable - and diplomacy will come into play.",
      "\"Pakistan's response is sure to come. The challenge would be to manage the next level of escalation. This is where crisis diplomacy will matter,\" says Mr Bisaria.",
      "\"Pakistan will be getting advice to exercise restraint. But the key will be the diplomacy after the Pakistani response to ensure that both countries don't rapidly climb the ladder of escalation.\"",

      "Pakistan-based experts like Ejaz Hussain, a Lahore-based political and military analyst, say Indian surgical strikes targeting locations such as Muridke and Bahawalpur were \"largely anticipated given the prevailing tensions\".",
      "Dr Hussain believes retaliatory strikes are likely.",
      "\"Given the Pakistani military's media rhetoric and stated resolve to settle the scores, retaliatory action, possibly in the form of surgical strikes across the border, appears likely in the coming days,\" he told the BBC.",
      "But Dr Hussain worries that surgical strikes on both sides could \"escalate into a limited conventional war\".",
      "Christopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US believes given the scale of India's strikes, \"visible damage at key sites\", and reported casualties, Pakistan is highly likely to retaliate.",
      "\"Doing otherwise essentially would give India permission to strike Pakistan whenever Delhi feels aggrieved and would run contrary to the Pakistan military's commitment to retaliating with 'quid pro quo plus',\" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia, told the BBC.",
      "\"Given India's stated targets of groups and facilities associated with terrorism and militancy in India, I think it is likely - but far from certain - that Pakistan will confine itself to attacks on Indian military targets,\" he said.",
      "Despite the rising tensions, some experts still hold out hope for de-escalation.",
      "\"There is a decent chance we escape this crisis with just one round of reciprocal standoff strikes and a period of heightened firing along the Line of Control,\" says Mr Clary.",
      "However, the risk of further escalation remains high, making this the \"most dangerous\" India-Pakistan crisis since 2002 - and even more perilous than the 2016 and 2019 standoffs, he adds.",
      "Is Pakistani retaliation now inevitable?",
      "Experts in Pakistan note that despite a lack of war hysteria leading up to India's strike, the situation could quickly shift.",
      "\"We have a deeply fractured political society, with the country's most popular leader behind bars. Imran Khan's imprisonment triggered a strong anti-military public backlash,\" says Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst and a former correspondent of Jane's Defence Weekly.",
      "\"Today, the Pakistani public is far less eager to support the military compared to 2016 or 2019 - the usual wave of war hysteria is noticeably absent. But if public opinion shifts in central Punjab where anti-India feelings are more prevalent, we could see increased civilian pressure on the military to take action. And the military will regain popularity because of this conflict.\"",
      "Dr Hussain echoes a similar sentiment.",
      "\"I believe the current standoff with India presents an opportunity for the Pakistani military to regain public support, particularly from the urban middle classes who have recently criticised it for perceived political interference,\" he says.",
      "\"The military's active defence posture is already being amplified through mainstream and social media, with some outlets claiming that six or seven Indian jets were shot down.",
      "\"Although these claims warrant independent verification, they serve to bolster the military's image among segments of the public that conventionally rally around national defence narratives in times of external threat.\"",
      "Can India and Pakistan step back from the brink?",
      "India is once again walking a fine line between escalation and restraint.",
      "Shortly after the attack in Pahalgam, India swiftly retaliated by closing the main border crossing, suspending a water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals. Troops on both sides have exchanged small-arms fire, and India barred all Pakistani aircraft from its airspace, mirroring Pakistan's earlier move. In response, Pakistan suspended a 1972 peace treaty and took its own retaliatory measures.",
      "This mirrors India's actions after the 2019 Pulwama attack, when it swiftly revoked Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, imposed heavy tariffs and suspended key trade and transport links.",
      "The crisis had escalated when India launched air strikes on Balakot, followed by retaliatory Pakistani air raids and the capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, further heightening tensions. However, diplomatic channels eventually led to a de-escalation, with Pakistan releasing the pilot in a goodwill gesture.",
      "\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience,\" Mr Bisaria told me last week."

      "At the current rate, it can take months to identify just one victim from a mixed mass grave. \"This,\" says Dr al-Hourani, \"will be the work of many, many years.\"",

      "Eleven of those \"mixed mass graves\" are slung around a beautiful, barren hilltop outside Damascus. The BBC are the first international media to see this site. The graves are quite visible now. In the years since they were dug, their surface has sunk into the dry, stony earth.",
      "Accompanying us is Hussein Alawi al-Manfi, or Abu Ali, as he also calls himself. He was a driver in the Syrian military. \"My cargo,\" says Abu Ali, \"was human bodies.\"",
      "This compact man with a salt and pepper beard was tracked down thanks to the tireless investigative work of Mouaz Mustafa, the Syrian-American executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a US-based advocacy group. He had persuaded Abu Ali to join us, to bear witness to what Mouaz calls \"the worst crimes of the 21st Century\".",
      "Abu Ali transported lorry loads of corpses to multiple sites for more than 10 years. At this location, he came, on average, twice a week for roughly two years at the start of the demonstrations and then the war, between 2011 and 2013.",
      "The routine was always the same. He'd head to a military or security installation. \"I had a 16m (52ft) trailer. It wasn't always filled to the brim. But I'd have, I guess, an average of 150 to 200 bodies in each load.\"",
      "Of his cargo, he says he is convinced they were civilians. Their bodies were \"mangled and tortured\". The only identification he could see were numbers written on the cadaver or stuck to the chest or forehead. The numbers identified where they had died.",
      "There were a lot, he said, from \"215\" - a notorious military intelligence detention centre in Damascus known as \"Branch 215\". It is a place we will re-visit in this story.",
      "Abu Ali's trailer did not have a hydraulic lift to tip and dump his load. When he backed up to a trench, soldiers would pull the bodies into the hole one after another. Then a front-loader tractor would \"flatten them out, compress them in, fill in the grave.\"",
      "Three men with weathered faces from a neighbouring village have arrived. They corroborate the story of the regular visits by military lorries to this remote spot.",
      "And as for the man behind the wheel: how could he do this for week after week, year after year? What was he telling himself each time he climbed into his cab?",
      "Abu Ali says he learned to be a mute servant of the state. \"You can't say anything good or bad.\"",

      "Damascus is where Malak Aoude has recently returned, after years as a refugee in Turkey. Syria may have been freed of the chokehold of the Assads' dynastic dictatorship. Malak is still serving a life sentence.",
      "For the past 13 years, she has been locked into a daily routine of pain and longing. It was 2012, a year after some of the people of Syria had dared to raise a protest against their president, that her two boys were disappeared.",
      "Mohammed was still a teenager when he was conscripted into Assad's army, as the demonstrations spread and the regime's deadly crackdown sparked a full-blown war.",
      "He hated what he was seeing, his mother says. Mohammed started absconding, and even went on the demos himself. But he was tracked down.",
      "\"They broke his arms and beat his back,\" says his mother. \"He spent three days unconscious in hospital.\"",
      "Mohammed went AWOL again. \"I reported him missing,\" says Malak. \"But I was hiding him.\"",
      "In May 2012, 19-year-old's Mohammed luck ran out. He was caught along with a group of friends. They were shot. Malak says there was no formal notification. But she has always assumed he was killed.",
      "Six months later, Mohammed's younger brother Maher was dragged from school by officers. It was Maher's second arrest. He'd gone to the protests in 2011, aged 14. That had led to his first arrest. When he was let out of detention, a month later, he was in his underwear, covered, says his mother, in cigarette burns, wounds and lice. \"He was terrified.\"",
      "Malak thinks Maher was disappeared from school in 2012 because the authorities had found that she had been hiding his older brother. Now, for the first time in 13 years, Malak returns to that school, desperate to get any clue about what happened to Maher.",
      "The new headteacher produces a couple of battered red ledgers. Malak traces the rows of names with her finger, and then finds her son's name. December 2012, the record flatly states: Maher has been excluded from school because he has failed to turn up for lessons for two weeks.",
      "There is no explanation that it is the state which has disappeared him. There is something else, though: a folder with Maher's school records has been found. Its cover is adorned with a photograph of a wise Bashar al-Assad, gazing thoughtfully into the distance. Malak picks up a pen from the headteacher's desk and scribbles over the photo. Six months ago, that gesture could have been lethal.",
      "For years, the only scraps Malak had to cling to were two men who say they saw Maher in \"Branch 215\" - that same military detention centre which produced so many corpses for Abu Ali to transport.",
      "One of the witnesses told Malak that her boy had told him something about his parents that, his mother says, only he could have known. It was definitely him. \"He asked this man to tell me he was doing fine.\" Malak heaves and leaks tears, stuffs a tattered tissue into the corners of her eyes.",
      "For Malak, like so many Syrians, the fall of Assad was not just a day of joy, but of hope. \"I thought there was a 90% chance Maher would walk out of prison. I was waiting for him.\"",
      "But she has not even been able to find her son's name on the prison lists. And so the throb of pain continues to course through her. \"I feel lost and confused,\" she says.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 00:07:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Why ex-bank boss Tidjane Thiam has been barred from seeking the Ivorian presidency - and the potential fallout.",
    "story": [
      "Even a stellar international business career cannot prepare you for the hard realities of politics in Ivory Coast, where some are questioning the democratic credentials of the West African nation most famous for being the producer of much of the world's cocoa and some of its finest footballers.",
      "That is the painful lesson Tidjane Thiam is learning as he waits to see whether deal-making in the corridors of power and popular pressure from the street can rescue his bid to become president of Ivory Coast.",
      "Seemingly relentless progress towards the election set for this October came to a juddering halt on 22 April when a judge ruled that the 62-year-old had lost his Ivorian citizenship by taking French nationality decades previously and not revoking it until too late to qualify for this year's vote.",
      "Moving back to Ivory Coast in 2022 after more than two decades in global finance, Thiam had immediately been seen as a potential contender to succeed current head of state Alassane Ouattara who, at 83, is now in the final year of his third term of office.",
      "A scion of a traditional noble family and a great nephew of the country's revered founding President, F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, he had impressed as a top government official and minister in the 1990s, overseeing infrastructure development and radical economic reforms.",
      "A military coup then pushed Thiam to seek a fresh career abroad, which culminated in high-profile stints as chief executive of UK insurance giant Prudential and then the banking group Credit Suisse.",
      "But returning home at last, three years ago, he embarked on a steady advance towards the next Ivorian presidential election.",
      "After the death in 2023 of former President Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9, long-serving leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI), Thiam was perfectly positioned to take his place and then on 17 April this year he was chosen as the party's candidate for the upcoming presidential race.",
      "That was no guarantee of victory, and especially if - as seems quite plausible Ouattara opts to run for a fourth term, backed by all the assets and advantages of incumbency and a track record of four successive years of annual economic growth above 6%.",
      "However, Thiam stood out as the prime alternative.",
      "As an opponent of the ruling Rally of Houphou\u00ebtists for Democracy and Peace (RHDP), he offered Ivorian voters the chance to change their government.",
      "Yet with his centrist politics and solid technocratic credentials, his candidacy offered reassuring competence and the prospect of continuing the impressive economic progress that Ouattara has piloted since 2011.",
      "Now that potential trajectory is blocked. If the court decision stands - and Ivorian law offers no option of appeal for this particular issue - Thiam will be out of October's contest.",
      "It is a race from which past court convictions have already excluded three other prominent opposition figures - former President Laurent Gbagbo, former Prime Minister Guillaume Soro and a former minister, Charles Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9 - all central actors in the political crises and civil conflicts that brutally paralysed the progress of Ivory Coast between 1999 and 2011.",
      "The prospect now is that Ouattara or any chosen RHDP successor candidate will approach the election without facing any heavyweight political challenge.",
      "That can only deepen Ivorians' already widespread popular disillusionment with the country's political establishment.",
      "This is against the wider context of a West Africa where the radical anti-politics rhetoric of the soldiers who have seized power in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger already finds a sympathetic audience among many disenchanted young people.",
      "That really matters in societies where, typically, three-quarters of the population is under 35.",
      "Amidst this crisis for West African democracy, there have been some moments of encouragement.",
      "In Liberia in 2023 and in Senegal and Ghana last year, incumbent governments were voted out, in free and fair elections whose results were accepted by all contestants without argument.",
      "The Senegalese result, in particular, owed much to the massive enthusiastic mobilisation of young people.",
      "Many hoped that Ivory Coast could offer a further positive example of democratic choice and the offer of change, and an example that might be all the more influential because the country is a prosperous regional powerhouse.",
      "It is the economic engine of the CFA franc single currency bloc and besides the cocoa industry, it is also a key hub for business services and finance and a leading political voice in the regional grouping, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas).",
      "What happens in Ivory Coast really matters and is widely noticed, across West Africa and indeed, also right across francophone Africa more generally.",
      "Ouattara is one of the continent's most prominent statesmen, commanding broad respect internationally too.",
      "And yet now the run-up to the country's crucial next presidential election has become ensnared in a return version of the identity politics that so soured the bitter disputes and instability of the 1990s and 2000s.",
      "Back then, the governments of first B\u00e9di\u00e9 and then Gbagbo used the contentious \"ivoirit\u00e9\", meaning \"Ivorian-ness\" law to shut Ouattara out of standing for the presidency on the grounds that his family allegedly had foreign origins.",
      "It was only in 2007 that the government scrapped the ban on his candidacy and only in 2016 - when he was already in office - that a new constitution at last ended the requirement that the stated parents of presidential candidates be native-born Ivorians.",
      "The poisonous mobilisation of identity issues had been a major contributing factor to the civil wars, street violence and northern separatist partition that brutally scarred Ivory Coast for more than a decade, up to 2011, at a cost of thousands of lives.",
      "Today the country feels far from such large-scale conflict.",
      "There is no popular appetite for a return to confrontation and politicians are staying well away from the incendiary rhetoric of the past.",
      "But the Thiam saga shows how identity issues, even in a more legalistic form and in this hopefully more peaceful era, can still weigh heavily.",
      "Ivory Coast only permits dual nationality under certain limited conditions.",
      "So in its 22 April ruling, an Abidjan court declared that, under the terms of a little-used post-independence law, Thiam had automatically lost his Ivorian citizenship almost four decades ago when he acquired French nationality - after several years' study in Paris.",
      "Although he officially surrendered that this February, and thus automatically recovered his original citizenship, this was too late for inclusion on this year's register of eligible voters or candidates.",
      "In vain, his lawyers had argued that, through his father, Thiam had French nationality from birth - which, if accepted, would exempt him from the dual nationality ban.",
      "Seeking to highlight the absurdity and inconsistencies of the situation, he argued that, logically, the country should now hand back its prized 2024 Africa Cup of Nations football title because many of the players also have French nationality.",
      "\"If we apply the law the way [that] they just applied it to me, we have to give the cup back to Nigeria - because half of the team was not Ivorian,\" he told the BBC.",
      "And Thursday could bring yet another setback in a scheduled court hearing where a judge may now rule that Thiam cannot, as a non-national, lead the PDCI.",
      "The past two weeks have seen continuing political and legal debate over this whole saga, with the Thiam camp hoping that a combination of popular pressure and discreet political negotiation will lead to a compromise that lets him back into the presidential race, perhaps along with the other excluded contenders.",
      "And Ouattara, should he chose not to run, might want to safeguard his impressive track record and secure his international reputation by intervening with some kind of deal that allows Thiam to run.",
      "With months to go before the polls, there is still time for that. But no-one is counting on it.",

      "\"Not even in my wildest imagination did I think this would happen,\" said Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David, describing the day he found out that he had been appointed a cardinal.",
      "He was speaking to the BBC at his cathedral in Caloocan, on the outskirts of the Philippine capital Manila. He was leaving the next day for Rome to join the conclave, one of three cardinals from the country who will take part in choosing the next pope.",
      "\"Normally you would expect archbishops to become cardinals, but I am only a humble bishop of a little diocese where the majority of the people are slum dwellers, urban poor, you know.",
      "\"But I thought just maybe, for Pope Francis, it mattered that we had more cardinals who are really grounded there.\"",
      "Cardinal David has only been in the job for five months, after his surprise elevation last December. But in some ways he personifies the late pontiff's legacy in his country.",
      "Pope Francis had set himself the goal of bringing a Catholic church he believed had lost its common touch, back closer to the people.",

      "Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
      "'Grandpa Francis': A nation remembers the Pope who braved a typhoon for them",
      "The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia, nearly 80% of its 100 million people, and the third-largest in the world.",
      "It's one reason why Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle is believed to be a papabile, or frontrunner to replace Pope Francis \u2013 Tagle was also talked of as a contender in the last papal conclave 12 years ago.",
      "The country is considered a bright spot for the Roman Catholic church, where faith is strong, its rituals woven into the fabric of society.",
      "Yet the church is facing headwinds there. Its doctrines on divorce and family planning are being challenged by politicians, and newer charismatic churches are winning converts.",
      "Pope Francis helped restore morale in the Philippines church, though he did not offer answers to these challenges beyond being more welcoming of diversity and urging the clergy to be more responsive to the needs of the poor.",
      "But those on the activist wing of the church did feel encouraged by his support.",
      "For Cardinal David that support was critical when he faced his greatest test, during the war on drugs declared by former President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016.",
      "He took me to see a plaque he had erected in front of his cathedral in memory of Kian Delos Santos, a 17 year-old boy from his diocese who was gunned down by police in August 2017.",
      "Kian was just one of many thousands who died in Duterte's campaign \u2013 estimates range from 6,300 to 30,000. What made his case different from most was that the usual police justification, that he was armed and had resisted arrest, was contradicted by eyewitnesses and security camera videos.",
      "The police officers had murdered him as he pleaded for his life. Three officers were eventually convicted of the murder, a rare instance of accountability in the drug war.",
      "The cardinal is still visibly affected by the hundreds of killings that happened in his diocese \u2013 a cluster of low-income neighbourhoods typical of the areas targeted by the police in their notorious tokhang, or \"knock and plead\" raids, against alleged drug dealers and users.",
      "\"It was just too much seeing dead bodies left and right,\" Cardinal David says.",
      "\"And you know, when I would ask people what they thought, you know, why these people were targeted. They said they're drug users. I said, so what? So what? Who told you that just because people use drugs, they deserve to die?\"",
      "He began offering sanctuary to those who feared they were on police hit lists, and then drug-rehabilitation programmes, in the hope this might protect them.",
      "He also did something the church as a whole did not do for several months: he openly criticised the drug war as illegal and immoral.",
      "As a result, he received many death threats. President Duterte accused him of taking drugs, and talked about decapitating him. The government also filed sedition charges against him, though these were eventually dropped.",
      "In those difficult years Cardinal David found he had a powerful backer, in Rome.",
      "On a visit to the city in 2019 Pope Francis had taken him aside to give him a special blessing, saying he knew what was happening in his diocese and urging him to stay safe.",
      "When they met again in 2023, and he reminded the Pope that he was still alive, he says the pontiff laughed and told him: \"You have not been called to martyrdom yet!\"",
      "The role of the Roman Catholic church in the Philippines has changed over its 500-year history in the archipelago.",
      "It was closely associated with the Spanish conquest, Spanish friars acting as de facto colonial administrators and the church becoming a big landowner. When the US replaced Spain as the colonial ruler in 1898, enforcing a separation of church and state, the political influence of the Catholic clergy waned.",
      "But the church retained the allegiance of most of the population; even today, after inroads made by charismatic protestant churches, nearly 80% of Filipinos identify as Roman Catholic.",
      "Since independence in 1946 the church has had an uneasy relationship with power. Its deep roots and establishment status have made it an influential player, wooed by political factions but also needing their support to protect its interests.",
      "Attitudes began changing in the 1970s and 80s, the time when a young Pablo David and many other senior church figures today were studying to enter the priesthood.",
      "This was the era of \"liberation theology\", which came out of Latin America and argued that it was the duty of the clergy to fight against the pervasive poverty and injustice all around them.",
      "When then-President Marcos, father of the current president of the Philippines, declared martial law in 1972 and began jailing and killing his critics, some priests even went underground to join the armed resistance.",
      "But the church hierarchy continued what it called \"critical collaboration\" with the Marcos dictatorship.",
      "That changed dramatically in February 1986, when the then-Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Jaime Sin, called on people to come out on the streets and oppose Marcos, sparking the famous \"people power\" uprising which deposed the president.",
      "Cardinal Sin would reprise that role in 2001 when he helped overthrow another beleaguered president, Joseph Estrada.",
      "After that, though, church leaders were accused of cosying up to Estrada's successor, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, partly to gain her support in opposing growing political and social pressure to expand access to family planning and legalise divorce.",
      "And they were reluctant to condemn President Duterte's drug war because, despite the appalling human cost, it remained popular with the Filipino public, at least away from the poorer areas where the killings took place.",
      "Nearly 40 years after its pivotal role in overthrowing the Marcos regime, the church's influence once again seems to be waning, as it did a century ago.",
      "For instance, the Church's fervent opposition could not prevent the Philippines Congress from passing the Reproductive Health Law of 2012 that made family planning easily accessible.",
      "This is despite the fact that many Filipino Catholics remain conservative on issues like gender and divorce, says Jayeel Cornelio, a sociologist who has written extensively on Catholicism in the Philippines.",
      "The church's defeat over family planning, he says, is indicative of its diminished sway over national politics.",
      "\"The Catholic church was practically sidelined during the Duterte presidency. When Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos ran for president in 2022, many Catholic leaders and institutions expressed their dissent and even endorsed the opposition. But Marcos still won.\"",
      "Many Filipinos welcome this, including, it seems, Cardinal David.",
      "\"It is not the business of the church to govern, neither is it the business of government to run a church\", he said.",
      "\"But we can complement one another - I cannot say we will be apolitical. So long as we stick to our role as a moral and spiritual leader, we can give guidance, even about political and economic matters.\"",
      "Even that more limited view of the church's proper role, though, has run into opposition.",
      "Thirteen years after overcoming ecclesiastical objections to the Reproductive Health Bill, the Philippines Congress is now trying to get a bill passed which would legalise divorce, something else the church disagrees with.",
      "\"I do not expect them to change their official doctrine, but in my job as a lawmaker, I try to address the problems that Filipinos face, and I don't want them to meddle in my work. It is against our constitution to legislate in favour of any religion,\" says Geraldine Roman, the first transgender member of Congress in the Philippines.",
      "A practicing Catholic, she credits Pope Francis with creating a more welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ people with his \"who am I to judge\" statement.",
      "\"Nobody misgenders me in my church now,\" she says.",
      "But she objects to the Catholic church lobbying against the divorce bill, which she argues will free thousands of Filipino women trapped in abusive marriages.",
      "\"The church is free to try to indoctrinate Catholics into sticking it out in their marriages. But in the end, it is the decision of the couple, and not even the church can meddle in that decision.\"",
      "Other challenges include a congregation which is increasingly disengaged. While the number of Roman Catholics has fallen only slightly in the past three decades, the number attending mass at least once a week has dropped by half, to just over one third of those surveyed recently.",
      "Then there are the various scandals associated with the Catholic church, especially the sexual abuse of minors, which critics say Pope Francis, while he did tackle the issue, did not do enough to address.",
      "Cardinal David recalled how President Duterte \"loved to wave\" a book called \"Altar of Secrets\", an expose of alleged scandals in the Filipino church, and how he would say, \"oh, those hypocrites. Don't listen to them. They don't practice what they what they preach. They are abusers. I must say some people swallowed it hook, line and sinker. So I am not surprised that our moral credibility has been challenged.\"",
      "But, he adds, defensiveness is not the way the Church can win back its credibility.",

    "story": [
      "Russia is expected to begin a self-declared three-day pause in fighting against Ukraine on Wednesday night, in a move derided by many Ukrainians and described by President Volodymyr Zelensky as little more than a \"theatrical show\".",
      "Russia's Vladimir Putin proposed the three-day ceasefire to coincide with the anniversary of the end of World War Two in Europe \u2013 a public holiday in Russia on Friday known as Victory Day.",
      "But in doing so Putin has rejected a much more substantial proposal from the Trump administration for a 30-day ceasefire and negotiations \u2013 a proposal that was accepted by Ukraine.",
      "Zelensky has in turn rejected Russia's unilateral three-day ceasefire and said that Ukraine will not guarantee the safety of a celebratory military parade in Moscow's Red Square on 9 May.",
      "Rosenberg: Russians remember WW2 with victory on their minds",
      "The Russian proposal has been met with widespread cynicism in Ukraine, where polls consistently suggest that about 95% of the population distrusts Russia.",
      "\"I don't believe there will be any ceasefire,\" said Tetyana Kondratenko, 42, a shopkeeper in Khotin Village in Sumy, a heavily bombarded region about six miles (10km) from the Russian border.",
      "\"Lately the shelling has only intensified, for half the day today we have heard boom after boom,\" Ms Kondratenko said in a phone interview.",
      "Zelensky was right to reject the proposal \"because you know how they operate, like what happened at Easter\", she added, referring to the Russians.",
      "\"They announced a ceasefire, then used it to bring in more equipment and started attacking again. What kind of ceasefire is that?\"",
      "Last month, around Easter, Russia proposed a similar 30-hour cessation in hostilities but was later accused by Ukraine of violating its own suggested truce nearly 3,000 times.",
      "On that occasion, rather than rejecting the proposal outright, Ukraine said it would mirror Russia's actions.",
      "A senior Ukrainian military officer told the BBC at the time that frontline units received an order to stop firing at Russian positions, but to record evidence of Russian violations and return fire if needed.",
      "By Wednesday Ukrainian officials had not said categorically whether they would adjust their military action over the three-day period. Asked if Ukrainian forces planned to continue military operations, a source in the presidential office told the BBC: \"We'll see.\"",
      "From Novosofiivka village, in the very badly hit region of Zaporizhzhia, Antonina Sienina, 35, said that any ceasefire worth agreeing to should come with \"solid guarantees\" for Ukraine's safety and sovereignty \u2013 not something included in Putin's plan for the next three days.",

      "Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia",
      "But Ms Sienina had mixed feelings. Her parents were killed in a Russian strike, her brother has been wounded, and her village has been pounded, so \"maybe it wasn't right to refuse\" the three-day proposal, she added.",
      "\"Because honestly, we would be happy even for just one day without explosions. Just to take the kids somewhere, to a shopping mall, to a playground, to some attractions,\" she said.",
      "\"We dream of the war being over, or at least a temporary ceasefire, because my children are exhausted. The nerves, the medications, the sleepless nights. It's too much.\"",
      "Residents of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv were kept awake in the early hours of Wednesday morning by Russian drone and missile strikes on the city. A ballistic missile was successfully shot down by air defence systems but a drone hit a block of flats, killing a mother and her son and injuring at least six more, including a child.",
      "The mayor of Moscow said on Wednesday that Russian air defences had downed 14 Ukrainian drones overnight. The Kremlin said that the drone attacks had no bearing on its plans to pause fighting for three days.",
      "The pause is not being taken seriously in Ukraine, for the most part. It has been greeted instead as more of a propaganda exercise. Pavlo Klimkin, the former foreign minister of Ukraine, told the BBC it was simply another Russian show of force.",
      "\"This is all about Russia framing the agenda on its own terms,\" Klimkin said. \"It has nothing to do with a real ceasefire. It is all about messaging \u2013 messaging internally, messaging to the US, messaging to Europe to say that we, Russia, are in control.\"",
      "Talks directed at a substantial ceasefire process began back in February, with US President Donald Trump sending officials to negotiate separately with the leaders of Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine has since agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, Russia has not.",
      "The months since have been a deadly period in the war. Russia has intensively targeted Ukrainian cities with drones and missiles, killing 19 people including nine children last month in a strike on a playground in Kryvyi Rih and 35 people a week later in an Easter strike on the city of Sumy.",
      "According to the UN, at least 848 civilians were killed between 1 and 24 April - a 46% increase on the same period last year.",
      "The level of civilian deaths meant that any ceasefire should be accepted, even on Russian terms, said Oleksii Kamchatnyi, 38, a scientist living in Kyiv.",
      "\"It is about saving lives,\" Mr Kamchatnyi said. \"I'm originally from Donbas, from Pokrovsk. I managed to evacuate my mother but my father stayed there. I haven't had any contact with him since 9 March.\"",
      "Still, Mr Kamchatnyi supported the temporary ceasefire, he said, \"even if it means giving up territory.\"",
      "Ukrainian polling suggests that a majority of the public would accept the idea of ceding some control of territory seized by the Russians during the full-scale invasion, though not surrendering formal sovereignty over the land, according to Anton Grushetsky, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.",
      "\"There is for certainly a lot of fatigue and there is a lot of desire to have a stable peace in Ukraine,\" Mr Grushetsky said.",
      "But based on previous polling, the majority of Ukrainians would likely view the proposed three-day ceasefire as \"either a trap or simply a ploy to avoid attacks on Moscow during the holiday\", he added.",
      "There is also suspicion among many in Ukraine that the ceasefire proposal is simply a ploy by Russia to move its forces to strategic places on the battlefield, make reinforcements where needed, and prepare for offensives.",
      "Ukraine had already made clear that it was ready for a full, unconditional ceasefire, and had no obligation to take part in Russia's agenda, said Mykhailo Samus, a Ukrainian military analyst and director of the New Geopolitics Research Network.",
      "\"Why would we play Putin's game? We are ready for a real ceasefire,\" Mr Samus said. \"If he wants to organise a parade to show that he is a great leader, that is his business.\"",

      "He said Ukraine and Russia \"are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own\". Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has echoed that message, saying a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is \"unrealistic\".",
      "\"It is modern-day appeasement,\" Biden said on Monday, a reference to the policy of former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who sought in the late 1930s to appease Adolf Hitler's demands in a failed attempt to avoid a catastrophic all-out war in Europe.",
      "He also expressed concern that \"Europe is going to lose confidence in the certainty of America and the leadership of America\".",
      "The continent's leaders, he added, were \"wondering, well, what do I do now?... Can I rely on the United States? Are they going to be there?\"",
      "Trump has said he expects Russia to keep the Crimean peninsula, which was illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, and last month he accused Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky of harming peace negotiations when Zelensky rejected the suggestion.",
      "Reports suggest recent US proposals for a truce settlement not only include formal US recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, but also de facto US recognition of Russian control of other occupied areas in Ukraine. The White House has not publicly confirmed the details.",
      "\"I have no favourites. I don't want to have any favourites. I want to have a deal done,\" Trump said last month when asked about recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea.",
      "\"Yes, of course, [the Ukrainians] are angry that they were invaded,\" VP Vance told Fox News last week. \"But are we going to continue to lose thousands and thousands of soldiers over a few miles of territory this or that way?\"",
      "The pressure to cede land is not just coming from Washington, with the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, telling the BBC last month that Ukraine may have to temporarily give up territory.",
      "Discussing Putin, Biden said: \"I just don't understand how people think that if we allow a dictator, a thug, to decide he's going to take significant portions of land that aren't his, that that's going to satisfy him. I don't quite understand.\"",
      "He also said he feared some countries in the Nato alliance that border Russia may \"just say we've got to make an accommodation\" to Putin if Ukraine ultimately gives up land.",
      "Trump has long resisted continuing the level of US military support that Biden gave to Ukraine, arguing that his ultimate aim is to end the bloodshed. He has previously said Zelensky played Biden \"like a fiddle\".",
      "Tensions between the White House and the Ukrainian leader exploded into public view in February, when Trump and Vance berated Zelensky and demanded he show more gratitude for years of US support during an extraordinary televised meeting in the Oval Office.",
      "\"I found it sort of beneath America in the way that took place,\" Biden said of the meeting.",
      "Trump and his top officials have repeatedly criticised European countries for not spending enough on their own defence and relying too heavily on US support.",
      "The US is by some margin the largest single donor to Ukraine, but European countries combined have spent more money, according to the Kiel Institute, a German-based think tank tracking support for Kyiv.",
      "\"I don't understand how they fail to understand that there's strength in alliances,\" Biden said of the Trump administration on Monday. \"There's benefits... It saves us money overall.\"",
      "When asked about President Trump's first 100 days in office, which has seen a whirlwind of executive actions as well as sweeping cuts to the size and spending of the federal government, Biden touted his own record and sought to draw a stark contrast between when he left office and now.",
      "\"Our economy was growing. We were moving in a direction where the stock market was way up. We were in a situation where we were expanding our influence around the world in a positive way, increasing trade\" he said of state of the country when he left the White House in January.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, says he is driving a needed overhaul of the world's relationship with the US, rebalancing trade, controlling illegal immigration and making government more efficient. He celebrated the 100-day milestone with a triumphant speech last week. What does Biden make of the start to Trump 2.0?",
      "\"I'll let history judge that,\" he said. \"I don't see anything that was triumphant.\"",

      "The four suspects \u2013 two Belgians, a Vietnamese and a Kenyan \u2013 were arrested last month with live ants suspected to have been destined for collectors in Europe and Asia.",

      "She added: \"This court will do what it can to protect all creatures great and small.\"",

      "Belgian nationals Lornoy David and Seppe Lodewijckx, both 19, Vietnamese national Duh Hung Nguyen and Kenyan Dennis Ng'ang'a, were handed similar terms after the magistrate considered their mitigation arguments.",

      "The ants were packed in more than 2,000 test tubes filled with cotton wool to help them survive for months, authorities said.",
      "The Belgian teens had entered Kenya on a tourist visa and were staying in Naivasha, a town popular with tourists for its animal parks and lakes.",
      "Nguyen, 23, was described by the court as a \"mule or courier\" as he was just sent to pick up the ants and the person who sent him paid for his ticket.",
      "The court said Ng'ang'a, 26, acted as a \"broker\" due to his knowledge of the ants that are found in his rural home.",
      "While sentencing Nguyen and Ng'ang'a, Ms Thuku said they were involved in what she described as \"illegal wildlife trade and possibly bio-piracy\".",
      "David, an ant enthusiast with 10 colonies of ants at home in Belgium, belongs to a Facebook group called \"Ant Gang\", the court heard.",
      "The Belgian teen, who first visited Kenya five years ago, said he had bought 2,500 queen ants for $200 when he was arrested looking for more.",
      "While pleading for leniency, David told the court he did not know his actions, which he regretted, were illegal.",
      "For his part, Lodewijckx said he had only offered to buy the ants for his entomology interest but his intention was not to traffic them.",

      "It also highlighted the ecological importance of the giant African harvester ants, noting that their removal from the ecosystem could disrupt soil health and biodiversity.",

      "\"Traffickers often underestimate the ecological value of smaller species, but their role in our ecosystems is irreplaceable,\" it added.",

      "\"I think that's the main thing. That doesn't presuppose the outcome of the negotiation,\" Carney added at a  news conference at the Canadian embassy in Washington DC. \"There'll be zigs and zags. Difficult aspects to it. But the prospect is there.\"",

    "story": [
      "For the past three years, when peers of Australia's former Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton were grilled over his divisive persona, they'd often profess his celebrity status in the north.",
      "\"Peter is one of us\u2026 He's very popular in Queensland,\" said the leader of the Nationals, the Liberal's coalition partner, earlier this year.",
      "But on election night, it was Dutton's home state that delivered Labor its election win, with the red landslide ousting the veteran MP from his own seat of Dickson.",
      "While votes are still being counted, Labor could pick up as many electorates in Queensland as it did across every other state and territory combined.",
      "And that's thanks, in no small part, to a new bloc of young voters and women who are disillusioned with the Coalition, and attribute the party's emphatic loss to the \"Dutton effect\".",
      "As 65-year-old coalition voter Sue, who didn't share her last name, bluntly puts it: \"This is where [Dutton's] from\u2026 People know him and they don't like him.\"",
      "Losing the heartland",
      "The Moreton Bay region, about an hour north of Brisbane, is supposed to be Dutton heartland. Before Australia's federal election on 3 May, all three seats here were Liberal-held - though only by small leads, with Dutton's electorate of Dickson having the narrowest in the state.",
      "Dutton's family have deep roots here, with his dairy farming great-grandparents having settled in the area in the 1860s.",
      "When he first entered parliament 24 years ago, the region was made up of urban pockets and industrial estates surrounded by swathes of semi-rural land. Not quite metropolitan or rural, is how the former police officer described it in his maiden speech as MP.",
      "Now Brisbane is one of the fastest growing cities in Australia, and these outer northern suburbs are one of the main places it is squeezing people in. Residential development has exploded, and more  families, priced out of locations closer to the city, have moved in to Moreton Bay.",
      "Full of the \"quiet Australians\" Dutton said would deliver him the election, outer-suburban neighbourhoods like these were at the heart of the Coalition's strategy.",
      "The average household in Moreton Bay earns less than both the state and national average, with many of them relying on the health, trade and hospitality sectors for work. The Coalition hoped promises to cut fuel expenses, improve housing affordability and back small businesses would woo voters concerned about the cost of living.",
      "Many Moreton Bay residents, like campaign volunteer Kenneth King, also felt Dutton's links to the area would give them a boost.",
      "\"I've known Peter Dutton for a lot of years,\" the Dickson local told the BBC on polling day. \"He's always been someone of high character, serious about effective policies and a lot of empathy for ordinary Australians.\"",
      "\"He's very well respected in the community\u2026 People know him.\"",
      "But there's a difference between being well known and well liked, says Aleysha, a swing voter in the neighbouring electorate of Petrie, who declined to give her surname.",
      "\"I don't know whether he appeals to the everyday person,\" the 26-year-old nurse says. \"He doesn't put himself in the people's shoes.\"",
      "Her vote over the years has gone to a range of parties from right across the political spectrum \u2013 except the Greens, she adds with a quick laugh.",
      "\"I don't sit with any party. Being a Christian, it's whatever party aligns closest to my values,\" she says, adding that the future of her two young children is the other major consideration.",
      "This election, that meant her vote went to Coalition incumbent Luke Howarth, who she knows personally from her church.",
      "But while she's praying for a miracle, with the final votes still being counted, she's not surprised to find Howarth may be on his way out.",
      "She says Labor ran very visible campaigns in the area, but tells the BBC that it was driving past the image of Howarth and his leader on billboards which stuck in her mind.",
      "\"Unfortunately I think that's what did it,\" she says.",
      "\"Peter Dutton's face behind him was a huge turnoff - for me personally too.\"",
      "Sue, who lives in the same electorate and is generally a conservative voter, says this election she was torn at the ballot box.",
      "\"I had a huge hesitation over it,\" she says. \"I don't like Albanese; I think he's like, weak.",
      "\"[But] Dutton's an unattractive personality... He thinks he's presenting himself as strong, but he presents himself as a bit of a bully.\"",
      "Ultimately Sue also voted for Howarth - and she's similarly convinced Dutton lost him the seat.",
      "\"I spoke to a few friends\u2026 some did change their votes because of Peter Dutton,\" she says. \"People, rightly or wrongly, aligned Dutton with Trump. And that's very negative for just about any sane person.\"",

      "He wanted to be Australia's PM. But a 'Trump effect' thwarted Peter Dutton",
      "Peter Dutton: The ex-cop who took Australia's opposition to the brink",
      "Drew Cutler grew up in the seat of Longman, which shares borders with both Dickson and Petrie - and though he no longer lives in the area, the 28-year-old was so invested in the outcome he came back to campaign for Labor.",
      "Won by Coalition MP Terry Young on a margin of 3% last election, it is now too close to call.",
      "Mr Cutler, a former Labor party staffer, believes Labor ran very strong local campaigns. But he also thinks Dutton's policy flip-flopping and the aura of instability that projected was potent.",
      "That included announcing, and then walking back, public service job cuts and plans to end work-from-home arrangements, as well as a fluctuating stance on electric vehicle taxes.",
      "Such optics were especially damaging, Mr Cutler argues, when contrasted with the image of strong, decisive leadership Dutton tries to convey.",
      "\"I almost think the Australian people would have respected him more if he stuck to it\u2026 and said, 'This is what I'm putting forward - if you don't like it, don't vote for it',\" Mr Cutler tells the BBC.",
      "Australia PM Albanese makes stunning comeback with landslide win",
      "Back in Dickson, Rick - a retiree and fresh Liberal Party member - said on election night that he also felt confusion played a role in the party's defeat, particularly among young people.",

      "But 30-year-old April, who didn't provide her last name, says it is Dutton who didn't understand.",
      "She can't remember a time when he wasn't in power in Dickson, and feels that over time he has lost touch with his own constituents and the country more broadly.",
      "For her, the last straw was his instrumental role in the defeat of the Voice to Parliament referendum, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them.",
      "\"I think he has caused a lot of harm to a lot of minority groups across the scale,\" she says.",
      "For others in the electorate though, the last straw was watching Dutton fly to a fundraiser in Sydney as the area in and around Dickson was hit by Cyclone Alfred in February.",
      "April didn't feel like Labor Party's offering was strong either, especially on climate action, so she decided to campaign for Ellie Smith, the so-called 'teal' independent running in the seat.",
      "Disappointment - borderline embarrassment - that Dutton was from her local area had crystallised into determination: \"I felt like it was a duty in a way\u2026 our responsibility to get him out.\"",
      "Ultimately, the Coalition lost at least six seats to Labor in Queensland \u2013 all bar one in Brisbane. And while they are a few votes ahead in Longman as the count continues, they could still lose that too.",
      "Wildcard Queensland",
      "Queensland has long been a bit of a political wildcard, and often finds itself in the \"spotlight\" at federal elections, says Frank Mols.",
      "The University of Queensland politics lecturer points out the state helped deliver Kevin Rudd's historic election win in 2007 and Scott Morrison's \"miracle\" victory in 2019. Last election, as a record number of people across the nation voted for candidates outside the two major parties, Queensland surprised the nation by giving the Greens three seats - up from none.",
      "There are a couple of factors that make the state more \"volatile\" and likely to deliver upsets, Dr Mols says.",
      "Firstly, it is the only state or territory, except for the island of Tasmania, where more than half of the population live outside the capital city of Brisbane.",
      "\"We talk about Queensland always being two elections, one in the south-east corner, and then the rest - and they often get very different patterns.\"",
      "There's also more political fragmentation in the state, Dr Mols says, which combined with Australia's preferential voting system can make political equations here tighter, and trends harder to predict.",
      "But he \u2013 like many of the voters the BBC spoke to \u2013 largely puts last weekend's surprise for the Coalition down to Dutton and his broadly-criticised campaign performance.",
      "While there's a tendency to attribute success or failure to policy issues, more often its really about voters' emotional response to candidates and leaders, Dr Mols says.",
      "\"If you do the barbecue test, is Dutton a person you would walk up to? Is he somebody you would warm to or gravitate towards?",
      "\"You can wonder: was Peter Dutton, in hindsight, the Labor Party's best asset?\"",
      "But Dutton may have had the opposite effect for the Greens Party, which has lost at least two of the three seats it gained in Brisbane in 2022. Their party leader, Adam Bandt, also appears to have been defeated in Melbourne, an electorate he'd held for 15 years.",
      "\"Perhaps in desperation, [Dutton] was gravitating towards culture war issues, sort of echoing Trumpian themes, if you like, and that has been punished,\" Dr Mols says. \"But also the Greens\u2026 who were perhaps seen as being at the other end of that shouting match, have not done well.\"",
      "Dr Mols also believes that desperation to keep Dutton out may have seen some former Greens voters prioritise Labor this time - though he points out more centrist Teal independents appear to have bucked that trend.",
      "In any case, he doesn't see the result in Queensland as a groundswell of love for Labor. The state was still the only jurisdiction in Australia where there were more first preference votes for the Coalition than Labor.",
      "\"There has to be enough of a swing towards a party, but it's often that preferencing that actually tilts it over the line,\" he says.",
      "\"This is more of a Liberal loss.\"",
      "For many Coalition voters, that loss is deeply felt. Rick describes it as a \"real rout\".",
      "But among others, like Aleysha, there is an inexplicable element of mirth.",
      "\"I think it's quite funny, that he slipped as much as he did,\" she says. \"And I can't tell you why.\"",

    "summary": "Pope Francis's efforts to shake up the workings of the Church should be built on by the next pope, according to some - but his critics are less convinced",
    "story": [
      "The Vatican's Santa Marta guesthouse has 128 rooms. From 7 May, it will be filled with cardinals participating in the conclave to elect the next Pope. But one room in the guesthouse is still sealed with a red ribbon, as it has been since its occupant died there on Easter Monday.",
      "That suite will only be reopened when the new pope is chosen. The ribbon remains a tangible reminder of the man whose shoes the cardinals are looking to fill \u2013 but Pope Francis' presence looms large over this conclave in many profound ways.",
      "He spent 12 years in the role and appointed around 80% of the cardinals who will select his successor. He also looked to radically shake up the workings of the Catholic Church, moving its centre of gravity away from its hierarchy at the Vatican in the direction of the rank-and-file faithful all over the world, and focused on the poor and marginalised.",
      "My conversations with cardinals and those assessing the needs of the Church in the days leading to this papal election almost always end up looking at what is required through the prism of what Pope Francis did in the role.",
      "While in recent days there appears to have been a growing coalescence around the idea that Francis' work should be built on, some of his critics remain far from convinced. So might there be enough of them to sway the vote as the Church attempts to reconcile the different outlooks and realities it faces around the globe?",
      "A most diverse conclave",
      "During the two weeks that followed the Pope's death, the cardinals met almost daily at the Vatican for pre-conclave gatherings known as general congregations.",
      "While the conclave in the Sistine Chapel is limited to cardinals who haven't yet reached the age of 80 (133 will participate in this one), these preliminary meetings are open to all 252 cardinals. Each attendee was given up to five minutes to air their views, though we know that some took longer.",
      "It was during such a meeting ahead of the last conclave of 2013, in a speech lasting less than four minutes, that Pope Francis - then known as Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina - made an impact, talking of a need to connect with those in the far reaches of the Catholic world.",
      "As Pope, he made a conscious drive to appoint cardinals from such places. It is why this is the most diverse conclave there has ever been. For the first time Cape Verde, Haiti, South Sudan, Tonga, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea and Rwanda will be represented.",
      "That diversity has already made its mark: the pre-conclave meetings are said to have brought to the fore just how different the needs of the Church appear to be depending on where in the world they are viewed.",
      "In Europe, for example, a primary consideration for some might be finding ways to reinvigorate and make relevant the mission of the Church in the face of shrinking congregations, whereas elsewhere - in African or Asian countries - concerns may revolve around social issues, poverty and conflict resolution.",
      "A prospective pope is likely to be one who has at least shown recognition of those very different realities.",
      "Spiritual leader, statesman, global influencer",
      "The official titles that the new pope will inherit gives a sense of the breadth of the role: Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Sovereign of the State of Vatican City among them.",
      "While some relate to the deeply spiritual, the last of those titles suggests the need for a statesman too, given that the pope is leader of a country, albeit the world's smallest.",
      "\"Unlike your average state, the agenda of the Vatican is driven to an extent by where the pope reigning at the time puts their emphasis,\" says Chris Trott, British ambassador to the Holy See. \"On the face of it a very tiny state, [but it is] one that punches many, many times above its weight.",
      "\"And Pope Francis had 50 million followers on Twitter, so [it is] a very, very small state and an incredible global influencer.\"",
      "Pope Francis chose to amplify this part of the role, becoming a powerful global spokesman on behalf of those on the margins, including the poor and victims of war.",
      "He also tried to play the role of peacemaker, though not everyone thought he was successful in that regard, in relation to China and Russia in particular.",
      "According to Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the most senior Catholic figure in England and Wales, this expansion of the role is one reason so many even outside the faith are invested in the outcome of the conclave.",
      "\"There is a sense that the Pope in the person of Pope Francis became a figure who addressed everybody in the world\u2026 religious people and even those who do not have a religious affiliation,\" he says.",
      "\"I'm more and more aware that it's not just Catholics who are interested in this.\"",
      "Confusion around Pope Francis' vision",
      "For many voting cardinals, it is primarily issues within the Catholic Church that are under the spotlight, which brings about the question of the type of pope they want as a manager, and someone who runs the Church's administrative body and its ministries.",
      "While Pope Francis worked on improving the way the Church deals with the huge issues of sexual abuse and of financial corruption, it is his successor who will have to ensure that reforms are evenly applied across the Catholic world.",
      "Even supporters of Pope Francis' efforts to make changes to the way the Church relates to its rank-and-file believers, and the way he built bridges with those outside the faith, were sometimes left confused about how exactly he envisioned things should work.",
      "Pope Francis changed the tone on social issues through comments he made, talking openly about subjects ranging from climate change to financial transparency within the Vatican. But throughout his papacy, some were unclear about what he meant or how it would be applied.",
      "One mission he had was to take some of the power and decision-making away from the Vatican hierarchy and into the hands of rank-and-file Catholics.",
      "Over nearly four years, at great effort, he commissioned what was, in effect, a poll of many of the world's Catholics to find out what mattered to them. Lay people were invited to participate in the most recent bishop's conference where the results of the survey were discussed.",
      "The biggest issues raised related to greater roles for women in the running of the church and welcoming LGBT+ Catholics. But the meeting ended in some confusion, with little in the form of tangible steps forward and little clarity as to how lay people will help steer the future direction of the Church.",
      "So, there is a general keenness for greater clarity from the new pope.",
      "An ugly divide: supporters and detractors",
      "Throughout his pontificate, some vocal traditionalists opposed what they saw as Pope Francis straying from Church teaching and long-standing tradition.",
      "In the pre-conclave meetings of cardinals, a number of those over the age of 80 (who because of their age would not be involved in voting) took the opportunity to play their part.",
      "Most contributions remained secret, but one that was reported was that of 83-year-old Italian cardinal, Beniamino Stella. He criticised Pope Francis for \"imposing his own ideas\" by attempting to move Church governance away from the clergy.",
      "And yet during the homily, or religious speech, at Pope Francis' funeral, what appeared to resonate with the public in attendance \u2013 judging by the volume of the applause \u2013 was talk of the themes Francis chose to champion: the dignity of migrants, an end to war, and the environment.",
      "This applause would have been heard loud and clear by the rows of cardinals.",
      "In some senses, Pope Francis did have clarity in focusing on the Church being relevant to people in their daily lives and, indeed, their struggles. He was clear about connecting with the world outside the faith too.",
      "\"There is a sense that in the voice of the pope, there's a voice of something that is needed,\" says Cardinal Nichols. \"For some people it's a moral compass, for some people it's the sense of being accepted, for some people it's the insistence that we must look at things from the point of view of the poorest.",
      "\"That's a voice that has fallen silent and our task is to find someone who can carry that forward.\"",
      "From the death of Pope Francis to the moment cardinals checked into the Santa Marta guesthouse and its overflow residences, there appeared to be a trend towards a desire for continuity of what Pope Francis had achieved.",
      "Though perhaps that vision of continuity is one that could bring along more of his sceptics, in a way that was pragmatic. The word \"unity\" has been talked of a lot, after a period where the divides between supporters and detractors of the Pope's vision could sometimes become ugly.",
      "But in the end, when they step into the Sistine Chapel, the holiest of voting chambers, for all the pragmatism they may have taken into consideration before they cast their ballot, they will be urged to let God and the Holy Spirit guide them.",

    "story": [
      "In an exclusive and remarkably candid interview - the first since he left office - Joe Biden discusses what he really thinks of his successor's first 100 days, plus his fears for the future if the Atlantic Alliance collapses",
      "It is hard to believe that the man I greet in the Delaware hotel where he launched his political career more than half a century ago was the \"leader of the free world\" little over 100 days ago.",
      "Joe Biden is still surrounded by all the trappings of power \u2013 the black SUVs, the security guys with curly earpieces, the sniffer dogs sent ahead to sweep the room for explosives. And yet he has spent the last three months watching much of what he believes in being swept away by his successor.",
      "Donald Trump has deployed the name Biden again and again - it is his political weapon of choice. One recent analysis showed that Trump said or wrote the name Biden at least 580 times in those first 100 days in office. Having claimed that rises in share prices were \"Trump's stock market\" at work, he later blamed sharp falls in share prices on \"Biden's stock market\".",
      "Until this week, President Biden himself (former presidents keep their titles after they leave office) has largely observed the convention that former presidents do not criticise their successors at the start of their time in office. But from the moment we shake hands it is clear that he is determined to have his say too.",
      "In a dark blue suit, the former president arrives smiling and relaxed but with the determined air of a man on a mission. It's his first interview since leaving the White House, and he seems most angry about Donald Trump's treatment of America's allies - in particular Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky.",

      "Five key takeaways from the interview",
      "Political Thinking with Nick Robinson: Listen to the full interview on BBC Sounds, or watch on BBC iPlayer or on YouTube",
      "\"I found it beneath America, the way that took place,\" he says of the explosive Oval Office row between Trump and Zelensky in February. \"And the way we talk about now that, 'it's the Gulf of America', 'maybe we're going to have to take back Panama', 'maybe we need to acquire Greenland, 'maybe Canada should be a [51st state].' What the hell's going on here?",
      "\"What President ever talks like that? That's not who we are. We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity - not about confiscation.\"",
      "After just over 100 action-packed days of Trump there was no shortage of targets for President Biden to choose from.",
      "But his main concern appears to be on the international stage, rather than the domestic one: that is, the threat he believes now faces the alliance between the United States and Europe which, as he puts it, secured peace, freedom and democracy for eight decades.",
      "\"Grave concerns\" about the Atlantic Alliance",
      "Just before our interview, which took place days before the 80th anniversary of VE Day, Biden took a large gold coin out of his pocket and pressed it into my hand. It was a souvenir of last year's D-Day commemoration. Biden believes that the speech he delivered on that beach in Normandy is one of his most important. In it, he declared that the men who fought and died \"knew \u2013 beyond any doubt \u2013 that there are things worth fighting and dying for\".",
      "I ask him whether he feels that message about sacrifice is in danger of being forgotten in America. Not by the people, he replies but, yes, by the leadership. It is, he says, a \"grave concern\" that the Atlantic Alliance is seen to be dying.",
      "\"I think it would change the modern history of the world if that occurs,\" he argues.",
      "\"We're the only nation in a position to have the capacity to bring people together, [to] lead the world. Otherwise you're going to have China and the former Soviet Union, Russia, stepping up.\"",
      "Now more than ever before that Alliance is being questioned. One leading former NATO figure told the BBC this week that the VE Day celebrations felt more like a funeral. President Trump has complained that the United States is being \"ripped off\" by her allies, Vice President JD Vance has said that  America is \"bailing out\" Europe whilst Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has insisted that Europe is \"free-loading\".",
      "Biden calls the pledge all members of Nato - the Atlantic Alliance - make \"to defend each and every inch of Nato territory with the full force of our collective power\" a \"sacred obligation\".",
      "\"I fear that our allies around the world are going to begin to doubt whether we're going to stay where we've always been for the last 80 years,\" Biden says.",
      "Under his presidency, both Finland and Sweden joined Nato - something he thinks made the alliance stronger.  \"We did all that - and in four years we've got a guy who wants to walk away from it all.",
      "\"I'm worried that Europe is going to lose confidence in the certainty of America, and the leadership of America in the world, to deal with not only Nato, but other matters that are of consequence.\"",
      "Biden, the \"addled old man\"?",
      "I meet President Biden in the place he has called home since he was a boy, the city of Wilmington in Delaware. It is an hour and a half Amtrak train ride from Washington DC, a journey he has been making for 50 years since becoming a Senator at the age of just 30. He has spent more years in government than any other president.",
      "He was 82 when he left the Oval Office. His age has invited no end of scrutiny - an \"at times addled old man\" is how the journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson describe him in their book, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.",
      "His calamitous live TV debate performance last June prompted further questions, as Biden stumbled over his words, lost his thread mid-sentence and boasted, somewhat bafflingly, that \"We finally beat Medicare!\". He withdrew from the election campaign soon after.",
      "Today, Biden is still warm and charismatic, with the folksy charm that made him an election winner but he is a much slower, quieter and more hesitant version of the leader he was once. Meeting with him in person, I found it hard to imagine he could have served for another four years in the White House, taking him closer to the age of 90.",
      "I ask Biden if he's now had to think again about his decisions last year. He pulled out of the presidential race just 107 days before election day, leaving Kamala Harris limited time to put together her own campaign.",
      "\"I don't think it would have mattered,\" he says. \"We left at a time when we had a good candidate, she was fully funded.",
      "\"What we had set out to do, no-one thought we could do,\" he continues. \"And we had become so successful in our agenda, it was hard to say, 'No, I'm going to stop now'... It was a hard decision.\"",
      "One he regrets? Surely withdrawing earlier could have given someone else a greater chance?",
      "\"No, I think it was the right decision.\" He pauses. \"I think that\u2026 Well, it was just a difficult decision.\"",
      "Trump is \"not behaving like a Republican president\"",
      "Biden says he went into politics to fight injustice and to this day has lost none of his appetite for the fight. Last year at the D-Day celebrations he warned: \"We're living in a time when democracy is more at risk across the world than at any point since the end of World War Two.\"",
      "Today, he expands on this: \"Look at the number of European leaders and European countries that are wondering, Well what do I do now? What's the best route for me to take? Can I rely on the United States? Are they going to be there?\"",
      "\"Instead of democracy expanding around the world, [it's] receding. Democracy - every generation has to fight for it.\"",
      "Speaking in Chicago recently, Biden declared that \"nobody's king\" in America. I asked him if he thinks President Trump is behaving more like a monarch than a constitutionally limited president.",
      "He chooses his reply carefully. \"He's not behaving like a Republican president,\" he says.",
      "Though later in our interview, Biden admits he's less worried about the future of US democracy than he used to be, \"because I think the Republican Party is waking up to what Trump is about\".",
      "\"Anybody who thinks Putin's going to stop is foolish\"",
      "President Biden relished his role as the leading figure in Nato, deploying normally top secret intelligence to tell a sceptical world back in 2022 that Vladimir Putin was about to launch a full scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Since taking office President Trump has charted a different course, telling Ukraine that it must consider giving up territory to Russia if it wants the war to end.",
      "\"It is modern day appeasement,\" Biden says of Trump's approach.",
      "Putin, he says, sees Ukraine as \"part of Mother Russia. He believes he has historical rights to Ukraine... He can't stand the fact that [\u2026] the Soviet Union has collapsed. And anybody who thinks he's going to stop is just foolish.\"",
      "He fears that Trump's approach might signal to other European countries that it's time to give in to Russia.",
      "Yet Biden has faced accusations against him concerning the Ukraine War. Some in Kyiv and her allies, as well as some in the UK, claim that he gave President Zelensky just enough support to resist invasion but not enough to defeat Russia, perhaps out of fear that Putin would consider using nuclear weapons if cornered.",
      "When Putin was asked point blank on TV this week whether he would use nuclear weapons to win the war, he declared that he hoped that they would \"not be necessary,\" adding that he had the means to bring the war to what he called his \"logical conclusion\".",
      "I point out to Biden that it has been argued that he didn't have the courage to go all the way to give Ukraine the weapons it needed - to let Ukraine win.",
      "\"We gave them [Ukraine] everything they needed to provide for their independence,\" Biden argues. \"And we were prepared to respond more aggressively if in fact Putin moved again.\"",
      "He says he was keen to avoid the prospect of \"World War Three, with nuclear powers,\" adding: \"And we did avoid it.",
      "\"What would Putin do if things got really tough for him?\" he continues. \"Threaten the use of tactical nuclear weapons. This is not a game or roulette.\"",
      "Americans used to be steadfast in their support for Israel. Those days are gone",
      "Sir John Curtice: The map that shows Reform's triumph was much more than a protest vote",
      "What Trump really wants from Canada",
      "Biden's belief in the Atlantic Alliance - as the last living President born during World War Two - is clearly undiminished.",
      "When he first arrived in the Oval Office, Biden hung a portrait of America's wartime leader Franklin D. Roosevelt on the wall. He was born two and a half years before the defeat of the Nazis, into the world FDR helped to create - a world of American global leadership and solidarity. But the United States voted to reject Biden's policies and values and instead to endorse Donald Trump's call to put America First.",
      "The world is changing from what people like Joe Biden have taken for granted.",
      "\"Every generation has to fight to maintain democracy, every one,\" Biden says. \"Every one's going to be challenged.",
      "\"We've done it well for the last 80 years. And I'm worried there's the loss of understanding of the consequences of that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.",
      "The Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named \"Operation Sindoor\" - were part of a \"commitment\" to hold \"accountable\" those responsible for the 22 April attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead.",
      "But Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in that attack, described the strikes as \"unprovoked\", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the \"heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished\".",
      "Sharif on Wednesday said the Pahalgam attack \"wasn't related\" to Pakistan, and that his country was \"accused for the wrong\" reasons.",

      "Follow the latest updates",
      "Why India and Pakistan fight over Kashmir",
      "BBC reports from Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir",
      "Pakistan's military said at least 31 people were killed and 57 injured in the strikes on Tuesday night. India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.",
      "Pakistan's military says it shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims.",
      "Late on Wednesday, Sharif said the air force made its defence - which was a \"reply from our side to them\".",
      "Where did India hit?",
      "Delhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.",
      "It said these sites were \"terrorist infrastructure\" - places where attacks were \"planned and directed\".",
      "It emphasised that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities, saying its \"actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature\".",
      "In the initial aftermath of the attacks, Pakistan said three different areas were hit: Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Bahawalpur in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, later said six locations had been hit.",
      "Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told GeoTV in the early hours of Wednesday that the strikes hit civilian areas, adding that India's claim of \"targeting terrorist camps\" was false.",
      "Why did India launch the attack?",
      "The strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours over the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam.",
      "The 22 April attack by a group of militants saw 26 people killed, with survivors saying the militants were singling out Hindu men.",
      "It was the worst attack on civilians in the region in two decades, and the first major attack on civilians since India revoked Article 370, which gave Kashmir semi-autonomous status, in 2019.",
      "Following the decision, the region saw protests but also witnessed militancy wane and a huge increase in the number of tourists.",
      "The killings have sparked widespread anger in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the country would hunt the suspects \"till the ends of the Earth\" and that those who planned and carried it out \"will be punished beyond their imagination\".",
      "However, India initially did not name any group it believed was behind the attack in Pahalgam.",
      "But Indian police alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.",
      "On 7 May, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group carried out the attack.",
      "In the two weeks since, both sides had taken tit-for-tat measures against each other - including expelling diplomats, suspending visas and closing border crossings.",
      "But many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.",
      "Why is Kashmir a flashpoint between India and Pakistan?",
      "Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.",
      "The countries have fought two wars over it.",
      "But more recently, it has been attacks by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.",
      "In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.",
      "In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.",
      "Neither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. Attempts have been made by various nations and diplomats around the world to prevent this.",
      "UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres quickly called for \"maximum restraint\" - a sentiment echoed by the European Union and numerous countries, including Bangladesh.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged \"dialogue\" and \"de-escalation\".",
      "US President Donald Trump - who was one of the first to respond - told reporters at the White House that he hoped the fighting \"ends very quickly\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, said he was keeping a close eye on developments."

      "Once on the island they tear down a swastika and replace it with the hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union. Victory.",
      "A large crowd is watching from the safety of the shore. What they're witnessing is an historical re-enactment of one of the final battles for Berlin in 1945. It led to the capitulation of Nazi Germany and what Moscow still refers to as The Great Victory.",
      "The battle for Berlin, unfolding in front of me in the town of Dubna, is one of many events in Russia for the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in World War Two.",
      "The anniversary is receiving enormous attention in a country where the national idea is built very much around the notion of Russia as victor and victim.",
      "\"I'm here because my grandfather fought in this war,\" one of the spectators, Katya, tells me.",

      "'I'm my own tsar,' he told me. 'Go fight, then, if you're a tsar,' I replied. He and his friend went together. His friend was killed.\"",
      "Katya's family history is a story of different generations fighting on the front line.",
      "But in very different circumstances.",
      "In 1941, Hitler's Germany invaded the Soviet Union to try to conquer the world's largest country and secure world domination. Soviet soldiers (Katya's grandfather among them) fought to liberate their country from the Nazis. Victory for Moscow came at an enormous human cost: more than 27 million Soviet citizens were killed in what is known here as the Great Fatherland or Great Patriotic War.",
      "But in 2022 it was Russia that launched a large-scale invasion - of its neighbour. What the Kremlin still calls a \"special military operation\" was widely seen as an attempt to force Ukraine back into Russia's geo-political orbit. In March 2022, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution condemning Russia's \"aggression.\"",
      "And yet the Russian authorities portray the war in Ukraine as a continuation of World War Two. The official narrative here creates a parallel reality, in which Russia once again is fighting Nazism and fascism, in Ukraine and across Europe. Russia, the country which invaded Ukraine, presents itself as the victim of external aggression.",
      "\"Historically and sociologically, victory in the Great Patriotic War was always a cornerstone of Russian united consciousness,\" Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov explains, \"because there is no glue for the nation: only this event. It was always so, from Brezhnev's time until now.",
      "\"But what's happening now is something special. Now the Great Patriotic War is presented as just the first step in our permanent war with the West, against 'Eurofascism.' The Special Military Operation as the continuation of the Great Patriotic War: this is something new.\"",
      "In Russia, television plays a key role in spreading the official message that Europe couldn't be trusted then and cannot be trusted now. Recently, on Russian TV, I saw a documentary entitled \"Europe Against Russia. Hitler's Crusaders\". It was about how European countries had collaborated with the Nazis during World War Two.",
      "No mention of the 1939 non-aggression pact between Hitler and Stalin: under its secret protocol Germany and the USSR had carved up spheres of influence in eastern Europe.",
      "Last month a Russian TV presenter launched a tirade against German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a staunch supporter of military support to Ukraine. The talk show host called Germany's leader \"a Nazi scumbag\" for comments about Russia. Addressing the Chancellor directly, the anchor said that Russians \"hold you and your comrades responsible for the killing of 27 million Soviet citizens.\"",

    "summary": "A new people-smuggling route opens up crossing a lake into Kenya, but it is proving deadly for some Eritreans.",
    "story": [
      "As the sun set over Lake Turkana, a mother sobbed and threw flowers into the greenish-blue water to remember her teenage daughter who had drowned trying to reach Kenya via a new route being used by people smugglers.",
      "Senait Mebrehtu, a Pentecostal Christian Eritrean who had sought asylum in Kenya three years ago, made the pilgrimage to north-western Kenya to see for herself where 14-year-old Hiyab had lost her life last year.",
      "The girl had been travelling with her sister, who survived the late-night crossing over the vast lake, where winds can be powerful.",
      "\"If the smugglers told me there was such a big and dangerous lake in Kenya, I wouldn't have let my daughters come this far,\" Ms Senait told the BBC as she sat on the western shoreline.",
      "Ms Senait had arrived by plane in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, on a tourist visa with her two younger children, fleeing religious persecution. But she was not allowed to travel with her two other daughters at the time as they were older and nearer the age of conscription.",
      "Eritrea is a highly militarised, one-party country - and often national service can go on for years and can include forced labour.",
      "The teenagers begged to join her in Kenya, so she consulted relatives who told her they would pay smugglers to get the girls out of Eritrea.",
      "The fate of the two girls was put into the hands of traffickers who took them on a weeks-long trip by road and foot from Eritrea into neighbouring Ethiopia - then to the south into Kenya to the north-eastern shores of Lake Turkana, the world's largest permanent desert lake.",
      "A female smuggler in Kenya confirmed to the BBC that Lake Turkana was increasingly being used as an illegal crossing for the migrants.",
      "\"We call it the digital route because it is very new,\" she said.",
      "The trafficker, who earns around $1,500 (\u00a31,130) for each migrant she traffics into or through Kenya (four times the average monthly salary of a Kenyan worker), spoke to us about her work at a secret location and on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the last 15 years she has been part of a huge smuggling network that operates across Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and South Africa - mainly moving those fleeing Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia.",
      "With Kenya having stepped up patrols on its roads, smugglers are now turning to Lake Turkana to get migrants into the country.",
      "\"Agents\" on the new route, she said, received the migrants in the Kenyan fishing village of Lomekwi where road transport was organised to take them to Nairobi - a journey of about 15 hours.",
      "Warning of the dangers of travelling on the rickety wooden boats, she appealed to parents not to allow their children to make the crossing alone.",
      "\"I won't say I love the money I make - because as a mother I can't be happy when I see bad things happening to other women's children,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"I'd like to advise migrants if they'll listen to me. I'd like to beg them to stay in their countries,\" she said, further cautioning of the callous attitudes of many traffickers.",
      "Osman, an Eritrean migrant who did not want to give his real name for security reasons, made the crossing at the same time as Hiyab and her sister.",
      "He recalled how Hiyab's boat capsized in front of his eyes not long after leaving the fishing village of Ileret as it was heading south-west to Lomekwi.",
      "\"Hiyab was in the boat in front of us - its motor wasn't working and it was being propelled by a strong wind,\" he said.",
      "\"They were about 300m [984ft] into the water when their boat overturned, resulting in the deaths of seven people.\"",
      "Hiyab's sister survived by clinging to the sinking boat until another vessel - also operated by the smugglers - came to the rescue.",
      "Ms Senait blamed the smugglers for the deaths, saying they overloaded the boat with more than 20 migrants.",
      "\"The cause of deaths was plain negligence. They put too many people in a small boat that couldn't even carry five people,\" she said.",
      "During the BBC's visit to Lomewki, two fishermen said they saw the bodies of migrants - believed to be Eritreans - floating in the lake, which is around 300km (186 miles) long and 50km wide, in July 2024.",
      "\"There were about four bodies on the shores. Then, a few days later other bodies appeared,\" Brighton Lokaala said.",
      "Another fisherman, Joseph Lomuria, said he saw the bodies of two men and two women - one of whom appeared to be a teenager.",
      "In June 2024, the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, recorded 345,000 Eritrean refugees and asylum seekers in East Africa, out of 580,000 globally.",
      "Like Ms Senait's family, many flee to avoid military conscription in a country that has been embroiled in numerous wars in the region, and where free political and religious activity is not tolerated as the government tries to keep a tight grip on power.",
      "Uganda-based Eritrean lawyer, Mula Berhan, told the BBC that Kenya and Uganda were increasingly becoming the preferred destination of these migrants because of conflict in Ethiopia and Sudan, which both neighbour Eritrea.",
      "The female smuggler said in her experience some of the migrants settled in Kenya, but others used the country as a transit point to reach Uganda, Rwanda and South Africa, believing it easier to get refugee status there.",
      "The smuggling network operates in all these countries, handing over migrants to different \"agents\" until they reach their final destination, which - in some cases - can also be Europe or North America.",
      "Her job is to hand over those migrants who are in transit in Nairobi to agents who keep them in \"holding houses\" until the next leg of their trip is arranged and paid for.",
      "By this stage each migrant has probably paid around $5,000 for the journey up to that point.",
      "The BBC saw a room in a block of flats that was being used as a holding house. Five Eritrean men were locked inside the room, which had just a single mattress.",
      "In the holding houses, migrants are expected to pay rent and also pay for their food - and the smuggler said she knew of three men and a young woman who had died of hunger as they had run out of cash.",
      "She said the agents simply disposed of the bodies and called their deaths bad luck.",
      "\"Smugglers keep lying to the families saying their people are alive, and they keep on sending money,\" she acknowledged.",
      "Female migrants, she said, were often sexually abused or forced to get married to male smugglers.",
      "She said she herself had no intention of giving up the lucrative trade but felt others should be aware of what could lie ahead of them.",
      "It is little comfort for Ms Senait, who still mourns the death of her 14-year-old while expressing relief that her elder daughter survived and was unharmed by the smugglers.",
      "\"We have gone through what every Eritrean family is going through,\" she said.",
      "\"May God heal our land and deliver us from all this.\"",

    "summary": "The secretive process will get underway at the Vatican to find a new leader of the Catholic Church.",
    "story": [
      "On Wednesday evening, under the domed ceiling of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, 133 cardinals will vote to elect the Catholic Church's 267th pope.",
      "The day will begin at 10:00 (09:00 BST) with a mass in St Peter's Basilica. The service, which will be televised, will be presided over by Giovanni Battista Re, the 91-year-old Cardinal Dean who was also the celebrant of Pope Francis' funeral.",
      "In the early afternoon, mobile signal within the territory of the Vatican will be deactivated to prevent anyone taking part in the conclave from contacting the outside world.",
      "Around 16:15 (15:15 BST), the 133 cardinal electors will gather in the Pauline Chapel and form a procession to the Sistine Chapel.",
      "All the while they will be singing a litany and the hymn Veni Creator - an invocation to the Holy Spirit, which is seen as the guiding hand that will help cardinals choose the new Pope.",
      "Once in the Sistine Chapel, one hand resting on a copy of the Gospel, the cardinals will pronounce the prescribed oath of secrecy which precludes them from ever sharing details about how the new Pope was elected.",

      "How the Vatican keeps its pap vote secret",
      "When the last of the electors has taken the oath, a meditation will be held. Then, the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations Diego Ravelli will announce \"extra omnes\" (\"everybody out\").",
      "He is one of three ecclesiastical staff allowed to stay in the Sistine Chapel despite not being a cardinal elector, even though they will have to leave the premises during the counting of the votes.",
      "The moment \"extra omnes\" is pronounced marks the start of the cardinals' isolation \u2013 and the start of the conclave.",
      "The word, which comes from the Latin for \"cum clave\", or \"locked with key\" is slightly misleading, as the cardinals are no longer locked inside; rather, on Tuesday Vatican officials closed the entrances to the Apostolic Palace \u2013 which includes the Sistine Chapel- with lead seals which will remain until the end of the proceedings. Swiss guards will also flank all the entrances to the chapel.",
      "Diego Ravelli will distribute ballot papers, and the cardinals will proceed to the first vote soon after.",
      "While nothing forbids the Pope from being elected with the first vote, it has not happened in centuries. Still, that first ballot is very important, says Austen Ivereigh, a Catholic writer and commentator.",
      "\"The cardinals who have more than 20 votes will be taken into consideration. In the first ballot the votes will be very scattered and the electors know they have to concentrate on the ones that have numbers,\" says Ivereigh.",
      "He adds that every other ballot thereafter will indicate which of the cardinals have the momentum. \"It's almost like a political campaign\u2026 but it's not really a competition; it's an effort by the body to find consensus.\"",
      "If the vote doesn't yield the two-third majority needed to elect the new pope, the cardinals go back to guesthouse Casa Santa Marta for dinner. It is then, on the sidelines of the voting process, that important conversations among the cardinals take place and consensus begins to coalesce around different names.",
      "According to Italian media, the menu options consist of light dishes which are usually served to guests of the residence, and includes wine \u2013 but no spirits. The waiters and kitchen staff are also sworn to secrecy and cannot leave the grounds for the duration of the conclave.",
      "From Thursday morning, cardinals will be taking breakfast between 06:30 (05:30 BST) and 07:30 (06:30 BST) ahead of mass at 08:15 (07:15 BST). Two votes then take place in the morning, followed by lunch and rest. In his memoirs, Pope Francis said that was when he began to receive signals from the other cardinals that serious consensus was beginning to form around him; he was elected during the first afternoon vote. The last two conclaves have all concluded by the end of the second day.",
      "There is no way of knowing at this stage whether this will be a long or a short conclave \u2013 but cardinals are aware that dragging the proceedings on could be interpreted as a sign of gaping disagreements.",
      "As they discuss, pray and vote, outside the boarded-up windows of the Sistine Chapel thousands of faithful will be looking up to the chimney to the right of St Peter's Basilica, waiting for the white plume of smoke to signal that the next pope has been elected.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial in New York City this month. Jury selection began Monday, and opening statements are scheduled to follow on May 12.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs will be tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"Freak Offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"Freak Off.\" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",

      "It was Harris' first time at the benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. In an interview with Vogue published ahead of the blue carpet event, Harris emphasized the importance of art and how it intertwines with politics.",
      "\"Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,\" Harris told Vogue. \"Artistic expression \u2014 whether it's dance, music, visual arts or fashion \u2014 has a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go.\"",

And in 1977, Ronald Reagan attended the Met Gala between his terms as governor of California and president of the United States.",
      "Harris may be eyeing a political return of her own.",
      "Speaking in San Francisco last week, in her first major public remarks since her 2024 presidential defeat, Harris blasted President Trump's economic agenda, including his tariffs. She also suggested she's been having conversations about her future, as California prepares to elect its next governor in 2026 and Democrats search for a presidential candidate to run in 2028.",
      "\"Everybody is asking me, 'Well, what've you been thinking about these days,'\" she said.",

Both co-chaired the event with Wintour, who wore a Loewe custom floor-length jacket adorned in feathers that formed tulip bouquets. But Zendaya, another gala co-chair, stole the night by walking the carpet twice. She first wore Maison Margiela Artisanal by John Galliano before changing quickly and closing out the most public part of the night, the strut into the event at the steps of the Met, in a 1996 black gown from John Galliano's Givenchy era, which she paired with a flower bouquet Alexander McQueen head piece designed by Philip Treacy.",

      "The Met Gala honored the late designer Karl Lagerfeld in 2023 with a night of references to his style and his immense influence in the fashion world. Some wore Lagerfeld's designs for Chanel, Fendi, Balmain and Chlo\u00e9, while others twisted his unique way of dressing, which combined black, white and leather for his daily wear, and later in life inspired the creative behind his eponymous label. There were also plenty of cat odes at the gala, a tribute to Lagerfeld's beloved feline friend Choupette,",
      "2022 Met Gala theme: \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\"",
      "The second installment of a two-part exhibition on fashion in the United States, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\" celebrated two centuries of American identity through fashion's eyes. \"Gilded Glamour\" graced the gala's red carpet and American history references were prevalent.",
      "The most recognized garment belonged to Marilyn Monroe. The nude, form-fitting number shined on the style icon while she serenaded then-president John F. Kennedy for his birthday in 1962. Kim Kardashian wore the dress after entering a deal with the Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum to bring the garment out of its display. The uproar was immediate, as some alleged possible damage to the dress. Ripley's was forced to respond\u00a0denying the heated claims.",
      "2021 Met Gala theme: \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\"",
      "The first of two parts, \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\" wove together identities of the ever-changing U.S. through time, exploring the emotions behind the country's evolving culture.

      "2019 Met Gala theme: \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\"",
      "Guests brought their imagination to the pink carpet for the 2019 \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" gala rendition. Gender-bending was evident\u00a0and many looks turned heads, like Jared Leto's interpretation of Alessandro Michele's world of Gucci. Lady Gaga's iconic Brandon Maxwell looks told a story of style with each step the singer took outside of the Met. Framed around Susan Sontag's 1964 essay \"Notes on 'Camp,'\" the gala brought to life the whimsical and effervescent nature of fashion.",
      "2018 Met Gala theme: \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\"",
      "The 2018 Met Gala theme drew inspiration from Catholicism. \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" explored religious iconography and the influence of medieval art in fashion. Guests brought to life looks that referenced papal garments and displayed biblical artifacts like crosses, angel wings and halos. The theme's ties to the history of Christ were not well received by some critics who thought fashion should stay out of the church.",
      "2017 Met Gala theme: \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art of the In-Between\"",
      "The 2017 event paid tribute to Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo and her Comme des Gar\u00e7ons avant-garde designs that play with the body's shape and form. Duality, a motif for the exhibit, highlighted almost four decades of her work. Guests brought to the event pops of red from Kawakubo's palette, intricate embellishments and sheer fabrics.

      "2016 Met Gala theme: \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\"",
      "The influence of technology in fashion turned the 2016 Met Gala into a spectacular display of metallics and cutting-edge designs.

CBS News spent the day with supermodel and entrepreneur Karlie Kloss, who wore a sleek white Brandon Maxwell number that referenced classic men's tailoring paired with Ala\u00efa-esque angular cuts.",
      "2015 Met Gala theme \"China: Through the Looking Glass\"",
      "While the 2015 Met exhibit scoped a wide history of artifacts and influence from Asian art, the gala came down to just one word: Rihanna. Dawning a sunny yellow cape that cascaded down the steps of the Met, the singer and fashion icon elevated the meaning of attending fashion's biggest night. The couture garment designed by China's Guo Pei took two years to make, Rihanna told Vanity Fair. The look quickly comes to mind around the world when the first Monday in May is discussed.",
      "2014 Met Gala theme: \"Charles James: Beyond Fashion\"",
      "The Costume Institute has been celebrating those behind fashion since its inception, and in 1973 it began hosting the gala within the museum itself, Vogue recounts. Fashion authority Diana Vreeland brought to life \"The World of Balenciaga\" after exiting Vogue as editor-in-chief, and her tribute to Spanish designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga left a blueprint for other designer-centered celebrations that followed.",
      "In 2014, couturier Charles James' work went on display at the Met and guests embraced brilliant gowns with his grandiose touch. James' tailored and structural approach to the female form, mixed with modern fabrics, brought elegance and regalia to the occasion.",
      "2013 Met Gala theme: \"Punk: Chaos to Couture\"",
      "Anti-establishment influence inked its way into the Met's\u00a0history in 2013.\u00a0Started in the 1970's, the punk movement gave guests a reason to wear garments embellished with the spirit of teen disobedience and air of grungy D.I.Y. personal style. Madonna honored the era with fishnets, metal studs and silver chains adorning a Givenchy mini plaid blazer by Riccardo Tisci. Rebellion was also apparent in the hairstyles exhibited, most notably by singer Miley Cyrus, a fashion fanatic, whose short, spiked look paired perfectly with her risque fishnet Marc Jacobs gown.",
      "What was the first Met Gala theme?",
      "The Costume Institute started holding benefits in 1948, but it was Vreeland who brought themed galas to the next level as a Met consultant with \"The World of Balenciaga\" in 1973, according to Vogue.",
      "Full list of past Met Gala themes over the years",

The night's theme was \"Sleeping Beauties: Fashion Reawakened,\" and the dress code was \"Garden of Time.\"",
      "The \"Dune\" and \"Euphoria\" star opened the evening in an ocean blue gown by Maison Margiela with fitted a corset and layers of metallic fabric, styled with a feather headpiece and smokey makeup.",
      "Then hours later, she made a surprise return on the red carpet with a second look. She appeared in a never-before-worn Givenchy couture gown from the 1996 collection -- the year she was born -- along with a vintage Alexander McQueen hat adorned with a bouquet of roses.",
      "\"When it comes to the Met carpet, Zendaya is all about keeping us guessing-but one thing is for certain: She will always turn heads. Clearly, she did it again tonight,\" Vogue's Senior Fashion and Style Writer Christian Allaire wrote of her back-to-back looks.",

      "Iman's latest iconic look, 2021 Met Gala",

    "summary": "The actor-playwright received two Tony nominations for the over-the-top comedy about Mary Todd Lincoln and her secret passion of becoming a cabaret star, while her husband, Abe, is trying to win the Civil War.",
    "story": [
      "\"Oh, Mary!\" may be Broadway's most unlikely offering this season, a wildly over-the-top, not-at-all historically accurate look at first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, written by and starring Cole Escola.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"For God's sake, Mary! How would it look for the first lady of the United States to be flitting about a stage right now in the ruins of war?\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"How would it look? Sensational!!\"",
      "It's a broad comedy about Mary's secret passion of becoming a cabaret star. Meanwhile, her husband, Abe, is just wrapping up the Civil War, and is more concerned with keeping the country together.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"No! It's inappropriate! We're at war!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"With who?\"Abraham Lincoln: \"The south!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"Of what?\"",
      "It's not a revival, it has no movie stars (\"Well, speak for yourself, Mo!\"), and it's a smash hit, breaking box office records.",
      "What does that say? \"Inflation is high,\" Escola laughed.",
      "Escola came up with the idea in 2009: \"I sent an email to myself that said, 'What if Abraham Lincoln's assassination wasn't such a bad thing for Mary Todd?' You know, like, Mary's starting over. Like, 'Now I'm single. I can date.' You know?\"",
      "But this fever dream Mary remained just a dream for years. \"I loved this idea so much, I didn't want it to get on paper and for it to disappoint me \u2013 to disappoint me, not just the audience, but, like, me,\" Escola said. \"There are certain ideas that you're just like, 'Oh, I don't wanna plant this seed, because what if it's an ugly flower?'\"",
      "Escola eventually wrote the play. \"Oh, Mary!\" opened to rapturous reviews downtown, quickly moved uptown to Broadway, and just this week earned five Tony nominations, including two for 38-year-old Escola (for best play and best actor).",
      "It's all a long way from rural Oregon, where Escola was raised. The family had little money, with a Vietnam veteran father, Escola says, who suffered from mental illness. \"When I was maybe five years old, my father chased us out of the home with a shotgun. He was having some sort of alcoholic manic break and thought that there were people after him. And so, he chased my mother and my brother and I out of the trailer, and then we moved out and didn't come back.\"",
      "The family moved in with Escola's grandmother. \"Then, her and I shared a bedroom, and I remember that's when she taught me to read. And she was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's so she would repeat stories a lot. But I loved them. I loved her stories. I realize now, when she would tell these stories, we were, like, meeting in the middle of her memory. Like, she was living out the fantasy of her childhood, and I was also living out my fantasy of being a young girl on a farm in Alberta.\"",
      "I asked, \"And you didn't mind that she was repeating the stories?\"",
      "\"No, no,\" Escola replied. \"Because she would remember certain details in a new telling or, like, leave something out, and then I got to be, like, you know, 'And you were wearing a dress, right, Gramma?'\"",
      "\"And is it right that she gave you a Barbie when you were five?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She gave me my first Barbie. just completely took me at face value when I was doing something that wasn't what boys were supposed to do.\"",
      "Her understanding proved prescient. Escola now uses they/them pronouns. Asked to explain, Escola said, \"I have always felt not male, not female. And you know, it's funny, because recently I saw photos of me on Instagram. The comments were like, 'What is that? Like, that's not a man.' 'Well, it sure as hell ain't a woman, either.' And I was like, 'Exactly.' Like, you do get it.\"",
      "Likewise, Escola's comedic identity has never been in doubt.",
      "I asked, \"Comedically, have you always done your own thing?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"So, there was never a time where you thought, 'I need to be more like this person to make people respond to me'?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Escola. \"It would be like trying to speak German when I don't actually know any German. It has to make me laugh in order for it to even have a chance of making someone else laugh.\"",
      "Escola began performing in community theater back in Oregon, and eventually scraped together the money to make it to New York (\"It was New York or bust!\"), at first attending college and living at the 92nd Street Y. It was a short stint of only nine months. \"I had to drop out because they wouldn't let me take out any more loans. I guess I was so poor that they were like, 'You'll never be able to pay this back.'",
      "\"I felt like there was something wrong with me that I couldn't afford to go to school. That's the thing that makes me the most angry about being poor, just this innate sense that it's like a moral failing or an innate thing that's broken in you.\"",
      "Escola eventually did make it back to New York to stay, gaining a fan base with online videos, such as \"Mom Commercial\" (2015):",
      "\u2026 and then on TV, playing a range of deranged, yet delightful characters in shows like \"At Home with Amy Sedaris.\"",
      "And then along came Mary.",
      "I said, \"You don't come to see the show and go, 'Oh, there were layers and layers of development people that were saying, No, you've gotta tweak it for this audience and do this for that audience.'\"",
      "\"No,\" Escola said. \"There is something special about the fact that I wrote this for me and my friends, and for my audience that I've had in downtown venues and stuff. And the fact that it's successful is, I don't know, it makes it that much sweeter. It really does.\"",

    "story": [
      "As an apprentice to a potter, what Alex Matisse discovered shaped him like clay itself.\u00a0 \"When I walked in, I knew that this is what I was going to do,\" he said. \"We were told pots have skin and bones and skeletons and, like, a plate should have the fullness of the moon.\"",
      "Artful descriptions, much the way a painter might define their craft. In fact it was Henri Matisse who once said, \"I don't literally paint that table, but the emotion it produces upon me.\"",
      "When Alex founded East Fork Pottery in Asheville, North Carolina, back in 2009, he took the same view. He saw ceramics as a canvas. It came easily, like it was woven into his DNA \u2013 because it was. Alex is the great-grandson of artist Henri Matisse.",
      "I asked, \"What did you know of your great-grandfather when you were growing up?\"",
      "\"He was everywhere, kind of in the air that we breathed, around the house, on the walls,\" Alex replied.",
      "It was a famous last name he ran away from for years.\u00a0 \"I had a very grumpy relationship with it,\" he laughed. \"It was this kind of shadow thing that followed me around that I wanted to shake.\"",
      "Maybe it was stubbornness, or pride, but Alex was determined to make his own way. He convinced his soon-to-be-wife Connie to help him build a wood kiln on an old tobacco farm.",
      "I asked, \"Did she have the same passion for it that you did?\"",
      "\"No. She didn't have a passion for clay,\" Alex said.",
      "\"But she had a passion for you, so she kept going?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She stuck around,\" he laughed.",
      "And without anyone knowing who he really was, his business boomed. He could barely keep up with the demand. He realized, \"If we're gonna play in this world, something's gotta change. Like, we cannot keep doing it like we did.\"",
      "So, he decided to mechanize, at least partially. The pottery was still his, only he thought better, especially the colors.\u00a0 He was excited. \"And we sent out a postcard of these new pots that look, you know, they were plain, they had colors on them,\" he said. \"And nobody showed up. So overnight, we lost almost every single one of our customers. Like, they had thought we had lost our minds.\"",
      "And yet, he still refused to fall back on the Matisse name, and it turned out that belief in himself paid off.",
      "Today, he has legions of fans who call themselves \"Potheads.\" They buy, share and trade East Fork dinnerware online. On the secondary market, some of his early pieces can go for thousands of dollars.",
      "And so, with East Fork firmly established, about 18 months ago Alex decided it was time to use his own name. He, along with his sister and brother, poured over hundreds of works by their great-grandfather to find the ones that could be pottery perfect.",
      "\"We wanted something like the Blue Nude series that was instantly recognizable,\" Alex said. \"But then, I wanted some that spoke to me a little more personally.\"",
      "Decals were made of the chosen works, faithful to their great-grandfather's exacting details. Each one is carefully applied by hand, and inspected by hand over and over again.",
      "He says he doesn't wonder what his great-grandfather would think of his new collection. \"Oh, geez. No.\" Alex said, \"Because he was very serious. He was so focused on his work. Like, that's what he cared about.\"",
      "Henri Matisse once famously said, \"Creativity takes courage.\" His great-grandson Alex Matisse would certainly agree with that. His only caveat is that sometimes courage is all in the timing.",
      "\"There's not a heaviness to it,\" he said. \"It's just another layer. It's just another interesting part of my history, my family's history. And it feels great to celebrate it and share it.\"",

Her 1995 song \"I Kissed A Girl\" was the first openly-gay-themed song to make it into the Billboard Top 20 despite being banned by many Southern radio stations.",
      "Other hits included \"Too Cool to Fall in Love,\" \"Supermodel\" (from the movie \"Clueless\"), and \"Bitter.\"",
      "Born in Denver, Sobule was praised for her witty and poignant writing, which first attracted attention with her 1990 album, \"Things Here Are Different.\" After two record companies dropped her and two indie labels she was tied to went bankrupt, Sobule turned to crowdfunding, with a website, jillsnextrecord.com, to raise $75,000. \"I think I got it within six weeks,\" Sobule told \"CBS Evening News.\" In addition to small dollar gifts, one donor wrote in saying, \"'I'm really not a fan of your music, but I think this is a great new model, so I'm giving you $50.'\" The resulting album, \"California Years,\" was released in 2009. She turned to crowdsourcing again for the 2018 album \"Nostalgia Kills.\"",

      "Last month, in an interview with Cincy Music, Sobule was asked about the changes she has seen in the recording business during her career. \"The demise of the music industry as we once knew it, hasn't been great,\" she said. \"Thinking of the sad-ass checks from Spotify. But it has also made one become creative in other endeavors. For example, musical theater. I do tell my theater pals that I have moved on from the music industry, as I've been told off-Broadway theater is so lucrative. They just laugh.\""

    "story": [
      "Ruth Buzzi, who rose to fame as the frumpy and bitter Gladys Ormphby on the groundbreaking sketch comedy series \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\" and made over 200 television appearances during a 45-year career, has died, her agent confirmed to CBS News on Friday. She was 88.",
      "Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, her agent Mike Eisenstadt said in a statement. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi's Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: \"She wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.\"",
      "Buzzi won a Golden Globe and was a two-time Emmy nominee for the NBC show that ran from 1968 to 1973. She was the only regular to appear in all six seasons, including the pilot.",
      "She was first spotted by \"Laugh-In\" creator and producer George Schlatter playing various characters on \"The Steve Allen Comedy Hour.\"",
      "Schlatter was holding auditions for \"Laugh-In\" when he received a picture in the mail of Buzzi in her Ormphby costume, sitting in a wire mesh trash barrel. The character was clad in drab brown with her bun covered by a hairnet knotted in the middle of her forehead.",
      "\"I think I hired her because of my passion for Gladys Ormphby,\" he wrote in his 2023 memoir \"Still Laughing: A Life in Comedy.\" \"I must admit that the hairnet and the rolled-down stockings did light my fire. My favorite Gladys line was when she announced that the day of the office Christmas party, they sent her home early.\"",
      "The Gladys character used her purse as a weapon against anyone who bothered her, striking people over the head. On \"Laugh-In,\" her most frequent target was Arte Johnson's dirty old man character Tyrone F. Horneigh.",
      "\"Gladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,\" Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. \"So when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who's been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused. And that's almost everyone at some time or other.\"",
      "Buzzi took her act to the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts in Las Vegas, where she bashed her purse on the heads of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Lucille Ball, among others.",
      "Her other recurring characters on \"Laugh-In\" included Flicker Farkle; Busy-Buzzi, a Hollywood gossip columnist; Doris Swizzler, a cocktail-lounge regular who got drunk with husband Leonard, played by Dick Martin; and an inconsiderate flight attendant.",
      "\"I never took my work for granted, nor assumed I deserved more of the credit or spotlight or more pay than anyone else,\" Buzzi told The Connecticut Post. \"I was just thrilled to drive down the hill to NBC every day as an employed actor with a job to do.\"",
      "Buzzi remained friends through the years with \"Laugh-In\" co-stars Lily Tomlin and Jo Anne Worley.",
      "Born Ruth Ann Buzzi on July 24, 1936, in Westerly, Rhode Island, she was the daughter of Angelo Buzzi, a nationally known stone sculptor. Her father and later her brother operated Buzzi Memorials, a gravestone and monument maker in Stonington, Connecticut, where she was head cheerleader in high school.",
      "Buzzi enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse at age 17. Two years later, she traveled with singer Rudy Vallee in a musical and comedy act during her summer break. That earned her an Actors' Equity union card before she graduated from the playhouse's College of Theatre Arts.",
      "Buzzi moved to New York and was immediately hired for a lead role in an off-Broadway musical revue, the first of 19 such shows she performed in on the East Coast.",
      "She got her national television break on \"The Garry Moore Show\" in 1964, just after Carol Burnett was replaced by Dorothy Loudon on the series. She played Shakundala the Silent, a bumbling magician's assistant to Dom DeLuise's character Dominic the Great.",
      "Buzzi was a regular on the CBS variety show \"The Entertainers,\" whose hosts included Burnett and Bob Newhart.",
      "She was in the original Broadway cast of \"Sweet Charity\" with Gwen Verdon in 1966.",
      "Buzzi toured the country with her nightclub act, including appearances in Las Vegas.",
      "She was a semi-regular on \"That Girl\" as Marlo Thomas' friend. She co-starred with Jim Nabors as time-traveling androids on \"The Lost Saucer\" in the mid-1970s.",
      "Her other guest appearances included variety shows hosted by Burnett, Flip Wilson, Glen Campbell, Tony Orlando, Donny and Marie Osmond and Leslie Uggams.",
      "She appeared in Ball's last comedy series, \"Life With Lucy.\"",
      "Buzzi guested in music videos with \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, the B-52's and the Presidents of the United States of America.",
      "She did hundreds of guest voices in cartoon series including \"Pound Puppies,\" \"Berenstain Bears,\" \"The Smurfs\" and \"The Angry Beavers.\"",
      "She received an Emmy nomination for her six-year run as shopkeeper Ruthie on \"Sesame Street.\"",
      "Her movie credits included \"Freaky Friday,\" \"Chu Chu and the Philly Flash,\" \"The North Avenue Irregulars,\" and \"The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again.\"",
      "Buzzi was active on social media and had thousands of followers whom she rewarded with such one-liners as \"I have never faked a sarcasm\" and \"Scientists say the universe is made up entirely of neurons, protons and electrons. They seem to have missed morons.\"",
      "She married Perkins, an actor, in 1978.",
      "The couple moved from California to Texas in 2003 and bought a 640-acre ranch near Stephenville.",
      "Buzzi retired from acting in 2021 and suffered a series of strokes the following year. Her husband told The Dallas Morning News in 2023 that she had dementia.",

That notice is hereby revoked,\" read the letter received by some workers at the World Trade Center Health Program, which provides health care services to 9/11 first responders and survivors.",
      "A move last week to cut 15 employees of the 9/11 program, as part of a larger wave of eliminations that gutted most of the work from the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, prompted outcry from New York lawmakers.",

      "\"Those programs were not terminated, as the media has reported. But they've simply been consolidated into a place that makes more sense,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Some of the FDA's laboratories also received notices Tuesday that they would be formally brought back to work as of Wednesday.",

      "Tuesday's move to reverse some layoffs at HHS comes days after the department laid off hundreds more employees at the National Institutes of Health, blindsiding staff who had survived the initial wave of cuts in April.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday it has picked a new head of its center charged with vaccine approvals and other biologics products: Dr. Vinay Prasad, a vocal critic of the agency's moves to greenlight COVID-19 vaccine boosters.",
      "Prasad replaces Dr. Peter Marks, who served as the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA and played a key role in launching Operation Warp Speed \u2014 the Trump administration's effort to speed up the development of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The center has been operating with an acting director since Marks left the FDA in March.",
      "\"Dr. Prasad brings the kind of scientific rigor, independence, and transparency we need at CBER \u2014 a significant step forward,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary posted on X on Tuesday.",
      "Prasad has long criticized the FDA for granting emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccine boosters, saying last year that Marks was \"either incompetent or corrupt to authorize a booster without clinical, randomized data.\"",
      "After Marks was forced out by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Prasad called Marks \"one of the most dangerous, pro-pharma regulators of the 21st century\" and a \"mediocre academic\" before joining the government.",
      "\"You could replace Peter Marks with a bobblehead doll that just stamps approval and you would have the same outcome at FDA with lower administrative fees,\" Prasad posted on March 20, the week before Marks was ousted.",
      "Prasad, a professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California at San Francisco. joins the agency at a time when the FDA says it is looking at whether it will approve annual updates to the COVID-19 vaccines this fall, as part of a routine process that had been due to start next month. Officials have floated the possibility of requiring new randomized trials before approving future updates to COVID shots.",
      "A week ago, Prasad said he backed the idea of new randomized clinical trials before approving COVID shot updates, calling it \"absurd\" that the U.S. was still offering COVID vaccinations to young children and warning that strain changes could result in changes to efficacy and safety.",
      "\"Without trials, it is only a matter of time before the FDA approves a vaccine that causes some bad outcome like vaccine-induced narcolepsy. If this happens, you can kiss faith in vaccines goodbye. You will see vaccine hesitancy like you have never seen before,\" he wrote.",
      "Prasad's following grew during the COVID-19 pandemic, as he criticized measures like vaccine mandates and called for Moderna's vaccine to be banned in men under 40.",
      "During the pandemic, he was accused alongside Makary and Dr. Tracy H\u00f8eg of being a prominent purveyor of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "H\u00f8eg now works for the FDA as a special assistant to Makary, and replaced the agency's representative on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.",
      "In an email to employees shared with CBS News, Makary said that Prasad \"brings a great set of skills, energy, and competence to the FDA, and I know that he is eager to begin immersing himself in the important work of CBER and the agency as a whole.\"",

      "Around 200 employees began receiving layoff notices Friday evening, said three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The move surprised NIH officials, since the department previously claimed no further cuts were planned at the agency.",
      "\"We thought the worst was behind us, and we were transitioning into this new phase, and the rug was just pulled out from underneath us,\" one laid-off employee said.",
      "A spokesperson for the NIH did not comment on why NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya sought the additional layoffs, referring an inquiry to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. An HHS spokesperson said that, after a review, the department had notified additional employees that they were \"also impacted\" by the layoffs plan announced in March.",
      "Fewer than 250 employees at the department received notices, the spokesperson said. An HHS official said that \"the same number of employees will be brought back in critical areas\" elsewhere at the department.",
      "Two people said they had been told that the second round of cuts was done as part of an effort to compensate for other scientists needing to be reinstated, in order to comply with layoff targets.",

He was the top official overseeing food inspections during the infant formula crisis in 2022,\u00a0 when the agency mishandled whistleblower complaints about a troubled formula plant linked to a deadly recall. He also oversaw a resulting reorganization of the FDA's inspections office in 2024.",
      "Two FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Rogers had told colleagues privately that he was miserable in recent days, as the agency's inspections office has reeled from sweeping cuts to its ranks ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The cuts have come as FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has publicly touted plans to expand foreign surprise inspections, despite the agency privately struggling to keep up with inspections due to layoffs, early retirements and resignations.",

      "The main difference with Friday's layoff notices was the date they take effect: workers are being put on leave until an official separation from service on July 2, instead of in June.",
      "The layoffs also stopped work at the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. This NIOSH division had been the government body tasked with vetting safety equipment like N95 masks and breathing devices used by emergency workers.",

    "summary": "There were at least 111 cases of measles reported in the last week of March, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
    "story": [
      "Weekly measles cases have set a new record, according to figures published Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, topping the peak of an outbreak in 2019 that ranked as the worst since the 1990s.",
      "The number of cases that had their symptoms start during the week of March 30 has grown to 111, according to the agency's latest update. Authorities backdate newly reported measles cases based on when their rash began, to account for delays in reporting and diagnosis.",
      "That tops the 102 cases reported for the week of March 23, 2019, at the height of that year's wave. By the end of 2019, measles cases that year added up to the largest annual tally since endemic spread of the virus was declared eliminated in 2000.",
      "This year, the majority of cases are from an ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states, which is now larger than any other single outbreak since the virus was eliminated. Between\u00a0Texas\u00a0and\u00a0New Mexico, at least 750 of the measles cases reported this year have been linked to that outbreak. Cases in\u00a0Oklahoma\u00a0and other states have also been linked to the outbreak.",
      "There have been 11 other local outbreaks of measles within the U.S. this year, up from 10 last week.",
      "While the pace of new cases looks to have declined in Texas, officials caution it is too soon to say whether the outbreak is truly ending.",
      "\"We look at the trends over time and we'd want to see several weeks of decline. New cases sometimes get reported to public health up to a week after someone was tested, especially if the test was done at a commercial lab,\" Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Anton said authorities are also watching to see if travel from the Easter holiday weekend last month will result in an increase.",
      "\"Cases from travel that weekend would likely start to be reported in the next week or two,\" Anton said.",
      "This year's tally of cases is likely an undercount, officials and experts have said, citing anecdotes of unreported infections. The unusually high severity of this year's wave also suggests many mild cases of spread are going undiagnosed.",
      "For example, authorities in Canada have confirmed more than 1,000 measles cases so far this year, after record outbreaks there. The U.S. has tallied at least 935 this year, according to the CDC.",
      "In Canada, 7% of cases have resulted in hospitalizations, less than the 13% of cases that have resulted in hospitalizations in the U.S. Three Americans have also died from measles so far this year, compared to none in Canada.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 20:00:37 -0400",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is again leaving its benchmark interest rate at 4.25% to 4.5%, citing rising economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged, resisting pressure from President Trump to lower U.S. borrowing costs as policy makers assess the economic impact of his trade policies.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since the central bank last moved to lower short-term rates in December.",
      "The federal funds rate \u2014 the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 helps determine what businesses and consumers pay in interest on loans and credit card debt.",
      "What does the Fed say about the economy?",
      "The Fed, which has a dual mandate to keep inflation low while maintaining a healthy job market, on Wednesday signaled that economic risks are on the rise.",
      "Concerns that Mr. Trump's tariffs could spur both higher inflation and unemployment were highlighted by Fed chair Jerome Powell in a press conference to talk about the central bank's decision. But Powell noted that while consumer and business sentiment has sharply dropped, the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs haven't yet materialized in hard economic data.",
      "\"We've judged that the risk to higher inflation and unemployment has risen\" since March, when the Fed last met, Powell said. But, he added, \"We can't say which way this will shake out.\"",
      "Because of the uncertainty of the economy's path under the Trump administration's trade policies, the central bank wants to take a wait-and-see approach, Powell added. At the benchmark rate's current level, the Fed has the flexibility to cut rates if unemployment rises, or hike rates if inflation reignites due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, he noted.",
      "At the same time, Powell noted there are concerns that the Fed could face a situation where its dual mandate is in tension, which could occur if inflation and unemployment simultaneously spike. In that scenario, the central bank would need to focus on which side of the mandate is the farthest from the Fed's goal, and prioritize taming that part of the economy, he added.",
      "\"This would be a complicated and challenging judgment we would have to make,\" Powell said. \"If the two goals are in tension \u2014 if unemployment is moving up in an uncomfortable way, and so is inflation \u2014 we would look at how far they are\" from the Fed's targets, and focus first on the economic issue that's under greater stress, he added.",
      "Wall Street interpreted Powell's comments as signaling an increased risk that the U.S. economy could slide into stagflation, or a combination of slower economic growth and higher inflation.",
      "\"The Fed still sees the economy on solid footing, but acknowledges upside risk to both sides of their mandate \u2014 unemployment and inflation \u2014 because of tariffs,\" Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in an email. \"With stagflation risks rising, the Fed's communications will emphasize patience until there is enough clarity in the data.\"",
      "What the Fed decision means",
      "The Fed's to hold interest rates steady comes amid pressure from Mr. Trump to cut interest rates, with the president\u00a0writing\u00a0on social media last month that the central bank has been \"TOO LATE AND WRONG\" for holding off on further reductions.",
      "The latest Fed statement offers no clues on when it might consider easing monetary policy, according to Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"We continue to expect that, with tariffs likely to generate a modest slowdown in GDP growth to around 1.5%, the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged for all of this year,\" he said in a report.",
      "Economists are forecasting that Mr. Trump's tariffs will boost inflation later this year. That could provide the Fed with the impetus to cut rates, although inflation\u00a0cooled in March.",
      "Given more subdued inflation and a buoyant job market, most economists had\u00a0projected\u00a0that the Fed would maintain interest rates at today's meeting, despite some headwinds such as eroding\u00a0consumer confidence\u00a0and a sharp decline in\u00a0first-quarter\u00a0U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"For the time being the Fed remains in a holding pattern as it waits for uncertainty to clear,\" said Ashish Shah, CIO of public investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email after the Fed's announcement.",
      "Shah added, \"Recent better-than-feared jobs data has supported the Fed's on-hold stance, and the onus is on the labor market to weaken sufficiently to bring a resumption of its easing cycle.\"",

      "His request came after the president announced over the weekend that he would impose 100% tariffs on all films produced outside the U.S. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the nation's movie industry was \"DYING a very fast death.\"",
      "The film industry has taken multiple hits in recent years, notably the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the Hollywood strikes in 2023. Production has failed to return to pre-pandemic levels since\u00a0experiencing a 22% drop in the first quarter of 2025 from 2024 levels.",
      "Last year, Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass proposed an increase in California's annual film tax credit\u00a0from $330 million to $750 million.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke about Newsom and many other topics when questioned by reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday. A day earlier, during a meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others to announce that the NFL draft would be held in Washington in 2027, the president also talked about Newsom and Hollywood.",
      "He said the American film industry has been \"decimated\" by other countries and the \"grossly incompetent\" Newsom, which he said caused the film industry to \"abandon\" the U.S. But he vowed that \"we'll get it back.\" He said he'll be meeting with some film industry executives to \"make sure they're happy with\" the prospective tariffs.",
      "The president referred to the California High-Speed Rail\u00a0project, which would run between San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
      "\"A little train going from San Francisco to Los Angeles that's being run by Gavin Newscum, the governor of California. Ever heard of Gavin Newscum?\" Mr. Trump said. \"That train is the worst cost overrun thing I've ever seen. ... It's hundreds of billions for a stupid project that should've never been built.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did have some brief but kind words for Newsom in the midst of his barrage.",
      "\"And Gavin, you know, I always like Gavin, had a good relationship with him,\" he said.",
      "He also touched on the January wild fires, claiming that he gave water to California.",
      "\"I just got him a lot of water. I sent in people to open up that water, because he refused to do it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If they would have had that water and if they would have done what I said to do, they wouldn't have had the fires in Los Angeles, those fires would have been put out very quickly,\"",
      "The president visited Los Angeles in late-January with the first lady, weeks after two massive fires devastated opposite ends of Los Angeles County. He was greeted by Newsom when he landed at the airport.",
      "\"I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the side of it, we flew over it in a helicopter. We flew to a few of the areas, and it is devastation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comments ended with a challenge for the Golden State's governor.",
      "\"I'd love him to run for president on the other side. I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone, well, that and the fires and a lot of other things pretty much put him out of the race,\" he said.",

The May 7 deadline for Americans to switch to the\u00a0federally compliant\u00a0identification comes after more than 20 years of being delayed. Real IDs will also be required to enter certain federal facilities.",
      "Despite the new security requirement, it was business as usual at many airports on Wednesday, with some airport websites reporting wait times at security checkpoints of just a few minutes. Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport's website, for example, showed wait times ranging from 5 to 16 minutes.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 17:31:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has a new plan to get \"healthy\" food to low-income seniors, but an anti-hunger advocate fears many will miss out.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposed budget for next year could include big changes for a small food aid program that helps low-income senior citizens supplement their diets. Under the plan, funding for the program \u2014 called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) \u2014 would be cut, and seniors instead would receive what the Trump administration is calling \"MAHA food boxes\" filled with products sourced directly from farmers.",
      "The food boxes \u2014 whose name stems from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to \"Make America Healthy Again\" \u2014 could eventually also be rolled out to either \"supplant or complement current USDA programs,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The agency didn't disclose what other government programs could integrate use of the MAHA food boxes.",
      "The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, more commonly known as food stamps. The agency also oversees other food aid programs such as Women, Infants and Children, which is aimed at pregnant women and kids, as well as the National School Lunch program.",
      "\"Unlike the current approach using food banks, which provide those in need with shelf-stable foods that are high in sodium and other harmful ingredients, MAHA boxes would be filled with commodities sourced from domestic farmers and given directly to American households,\" the Trump budget proposal notes.",
      "The CSFP helps about 730,000 low-income seniors annually through its $389 million budget, according to the USDA. By comparison, the food-stamp program spent about $100 billion last year to provide assistance to 41 million Americans, according to the USDA.",
      "\"We have no details\"",
      "The CSFP is essential for low-income seniors who are struggling to put food on the table, said George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program, a nonprofit\u00a0in Philadelphia. He expressed concern about the Trump administration's plans to replace the CSFP with food boxes, noting the logistical complexity of getting perishable food from farmers directly to older Americans.",
      "Another question is whether the foods included in the food boxes would meet the needs of seniors who often need shelf-stable foods because many struggle to get to the store, Matysik said.",
      "\"What we do know is that the program that we currently have is working, and seniors have come to rely on us,\" he said. \"We have no details [about logistics of the MAHA food boxes], and this has been a continued challenge that we've had with this administration, where decisions are sort of made overnight.\"",
      "Share Food Program relies on $4.5 million in CSFP funding to provide 32-pound food boxes to more than 7,000 seniors in the Philadelphia region who earn less than roughly $23,000 per year. Matysik disagreed with the Trump administration's claims that the program provides unhealthy foods to seniors, noting the boxes typically contain products such as canned vegetables, lean proteins and pastas.",
      "\"For seniors, a lot of times it can be hard to make it out to the grocery store \u2014 it can be hard to get those core items that folks need,\" he added. \"What we do at Share Food Program is take it directly to the doorstep of about 4,500 seniors, so not only are we providing that nutrition, but we're making it easy on the seniors.\"",
      "The Trump budget proposal represents a wish list for the current administration, and it isn't certain that funding for the CSFP would be cut.",
      "But the plan comes amid a larger push by the Trump administration to reduce spending on similar programs, such as a decision in March to cut two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks and instead have them source food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "The Kennedy effect",
      "The MAHA food boxes would provide a twofold benefit, the USDA said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"MAHA boxes would be more wholesome foods, and similar to the Farmers to Families Food Box, fresh foods,\" the agency said. It added that \"the most obvious\" benefit would be \"the removal of administrative middlemen from the distribution of food.\"",
      "The Farmers to Families Food Box, a pandemic food program that ran from May 2020 to May 2021, relied on more than 200 contractors to deliver millions of boxes to needy families, according to a 2021 analysis from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The study found that the 21 biggest contractors were collectively awarded $3 billion to deliver the boxes.",
      "MAHA, meanwhile, is part of a push by Kennedy to promote natural foods and alternative medicines. As head of HHS, he's pressing the food industry to stop using\u00a0synthetic food dyes\u00a0and has pledged to remove processed foods from school lunches.",
      "The USDA has signaled its openness to the MAHA platform, with Secretary Brooke Rollins saying she plans to approve a plan from Arkansas to ban the use of food stamps for purchasing sodas and candy. Anti-hunger advocates have said such restrictions can be stigmatizing for low-income Americans.",
      "In the meantime, Matysik said he's worried about the future of the CSFP program and the seniors who rely on it.",
      "\"Our seniors in particular are already hurting,\" he said. \"We're hearing about cuts to the SNAP program. We're seeing about cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. We're really worried about our senior citizens in this funding environment from our federal government right now.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 14:13:49 -0400",
    "summary": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren is urging other Democrats not to support a bipartisan crypto regulation bill, as Democrats warn about President Trump's ties to crypto.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are rebelling against a crypto regulation bill, putting the first-of-its-kind legislation in jeopardy ahead of a possible key vote on it later this week.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance.",
      "The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins.",
      "Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday \"we need to start moving forward.\" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes.",
      "Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said the stablecoin bill advanced out of the committee with the caveat that improvements would be made before it was brought up for a floor vote. But Republicans moved ahead without addressing Democrats' concerns on provisions involving anti-money laundering, national security and consumer protections, Gallego said.",
      "\"I think the purpose of that was really to put Democrats in a bad position and try to force us to vote for it,\" Gallego told MeidasTouch in an interview posted Wednesday.",
      "\"You can't try to f*** us and then say, hey, deal with it,\" Gallego added. \"That's just not going to work, especially when you still need our votes.\"",
      "A few Republican senators \u2014 Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Josh Hawley of Missouri and John Kennedy of Louisiana \u2014 have also indicated that they could vote against the bill for various other reasons.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures.",
      "\"Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,\" it says.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, \"Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption.\"",
      "The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets.",
      "\"Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,\" Merkley said in a statement. \"This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately.\"",
      "The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act.",
      "On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's \"serious risks\" to the U.S. economy.",
      "The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole.",
      "The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth \u2014 or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024.",
      "In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's \"assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.\"",
      "\"Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,\" she said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News last week, World Liberty said the Abu Dhabi deal represents the \"single largest-ever investment in a crypto company\" and sets a \"historic precedent.\" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, is seeking records and documents about Mr. Trump's crypto ventures from Fight Fight Fight LLC, the company that launched Mr. Trump's meme coin, and World Liberty Financial.",
      "The senator sent letters to both companies on Tuesday requesting the records, including communications between both companies, the Trump Organization, the president, his administration and foreign governments.",

      "Here's what you need to know as the Real ID requirements takes effect on Wednesday.",
      "What is a Real ID?",
      "The Real ID is a federally compliant license, learner permit or nondriver ID card issued by state driver's license agencies. You can tell if a state-issued license or ID card is a Real ID if it has a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",

      "Am I required to get a Real ID?",
      "Real or Enhanced IDs are only required for those over 18 without a valid U.S. passport who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification.",
      "That's said, Real IDs are considered a more secure form of identification than a classic driver's license.",
      "The requirement for Real IDs was established by Congress in 2005, following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the Federal Government \"set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses,\" according to the Department of Homeland Security.",

      "Prices vary by state. In\u00a0New York, for example, there is no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the normal transactional cost you pay for a standard license, ID or renewal. Pennsylvania, however, charges a \"one-time $30 Real ID fee\" on top of standard renewal fees. New York charges an additional $30 fee for Enhanced IDs.",
      "It's best to check your state's Real ID guidelines for an accurate estimate of how much you'll pay. The same goes for Enhanced IDs.",

    "summary": "The IRS, hit by the Trump administration's federal workforce cuts, has lost 31% of its auditors through March, government watchdog finds.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's plan to trim the IRS workforce has resulted in almost one-third of its tax auditors leaving the agency through March, according to a report from the U.S. Treasury Department's watchdog.",
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has sought to trim the federal workforce through a combination of layoffs and so-called deferred resignation. Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla,\u00a0said\u00a0on the electric vehicle maker's April 22 earnings call that DOGE's efforts \"in addressing waste and fraud\" will \"get the country back on track.\"",
      "The IRS has been a focus of DOGE's cost-cutting efforts, with plans to trim as much as 40% of its workforce this year. Through March, those efforts have resulted in the tax agency losing about 11% of its workforce, the May 2 report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found.",
      "But revenue agents \u2014 the IRS workers who perform audits \u2014 have seen a much bigger hit, with 31% of those workers, or about 3,600 auditors, taking either the deferred resignation plan or getting fired in the first three months of 2025, the report found. Losing a large share of auditors could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, given that these agents typically handle cases involving wealthy taxpayers or corporations, experts say.",
      "\"You lose the very staff trained to keep high-end taxpayers and corporate tax payers in compliance,\" noted Emily DiVito, senior adviser on economic policy at the left-leaning Groundwork Collaborative and a former policy adviser at the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS.",
      "She added, \"You can see some behavioral effects when taxpayers, especially those that really don't want to pay their bills, come to accept there is very little risk to not paying at all, or even filing.\"",
      "Reached for comment, a Treasury spokeswoman said, \"The Biden Administration grew the IRS from 79,431 to 102,309 personnel. Under new leadership, approximately the same number of employees have left the IRS, with a vast majority leaving voluntarily through the Deferred Resignation Program. The roll back of wasteful Biden-era hiring surges, and consolidation of critical support functions are vital to improve both efficiency and quality of service. The Secretary is committed to ensuring that efficiency is realized while providing the collections, privacy, and customer service the American people deserve.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately return a request for comment about the TIGTA report.",
      "While the TIGTA report didn't explain why auditor departures outpaced that of overall cuts at the IRS, the tax agency had made an effort under the Biden administration to hire more auditors in order to beef up revenue collection. In February 2024, the IRS had said it expected to collect hundreds of billions in additional taxes after using funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to hire more auditors.",
      "Because the DOGE cuts have focused on firing so-called \"probationary workers,\" or junior federal employees who typically have less than a year or two on the job, there may have been more newly hired auditors who were impacted by the reductions, DeVito said.",
      "Reducing federal revenue?",
      "Auditing wealthy Americans and corporations can be lucrative for the federal government. In fiscal year 2023, auditors recommended an additional $32 billion in tax assessments, the TIGTA report said.",
      "And every $1 spent on auditing the top 0.1% of earners can return about $26 in tax revenue, according to an analysis from Better IRS, an advocacy group for free tax filing.",
      "The cuts to the IRS' auditing force raises questions about the effectiveness of DOGE's efforts, given that the tax agency is responsible for collecting the bulk of the nation's revenue, DeVito added.",
      "The combination of individual and corporate income taxes provides about 60 cents for every $1 in federal revenue, with the remaining 40 cents coming from payroll taxes and fees, such as paying admission to national parks, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "DOGE's cost-cutting efforts may end up costing almost as much as they've saved, according to an analysis last month from the nonpartisan research group the Partnership for Public Service.",
      "DOGE claims to have saved $165 billion, but the Partnership for Public Service estimates that the savings have come at a cost of $135 billion due to paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity. That figure also excludes the impact of multiple lawsuits filed against DOGE's actions, as well as lost tax revenue due to IRS cuts, the group said.",
      "The IRS could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an\u00a0estimate\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "\"The argument from DOGE is to save money \u2014 that if we don't have as big of a federal workforce, then we are saving the government money,\" DeVito said. But given the potential to lose out on tax revenue, the IRS reduction \"simply doesn't make sense,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The Kamler family, owner of Fairfield, New Jersey-based Kent International, has been in the bicycle business for four generations.",
      "\"When I joined the company in 1972, we had six employees, including both my parents and myself,\" former Kent International CEO Arnold Kamler told CBS News. \"And as of a few months ago we had over 200 employees.\"",
      "Arnold took over Kent International from his father. Now his son, Scott Kamler, is CEO. They sell about two million bikes per year in the U.S. and they're one of Walmart's biggest suppliers. But President Trump's plan for tariffs is throwing a wrench into their American dream.",
      "About 90% of Kent bikes are imported from China. The rest are assembled in the U.S. at their factory in South Carolina with parts from Asia. Kent had been paying 25% tariffs on bikes and bike parts coming from China since the first Trump administration. But under the tariffs implemented by Mr. Trump last month, a recent shipment that was delayed and arrived during the new tariff period forced the company to pay a combined 181.47% in import duties and tariffs.",
      "During the one-month period from March 20 to April 20, Kent Bikes paid $3.1 million in tariffs alone.",
      "Under the new tariffs, a bicycle wheel imported from China that would have previously cost between $10 and $12 increased to about $30, according to Arnold.",
      "He says that makes him feel \"really bad\" and \"angry.\"",
      "\"China is not paying these tariffs,\" Arnold said. \"We have an account with U.S. customs where they automatically deduct once a month, the import duty, from our account. And so, it's not only import duty, but these tariffs are deducted.\"",
      "The company cancelled its new orders from China for April, and it doesn't have any plans to place new orders in May.",
      "Even if tariffs against China are reduced by the Trump administration, there are dozens of other countries facing new tariffs. So trying to find other foreign vendors seems futile.",
      "\"We had already shifted some of our business, almost half our business, to several of the countries on that list,\" Kamler   said. \"And we're getting out of China and now we're still getting slammed. It's just completely unfair.\"",
      "Arnold indicates that fully manufacturing and assembling their bikes in the U.S. is not financially tenable from a cost-perspective.",
      "\"I can't even calculate that high,\" Kamler   said about what he thinks a bike would cost to produce here. \"I'll just tell you one quick story. There was a company that came to us a couple years ago. They wanted to make handlebars for us. Now we used to make our own handlebar for about a dollar-and- a-half, and we saved some money by buying it from Asia. And this company took three months to give me the quotation for a simple BMX handlebar. And the price came back at $12. I said, '$12? It's about 80 cents of steel. How could you be?' 'Well, there's a lot of work.' And I said, 'OK, thank you, you can lose my number.' So, you can take that (as) kind of (an) example\u2026I mean, a $100-bicycle here would be a $1,000 if all the parts were made here right now.\"",

      "\"The world has been coming to the U.S., and China has been the missing piece,\" Bessent said on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 06 May 2025 19:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Many investments Mr. Trump claims credit for predate his return to office or are based on vague future pledges. Here's a fact check of his claims.",
    "story": [
      "After President Trump was pressed on rising consumer prices and slowing economic growth, he defended his tariff policies by claiming they had spurred record investment in the United States.",
      "\"I think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview on\u00a0NBC's Meet the Press that aired Sunday. \"If you look at other presidents, there's never been anything like that.\"",
      "He has also repeatedly claimed that he secured more investment in his first two months than President Biden did in four years.",
      "Neither claim is supported by evidence, CBS News Confirmed found. While companies have announced hundreds of billions of dollars in planned investments since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the White House has not provided data showing the total approaches $9 trillion.",
      "Additionally, a CBS News review found that some investments highlighted by the White House were announced before Mr. Trump's reelection. The comparison to the Biden administration is also misleading: the president is citing future investments pledges, while contrasting them with a narrower list of projects that were in the works or completed by the end of his predecessor's term.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the claims.",
      "Some investments Trump claims credit for were announced under Biden",
      "The White House on April 29 said Mr. Trump had secured $5 trillion of U.S. investment in his first 100 days, and published a partial list titled \"The Trump Effect\" \u2014 which it said demonstrated \"his America First economic policies have sparked trillions of dollars in new investment.\"",
      "That list totals closer to $2 trillion from private companies, and around $5 trillion if commitments from foreign countries are included. The basis for the president's $9 trillion claim is unclear and the administration has not explained the discrepancy.",
      "A closer look at the White House list also shows some of the investments had been announced before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The list initially included a $4.1 billion commitment from Novelis, a Georgia-based aluminum company, to build a plant in southern Alabama. But construction for that project began in October 2022 and the $4.1 billion total investment was detailed in the company's February 2024 financial report. CBS News asked the White House on May 5 why the project was included; the administration did not answer the question, but by midday May 6 the project had been removed from the website.",
      "The Trump administration also claimed credit for a $1.5 billion pledge by Corning to invest in its solar products facility in Michigan. A company spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that $900 million of this funding was announced months before Mr. Trump assumed office. On April 29, Corning announced an additional $600 million investment, bringing the total to $1.5 billion.",
      "Likewise, the White House listed Johnson & Johnson's commitment to spend $55 billion over the next four years, but a company spokesperson confirmed that total includes a $2 billion investment \u2014 announced last October \u2014 in a facility in Wilson, North Carolina.",
      "The list also includes the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative announced by Open AI and Japan-based Softbank on Jan. 21, which had been in development for at least a year before Mr. Trump's inauguration. The companies said $100 billion would be deployed \"immediately,\" but offered few specifics on how or where the money would be spent.",
      "Comparing to investments under Biden",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he attracted more investment in two months than Biden did in four years, suggesting he brought in trillions in a matter of weeks while casting doubt that the former president secured even $1 trillion during his term.",
      "But there's no clear evidence to support his claim. A White House spokesperson said the president was referring to a December 2024 report from the Biden White House, which said the private sector committed at least $1 trillion to clean energy and manufacturing projects during Biden's term.",
      "However, Biden's list of investments highlighted \"a selection of private-sector investments in 21st century industries\" including green energy, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, based on project announcements in specific locations or factories under construction. The data on Biden's \"Investing in America\" spreadsheet also showed projects that closely resemble some on Mr. Trump's list.",
      "By comparison, the Trump administration's list includes broader, less specific investment pledges across a variety of industries \u2014 many without clear timelines or locations.",
      "For example, Mr. Trump's list highlights Apple's recent $500 billion pledge to U.S. manufacturing and training. However, as previously reported by The Washington Post, Apple also announced a $430 billion investment early in Biden's term, including a North Carolina engineering hub that was paused in 2024, and the Biden administration's report does not include any Apple investments in its tally.",
      "However, experts caution that announcements about planned investments don't guarantee action.",
      "\"Companies often will make announcements to essentially curry favor with an incoming administration to show how committed they are to the United States,\" said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S. \"It's not unusual whether it was President Trump or President Biden or President Obama.\"",
      "Presidents from both parties have claimed credit for projects started under their predecessors. For instance, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced investments during Mr. Trump's first term, some of which contributed to the construction of manufacturing facilities highlighted by the Biden White House investment report.",
      "During his term, Biden signed major pieces of legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which included $24 billion in tax credits to attract private investors in hopes of driving domestic manufacturing commitments.",
      "Such incentives may continue to fuel further projects during Mr. Trump's term, according to Nigro, provided they remain in place \u2014 but the long-term impact of federal policy, including under both Biden and Mr. Trump, may take years to assess.",
      "\"It's very hard to attach these new investments that have been announced as being tied directly to policies of the Trump administration. It's frankly just too early,\" Nigro said.",

      "What are the odds of a Fed rate cut?",
      "Very slim, with economists projecting 97% odds that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "\"Criticism from President Trump will not trigger a Fed policy response \u2014 neither an early cut without evidence of labor market deterioration, nor a stubborn refusal to cut once the labor market does soften, provided long-term inflation expectations remain anchored,\" noted Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius in a May 6 research note.",
      "When is the Fed expected to cut rates?",
      "Consumers eager for relief on borrowing costs are likely going to face a wait, according to economists.",
      "Following the May 7 meeting, the Fed will next meet on June 18, with economists currently expecting the central bank to also hold steady then, according to CME FedWatch. Its polling finds a 70% likelihood that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.5% at that meeting.",
      "However, it's more likely the Fed could slash rates at its July 30 meeting, with the probability of a rate cut sitting currently at 80%, FedWatch notes.",
      "But some economists expect the central bank to hold off even longer.",
      "\"We think the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates next year, as tariff-induced inflation begins to fade and the labor market shows more troubling signs,\" noted Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Ryan Sweet, who says he believes the first cut will occur in December.",
      "Why does Trump want a rate cut now?",
      "Mr. Trump argues that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social that there is \"NO INFLATION\" and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gas has dropped to $1.98 a gallon.",
      "But those claims are not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gas and oil prices have declined \u2014 gas costs are down 10% from a year ago \u2014 continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken. Still, AAA says gas prices nationwide average $3.18 a gallon.",
      "What does the Fed's decision mean for your money?",
      "Borrowers who are looking for relief on loan and credit card rates will have a wait ahead of them, experts say.",
      "\"There's just so much uncertainty in the economy now,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in an email. \"No one quite knows what the next few months will look like, but what does seem clear is that Americans are going to have wait at least a little longer for the Fed to cut rates.\"",
      "Schulz predicts that credit card rates could tick higher in the next few months, as well as auto loan rates.",
      "\"Banks are nervous about all of the uncertainty in the economy and what it means for consumers,\" he noted. \"When that happens, banks try to minimize risk as much as possible, and one of the ways they do that is to raise interest rates on credit cards.\"",
      "Because of that, consumers should focus on shopping around for the best rates they can find, as well as considering transferring existing high-interest credit card debt to 0% balance transfer cards, Schulz added.",

Experts warn that the sharp decline in trade activity could lead to COVID-19 pandemic-like shortages of products, including goods assembled in the U.S. or elsewhere that use materials or inputs from China.",
      "Many American retailers rushed to build up their inventories ahead of President Trump's sweeping levies, leading to a recent\u00a0spike in imports. Imports have since slowed, with a number of retailers foregoing orders on apparel, baby goods and other items that would typically be headed toward U.S. ports.",

      "Toys, games and sports equipment: More than $30 billion in toys, games and sports equipment sold in the U.S. is imported from China. That accounts for just over 73% of the country's total imports in the category. The trade war could spell shortages in children's toys come Christmastime, experts, as well as President Trump, have warned.",
      "Textile art: The U.S. imports $8.6 billion in textile art from China. That accounts for over half of all the textile art the country imports from abroad.",
      "Footwear: The U.S. is highly reliant on China for shoes. It imports $9.8 billion's worth, or 36% of footwear sold stateside. Sportswear giant Adidas for one, has warned that it expects to raise prices for U.S. customers because of tariffs.",
      "Cutlery:\u00a0Dinner utensils manufactured in China could also start becoming scarce. The U.S. imports $3.1 billion in cutlery and metal tools from the country.",
      "Glassware: Almost 30% of U.S. imports of glassware and other products made of glass comes from China.",
      "Furniture and bedding: $18.5 billion's worth of furniture and bedding comes from China. That's 28% of all U.S. imports in the category.",

    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration is retreating from a recent policy change on the agency recovering overpayments that sparked concerns it could cause financial hardship for tens of thousands of beneficiaries.",
      "In an April 25 \"emergency message\" to Social Security employees, the agency said it is reducing its overpayment clawback rate to 50% from 100%. The change comes after SSA on March 27 started recovering erroneous overpayments to Social Security recipients by\u00a0taking 100%\u00a0of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up sharply from the prior rate of 10%.",
      "The agency didn't explain its reason for the change, nor immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The 100% clawback policy was directed by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to\u00a0cut costs\u00a0at the agency. Dudek said in a March 7 press release that the change was needed to \"properly safeguard taxpayer funds.\"",
      "The agency's move to recover overpayments has long been a pain point for thousands of beneficiaries who are overpaid each year, with many people unaware they had received a bigger benefit than they were entitled to until receiving notices from the Social Security Administration.",
      "The agency's inspector general found that 73,000 overpayments in 2022 were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations, rather than the fault of the beneficiary.",
      "\"SSA's automated systems could not compute benefit payments due in certain situations, and the Agency did not provide employees with a comprehensive tool to use when they had to manually calculate them. Without adequate automation tools, employees can make errors,\" the inspector general said in a report.",
      "Severe clawbacks cause hardship",
      "Last year, the Biden administration\u00a0capped the clawback rate\u00a0at 10% after reports that some seniors and disabled beneficiaries had been forced into financial hardship, including homelessness, due to the prior 100% clawback rate. But that 10% rate was only effective for about a year, with the the agency returning it to a 100% rate in March.",
      "Those most at risk from the government's stepped-up effort to recover overpayments are the roughly one-third of Social Security recipients who rely on their monthly benefit check for at least 75% of their income. Some seniors have told CBS News they were left\u00a0too financially strapped\u00a0to afford rent, food and other basics.",
      "Many of the overpayments involve disabled workers who receive payments through the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, whose recipients receive an average of $1,538 per month, said Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.",
      "One SSA\u00a0report found that SSDI has a higher rate of overpayments than the overall Social Security program because disabled recipients sometimes fail to report work income, which can occur if they're not aware they need to disclose extra earnings to the agency. Social Security\u00a0reduces benefits for disabled recipients who earn more than $1,620 a month.",
      "\"While walking back the clawback of overpayments from 100% to 50% is a step in the right direction, taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden to many workers with disabilities who receive SSDI,\" Adcock told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "\"We received emails from several different farms we work with that said after Mother's Day the tariff prices are going to go into effect,\" Lucero told CBS MoneyWatch. She's increased her prices as a result, with wrist corsages typically sold for $40, now priced at $50.",
      "\"That's not nearly enough of what I should have charged, but because my clientele is not wealthy, I had to take that into account if would people purchase from me or would they go elsewhere?\" said Lucero, adding that as her own costs skyrocket, the future of her business is uncertain.",
      "\"I have been transparent with customers to try to get them to understand, but if it gets to be too much, I may have to close,\" she said. \"This is a whole different atmosphere.\"",
      "Chinese goods are \"unsaleable\"",
      "Few businesses are immune to tariffs, but smaller establishments, which tend to operate on thin margins, are among the most vulnerable. Some bigger businesses imported goods ahead of tariffs going into effect, stockpiling inventory. With less cash on hand, small businesses did not have the same ability.",
      "\"Small business owners are innovative, driven and scrappy \u2014 they often operate on razor-thin margins and are constantly finding new ways to grow,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement. \"But President Trump's tariffs are needlessly causing immense uncertainty for small business owners, forcing them to make layoffs, increase prices for their customers and even close their doors,\" she added.",
      "Mike Roach, who co-owns Paloma Clothing, a 50-year-old womenswear store in Portland, Oregon, sells labels that are primarily manufactured in India and China.",
      "He placed orders for a new season's worth of merchandise three to five months ago, before tariffs on either country were in effect. Today, tariffs as high as 145% apply to goods from China, while a 10% baseline levy is in place on goods entering the U.S. from India.",
      "\"The companies we deal with are going through conniptions trying to figure out what they're going to do. At that level, Chinese goods, are pretty much unsaleable,\" he said. \"That's a huge threat to the future of our business.\"",
      "Roach hopes his store's 50th year in business isn't its last, but it's a potential reality he's facing.",
      "\"This is the worst and most uncertain situation we've ever been in,\" he said. \"This is way worse than anything else in terms of not knowing what to do and what the future is going to hold because of the uncertain factor.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 05:00:19 -0400",
    "summary": "In recent weeks, Social Security has been plagued by problems related to technology, system errors, and even the marking of living people as dead.",
    "story": [
      "Rennie Glasgow, who has served 15 years at the Social Security Administration, is seeing something new on the job: dead people.",
      "They're not really dead, of course. In four instances over the past few weeks, he told KFF Health News, his Schenectady, New York, office has seen people come in for whom \"there is no information on the record, just that they are dead.\" So employees have to \"resurrect\" them \u2014 affirm that they're living, so they can receive their benefits.",
      "Revivals were \"sporadic\" before, and there's been an uptick in such cases across upstate New York, said Glasgow. He is also an official with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represented 42,000 Social Security employees just before the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Martin O'Malley, who led the Social Security Administration toward the end of the Biden administration, said in an interview that he had heard similar stories during a recent town hall in Racine, Wisconsin. \"In that room of 200 people, two people raised their hands and said they each had a friend who was wrongly marked as deceased when they're very much alive,\" he said.",
      "It's more than just an inconvenience, because other institutions rely on Social Security numbers to do business, Glasgow said. Being declared dead \"impacts their bank account. This impacts their insurance. This impacts their ability to work. This impacts their ability to get anything done in society.\"",
      "\"They are terminating people's financial lives,\" O'Malley said.",
      "Though it's just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead.",
      "Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times, thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to \"self-deport.\"",
      "Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. \"Why don't you just do due diligence to make sure what you're doing in the first place is correct?\" he said.",
      "The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration's crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program's future.",
      "But KFF Health News' interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities.",
      "Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece's difficulties with Social Security's disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece's address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer \u2014 whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record \u2014 believes they could be zero.",
      "Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece's bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment.",
      "Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore.",
      "The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece's disability payments, \"then she will be homeless,\" Seda recalled telling an agency employee. \"I don't know if I'm going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.\"",
      "Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency's efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, \"it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,\" the committee recently told the agency's inspector general.",
      "While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they're owed, she said.",
      "For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according to a January survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance.",
      "Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that's nearly unprecedented in their experience.",
      "Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members' March payments were several days late. \"For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,\" she said. \"The delayed payment is not something I've heard in the last 20 years.\"",
      "When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Mr. Trump's \"resounding mandate\" to make government more efficient.",
      "\"He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,\" Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions.",
      "Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general's office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News.",
      "A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security \u2014 which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 \u2014 had nearly doubled in March compared with last year.",
      "Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it's getting worse as experienced employees have been let go.",
      "\"We're seeing more mistakes being made,\" said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years' experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. \"We're seeing more things get dropped.\"",
      "What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn't show.",
      "She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem \u2014 only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said.",
      "Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm's policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored \u2014 the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there.",
      "\"To be told they've never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Researchers and lawyers say they have a suspicion about what's behind the problems at Social Security: the Elon Musk-led effort to revamp the agency.",
      "Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O'Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. \"As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,\" he predicted in an April hearing held by House Democrats. \"It's going to mean that if you go to a field office, you're going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.\"",
      "The departures have hit the agency's regional payment centers hard. These centers help process and adjudicate some cases. It's the type of behind-the-scenes work in which \"the problems surface first,\" Romig said. But if the staff doesn't have enough time, \"those things languish.\"",
      "Languishing can mean, in some cases, getting dropped by important programs like Medicare. Social Security often automatically deducts premiums, or otherwise administers payments, for the health program.",
      "Lately, Melanie Lambert, a senior advocate at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, has seen an increasing number of cases in which the agency determines beneficiaries owe money to Medicare. The cash is sent to the payment centers, she said. And the checks \"just sit there.\"",
      "Beneficiaries lose Medicare, and \"those terminations also tend to happen sooner than they should, based on Social Security's own rules,\" putting people into a bureaucratic maze, Lambert said.",
      "Employees' technology is more often on the fritz. \"There's issues every single day with our system. Every day, at a certain time, our system would go down automatically,\" said Glasgow, of Social Security's Schenectady office. Those problems began in mid-March, he said.",
      "The new problems leave Glasgow suspecting the worst. \"It's more work for less bodies, which will eventually hype up the inefficiency of our job and make us, make the agency, look as though it's underperforming, and then a closer step to the privatization of the agency,\" he said.",

      "Means was close to Kennedy during the campaign, along with her brother, Calley Means, who played a key role in orchestrating Kennedy's endorsement of Mr. Trump, according to some of Kennedy allies who played a role in the transition.",
      "Casey Means has\u00a0written about\u00a0how, after attending Stanford Medical School and training to become a surgeon, she opted to leave \"traditional medicine\" to devote her life to \"tackling the root cause of why Americans are sick.\"",
      "She co-founded Levels, a health app that can connect to glucose monitors, and has built a large following online for writing about health and wellness.",
      "Both Means siblings soared to prominence in recent years after viral interviews decrying the influence of the food and drug industry. Their views align with Kennedy's claims that unhealthy food and lifestyle choices underpin a vast swath of Americans' health conditions.",
      "The two siblings authored the bestseller \"Good Energy\" after their mother died of pancreatic cancer, saying that she had been \"simply prescribed pills and not set on a path of curiosity about how these conditions are connected and how the root cause can be reversed.\"",
      "An interview the two did with Tucker Carlson \u2014 ranked by Apple as the most-shared podcast episode of 2024 \u2014 was titled \"The Truth About Ozempic, the Pill, and How Big Pharma Keeps You Sick.\"",
      "\"She's qualified. She's energetic. She's been a good communicator, which is the role of surgeon general. She seems to have good ethical moorings. And she reflects this new thinking about where HHS should be. I think it's a bold pick,\" Dr. Robert Malone, another close ally of Kennedy, told CBS News.",
      "Casey and Calley Means have also earned skepticism from some of Kennedy's anti-vaccine base, who have grown frustrated with what they fear has been Kennedy's drifting attention away from what they hoped would be a ban of several vaccines and towards a crackdown on unhealthy foods and additives like synthetic food dyes.",
      "\"The nutritional agenda is a core part of MAHA. It may not be their core part of MAHA. But there's no doubt that it's a central part of the overall mission,\" he said.",
      "Malone acknowledged the perception among some of Kennedy's base that Means had not been \"sufficiently vocal, early enough, in rejecting the mRNA vaccine products,\" as he had been.",
      "Malone himself rose to prominence criticizing the shots while painting himself as the inventor of mRNA vaccines, a claim that other scientists rejected as misinformation. He was with Kennedy and Mr. Trump in Florida on election night.",
      "Means has said she backs Kennedy \"relentlessly pushing for vaccine safety\" and said she thought it was \"criminal\" to require vaccinations. She has also claimed \"the current extreme and growing vaccine schedule\" could be \"causing health declines in vulnerable children. This needs to be investigated,\" she wrote on her website last year.",
      "Calley Means now serves as a special government employee, advising Kennedy and backing state bills promoting his agenda.",
      "Casey Means was initially favored as one contender for the surgeon general pick, some of Kennedy's allies said, but was passed over for Dr. Nesheiwat. Some of Kennedy's allies said they believed Nesheiwat's appearances on Fox News and ties to former national security adviser Mike Waltz, who is married to Nesheiwat's sister Julia, played a role in the president's decision.",
      "Nesheiwat's nomination was withdrawn Wednesday amid concerns about how she portrayed her credentials. For example, as\u00a0CBS News previously reported, she has publicly listed an M.D. from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine, but she actually got her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean.",

      "Mr. Trump asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to jointly develop a proposal for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund by early May.",
      "It has been submitted, multiple sources told CBS News on Wednesday. However, the White House had concerns about the approach taken by Treasury, one of the sources said.",
      "Details on the mechanics of the fund continue to be debated, and no announcement is imminent, one source said.",
      "\"In accordance with President Trump's executive order, the Treasury and Commerce Departments have formulated plans for a Sovereign Wealth Fund, but no final decisions have yet been made,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The Administration remains committed to using every tool available to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard America's national and economic security.\"",

      "Mr. Trump has not determined how proceeds from the sovereign wealth fund would be spent, sources said. In the past, he has suggested the fund could own a stake in TikTok, the popular social media platform that faces a U.S. ban unless China-based parent company ByteDance divests from it.",
      "Sovereign wealth funds typically invest assets from a country's natural resources with an aim to make returns that would provide a public windfall. Some of the best-known funds are financed by revenue from gas or oil, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Norway's sovereign wealth fund. These funds can help insulate countries from swings in the value of natural resources, provide funds for government expenditures and allow future generations to benefit from current oil and gas revenue.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump issued an executive order that directed the Treasury and Commerce secretaries, in close coordination with the National Economic Council's Kevin Hassett, to draft a plan for the sovereign wealth fund within 90 days.",
      "\"Such plan shall include recommendations for funding mechanisms, investment strategies, fund structure, and a governance model,\" the order stated. \"The plan shall also include an evaluation of the legal considerations for establishing and managing such a fund, including any need for legislation.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 17:31:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has a new plan to get \"healthy\" food to low-income seniors, but an anti-hunger advocate fears many will miss out.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposed budget for next year could include big changes for a small food aid program that helps low-income senior citizens supplement their diets. Under the plan, funding for the program \u2014 called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) \u2014 would be cut, and seniors instead would receive what the Trump administration is calling \"MAHA food boxes\" filled with products sourced directly from farmers.",
      "The food boxes \u2014 whose name stems from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to \"Make America Healthy Again\" \u2014 could eventually also be rolled out to either \"supplant or complement current USDA programs,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The agency didn't disclose what other government programs could integrate use of the MAHA food boxes.",
      "The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, more commonly known as food stamps. The agency also oversees other food aid programs such as Women, Infants and Children, which is aimed at pregnant women and kids, as well as the National School Lunch program.",
      "\"Unlike the current approach using food banks, which provide those in need with shelf-stable foods that are high in sodium and other harmful ingredients, MAHA boxes would be filled with commodities sourced from domestic farmers and given directly to American households,\" the Trump budget proposal notes.",
      "The CSFP helps about 730,000 low-income seniors annually through its $389 million budget, according to the USDA. By comparison, the food-stamp program spent about $100 billion last year to provide assistance to 41 million Americans, according to the USDA.",
      "\"We have no details\"",
      "The CSFP is essential for low-income seniors who are struggling to put food on the table, said George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program, a nonprofit\u00a0in Philadelphia. He expressed concern about the Trump administration's plans to replace the CSFP with food boxes, noting the logistical complexity of getting perishable food from farmers directly to older Americans.",
      "Another question is whether the foods included in the food boxes would meet the needs of seniors who often need shelf-stable foods because many struggle to get to the store, Matysik said.",
      "\"What we do know is that the program that we currently have is working, and seniors have come to rely on us,\" he said. \"We have no details [about logistics of the MAHA food boxes], and this has been a continued challenge that we've had with this administration, where decisions are sort of made overnight.\"",
      "Share Food Program relies on $4.5 million in CSFP funding to provide 32-pound food boxes to more than 7,000 seniors in the Philadelphia region who earn less than roughly $23,000 per year. Matysik disagreed with the Trump administration's claims that the program provides unhealthy foods to seniors, noting the boxes typically contain products such as canned vegetables, lean proteins and pastas.",
      "\"For seniors, a lot of times it can be hard to make it out to the grocery store \u2014 it can be hard to get those core items that folks need,\" he added. \"What we do at Share Food Program is take it directly to the doorstep of about 4,500 seniors, so not only are we providing that nutrition, but we're making it easy on the seniors.\"",
      "The Trump budget proposal represents a wish list for the current administration, and it isn't certain that funding for the CSFP would be cut.",
      "But the plan comes amid a larger push by the Trump administration to reduce spending on similar programs, such as a decision in March to cut two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks and instead have them source food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "The Kennedy effect",
      "The MAHA food boxes would provide a twofold benefit, the USDA said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"MAHA boxes would be more wholesome foods, and similar to the Farmers to Families Food Box, fresh foods,\" the agency said. It added that \"the most obvious\" benefit would be \"the removal of administrative middlemen from the distribution of food.\"",
      "The Farmers to Families Food Box, a pandemic food program that ran from May 2020 to May 2021, relied on more than 200 contractors to deliver millions of boxes to needy families, according to a 2021 analysis from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The study found that the 21 biggest contractors were collectively awarded $3 billion to deliver the boxes.",
      "MAHA, meanwhile, is part of a push by Kennedy to promote natural foods and alternative medicines. As head of HHS, he's pressing the food industry to stop using\u00a0synthetic food dyes\u00a0and has pledged to remove processed foods from school lunches.",
      "The USDA has signaled its openness to the MAHA platform, with Secretary Brooke Rollins saying she plans to approve a plan from Arkansas to ban the use of food stamps for purchasing sodas and candy. Anti-hunger advocates have said such restrictions can be stigmatizing for low-income Americans.",
      "In the meantime, Matysik said he's worried about the future of the CSFP program and the seniors who rely on it.",
      "\"Our seniors in particular are already hurting,\" he said. \"We're hearing about cuts to the SNAP program. We're seeing about cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. We're really worried about our senior citizens in this funding environment from our federal government right now.\"",

      "CBS News has obtained the list of more than 1,000 Americorps grant programs terminated in recent weeks by the Administration.",
      "The wide-ranging list includes a child abuse prevention organization in Missouri, tutors for children in rural Alaska, a group that provides life-saving flood relief in West Virginia and an organization that has helped provide nearly 1 million volunteer service hours in Michigan.",
      "Some of the impacted groups told CBS News the Trump administration's halting of some funding for AmeriCorps projects threatens the future of help in some of America's most impoverished counties and rural areas, many of which voted overwhelmingly for Trump last year.",
      "AmeriCorps is the federal agency that helps support and launch national service projects and volunteerism.\u00a0 It began in the 1960s as an offshoot of the Peace Corps and evolved in the decades since as a critical provider of funding and support to build new infrastructure in needy areas, assist with disaster relief, offer services to senior citizens, rural and inner-city health programs and education services in low socio-economic communities and cities.",
      "Some of the organizations that have had their funding abruptly stripped by the Trump administration said the termination of grant money has caused \"damage and chaos\" and have \"upended\" the lives of participants who have been contributing to community assistance projects.",

      "The list of impacted programs obtained by CBS News shows more than 100 grants have been cut in the states with the highest poverty levels:\u00a0 Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky, West Virginia, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Alabama.",
      "The cuts include funding for a child abuse prevention program in Independence, Missouri and several more in California.",

      "In Detroit, grant money for Americorps \"urban safety\" projects was also cancelled.\tThe projects, which were coordinated with the assistance of Wayne State University included the boarding-up of vacant homes and clearing of vacant lots to improve public safety and reduce crime threats.",
      "In a statement, Ramona Washington, the director of Wayne State University's Urban Safety Program, said the termination of $1.3 million in funding \"halted vital outreach and community support efforts carried out by WSU faculty, staff, students, and AmeriCorps members.\"",
      "\"Our students, who serve as AmeriCorps members, have helped lead community-engaged research and service-learning initiatives that improve urban public safety and public health. Without this support, the progress we've made in building safer, healthier neighborhoods is at serious risk,\" Washington said.",
      "A Wayne State University spokesperson told CBS News the organization's Americorps activities also included \"outreach in Detroit Police Precincts to connect with victims of domestic violence and assist with navigating the process of personal protection orders.\"",
      "The cuts also include money for a Boys and Girls Club program in West Palm Beach, Florida, which is home to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, according to the list obtained by CBS News from a source familiar with the cuts.",
      "The High Rocks Educational Corporation in Lewisburg, West Virginia also lost AmeriCorps funding. An organization spokeswoman told CBS News the cuts could have a dramatic impact on its ability to help young people opportunities in the state and could exacerbate the declining youth population in the Mountain State.",
      "The organization was also vital in helping Greenbrier County respond to and recover from the calamitous flooding in White Sulpher Springs in 2016.\tThe list obtained by CBS News showed High Rocks was receiving a $1.4 million dollar grant through an AmeriCorps program. West Virginia has some of the neediest communities and highest per capita usage of AmeriCorps programs and funds, according to multiple sources.",
      "There have been at least two lawsuits filed over the terminations. A handful of impacted organizations and nonprofits have filed a federal civil lawsuit in Maryland seeking a court order to halt the dismantling of AmeriCorps.",
      "One of the organizations that filed the suit, the Red Cloud Indian School in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, said it had received funding for 26 years to help respond to a \"critical teacher shortage\" in one of the nation's poorest regions. CBS News has learned the program was receiving a $395,621 grant.",
      "In the civil lawsuit, some of the grant recipients argue, \"These sweeping actions have forced the early dismissal of participants, halted ongoing projects at organizations across the country, and jeopardized critical support for communities nationwide, with particularly severe impacts on rural areas where AmeriCorps programs have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support.\"",

      "The administration's assertion of the privilege was revealed in an order from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, which asked lawyers for Abrego Garcia and the Justice Department to file additional legal papers about the administration's \"invocations of privilege, principally the state secrets and deliberative process privileges.\"",
      "Xinis gave the two sides until Monday to submit the filings \"addressing the legal and factual bases for the invocation of those privileges,\" including a request from Abrego Garcia's lawyers for the court to conduct a review of \"the withheld documents.\" The judge also set a hearing for May 16 at the courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland.",
      "The Justice Department had indicated last month that it would invoke certain privileges to protect information regarding Abrego Garcia's removal from the U.S., citing in a filing the attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege and certain executive privileges.",
      "Administration lawyers had said that a request for documents from Abrego Garcia's legal team about the terms of any arrangement regarding the government's use of El Salvador's notorious prison to house deportees from the U.S. \"calls for the immediate production of classified documents, as well as documents that defendants may elect to assert are subject to the protections of attorney-client privilege and the state secrets privilege.\"",
      "Xinis told a lawyer with the administration during a hearing last month that if they do assert privileges, they must provide justifications for each claim, and she will make a determination as to whether they can stand.",
      "The Trump administration has invoked the state secrets privilege before, in a case involving the deportations of Venezuelan migrants to the Salvadoran prison, called the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "In Abrego Garcia's case, Xinis had ordered the Trump administration to turn over documents to his lawyers and allowed them to conduct depositions with certain administration officials. Some of the records were initially due last month, but Xinis agreed to push back her deadlines after the Trump administration filed information with the court under seal. One day earlier, Xinis had accused the administration of showing a \"willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\"",
      "Under the judge's latest order, the Trump administration had until Monday to answer and respond to outstanding discovery requests and provide information about their invocation of privileges. Depositions of four Homeland Security and State Department officials are to be completed by Friday, according to the order.",
      "Xinis allowed the expedited discovery process to begin last month after Abrego Garcia's legal team accused the Trump administration of failing to follow her order to facilitate his return to the U.S. The Supreme Court had agreed that the administration had to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "President Trump and other top administration officials have repeatedly said it is up to El Salvador whether to release Abrego Garcia, who had been held at CECOT. As of April 21, he was being held at\u00a0a lower-security facility\u00a0in Santa Ana, according to a declaration from a State Department official.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who was born in El Salvador, entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 and has been living in Maryland since then. He was granted a withholding of removal, a legal status, in 2019 that prevented the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador because of a risk of persecution by local gangs.",

      "A federal immigration official acknowledged that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the administration has since declined to return him to the U.S. Instead, top administration officials have claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant. His lawyers, however, argue that Abrego Garcia is not a member of MS-13 or any other gang, and has never been charged or convicted of any crimes in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country.",

    "summary": "A federal appellate panel will hear arguments on where and whether Mohsen Mahdawi and Rumesya Ozturk should be detained as cases challenging their confinements proceed.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appellate panel on Tuesday considered high-profile cases involving two international students who were detained by federal immigration officials and now face removal from the U.S. after they made statements that were critical of Israel.",
      "The panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit heard arguments in emergency appeals from the Trump administration after two federal judges issued separate decisions in favor of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, and Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student at Columbia University, last month.",
      "Administration officials are asking the 2nd Circuit to pause the lower court orders issued in Ozturk and Mahdawi's cases while their challenges to their respective detentions move forward. In Ozturk's case, U.S. District Judge William Sessions issued an order for Ozturk, who is being detained at a facility in Louisiana, to be transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in Vermont and set a bail hearing for her to attend in person on May 9.",
      "U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered Mahdawi's release from immigration custody while the challenge to his detention proceeds.",
      "Appeals court Judges Barrington Parker, Susan Carney and Alison Nathan weighed the administration's request for a stay of the two orders, and said following arguments that they will take the matters under advisement.",
      "The cases are still in their early stages, and the lower court judges, Sessions and Crawford, are still weighing Ozturk and Mahdawi's respective habeas corpus challenges to their confinement. But a key issue in the two cases is untangling the removal proceedings playing out in immigration court from the challenges to their detentions that were filed in federal court, and what is required in each of those cases.",
      "Ozturk, a Ph.D. student at Tufts, was arrested by federal immigration officials near her Somerville, Massachusetts, apartment on March 25, after the Trump administration revoked her student visa. She was not notified of the revocation before her arrest, according to court records.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in March that at least 300 students studying at American universities have had their visas rescinded after they were accused of expressing support for Palestinians or participating in campus protests.",
      "Ozturk co-authored an opinion piece in the Tufts' student newspaper that criticized the school for its dismissal of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate as a \"sincere effort to hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\" The op-ed\u00a0did not mention Hamas.",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, Esha Bhandari, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Ozturk, said her client has been \"held behind bars for six weeks while her health deteriorates for writing an op-ed.\" All she is asking for is for the temporary transfer order to be completed as court proceedings play out in Vermont, Bhandari said.",
      "\"The executive branch made a specific decision to detain Ms. Ozturk because of her speech,\" she said.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in part that the district court in Vermont does not have jurisdiction over Ozturk's habeas petition because it was not filed where she is confined \u2014 Louisiana \u2014 and did not name her immediate custodian as a defendant \u2014 the warden at the detention center.",
      "But Bhandari argued that the executive branch effectively suspended the writ of habeas corpus on its own by refusing to specify to Ozturk's lawyers who had custody of her, which would have allowed them to name that person as the defendant in Ozturk's challenge to her detention.",
      "Bhandari called the government's position \"breathtaking.\"",
      "According to court filings, a memorandum from a senior official with the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs said Ozturk's visa was revoked based on a request from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, which determined that she \"had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization.'\"",
      "After she was arrested, Ozturk was transported to Methuen, Massachusetts, and transported to Lebanon, New Hampshire, followed by St. Albans, Vermont, where she was kept overnight. On the morning of March 26, in Burlington, Vermont, Ozturk was put on a plane and flown to Louisiana, where she is currently in custody at an immigration facility in Basile.",
      "Ozturk's lawyers filed a petition challenging her arrest and detention as a violation of the First and Fifth Amendments in federal district court in Massachusetts. But the case was transferred to Sessions' court in Vermont after it was determined that Ozturk was detained in that state at the time the petition was filed.",
      "The Justice Department sought to dismiss Ozturk's petition while her lawyers asked Sessions to order her to be released or transferred to Vermont while her claims are adjudicated.",
      "Sessions last month ruled that Ozturk's arrest and detention raised \"significant constitutional concerns\" and said she must be transferred to ICE custody in Vermont by May 1. He also set a bail hearing for May 9, with Ozturk appearing in person, and will consider the merits of her habeas petition on May 22.",
      "The 2nd Circuit temporarily paused Sessions' order late last month while it considers the Trump administration's request for emergency relief.",
      "Mahdawi, who is to graduate from Columbia this month with a bachelor's degree in philosophy, was detained by immigration agents in Vermont last month during what he was told was his citizenship interview.",
      "He was born in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and he has held a green card for the last 10 years and co-founded his university's Palestinian Student Union, alongside Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, Columbia Ph.D. student and U.S. resident detained by the government. Mahdawi's attorneys said he took a \"step back\" from the high-profile protests at the school before students began occupying university buildings.",
      "Khalil, a Palestinian born in Syria, was a vocal member of last year's protests at Columbia. He was arrested by ICE in March. He is also challenging his removal and detention, though an immigration judge allowed the government to proceed with its effort to deport Khalil.",
      "In an interview with CBS News the day before his arrest, Mahdawi called the interview a \"honey trap\" that allowed federal immigration officials to detain him while he went in to pursue U.S. citizenship.",
      "Mahdawi's attorneys secured a court order that blocked the Trump administration from deporting him or moving him outside of Vermont. Then, last week, Crawford released Mahdawi from federal detention as his immigration proceedings continue and again barred the government from removing him from the state or country.",
      "A U.S. attorney arguing against Mahdawi's release said that keeping him in detention would be a \"constitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process\" and argued in court filings that Mahdawi's \"presence and activities\" in the U.S. \"have serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" if he remains here.",
      "But Naz Ahmad, who argued on Mahdawi's behalf before the 2nd Circuit, told the judges that the government's detention of her client was \"retaliatory\" and had not only chilled his speech, but also others. He is challenging his detention as a violation of the First and First Amendments.",
      "If the 2nd Circuit grants the Justice Department's request for the stay in Mahdawi's case, it would allow immigration authorities to re-detain him. But two of the judges on the panel seemed to question how the government is harmed by the lower court's decision ordering Mahdawi's release.",
      "Barrington asked Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, whether an \"adverse\" decision constitutes irreparable harm to the government. Irreparable harm is one of four factors courts analyze when considering whether to grant a stay of a lower court order.",
      "Ensign mentioned operational costs to the government that would arise from Mahdawi having to participate in immigration proceedings, which are being held separately in Louisiana, from Vermont.",
      "One of the judges noted that in both Mahdawi and Ozturk's cases, the district court judges have indicated a \"strong desire\" to move quickly when considering the challenges to their allegedly unlawful detentions.",
      "The Trump administration has been cracking down on U.S. universities and their students who were involved in pro-Palestinian protests waged after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, which triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order in January that ordered his administration to use \"all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.\" The White House said that these efforts would include deporting alleged \"Hamas sympathizers\" and revoking student visas.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to comply with a lower court order that requires it to transfer Tufts Ph.D. student Rumeysa Ozturk from a detention facility in Louisiana to Vermont.",
      "The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit rejected a bid for emergency relief sought by the Trump administration in Ozturk's challenge to her detention. The decision came after the 2nd Circuit panel heard arguments Tuesday on the Justice Department's request for it to pause a district court's order that required Ozturk to be\u00a0transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody\u00a0in Vermont.",
      "Ozturk is currently detained at an immigration facility in Basile, Louisiana. A bail hearing in her challenge to her confinement is set to take place at the federal district court in Vermont on Friday. The judges on the 2nd Circuit said the Trump administration has one week \u2014 until May 14 \u2014 to comply with the district court's transfer order.",
      "\"Permitting Ozturk's transfer will provide her ready access to legal and medical services, address concerns about the conditions of her confinement, and expedite resolution of this matter \u2014 all of which are required, as the court below noted, to proceed expeditiously,\" Judges Barrington Parker, Susan Carney and Alison Nathan said in their unanimous opinion. \"At stake, too, is Ozturk's ability to participate meaningfully in her habeas proceedings.\"",
      "In response to the decision, Esha Bhandari, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on behalf of Ozturk during Tuesday's proceedings, said she and her client are grateful for the court's decision.",
      "\"No one should be arrested and locked up for their political views,\" she said in a statement. \"Every day that Rumeysa Ozturk remains in detention is a day too long.\"",
      "Ozturk, a 30-year-old doctoral candidate at Tufts, was taken into custody by plainclothes ICE agents near her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, on March 25 after the Trump administration revoked her student visa. She was not notified of the revocation beforehand, according to court documents.",
      "As justification for her arrest and detention, the Department of Homeland Security and ICE have said that Ozturk \"had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization,'\" court filings show.",
      "In 2024, Ozturk had co-authored an opinion piece in the Tufts' student newspaper that criticized the school for its dismissal of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate as a \"sincere effort to hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\" The op-ed\u00a0did not mention Hamas.",

But the case was transferred to the U.S. district court in Vermont after it was determined that Ozturk was detained in that state at the time the petition was filed.",
      "The Justice Department sought to dismiss Ozturk's petition, claiming the district court in Vermont lacks jurisdiction since Ozturk is confined in Louisiana. But Ozturk's lawyers asked U.S. District Judge William Sessions to order her to be released or transferred to Vermont while her claims are adjudicated. Sessions last month ruled that Ozturk had to be transferred to ICE custody in Vermont by May 1. He also set a bail hearing for May 9, with Ozturk appearing in person, and will consider the merits of her habeas petition on May 22.",
      "The 2nd Circuit then temporarily halted Sessions' order while it considered the Trump administration's emergency appeal.",
      "The judges said that Ozturk's constitutional challenge to her detention can move forward, even amid a potential challenge to deportation from the U.S., which would arise after an order of removal has been entered by an immigration judge and affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals.",
      "\"She asserts that the government arrested and detained her to prevent speech with which it disagrees. Such an act would be a violation of the Constitution \u2014 quite separate from the removal procedures followed by the immigration courts,\" they wrote.",
      "The panel noted that Ozturk is not seeking to disrupt removal proceedings and said she can attend any hearings before an immigration judge remotely from Vermont.",
      "The judges also highlighted the timeline of the government's actions moving Ozturk from Massachusetts, where she was arrested, to Louisiana. A federal district judge in Massachusetts had blocked the government from moving Ozturk outside of the state without first providing advance notice, and issued that directive without an hour of the petition challenging her detention being filed.",
      "\"Although not technically non-compliant, despite this order, the government moved Ozturk from Vermont to Louisiana the next morning,\" the 2nd Circuit panel said.",
      "The appeals court considered Ozturk's case alongside that of another international student,\u00a0Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student at Columbia University. Mahdawi, a green card holder who was born in the West Bank, was detained by immigration agents in Vermont last month during what he was told was a citizenship interview.",
      "But U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford\u00a0ordered Mahdawi's release from immigration custody while a challenge to his detention proceeds. The Trump administration appealed that decision and asked the 2nd Circuit to pause the ruling, which would allow immigration authorities to re-detain him.",

      "In a post on X, Kemp said, \"Being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for me and my family.\"",
      "He added that he spoke with Senate GOP leadership and President Trump and \"expressed my commitment to work alongside them to ensure we have a strong Republican nominee who can win next November.\"",
      "Kemp was a top recruiting target for Senate Republicans. The Senate race in Georgia is one of next year's most closely watched contests, and retaining the seat could prove essential to Democrats' efforts to regain control of the upper chamber where Republicans currently hold a 53-47 edge.",
      "Prior to Monday's announcement, Kemp informed GOP leaders \u2014 including Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee \u2014 that he was not going to run for the seat, citing reservations from his family, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",

Raphael Warnock was reelected by fewer than three points in 2022, beating Trump-backed ex-football star Herschel Walker.",
      "Kemp's plans for the Senate race were closely watched due to his popularity in the state. The term-limited governor defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams by just 1.4 points in 2018, but improved his margin to 7.5 points in a 2022 rematch against Abrams. Kemp also easily staved off a Trump-backed primary challenge by Perdue in 2022, beating him by over 50 points.",
      "Kemp and Mr. Trump have a rocky relationship, dating back to the governor's refusal to help the president overturn his narrow 2020 election loss in Georgia. Mr. Trump endorsed Perdue's primary election, calling Kemp the \"WORST Governor in the Country on Election Integrity.\" Kemp later endorsed Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, and Mr. Trump won back Georgia.",
      "With Kemp out of the race, it's unclear who will seek to run against Ossoff.",
      "Mr. Trump said in 2023 he would \"fight like hell\" for Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene if she runs for Senate. The firebrand lawmaker said earlier this year she's \"considering all possibilities\" when asked if she will run for statewide office in 2026.",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are rebelling against a crypto regulation bill, putting the first-of-its-kind legislation in jeopardy ahead of a possible key vote on it later this week.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance.",
      "The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins.",
      "Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday \"we need to start moving forward.\" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes.",

      "\"Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,\" it says.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, \"Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption.\"",
      "The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets.",
      "\"Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,\" Merkley said in a statement. \"This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately.\"",

      "The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth \u2014 or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024.",
      "In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's \"assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.\"",

      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on behalf of the plaintiffs, said in a statement that the district court \"joined several others in correctly recognizing the president cannot simply declare that there's been an invasion and then invoke a wartime authority during peacetime to send individuals to a Gulag-type prison in El Salvador without even giving them due process.\"",
      "Hellerstein was the second federal judge to bar Trump administration officials from using the proclamation invoking the 1798 law to remove certain Venezuelan migrants at risk of deportation. U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, ruled last week that Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is unlawful and blocked administration officials from using the law and the president's proclamation to detain, transfer or remove Venezuelan migrants who either live or are detained in southern Texas.",
      "Later Tuesday, a third judge, Charlotte Sweeney, blocked the administration from detaining or removing migrants in Colorado who are subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act. In her\u00a0decision, Sweeney rejected the Trump administration's claim that federal courts have no role in determining whether the preconditions for using the law are satisfied, saying it \"staggers.\"",
      "\"It is wrong as a matter of law and attempts to read an entire provision out of the Constitution,\" she wrote.",
      "Sweeney, appointed by President Joe Biden, found that the plaintiffs in the case before her were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is unlawful.",
      "Challenges to Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act have been filed throughout the country in response to a Supreme Court decision last month that allowed removals under the law. But the high court said that Venezuelan migrants covered by the declaration are entitled to notice and the opportunity to challenge their confinement and removal under the Alien Enemies Act through habeas corpus proceedings brought in the district where they are being detained.",
      "The two-century-old law has only been employed previously during three periods of declared wars. But in March, Mr. Trump issued a proclamation claiming that the gang Tren de Aragua \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\" Mr. Trump's proclamation said that all Venezuelan citizens who are at least 14 years old and in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to apprehension and removal as \"alien enemies.\"",
      "The declaration claimed that the gang is undertaking \"hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare\" against the U.S. directly and at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's regime. But an April assessment from the National Intelligence Council obtained by the Freedom of the Press Foundation through a public records request found that \"while Venezuela's permissive environment enables TDA to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States.\"",
      "The declassified assessment said that most of the intelligence community \"judges that intelligence indicating that regime leaders are directing or enabling TDA migration to the United States is not credible.\"",
      "The case before Hellerstein was brought by two plaintiffs \u2014 identified in filings as G.F.F. and J.G.O. \u2014 who were initially detained at the Orange County Jail in New York and were transferred to an immigration facility in Texas to be deported to El Salvador. But they were removed from a plane in response to temporary orders issued by a federal district judge in Washington, D.C., as part of a challenge to Mr. Trump's efforts to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act. That case ultimately landed before the Supreme Court.",
      "The two plaintiffs were returned to the jail, where they remain confined and \"under threat of imminent removal,\" according to Hellerstein's opinion. The migrants brought a challenge under habeas corpus in early April in the Southern District of New York on behalf of themselves and other noncitizens in the region at risk of deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, and Hellerstein agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from removing them from the U.S. under the president's proclamation unless they received a notice in English and Spanish and a hearing.",
      "His temporary order was to remain in place while he considered the Venezuelan migrants request for a preliminary injunction, which he granted Tuesday after finding that absent such relief, they would be deported to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT. Hellerstein said that once there, \"they would endure abuse and inhumane treatment with no recourse to bring them back.\"",
      "In his opinion, Hellerstein first called the notice provided by immigration officers to those subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act a \"fleeting affair\" and a \"bare bones form letter.\"",
      "\"Petitioners have not been given notice of what they allegedly did to join TdA, when they joined, and what they did in the United States, or anywhere else, to share or further the illicit objectives of the TdA,\" Hellerstein wrote. \"Without such proof, petitioners are subject to removal by the executive's dictate alone, in contravention of the AEA and the constitutional requirements of due process.\"",
      "The judge said that the procedures used by the Trump administration have already led to the wrongful removal of at least two migrants to CECOT. One of those migrants is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who the Trump administration admitted was mistakenly removed to El Salvador as a result of an \"administrative error.\" A federal judge, U.S. appeals court and the Supreme Court have said the U.S. has to facilitate his release from Salvadoran custody, but the Trump administration has claimed it's up to El Salvador to return him.",
      "Hellerstein also said that the grounds for Mr. Trump's proclamation \u2014 that Tren de Aragua has engaged in either a war, invasion or predatory incursion of the U.S. \u2014 \"do not exist.\"",
      "\"There is nothing in the AEA that justifies a finding that refugees migrating from Venezuela, or TdA gangsters who infiltrate the migrants, are engaged in an 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote. \"They do not seek to occupy territory, to oust American jurisdiction from any territory, or to ravage territory. TdA may well be engaged in narcotics trafficking, but that is a criminal matter, not an invasion or predatory incursion.\"",
      "The Trump administration can appeal the decision.",

At Tuesday's Oval Office meeting, Carney said Canada \"won't be for sale, ever,\" while Mr. Trump mused, \"never say never.\"",

      "But, he said in an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that \"something could happen with Greenland, I'll be honest,\" adding that \"we need that for national and international security.\"",
      "Even before Mr. Trump took office in January, he talked about acquiring the Panama Canal and Greenland, and he has ramped up his rhetoric on Greenland in recent weeks, declining to rule out military force. Greenland is a semi-autonomous state in the Kingdom of Denmark, although there is a U.S. military base, Mr. Trump's comments have not been well received\u00a0there.",

      "\"Listen to what Putin said when he talked about going from Kyiv into Ukraine, and why he can't stand the fact that the Russian dictatorship that he runs, that the Soviet Union has collapsed, and anybody thinks he's going to stop is this foolish,\" Biden said.",
      "Biden continued that he \"found it sort of beneath America the way that took place,\" as well as Mr. Trump's actions renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Mr. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office to rename the Gulf, and has since blocked Associated Press\u00a0reporters from covering certain Oval Office events for refusing to comply with that order.",
      "Mr. Trump has long been suspicious of the alliance with Europe\u00a0formed after World War II, saying in March that\u00a0the continent has been \"very, very bad for us.\"",
      "Biden said forming NATO is \"one of the smartest things we did,\" and called it a \"grave concern\" that the alliance could be ending.",
      "\"I think it would change the modern history of the world that occurs,\" Biden said. \"Look, we are not the essential nation, but we're the only nation in a position to have the capacity to bring people together, to lead the world, and otherwise you're going to have China and the former Soviet Union, Russia stepping out.\"",
      "In response to Biden's comments, White House spokesman Steven Cheung posted on social media that Biden is a \"complete disgrace to this country and the office he occupied.\"",
      "Democrats have fumed and struggled to reorganize themselves after Mr. Trump's victory, with much of the fury going toward Biden for staying in the 2024 race for too long.

      "\"We've tried to move beyond the obsession with the 30-day ceasefire and more on the what would the long-term settlement look like? And we've tried to consistently advance the ball,\" the vice president said.",

      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has sought to trim the federal workforce through a combination of layoffs and so-called deferred resignation. Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla,\u00a0said\u00a0on the electric vehicle maker's April 22 earnings call that DOGE's efforts \"in addressing waste and fraud\" will \"get the country back on track.\"",
      "The IRS has been a focus of DOGE's cost-cutting efforts, with plans to trim as much as 40% of its workforce this year. Through March, those efforts have resulted in the tax agency losing about 11% of its workforce, the May 2 report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found.",
      "But revenue agents \u2014 the IRS workers who perform audits \u2014 have seen a much bigger hit, with 31% of those workers, or about 3,600 auditors, taking either the deferred resignation plan or getting fired in the first three months of 2025, the report found. Losing a large share of auditors could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, given that these agents typically handle cases involving wealthy taxpayers or corporations, experts say.",
      "\"You lose the very staff trained to keep high-end taxpayers and corporate tax payers in compliance,\" noted Emily DiVito, senior adviser on economic policy at the left-leaning Groundwork Collaborative and a former policy adviser at the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS.",
      "She added, \"You can see some behavioral effects when taxpayers, especially those that really don't want to pay their bills, come to accept there is very little risk to not paying at all, or even filing.\"",
      "Reached for comment, a Treasury spokeswoman said, \"The Biden Administration grew the IRS from 79,431 to 102,309 personnel. Under new leadership, approximately the same number of employees have left the IRS, with a vast majority leaving voluntarily through the Deferred Resignation Program. The roll back of wasteful Biden-era hiring surges, and consolidation of critical support functions are vital to improve both efficiency and quality of service. The Secretary is committed to ensuring that efficiency is realized while providing the collections, privacy, and customer service the American people deserve.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately return a request for comment about the TIGTA report.",
      "While the TIGTA report didn't explain why auditor departures outpaced that of overall cuts at the IRS, the tax agency had made an effort under the Biden administration to hire more auditors in order to beef up revenue collection. In February 2024, the IRS had said it expected to collect hundreds of billions in additional taxes after using funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to hire more auditors.",
      "Because the DOGE cuts have focused on firing so-called \"probationary workers,\" or junior federal employees who typically have less than a year or two on the job, there may have been more newly hired auditors who were impacted by the reductions, DeVito said.",
      "Reducing federal revenue?",
      "Auditing wealthy Americans and corporations can be lucrative for the federal government. In fiscal year 2023, auditors recommended an additional $32 billion in tax assessments, the TIGTA report said.",
      "And every $1 spent on auditing the top 0.1% of earners can return about $26 in tax revenue, according to an analysis from Better IRS, an advocacy group for free tax filing.",
      "The cuts to the IRS' auditing force raises questions about the effectiveness of DOGE's efforts, given that the tax agency is responsible for collecting the bulk of the nation's revenue, DeVito added.",
      "The combination of individual and corporate income taxes provides about 60 cents for every $1 in federal revenue, with the remaining 40 cents coming from payroll taxes and fees, such as paying admission to national parks, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "DOGE's cost-cutting efforts may end up costing almost as much as they've saved, according to an analysis last month from the nonpartisan research group the Partnership for Public Service.",
      "DOGE claims to have saved $165 billion, but the Partnership for Public Service estimates that the savings have come at a cost of $135 billion due to paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity. That figure also excludes the impact of multiple lawsuits filed against DOGE's actions, as well as lost tax revenue due to IRS cuts, the group said.",
      "The IRS could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an\u00a0estimate\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "\"The argument from DOGE is to save money \u2014 that if we don't have as big of a federal workforce, then we are saving the government money,\" DeVito said. But given the potential to lose out on tax revenue, the IRS reduction \"simply doesn't make sense,\" she said.",

      "Federal dollars match state payments with no limit. While the split varies based on a state's per capita income, the federal match ranges from 50% to 77% for children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities, who make up most of the enrollment.",
      "States started using provider taxes in the 1980s to help pay their share and gain additional Medicaid funds from the federal government.",
      "Brian Blase, a former Trump health policy adviser who leads the conservative Paragon Health Institute, sees provider taxes as one of the highest forms of waste in Medicaid. States and their hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers aren't held accountable for how the tax money is used, reducing incentives for states to control Medicaid spending, he said.",
      "\"This has been a feature of the program for four decades, and it is a feature that is getting worse,\" Blase said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimates eliminating provider taxes would save the federal government more than $600 billion over a decade.",
      "Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.), who chairs the House committee that oversees Medicaid, has said provider taxes are on the menu for potential cuts.",
      "Other changes Republicans are considering to cut federal Medicaid spending include requiring adult enrollees to prove they're working as a condition of eligibility, as well as ending higher payments for adults enrolled as part of the Affordable Care Act's expansion of the program.",
      "Since 2014, more than 20 million nondisabled adults in 40 states and Washington, D.C., have gained coverage under the expansion.",
      "House Republicans have set a Memorial Day deadline to come to an agreement on spending cuts, which would help pay for extending about $4 trillion in tax cuts passed during Mr. Trump's first administration and set to expire at the end of this year.",
      "The Government Accountability Office and the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, a congressional advisory board, have raised concerns about the provider taxes, which effectively saddle federal taxpayers with state expenses. Republican and Democrat presidents have criticized or proposed curtailing the use of Medicaid provider taxes \u2014 including Mr. Trump in his first term, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden while serving as vice president.",
      "But opposition from hospitals, nursing homes, and states snuffed out any move to limit or end the arrangements.",
      "Colorado and other states often use the money to maintain or increase payments to providers, which are often paid less by Medicaid than by Medicare, the federal program primarily for people 65 or older, or private insurers.",
      "States have added provider taxes to help generate federal money to cope with economic downturns and budget constraints.",
      "Hospitals in Idaho last year began paying an additional provider tax to increase pay to hospitals and home- and community-based providers. The tax came as Idaho's Republican-controlled legislature sought to add many conditions that threatened to end the state's Medicaid expansion \u2014 which would also eliminate a key source of increased federal funding.",
      "Brian Whitlock, president and CEO of the Idaho Hospital Association, said funding from the hospital tax helps boost Medicaid payments to about 80% of Medicare's rates instead of 60%.",
      "\"We still lose money on every Medicare and Medicaid patient,\" he said. \"The state recognizes that this money helps offset the losses we take under Medicaid reimbursement.\"",
      "While hospitals and nursing homes have been the main beneficiaries of provider tax proceeds, ambulance services have also paid and benefited from Medicaid taxes. States increasingly have also approved Medicaid taxes on private insurers that operate their Medicaid programs to gain more federal funds.",
      "California's Medicaid managed care tax began in 2009 and is expected to generate nearly $9 billion in net revenue for the 2024-25 fiscal period \u2014 or about 5% of the state's Medicaid budget, according to the California Legislative Analyst's Office.",
      "In recent years, California has extended full Medicaid coverage to immigrants lacking permanent legal status. Federal law prohibits federal Medicaid dollars from being used to cover people in the country without authorization, but states can use their own money.",
      "At a presentation to congressional staffers in April, Blase cited California's strategy as an example of provider tax abuse and claimed the state is effectively laundering federal funds to cover people living in the country illegally.",
      "In practice, the tax has been a kind of fiscal pressure valve generally offsetting state spending. A ballot measure that passed in November now requires that much of the money from California's tax specifically be used to increase Medicaid reimbursement to doctors, hospitals, and other providers.",
      "Hospital officials and state Medicaid leaders argue the term \"money laundering\" is an inaccurate way to describe provider taxes, since they are allowed by federal law. But Blase said calling the levies a \"tax\" is misleading, pointing out that most businesses don't typically advocate to pay one.",
      "Jamie Whitney, chief legal officer for Texas-based Adelanto HealthCare Ventures, a consulting firm, said that provider taxes are a politically neutral way to help states pay for Medicaid and that curtailing their use would harm them all. \"This is not a red-state, blue-state issue,\" she said.",
      "Colorado is one of more than a dozen states that have funded an ACA Medicaid expansion using provider tax money. Others include Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia.",
      "Colorado implemented its Medicaid provider tax effort in 2009. In the 2024 fiscal year, about $5 billion of the state's $15 billion Medicaid program was funded by provider taxes, according to the state.",
      "The money helps the state pay higher Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals, which reduces their need to charge higher rates to private insurers, said Kim Bimestefer, executive director of the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which oversees Medicaid.",
      "Some of the extra payments are dependent on hospitals meeting certain quality and patient-safety metrics, such as reducing readmission rates after patients are discharged \u2014 a requirement state officials say improves care for everyone.",
      "The provider taxes also fund a program allowing working residents with disabilities to buy into Medicaid coverage even if their income is as high as 300% of the federal poverty level, or $46,950 for an individual. About 20,000 people are enrolled in the program.",
      "Among them is Alison Sbrana, 31, of Fort Collins, Colorado, who has a type of chronic fatigue syndrome and relies on Medicaid to cover long-term home care.",
      "\"It would be devastating if the benefit went away,\" said Sbrana, who works as a researcher and activist for those with the same disorder. \"I would be forced to stop working to keep my income low enough to qualify.\"",
      "The state's provider taxes also pay for a $60 million fund to support rural hospitals, helping them add telehealth services, recruit surgeons, and hire paramedics, according to a state report.",
      "Konnie Martin, CEO of San Luis Valley Health, a two-hospital system based in Alamosa, Colorado, said her nonprofit paid $5.4 million in provider taxes last year and gained about $15 million in benefits from higher Medicaid payments and the rural grants.",
      "She said the money helps her hospital maintain obstetrical services, so residents don't have to drive 120 miles to the nearest maternity hospital. Without the birthing center, the entire region would suffer, she said.",
      "\"It also would gut the economy of the community, because young people will move away,\" she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 06 May 2025 19:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Many investments Mr. Trump claims credit for predate his return to office or are based on vague future pledges. Here's a fact check of his claims.",
    "story": [
      "After President Trump was pressed on rising consumer prices and slowing economic growth, he defended his tariff policies by claiming they had spurred record investment in the United States.",
      "\"I think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview on\u00a0NBC's Meet the Press that aired Sunday. \"If you look at other presidents, there's never been anything like that.\"",
      "He has also repeatedly claimed that he secured more investment in his first two months than President Biden did in four years.",
      "Neither claim is supported by evidence, CBS News Confirmed found. While companies have announced hundreds of billions of dollars in planned investments since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the White House has not provided data showing the total approaches $9 trillion.",
      "Additionally, a CBS News review found that some investments highlighted by the White House were announced before Mr. Trump's reelection. The comparison to the Biden administration is also misleading: the president is citing future investments pledges, while contrasting them with a narrower list of projects that were in the works or completed by the end of his predecessor's term.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the claims.",
      "Some investments Trump claims credit for were announced under Biden",
      "The White House on April 29 said Mr. Trump had secured $5 trillion of U.S. investment in his first 100 days, and published a partial list titled \"The Trump Effect\" \u2014 which it said demonstrated \"his America First economic policies have sparked trillions of dollars in new investment.\"",
      "That list totals closer to $2 trillion from private companies, and around $5 trillion if commitments from foreign countries are included. The basis for the president's $9 trillion claim is unclear and the administration has not explained the discrepancy.",
      "A closer look at the White House list also shows some of the investments had been announced before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The list initially included a $4.1 billion commitment from Novelis, a Georgia-based aluminum company, to build a plant in southern Alabama. But construction for that project began in October 2022 and the $4.1 billion total investment was detailed in the company's February 2024 financial report. CBS News asked the White House on May 5 why the project was included; the administration did not answer the question, but by midday May 6 the project had been removed from the website.",
      "The Trump administration also claimed credit for a $1.5 billion pledge by Corning to invest in its solar products facility in Michigan. A company spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that $900 million of this funding was announced months before Mr. Trump assumed office. On April 29, Corning announced an additional $600 million investment, bringing the total to $1.5 billion.",
      "Likewise, the White House listed Johnson & Johnson's commitment to spend $55 billion over the next four years, but a company spokesperson confirmed that total includes a $2 billion investment \u2014 announced last October \u2014 in a facility in Wilson, North Carolina.",
      "The list also includes the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative announced by Open AI and Japan-based Softbank on Jan. 21, which had been in development for at least a year before Mr. Trump's inauguration. The companies said $100 billion would be deployed \"immediately,\" but offered few specifics on how or where the money would be spent.",
      "Comparing to investments under Biden",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he attracted more investment in two months than Biden did in four years, suggesting he brought in trillions in a matter of weeks while casting doubt that the former president secured even $1 trillion during his term.",
      "But there's no clear evidence to support his claim. A White House spokesperson said the president was referring to a December 2024 report from the Biden White House, which said the private sector committed at least $1 trillion to clean energy and manufacturing projects during Biden's term.",
      "However, Biden's list of investments highlighted \"a selection of private-sector investments in 21st century industries\" including green energy, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, based on project announcements in specific locations or factories under construction. The data on Biden's \"Investing in America\" spreadsheet also showed projects that closely resemble some on Mr. Trump's list.",
      "By comparison, the Trump administration's list includes broader, less specific investment pledges across a variety of industries \u2014 many without clear timelines or locations.",
      "For example, Mr. Trump's list highlights Apple's recent $500 billion pledge to U.S. manufacturing and training. However, as previously reported by The Washington Post, Apple also announced a $430 billion investment early in Biden's term, including a North Carolina engineering hub that was paused in 2024, and the Biden administration's report does not include any Apple investments in its tally.",
      "However, experts caution that announcements about planned investments don't guarantee action.",
      "\"Companies often will make announcements to essentially curry favor with an incoming administration to show how committed they are to the United States,\" said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S. \"It's not unusual whether it was President Trump or President Biden or President Obama.\"",
      "Presidents from both parties have claimed credit for projects started under their predecessors. For instance, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced investments during Mr. Trump's first term, some of which contributed to the construction of manufacturing facilities highlighted by the Biden White House investment report.",
      "During his term, Biden signed major pieces of legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which included $24 billion in tax credits to attract private investors in hopes of driving domestic manufacturing commitments.",
      "Such incentives may continue to fuel further projects during Mr. Trump's term, according to Nigro, provided they remain in place \u2014 but the long-term impact of federal policy, including under both Biden and Mr. Trump, may take years to assess.",
      "\"It's very hard to attach these new investments that have been announced as being tied directly to policies of the Trump administration. It's frankly just too early,\" Nigro said.",

      "Most of the Oval Office meeting focused on tariffs and the relationship between Canada and the U.S., with Carney emphatically telling Mr. Trump that Canada is \"not for sale\" and \"won't be for sale, ever,\" while Mr. Trump called the border between the U.S. and Canada \"artificial\" and again raised the idea of Canada joining the U.S.",
      "But part way through the meeting, the president digressed to talk about the Obama Presidential Library, which is being built in Chicago's Jackson Park. In his comments, he derided the project and blamed \"DEI\" and \"woke\" for it being \"a disaster.\"",
      "\"I mean look, President Obama \u2014 and if he wanted help, I'd give him help because I build on time and on budget \u2014 he's building his presidential library in Chicago. It's a disaster,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And he said something to the effect, 'I only want DEI, I only want woke.' He wants woke people to build it. Well, he got woke people and they have massive cost overruns, the job is stopped. I don't know, it's a disaster.\"",
      "According to updates posted on the Obama Foundation website, work has continued to close the exterior of building and install glass and granite finishing, and instal interior windows on the museum levels. The foundation said insulation has also been installed in several other buildings at the complex.",
      "However, Mr. Trump claimed the center is \"millions of dollars, like many, many \u2014 I mean, really, millions of dollars over budget,\" and said the problems were because Pres. Obama \"wanted to be very politically correct and he didn't use good, hard, tough, mean construction workers that I love.\"",
      "\"He wanted people that, like, never did it before and he's got a disaster on his hands,\" he said.",
      "A spokesperson for the Obama Foundation said the president's comments were not based in fact and said they believe he was referencing \"a relatively common dispute between two subcontractors over work that has already been completed.\"",
      "\"Everyone who sees the Obama Presidential Center is blown away by its beauty, scale and the way it will be an economic engine for Chicago and a beacon of hope for the world,\" the foundation said in a statement. \"We look forward to welcoming all visitors to the 19.3-acre campus next spring, to experience a presidential center that not only honors the Obamas' legacy but also lifts up the next generation of leaders.\"",
      "The center's website touts their use of union labor to build the center, which is privately funded and does not use taxpayer dollars. Construction has been ongoing throughout the often-harsh Chicago winter, and the foundation continues to expect that the Obama Presidential Center will open to the public in 2026.",

      "The talks are part of an intense diplomatic campaign by the Trump administration to convince as many nations as possible \u2014 including those with controversial human rights records \u2014 to receive deportees from the U.S., such as migrants whose home countries won't take them back.",
      "The administration has already brokered agreements with several Latin American countries willing to accept migrants who are not their own. In February, the U.S. deported hundreds of African and Asian migrants to Costa Rica and Panama. In March, the Trump administration sent nearly 300 Venezuelans accused of being gang members to El Salvador, which imprisoned them at an infamous mega-prison.",
      "Guatemala has also agreed to take in third country deportees from the U.S. The Mexican government, under a deal that preceded Mr. Trump's second term, has been receiving migrants from other Latin American countries, like Venezuela, caught crossing the U.S. southern border illegally.",

The U.S. has yet to announce any formal deals with these nations.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported on the internal talks with some of these countries in April. The negotiations with Angola and Equatorial Guinea have not been previously reported.",
      "It's unclear who exactly would be sent to the third countries if any deportation arrangements are finalized. But one of the ideas under consideration, the internal government documents show, would be for the U.S. to use the agreements to deport suspected members of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang Mr. Trump has made into a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "How deportees would be treated by governments that are not their own is also an open question. As part of its arrangement with El Salvador, for example, the U.S. agreed to give the Salvadoran government millions of dollars to detain Venezuelans deemed to be Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security referred questions about the deportation negotiations, and how the potential agreements would work, to the Department of State, which did not immediately comment on CBS News' reporting.",

      "On Monday, after CBS News published its story, a spokesperson for the Angolan Embassy in the U.S. said, \"Angola has stated that it is not accepting deported individuals of other nationalities.\"",
      "In recent years, Western countries bedeviled by migration crises and the accompanying political backlash have sought to forge diplomatic agreements that allow them to re-route migrants and asylum-seekers to third countries.",
      "The first Trump administration convinced El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to sign \"safe third country\" deals that allowed the U.S. to divert migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border to those countries; though only one of the deals was implemented before they were scrapped by the Biden administration.",
      "In 2022, the United Kingdom brokered a \"safe third country\" deal with Rwanda, but it was ultimately discontinued amid intense controversy and legal challenges. Under another arrangement, Albania agreed to host migrants in Italian custody, though that effort has been partially blocked by judges.",
      "Andrew Selee, the president of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based research group, said there are many legal, political and humanitarian questions about the agreements the Trump administration is considering, including whether the U.S. will try to ensure deportees are not mistreated in the receiving countries.",
      "A court ruling from April prohibited the Trump administration from sending deportees to a third country without informing them of the destination and allowing them to be screened for any concerns they have about being harmed there.",
      "But Selee said the deportation deals, even if they're limited in scope or held up in court, are principally designed to deter migrants from entering or staying in the U.S. illegally.",

    "story": [
      "Over a dozen states sued the Trump administration Monday for laying off thousands of Health and Human Services staffers, urging a court to reverse job cuts that they argue brought work at large swaths of the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-led health agency to a \"sudden halt.\"",
      "The lawsuit \u2014\u00a0filed in Rhode Island federal court by New York, California, 17 other states and Washington, D.C. \u2014 claims the Trump administration has sought to \"dismantle\" HHS through layoffs that disproportionately hit \"disfavored work and programs,\" like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "HHS is aiming to cut its headcount by 20,000 \u2014 or nearly 25% \u2014 through a combination of layoffs, buyouts and early retirement offers, the department announced in March, framing it as a \"dramatic restructuring\" aimed at making HHS more efficient and cutting redundant or unnecessary services. The cuts are part of a wider initiative by the Trump administration, led by billionaire Elon Musk, to slash the size of the federal government.",
      "Since then, thousands of HHS staff have gotten layoff notices. The cuts have hit large agencies like the FDA and CDC, along with departments that handle mental health, federal poverty guidelines and other services, CBS News has previously reported. Deep cuts are also slated for the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Monday's lawsuit, which names Kennedy and other HHS leaders as defendants, argues these job cuts have \"systematically deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job.\"",
      "The layoffs have allegedly cut off the states from data and made it harder to access grants for everything from worker safety to the Head Start preschool program, the lawsuit argues. The suit also says the agency has shuttered key disease\u00a0testing labs, forcing them to \"find new partners to handle their most difficult testing needs that had previously been handled by the CDC.\"",
      "The states are asking a federal judge to halt Kennedy's directive to reorganize and cut the HHS, arguing the moves exceed HHS's legal authority and violate the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine by slashing programs authorized by Congress.",
      "The suit also takes aim at Kennedy's views, citing his vaccine skepticism and \"history of advocating for the evisceration of the Department's statutorily mandated work promoting public health.\" It also pointed to Kennedy's acknowledgement that 20% of job cuts at the HHS may need to be reversed due to \"mistakes.\"",
      "An HHS spokesperson said in response to the lawsuit, \"HHS remains confident that the process will withstand legal scrutiny.\"",
      "\"We are following the law, period. Nothing has been rushed and multiple rounds of discussions between divisions and HHS occurred before the announcement. Every step taken has been deliberate, collaborative, and consistent with federal personnel policy and civil service protections,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson also defended changes to the agency, saying they \"are designed to strengthen the agency's capacity to serve the American public, not weaken it.\"",
      "Monday's suit is the latest legal action against the Trump administration's cost-cutting drive. Almost two dozen states sued HHS last month for cutting public health grants, and labor unions have sued the government over cuts to other agencies.",

    "summary": "The Hmong diaspora to Minnesota started nearly 50 years ago with one man: Leng Wong. He fled his home of Laos, arriving at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, in the bitter cold, on Feb. 7, 1976.",
    "story": [
      "Minnesota is built by immigrants who've enriched the state with diversity and innovation. One of those groups is the Hmong community.",
      "Minnesota is home to the largest Hmong population in the country, and it all started nearly 50 years ago when\u00a0the Vietnam War ended with the fall of Saigon.",
      "Months after the fall, Leng Wong fled his home of Laos months after serving as a military officer in the Lao Armed Forces during the Secret War, a clandestine operation where\u00a0the CIA recruited and trained thousands of Hmong men\u00a0to fight on behalf of the U.S.",
      "\"Flew missions into different parts of Laos, and I flew in American military operative, translate for them, talk to troops on the ground and relayed it to the American troops,\" Wong said. \"I was traveling with so they could relay it back to the base or the headquarter and call for support.\"",
      "Wong served for 10 years, until the bitter end was inevitable. He knew it was no longer safe for him to stay.",
      "\"They called us traitors, so they don't like us,\" he said. \"It was so chaotic that we really didn't have time to think much about it other than how to survive.\"",
      "He and his family escaped on one of the C-130 cargo planes the Americans had sent to help evacuate refugees.",
      "\"Just the clothes on our back. There was really nothing that we could bring with us,\" he said.",
      "They flew to Thailand, where they would stay for the next nine months. Then, news came of a sponsor.",
      "\"There was a lot of uncertainty, what I would be facing in a new land,\" Wong said.",
      "He arrived at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, in the bitter cold, on Feb. 7, 1976.",
      "\"I was having trouble catching my breath because it was so cold, and we're not used to that type of cold in our home country,\" he said.",
      "Frigid, and foreign, Wong was often met with a cold shoulder. He says his biggest barriers at first were language and culture.",
      "\"Initially, we were faced with some resentment from the community as well, thinking that we were here taking away services,\" he said.",
      "Even so, Wong still felt the need to help others just like him. He made it his aim to improve the lives of other Hmong people who would be following in his footsteps.",
      "\"I was able to communicate and translate for people, so I'd be busy day and night,\" he said. \"We'd be at the hospital, the clinic, at the airport.\"",
      "Wong would spend years working for refugee programs with Lutheran Social Services and the state, helping people find jobs and working with employers to create those jobs.",
      "He'd also advocate for policy changes in support of refugees, all while traveling across Minnesota, and eventually across the country, to break down barriers and to educate others on the Hmong people.",
      "These days, Wong owns several commercial buildings across the Twin Cities, and also has his sights set on building more affordable housing for all Minnesota families.",
      "\"I don't think I'll ever retire. I think I will continue to advocate for our community and to work and contribute back to our community, as well as the community at large,\" he said.",
      "Wong is a humble servant, forever thankful for the new land, and its people who accepted him.",
      "\"Minnesota's been good to me. It's always cold, but the people in Minnesota are warm hearts,\" he said. \"We know this is where we belong now, but we still have a part of our heart on the other side of the world that we know we belong there, too.\"",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: Dang Her and his family were the first Hmong immigrants to come to Minnesota in November 1975, according to the Minnesota Historical Society. Leng Wong's family came as the first Hmong refugees in February 1976, according to the Hmong American Partnership.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-errors-living-dead/",
    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 05:00:19 -0400",
    "summary": "In recent weeks, Social Security has been plagued by problems related to technology, system errors, and even the marking of living people as dead.",
    "story": [
      "Rennie Glasgow, who has served 15 years at the Social Security Administration, is seeing something new on the job: dead people.",
      "They're not really dead, of course. In four instances over the past few weeks, he told KFF Health News, his Schenectady, New York, office has seen people come in for whom \"there is no information on the record, just that they are dead.\" So employees have to \"resurrect\" them \u2014 affirm that they're living, so they can receive their benefits.",
      "Revivals were \"sporadic\" before, and there's been an uptick in such cases across upstate New York, said Glasgow. He is also an official with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represented 42,000 Social Security employees just before the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Martin O'Malley, who led the Social Security Administration toward the end of the Biden administration, said in an interview that he had heard similar stories during a recent town hall in Racine, Wisconsin. \"In that room of 200 people, two people raised their hands and said they each had a friend who was wrongly marked as deceased when they're very much alive,\" he said.",
      "It's more than just an inconvenience, because other institutions rely on Social Security numbers to do business, Glasgow said. Being declared dead \"impacts their bank account. This impacts their insurance. This impacts their ability to work. This impacts their ability to get anything done in society.\"",
      "\"They are terminating people's financial lives,\" O'Malley said.",
      "Though it's just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead.",
      "Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times, thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to \"self-deport.\"",
      "Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. \"Why don't you just do due diligence to make sure what you're doing in the first place is correct?\" he said.",
      "The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration's crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program's future.",
      "But KFF Health News' interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities.",
      "Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece's difficulties with Social Security's disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece's address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer \u2014 whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record \u2014 believes they could be zero.",
      "Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece's bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment.",
      "Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore.",
      "The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece's disability payments, \"then she will be homeless,\" Seda recalled telling an agency employee. \"I don't know if I'm going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.\"",
      "Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency's efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, \"it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,\" the committee recently told the agency's inspector general.",
      "While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they're owed, she said.",
      "For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according to a January survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance.",
      "Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that's nearly unprecedented in their experience.",
      "Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members' March payments were several days late. \"For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,\" she said. \"The delayed payment is not something I've heard in the last 20 years.\"",
      "When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Mr. Trump's \"resounding mandate\" to make government more efficient.",
      "\"He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,\" Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions.",
      "Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general's office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News.",
      "A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security \u2014 which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 \u2014 had nearly doubled in March compared with last year.",
      "Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it's getting worse as experienced employees have been let go.",
      "\"We're seeing more mistakes being made,\" said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years' experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. \"We're seeing more things get dropped.\"",
      "What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn't show.",
      "She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem \u2014 only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said.",
      "Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm's policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored \u2014 the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there.",
      "\"To be told they've never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Researchers and lawyers say they have a suspicion about what's behind the problems at Social Security: the Elon Musk-led effort to revamp the agency.",
      "Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O'Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. \"As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,\" he predicted in an April hearing held by House Democrats. \"It's going to mean that if you go to a field office, you're going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.\"",
      "The departures have hit the agency's regional payment centers hard. These centers help process and adjudicate some cases. It's the type of behind-the-scenes work in which \"the problems surface first,\" Romig said. But if the staff doesn't have enough time, \"those things languish.\"",
      "Languishing can mean, in some cases, getting dropped by important programs like Medicare. Social Security often automatically deducts premiums, or otherwise administers payments, for the health program.",
      "Lately, Melanie Lambert, a senior advocate at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, has seen an increasing number of cases in which the agency determines beneficiaries owe money to Medicare. The cash is sent to the payment centers, she said. And the checks \"just sit there.\"",
      "Beneficiaries lose Medicare, and \"those terminations also tend to happen sooner than they should, based on Social Security's own rules,\" putting people into a bureaucratic maze, Lambert said.",
      "Employees' technology is more often on the fritz. \"There's issues every single day with our system. Every day, at a certain time, our system would go down automatically,\" said Glasgow, of Social Security's Schenectady office. Those problems began in mid-March, he said.",
      "The new problems leave Glasgow suspecting the worst. \"It's more work for less bodies, which will eventually hype up the inefficiency of our job and make us, make the agency, look as though it's underperforming, and then a closer step to the privatization of the agency,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Just weeks ago, scientists warned that a \"city killer\" asteroid had a small chance of hitting Earth. While that prediction was thankfully\u00a0revised, the planet may have to worry about another object plummeting down from the heavens \u2014 a 1970s spacecraft called Kosmos 482.",
      "The Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus a half century ago is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth.",
      "It's too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek, a lecturer at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph, if it remains intact.",
      "\"While not without risk, we should not be too worried,\" Langbroek said in an email.",
      "Given its orbit, the spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, Langbroek wrote in a\u00a0blog post. That represents a vast area, including the United States, South America, Africa, Australia, and most of Europe and Asia south of the Arctic Circle.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\"",
      "Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard & Smithsonian, told NPR that the spacecraft is making its \"final death plunge.\"",
      "\"I expect it'll have the usual one-in-several-thousand chance of hitting someone,\" McDowell wrote last month. \"No need for major concern, but you wouldn't want it bashing you on the head.\"",
      "Kosmos 482 launched in 1972",
      "The Soviet Union launched Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth's orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \"it'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\"",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, \"chances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,\" Langbroek said.",
      "Space debris could impact planes",
      "Space junk crashing back back to Earth could be a growing problem for aircraft, researchers warned in a\u00a0recent study.",
      "The study's authors said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights.",
      "The study found that high-density regions close to major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled rocket reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern U.S. or around major cities in Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was\u00a0published in Scientific Reports.",
      "Space junk has hit Earth recently",
      "Space debris has crashed back into Earth in recent months.",
      "In February, debris from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that blasted off in the United States entered the Earth's atmosphere over Poland. Two chunks from an unidentified object \u2014 both measuring about 5 feet by 3 feet \u2014 were later found on the ground. Police said it was possible the objects came from the SpaceX rocket.",

      "One of the largest websites dedicated to deepfake pornography announced that it has shut down after a critical service provider withdrew its support, effectively halting the site's operations.",
      "Mr. Deepfakes, created in 2018, has been described by researchers as \"the most prominent and mainstream marketplace\" for deepfake porn of celebrities, as well as individuals with no public presence. On Sunday, the website's landing page featured a \"Shutdown Notice,\" saying it would not be relaunching.",
      "The site allowed users to upload and view deepfake porn videos created using artificial intelligence. Forums on the site allowed users to buy and sell custom nonconsensual deepfake content, as well as discuss practices for making deepfakes.\u00a0 The owner of the site remains unknown.",
      "The shutdown comes just days after Congress passed the \"Take It Down Act,\" which makes it a federal crime to post nonconsensual sexual imagery, including explicit deepfakes. The legislation, backed by first lady Melania Trump, requires social media platforms and other websites to remove images and videos within 48 hours after a victim's request.",

      "Attorneys argued that the company's statements on performance expectations last year and earlier this year were \"materially false and misleading\" because UnitedHealth didn't tell shareholders \"it would have to adjust its strategy, which resulted in heightened denials compared to industry competitors.\"",
      "The complaint described UnitedHealthcare's strategy as \"aggressive, anti-consumer tactics.\" The tactics were becoming \"increasingly controversial,\" the complaint said, especially after the death of\u00a0former UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged, resisting pressure from President Trump to lower U.S. borrowing costs as policy makers assess the economic impact of his trade policies.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since the central bank last moved to lower short-term rates in December.",
      "The federal funds rate \u2014 the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 helps determine what businesses and consumers pay in interest on loans and credit card debt.",
      "What does the Fed say about the economy?",
      "The Fed, which has a dual mandate to keep inflation low while maintaining a healthy job market, on Wednesday signaled that economic risks are on the rise.",
      "Concerns that Mr. Trump's tariffs could spur both higher inflation and unemployment were highlighted by Fed chair Jerome Powell in a press conference to talk about the central bank's decision. But Powell noted that while consumer and business sentiment has sharply dropped, the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs haven't yet materialized in hard economic data.",
      "\"We've judged that the risk to higher inflation and unemployment has risen\" since March, when the Fed last met, Powell said. But, he added, \"We can't say which way this will shake out.\"",
      "Because of the uncertainty of the economy's path under the Trump administration's trade policies, the central bank wants to take a wait-and-see approach, Powell added. At the benchmark rate's current level, the Fed has the flexibility to cut rates if unemployment rises, or hike rates if inflation reignites due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, he noted.",
      "At the same time, Powell noted there are concerns that the Fed could face a situation where its dual mandate is in tension, which could occur if inflation and unemployment simultaneously spike. In that scenario, the central bank would need to focus on which side of the mandate is the farthest from the Fed's goal, and prioritize taming that part of the economy, he added.",
      "\"This would be a complicated and challenging judgment we would have to make,\" Powell said. \"If the two goals are in tension \u2014 if unemployment is moving up in an uncomfortable way, and so is inflation \u2014 we would look at how far they are\" from the Fed's targets, and focus first on the economic issue that's under greater stress, he added.",
      "Wall Street interpreted Powell's comments as signaling an increased risk that the U.S. economy could slide into stagflation, or a combination of slower economic growth and higher inflation.",
      "\"The Fed still sees the economy on solid footing, but acknowledges upside risk to both sides of their mandate \u2014 unemployment and inflation \u2014 because of tariffs,\" Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in an email. \"With stagflation risks rising, the Fed's communications will emphasize patience until there is enough clarity in the data.\"",
      "What the Fed decision means",
      "The Fed's to hold interest rates steady comes amid pressure from Mr. Trump to cut interest rates, with the president\u00a0writing\u00a0on social media last month that the central bank has been \"TOO LATE AND WRONG\" for holding off on further reductions.",
      "The latest Fed statement offers no clues on when it might consider easing monetary policy, according to Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"We continue to expect that, with tariffs likely to generate a modest slowdown in GDP growth to around 1.5%, the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged for all of this year,\" he said in a report.",
      "Economists are forecasting that Mr. Trump's tariffs will boost inflation later this year. That could provide the Fed with the impetus to cut rates, although inflation\u00a0cooled in March.",
      "Given more subdued inflation and a buoyant job market, most economists had\u00a0projected\u00a0that the Fed would maintain interest rates at today's meeting, despite some headwinds such as eroding\u00a0consumer confidence\u00a0and a sharp decline in\u00a0first-quarter\u00a0U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"For the time being the Fed remains in a holding pattern as it waits for uncertainty to clear,\" said Ashish Shah, CIO of public investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email after the Fed's announcement.",
      "Shah added, \"Recent better-than-feared jobs data has supported the Fed's on-hold stance, and the onus is on the labor market to weaken sufficiently to bring a resumption of its easing cycle.\"",

And she reflects this new thinking about where HHS should be. I think it's a bold pick,\" Dr. Robert Malone, another close ally of Kennedy, told CBS News.",
      "Casey and Calley Means have also earned skepticism from some of Kennedy's anti-vaccine base, who have grown frustrated with what they fear has been Kennedy's drifting attention away from what they hoped would be a ban of several vaccines and towards a crackdown on unhealthy foods and additives like synthetic food dyes.",
      "\"The nutritional agenda is a core part of MAHA. It may not be their core part of MAHA. But there's no doubt that it's a central part of the overall mission,\" he said.",

She has also claimed \"the current extreme and growing vaccine schedule\" could be \"causing health declines in vulnerable children. This needs to be investigated,\" she wrote on her website last year.",

      "Three former Memphis officers were acquitted Wednesday of all state charges, including second-degree murder, in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols after he ran away from a traffic stop, a death that sparked nationwide protests and prompted renewed calls for police reforms in the U.S.",
      "An out-of-town jury from a majority-White county took about 8 1/2 hours over two days to find Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith not guilty on all charges after a nine-day trial in state court in Memphis, which is majority-Black. After the jury's verdict was read, the defendants hugged their lawyers as relatives of the former officers cried. One relative yelled, \"Thank you, Jesus!\"",
      "Martin Zummach, Smith's attorney, told The Associated Press by text: \"It's easy to defend a good person. It's nerve racking to represent an innocent man.\"",
      "The three defendants still face the prospect of years in prison after they were convicted of federal charges, though they were acquitted of the most serious charges there, too. Two other former officers previously pleaded guilty in both state and federal court, including Emmitt Martin, who defense attorneys blamed for the majority of the violence.",
      "Bean and Smith are out on bond and under house arrest after their federal convictions. Haley is being held in federal prison.",
      "Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, fled a traffic stop after he was yanked out of his car, pepper-sprayed and hit with a Taser. The five officers, who are also Black, caught up with him and punched, kicked and hit Nichols with a police baton, struggling to handcuff him as he called out for his mother just steps from his home. Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating.",
      "Footage of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries. The video prompted intense scrutiny of police in Memphis.",
      "Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Nichols' family, issued a statement expressing outrage at the trial.",
      "\"Today's verdicts are a devastating miscarriage of justice,\" the statement reads. \"The world watched as Tyre Nichols was beaten to death by those sworn to protect and serve.\"",

      "He said he spoke to Nichols' family briefly and, \"They were devastated. ... I think they were outraged, and we can understand why they would be outraged, given the evidence.\"",
      "Former Memphis officers Desmond Mills Jr. and Martin, who were also involved in the beating, did not stand trial in state court after they agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors. They also pleaded guilty in federal court, where sentencing for all five officers is pending.",
      "Mulroy referred to Martin and Mills in his comments after Wednesday's verdict, telling reporters that the two defendants who he said were \"most culpable\" in the case weren't in the courtroom.",
      "\"That doesn't mean that the remaining three defendants weren't culpable,\" he said. As for the acquittal, the DA said, \"It's hard to get inside the mind of the jury.\"",
      "At trial, defense attorneys emphasized that Martin kicked and punched Nichols several times in the head.",
      "The defense also seemed to score points with their use-of-force experts, who testified that the three officers on trial acted in compliance with police department policies and widely accepted law enforcement standards. Attorneys for Bean and Smith called character witnesses who testified that the men were good officers who did their job the right way.",
      "Mills testified for the prosecution, saying he regrets his failure to stop the beating, which led to Nichols' death from blunt force trauma. Nichols suffered tears and bleeding in the brain, Dr. Marco Ross, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, said in court testimony.",
      "The three officers had been charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. In addition to beating Nichols, prosecutors also said the officers failed to intervene and failed to tell medical personnel that Nichols had been hit repeatedly in the head.",
      "Mills acknowledged on the stand that he had a duty to intervene, but didn't. He admitted Nichols never punched or kicked any of the officers.",
      "But Mills also bolstered the defense's case when he said Nichols was actively resisting arrest and not complying with orders to present his hands to be cuffed. Under cross-examination, he indicated he would not have struck Nichols if Nichols had put his hands behind his back. He also agreed that an officer is not safe until a suspect is handcuffed and searched for a weapon.",
      "Zummach noted in closing arguments that credit and debit cards that did not belong to Nichols were found in his car when it was searched after the beating and said it was likely why Nichols ran from the traffic stop. Defense lawyers have argued that the fatal beating would not have taken place if Nichols had just allowed himself to be handcuffed.",
      "\"This is Emmitt Martin's and Tyre Nichols' doing,\" Zummach said.",
      "The jury for the state trial was chosen in Hamilton County, which includes Chattanooga, after Judge James Jones Jr. ordered the case be heard from people outside of Shelby County, which includes Memphis. Defense lawyers for the officers had argued that intense publicity made seating a fair jury difficult.",
      "Defense lawyers also claimed Bean and Smith could not see the strikes to Nichols' head because they were blinded by pepper spray and they had tunnel vision as they tried to restrain Nichols.",
      "But prosecutors sowed doubt on that claim by pointing to comments the defendants made after the beating. According to footage from the scene, Bean said Nichols was \"eating\" the blows and Smith said they hit Nichols with \"so many pieces,\" or punches. Smith also said \"hit him\" and Haley said \"beat that man,\" prosecutor Tanisha Johnson said.",
      "In December, the U.S. Justice Department said a 17-month investigation showed the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people.",
      "The five officers, the city of Memphis and the police chief are being sued by Nichols' family for $550 million. A trial has been scheduled for next year.",

      "As of Wednesday, U.S. travelers flying domestically are required to show a Real ID at airport checkpoints. The May 7 deadline for Americans to switch to the\u00a0federally compliant\u00a0identification comes after more than 20 years of being delayed. Real IDs will also be required to enter certain federal facilities.",
      "Despite the new security requirement, it was business as usual at many airports on Wednesday, with some airport websites reporting wait times at security checkpoints of just a few minutes. Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport's website, for example, showed wait times ranging from 5 to 16 minutes.",
      "At Chicago's O'Hare airport, wait times were actually lower than usual. Jim Spriggs, TSA's federal security director for Illinois, said 90% of O'Hare travelers were prepared for the Real ID deadline.",
      "TSA employees at Newark Airport said they were pleasantly surprised by how prepared passengers were. Travelers at the New Jersey airport have experienced serious delays in recent days due to a mix of air traffic controller issues and staffing shortages.",
      "At New York's LaGuardia Airport\u00a0not all travelers had their Real ID yet, although some had remembered to bring their passports, which is another acceptable form of identification for checkpoints.",
      "\"I'm  hoping that it's really quick  and easy,\" one woman at LaGuardia told CBS News New York. \"But I will say I was  really happy that I happened to  bring my passport on this trip because we're going back home.\"",
      "Another traveler was making his way from New York to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. \"I wish we  probably picked a different day  to travel because it might be a  little bit tougher for everyone  else,   but we'll be alright,\" he said.",
      "The TSA has extra staff\u00a0on hand at airports Wednesday to help travelers and explain the differences between acceptable forms of ID. Officers are using a secondary process to confirm the identity of travelers without a Real ID, passport or other compliant form of identification.",
      "Still, officials advised travelers to arrive at least three hours before a domestic flight, especially if they don't have a Real ID. People without Real IDs can still fly, although they may face extra security hurdles.",
      "The agency said it's seeing about 81% Real ID-compliance at airports. According to a\u00a0CBS News analysis\u00a0from April, at least 17 states were less than 50% compliant with the law.",
      "Those without Real ID can still apply",
      "While the ID cards are required for domestic air travel as of Wednesday, officials have emphasized that May 7 is not the last day Americans can get a Real ID.",
      "\"The vast majority of people do not need a Real ID before Wednesday,\" Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias\u00a0told CBS News Chicago.",
      "Even so, state government offices that issue driver's licenses and state IDs have seen a significant increase in demand for Real ID, with some extending their office hours to meet the spike in applications.",
      "In the weeks before the new ID requirement was set to take effect on Wednesday, state driver's license agencies across the country saw lines of travelers gathered outside to secure their\u00a0Real ID, which has a star marking at the upper-right part of the card.",
      "CBS News captured long wait times at the\u00a0Real ID Supercenter\u00a0in downtown Chicago and the\u00a0DMV in Pomona, California, where lines snaked around the block.",
      "People who aren't flying until later in the year can wait to make an appointment. Air travelers are also allowed to bring an alternative form of\u00a0identification, such as a passport, to get through security checkpoints, according to the TSA.",
      "A list of alternative forms of identification that will be accepted at security checkpoints can be found on the TSA's website\u00a0here.",
      "Five states \u2014 Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Vermont \u2014 also issue what is called an\u00a0Enhanced Driver's License\u00a0(EDL), or Enhanced ID. This is considered an acceptable alternative to a Real ID card.",
      "Look out for scams",
      "The Better Business Bureau is warning people who have yet to apply for a Real ID to keep an eye out for scams, as fraudsters look to exploit confusion around the application process.",
      "Keep in mind that the only way to apply for a Real or Enhanced ID is to visit the DMV in-person after making an appointment.

      "An alligator attacked and killed a woman who was canoeing with her husband on a central Florida lake Tuesday afternoon, authorities said, after her spouse tried unsuccessfuly to fight off the predator.",
      "The attack occurred near the mouth of Tiger Creek into Lake Kissimmee, south of Orlando, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said. \u00a0It's near the same location as a March alligator attack in which a woman was bitten on the elbow while kayaking.",
      "At a news conference Wednesday, FWC Maj. Evan Laskowski said the woman was sitting in the bow of a 14-foot canoe when the attack happened. She and her husband were in about 2.5 feet of water when the boat passed over a large alligator, he said.",
      "\"The alligator thrashed and tipped the canoe over. Both individuals ended up in the water,\" Laskowski said. \"She ended up on top of the alligator in the water and was bitten. Her husband attempted to intervene but was unsuccessful.\"",
      "The woman, who was identified as 61-year-old Cynthia Diekema of Davenport, Florida, was later recovered from the water and declared dead. \u00a0It wasn't clear if her husband was injured.",
      "Polk County Sheriff's Office deputies and marine units assisted with the search and recovery.",
      "A sheriff's office radio transmission of the incident was obtained by\u00a0CBS affiliate WKMG. \"Gator grabbed her out of the canoe,\" a sheriff's deputy can be heard saying. \"He tried to fight the gator off. We're at the last place he saw her. He left the paddle here where he last saw her at.\"",
      "Laskowski said nuisance alligator trappers were called to the scene Tuesday night, and they recovered two alligators. One was over 11 feet long \"matching the length and description of the alligator involved in the incident,\" he said, and the second alligator was approximately 10 to 11 feet long.",
      "Officials did not say if either of the alligators would be euthanized.",
      "Alligator attacks in Florida",
      "Since 1948, when officials began tracking alligator bites involving people in Florida, there have been 487 unprovoked bites through 2024, according to FWC data. Of those, 339 were major bites and 27 were fatal.",
      "The most recent fatal alligator attack was in February 2023 when 85-year-old Gloria Serge was killed while walking her dog along a community pond in Fort Pierce, officials said. Earlier that year, a 23-year-old man lost his arm in an attack near a pond behind a bar in Port Charlotte.",
      "Alligator encounters with humans are more common in the spring mating season when they are most active, Young said. There are an estimated 1.3 million alligators in Florida.",
      "\"While alligator attacks resulting in fatalities are extremely rare, this tragedy serves as a somber reminder of the powerful wildlife that share our natural spaces,\" said Roger Young, the FWC executive director. \"Be cautious of your surroundings. Know what wildlife is in the area.\"",
      "The alligator attack comes as FWC officials continue to investigate a rare fatal black bear attack Monday that took the life of 89-year-old Robert Markel and his dog near his home in Collier County, in southwest Florida.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-maha-food-box-replace-csfp-low-income-seniors/",
    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 17:31:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has a new plan to get \"healthy\" food to low-income seniors, but an anti-hunger advocate fears many will miss out.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposed budget for next year could include big changes for a small food aid program that helps low-income senior citizens supplement their diets. Under the plan, funding for the program \u2014 called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) \u2014 would be cut, and seniors instead would receive what the Trump administration is calling \"MAHA food boxes\" filled with products sourced directly from farmers.",
      "The food boxes \u2014 whose name stems from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to \"Make America Healthy Again\" \u2014 could eventually also be rolled out to either \"supplant or complement current USDA programs,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The agency didn't disclose what other government programs could integrate use of the MAHA food boxes.",
      "The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, more commonly known as food stamps. The agency also oversees other food aid programs such as Women, Infants and Children, which is aimed at pregnant women and kids, as well as the National School Lunch program.",
      "\"Unlike the current approach using food banks, which provide those in need with shelf-stable foods that are high in sodium and other harmful ingredients, MAHA boxes would be filled with commodities sourced from domestic farmers and given directly to American households,\" the Trump budget proposal notes.",
      "The CSFP helps about 730,000 low-income seniors annually through its $389 million budget, according to the USDA. By comparison, the food-stamp program spent about $100 billion last year to provide assistance to 41 million Americans, according to the USDA.",
      "\"We have no details\"",
      "The CSFP is essential for low-income seniors who are struggling to put food on the table, said George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program, a nonprofit\u00a0in Philadelphia. He expressed concern about the Trump administration's plans to replace the CSFP with food boxes, noting the logistical complexity of getting perishable food from farmers directly to older Americans.",
      "Another question is whether the foods included in the food boxes would meet the needs of seniors who often need shelf-stable foods because many struggle to get to the store, Matysik said.",
      "\"What we do know is that the program that we currently have is working, and seniors have come to rely on us,\" he said. \"We have no details [about logistics of the MAHA food boxes], and this has been a continued challenge that we've had with this administration, where decisions are sort of made overnight.\"",
      "Share Food Program relies on $4.5 million in CSFP funding to provide 32-pound food boxes to more than 7,000 seniors in the Philadelphia region who earn less than roughly $23,000 per year. Matysik disagreed with the Trump administration's claims that the program provides unhealthy foods to seniors, noting the boxes typically contain products such as canned vegetables, lean proteins and pastas.",
      "\"For seniors, a lot of times it can be hard to make it out to the grocery store \u2014 it can be hard to get those core items that folks need,\" he added. \"What we do at Share Food Program is take it directly to the doorstep of about 4,500 seniors, so not only are we providing that nutrition, but we're making it easy on the seniors.\"",
      "The Trump budget proposal represents a wish list for the current administration, and it isn't certain that funding for the CSFP would be cut.",
      "But the plan comes amid a larger push by the Trump administration to reduce spending on similar programs, such as a decision in March to cut two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks and instead have them source food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "The Kennedy effect",
      "The MAHA food boxes would provide a twofold benefit, the USDA said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"MAHA boxes would be more wholesome foods, and similar to the Farmers to Families Food Box, fresh foods,\" the agency said. It added that \"the most obvious\" benefit would be \"the removal of administrative middlemen from the distribution of food.\"",
      "The Farmers to Families Food Box, a pandemic food program that ran from May 2020 to May 2021, relied on more than 200 contractors to deliver millions of boxes to needy families, according to a 2021 analysis from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The study found that the 21 biggest contractors were collectively awarded $3 billion to deliver the boxes.",
      "MAHA, meanwhile, is part of a push by Kennedy to promote natural foods and alternative medicines. As head of HHS, he's pressing the food industry to stop using\u00a0synthetic food dyes\u00a0and has pledged to remove processed foods from school lunches.",
      "The USDA has signaled its openness to the MAHA platform, with Secretary Brooke Rollins saying she plans to approve a plan from Arkansas to ban the use of food stamps for purchasing sodas and candy. Anti-hunger advocates have said such restrictions can be stigmatizing for low-income Americans.",
      "In the meantime, Matysik said he's worried about the future of the CSFP program and the seniors who rely on it.",
      "\"Our seniors in particular are already hurting,\" he said. \"We're hearing about cuts to the SNAP program. We're seeing about cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. We're really worried about our senior citizens in this funding environment from our federal government right now.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration appears to have invoked the state-secrets privilege to withhold information in the case involving the mistaken removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador and any efforts by the Trump administration to return him to the United States.",
      "The administration's assertion of the privilege was revealed in an order from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, which asked lawyers for Abrego Garcia and the Justice Department to file additional legal papers about the administration's \"invocations of privilege, principally the state secrets and deliberative process privileges.\"",
      "Xinis gave the two sides until Monday to submit the filings \"addressing the legal and factual bases for the invocation of those privileges,\" including a request from Abrego Garcia's lawyers for the court to conduct a review of \"the withheld documents.\" The judge also set a hearing for May 16 at the courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland.",
      "The Justice Department had indicated last month that it would invoke certain privileges to protect information regarding Abrego Garcia's removal from the U.S., citing in a filing the attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege and certain executive privileges.",
      "Administration lawyers had said that a request for documents from Abrego Garcia's legal team about the terms of any arrangement regarding the government's use of El Salvador's notorious prison to house deportees from the U.S. \"calls for the immediate production of classified documents, as well as documents that defendants may elect to assert are subject to the protections of attorney-client privilege and the state secrets privilege.\"",
      "Xinis told a lawyer with the administration during a hearing last month that if they do assert privileges, they must provide justifications for each claim, and she will make a determination as to whether they can stand.",
      "The Trump administration has invoked the state secrets privilege before, in a case involving the deportations of Venezuelan migrants to the Salvadoran prison, called the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "In Abrego Garcia's case, Xinis had ordered the Trump administration to turn over documents to his lawyers and allowed them to conduct depositions with certain administration officials. Some of the records were initially due last month, but Xinis agreed to push back her deadlines after the Trump administration filed information with the court under seal. One day earlier, Xinis had accused the administration of showing a \"willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\"",
      "Under the judge's latest order, the Trump administration had until Monday to answer and respond to outstanding discovery requests and provide information about their invocation of privileges. Depositions of four Homeland Security and State Department officials are to be completed by Friday, according to the order.",
      "Xinis allowed the expedited discovery process to begin last month after Abrego Garcia's legal team accused the Trump administration of failing to follow her order to facilitate his return to the U.S. The Supreme Court had agreed that the administration had to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "President Trump and other top administration officials have repeatedly said it is up to El Salvador whether to release Abrego Garcia, who had been held at CECOT. As of April 21, he was being held at\u00a0a lower-security facility\u00a0in Santa Ana, according to a declaration from a State Department official.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who was born in El Salvador, entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 and has been living in Maryland since then. He was granted a withholding of removal, a legal status, in 2019 that prevented the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador because of a risk of persecution by local gangs.",
      "But Abrego Garcia was among the hundreds of migrants sent by the Trump administration to CECOT in March.",
      "A federal immigration official acknowledged that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the administration has since declined to return him to the U.S. Instead, top administration officials have claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant. His lawyers, however, argue that Abrego Garcia is not a member of MS-13 or any other gang, and has never been charged or convicted of any crimes in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country.",

    "summary": "Victim's mother says Dr. James Ryan noticed Sarah Harris years earlier in a toy store where she was dressed as Elsa from \"Frozen.\"",
    "story": [
      "When Sarah Harris went in for surgery to remove her wisdom teeth in the summer of 2020, she must have thought she was in good hands. The oral surgeon she chose, Dr. James Ryan, had years of training, a good reputation and a thriving practice near her Washington, D.C.-area home. As a new patient at 23, she may never have dreamed he'd allegedly watched her when she was just 14. And Ryan would do more than take out Sarah's teeth. Her family says he would take her self-control and eventually take her life.",
      "On the morning of Jan. 26, 2022, first responders could not revive Sarah after finding her unresponsive on the floor of the house where she lived with Ryan; following the surgery, the two had become romantically involved. Ryan told authorities he'd gone to bed about 10:30 p.m. the night before and discovered her in the morning. He told first responders Sarah had been struggling with drugs and mental health and he suspected an overdose. Authorities on the scene believed Dr. Ryan's account.",
      "But for a while Sarah's mother, Tina Harris, had been suspicious of Ryan. Tina Harris tells \"48 Hours\" contributor Nikki Battiste that Ryan admitted to her he'd noticed Sarah when he saw her in the park with friends when she was only 14. And Battiste learns from authorities that, when they started dating years later, Ryan had provided Sarah with access to the habit-forming drugs that eventually killed her. It's all in a report titled \"Depraved Heart Murder.\"\u00a0An encore of the broadcast airs Saturday, May 10 at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Tina Harris says she knew Ryan was responsible for her daughter's death from the moment he'd called with the news that morning. She says Sarah had a history of depression and anxiety. Twice in the previous three months, she says she'd discovered Sarah with slurred speech and drug vials and medical paraphernalia nearby, which she'd instructed Sarah's sister Rachel to photograph. Tina Harris says Sarah and Ryan both had claimed he was merely hydrating her and they convinced Tina Harris not to notify police. But she says her suspicion about Sarah having been at risk was affirmed after her daughter's death when authorities discovered Sarah had two powerful surgical anesthetics in her system: propofol and ketamine, the latter of which is also used for depression and made news in the 2023 death of actor Matthew Perry.",
      "During and after high school, Sarah had been a good student, an aspiring model and a beauty pageant winner. She already had a boyfriend. But Tina Harris says Ryan didn't seem to care. She says soon after the medical procedure, his interest in Sarah became more overt. More than twice her age, he'd texted her with smiley face emojis, Tina Harris says, and offered Sarah a job as his surgical assistant. Interested in a medical career, she'd taken the job, and Tina Harris says around that Christmas, he'd left Sarah a diamond necklace in her locker. Ryan was divorced with three grown children and he already had a baby with one of his employees.",
      "\"I said, 'OK, he's after you,'\" said Tina Harris. \"You've gotta put your foot down.\"",
      "But Tina says in early 2021, Sarah agreed to have a meal with Ryan. Over the coming months, he wore Sarah down, says Tina Harris, by showering her with attention, gifts and travel \u2014 even paying travel expenses for the other Harrises too.",
      "\"You think he was grooming Sarah?\" asked Battiste.",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" Tina Harris responded. \"And \u2026 I think he was grooming me; I think he was grooming Rachel.\"",
      "They were all together on a trip to Key West in September 2021, when Tina Harris says a drunk Ryan revealed something to her and Rachel that made them instantly uncomfortable: that he'd noticed Sarah long before ever seeing her as a patient. Tina says Sarah had been just 14.",
      "\"'I used to see Sarah walking the neighborhood and playing at the park with her friends,' \" Tina Harris says Ryan told her one evening. She says he then added a reference to having thought Sarah was \"pretty.\"",
      "The conversation could not be independently corroborated, but Tina Harris says Ryan kept talking. \"'I found out she worked in the toy store across the street at this little shopping area,'\" she says he told her. \"'So I would take my kids there so I could see her and I remember when she dressed up as Elsa from 'Frozen' and she looked just like Elsa.'\"",
      "According to Tina Harris, Ryan later discovered Sarah had a waitressing job.",
      "\"'Then I found out she worked at one of these restaurants\u2026and so I would go in there for dinner so I could get her as my server,'\" she says Ryan told her.",
      "\"It sounds like Dr. Ryan was obsessed with Sarah,\" Battiste observed.",
      "\"He was. He was very much so,\" Tina Harris said.",
      "Tina Harris says she shared her concerns with Detective Ian Iacoviello of Montgomery County Police weeks after Sarah's death. The specialist in pharmaceutical cases was nearing his 2023 retirement, but first made a case against James Ryan with prosecutors, who charged and tried him.",
      "\"I can't imagine as a parent hearing another grown man say that they were watching my child,\" Iacoviello told us. \"There is a problem, um, an infatuation, a \u2014 almost a control aspect.\"",
      "During and after Ryan's initial courtship of Sarah, authorities say he had brought her drugs that he'd removed from his office and controlled her, as evidenced in a slew of texts between them, unearthed by Rachel Harris after her sister Sarah's death.",
      "On Feb. 11, 2021 Ryan wrote: \u00a0\"I can give you an injection \u2026 the anxiety will be completely gone in 6 second s (sic) \u2026 it will work. Let's try it\u2026\" In October, Sarah is asking for the drugs, writing: \"Do we have Ketamine here \u2026\" In November: \"We need syringes \u2026 I feel like s***.\" In December: \"I just really need \u2026 sleep xan (sic) you bring propofol \u2026\"",
      "\"He's created an addict,\" said Iacoviello.",
      "And in at least one case, Ryan appears to have actually administered the drugs to Sarah himself. On \u00a0Dec. 20, 2021, he'd written\u00a0 \"If you wake up \u2026 I just went to change, after I gave you Ketamine just now \u2026\"",
      "\"He's injecting her while she's asleep,\" Iacoviello told \"48 Hours.\" \"No monitoring, no anything.\"",
      "\"She was chemically dependent on him,\" said social worker Janice Miller, who had testified on behalf of the prosecution at Ryan's trial. From the witness box, Miller had told jurors that dysfunctional relationships can be caused by imbalances, in which one side seeks power over the other and then uses that power for control. And Miller told Battiste that, though she'd never met Ryan, his behavior fit the pattern of an abusive partner and as such, his need for control over Sarah Harris could have started years earlier.",
      "\"If Dr. Ryan was attracted to Ms. Harris when she was still a teenager, uh \u2026 he didn't really view her as a person,\" she said in an interview with \"48 Hours.\" \"He viewed her as an object \u2026 not a person to be in an equal relationship with. And so, if that's true, then he entered into that relationship not with the idea that they could have an equal relationship, but that he could control her.\"",
      "Ryan may have wanted to control Sarah, but prosecutors making a case against him faced a challenge. They had no conclusive evidence he wanted her to die. So they charged him with drug distribution, intent to distribute and a very uncommon type of murder.",
      "What is \"depraved heart murder\"?",
      "It's known as \"depraved heart murder.\"",
      "They told us it's a subcategory of second-degree murder \u2014 more serious than manslaughter, in which the state must show the defendant has a reckless disregard for human life. Maryland Assistant State's Attorney James Dietrich gave \"48 Hours\" an example:",
      "\"If I ... take a gun and just randomly shoot it into a crowd,\" Dietrich says, \"I may not necessarily want or care that anybody dies. But\u2026that is such a grossly reckless act that someone's likely to die.\"",
      "And Dietrich says Dr. Ryan's medical training meant he had to know the risks of those drugs he was bringing to Sarah Harris.",
      "Ryan's alleged comments about Sarah at 14 never came up at trial, where the defense team argued that when Ryan and Sarah met as adults, he only wanted to help her and that her own battle with drugs and depression may have played a role in her demise. But, having considered the incriminating texts and photos Rachel had taken at Sarah's house, it took a jury less than three hours to reach a guilty verdict on all the charges.",
      "And James Ryan is not the only doctor to face drug charges in a fatal overdose. Just last summer, federal prosecutors charged two physicians with conspiracy to distribute ketamine in the Matthew Perry case.",
      "At the Ryan sentencing on Jan, 3, 2024, Ryan addressed the court before the judge gave him 45 years in prison.",
      "\"While I did not administer the drugs to Sarah, and I'm not exactly sure when she got them, those drugs were absolutely my responsibility,\" Ryan said. \"And I should have made sure that she never had access to them\u2026I should have never thought I could control her addiction \u2026\"",

      "Her lawyers said the Department of Homeland Security presented one document to support their opposition to \u00d6zt\u00fcrk's bond request: a one-paragraph State Department memo revoking her student visa.

      "\u00d6zt\u00fcrk's lawyers said the immigration judge denied bond based on the \"untenable conclusion\" that she was \"both a flight risk and a danger to the community.\"",
      "The DHS has defended \u00d6zt\u00fcrk's treatment. \"Being granted a visa to live and study in the United States is a privilege not a right. The State Department makes specific determinations about visa revocations when an individual poses a threat to national security,\" a senior DHS offiical said in a statement.",

      "Administration officials are asking the 2nd Circuit to pause the lower court orders issued in Ozturk and Mahdawi's cases while their challenges to their respective detentions move forward. In Ozturk's case, U.S. District Judge William Sessions issued an order for Ozturk, who is being detained at a facility in Louisiana, to be transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in Vermont and set a bail hearing for her to attend in person on May 9.",

      "Ozturk, a Ph.D. student at Tufts, was arrested by federal immigration officials near her Somerville, Massachusetts, apartment on March 25, after the Trump administration revoked her student visa. She was not notified of the revocation before her arrest, according to court records.",

      "During Tuesday's hearing, Esha Bhandari, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Ozturk, said her client has been \"held behind bars for six weeks while her health deteriorates for writing an op-ed.\" All she is asking for is for the temporary transfer order to be completed as court proceedings play out in Vermont, Bhandari said.",
      "\"The executive branch made a specific decision to detain Ms. Ozturk because of her speech,\" she said.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in part that the district court in Vermont does not have jurisdiction over Ozturk's habeas petition because it was not filed where she is confined \u2014 Louisiana \u2014 and did not name her immediate custodian as a defendant \u2014 the warden at the detention center.",
      "But Bhandari argued that the executive branch effectively suspended the writ of habeas corpus on its own by refusing to specify to Ozturk's lawyers who had custody of her, which would have allowed them to name that person as the defendant in Ozturk's challenge to her detention.",
      "Bhandari called the government's position \"breathtaking.\"",
      "According to court filings, a memorandum from a senior official with the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs said Ozturk's visa was revoked based on a request from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, which determined that she \"had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization.'\"",

Then, last week, Crawford released Mahdawi from federal detention as his immigration proceedings continue and again barred the government from removing him from the state or country.",
      "A U.S. attorney arguing against Mahdawi's release said that keeping him in detention would be a \"constitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process\" and argued in court filings that Mahdawi's \"presence and activities\" in the U.S. \"have serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" if he remains here.",

      "If the 2nd Circuit grants the Justice Department's request for the stay in Mahdawi's case, it would allow immigration authorities to re-detain him. But two of the judges on the panel seemed to question how the government is harmed by the lower court's decision ordering Mahdawi's release.",

She was not notified of the revocation beforehand, according to court documents.",
      "As justification for her arrest and detention, the Department of Homeland Security and ICE have said that Ozturk \"had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization,'\" court filings show.",

      "\"She asserts that the government arrested and detained her to prevent speech with which it disagrees. Such an act would be a violation of the Constitution \u2014 quite separate from the removal procedures followed by the immigration courts,\" they wrote.",
      "The panel noted that Ozturk is not seeking to disrupt removal proceedings and said she can attend any hearings before an immigration judge remotely from Vermont.",
      "The judges also highlighted the timeline of the government's actions moving Ozturk from Massachusetts, where she was arrested, to Louisiana.

    "summary": "Federal judges in New York and Colorado ruled against President Trump's administration over his invoking of the Alien Enemies Act.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens detained in the Southern District of New York under President Trump's proclamation invoking the wartime Alien Enemies Act. Another judge in Colorado issued a similar order later in the day.",
      "In New York, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said in a 22-page decision that the president's March proclamation ordering the summary removal of Venezuelan migrants exceeded the scope of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that the Trump administration has relied on to deport noncitizens that his administration claims are part of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act gives the president the power to detain and deport migrants when there is a declared war between the U.S. and a foreign nation, or when there is an \"invasion\" or \"predatory inclusion\" against the U.S. by a foreign nation or government.",
      "But Hellerstein, appointed by President Bill Clinton, said that the Trump administration failed to demonstrate the existence of a war, invasion or predatory incursion. Because of that, the Alien Enemies Act \"was not validly invoked by the presidential proclamation,\" he wrote.",
      "The judge said noncitizens in his judicial district can still be removed under the Immigration and Nationality Act.",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on behalf of the plaintiffs, said in a statement that the district court \"joined several others in correctly recognizing the president cannot simply declare that there's been an invasion and then invoke a wartime authority during peacetime to send individuals to a Gulag-type prison in El Salvador without even giving them due process.\"",
      "Hellerstein was the second federal judge to bar Trump administration officials from using the proclamation invoking the 1798 law to remove certain Venezuelan migrants at risk of deportation. U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, ruled last week that Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is unlawful and blocked administration officials from using the law and the president's proclamation to detain, transfer or remove Venezuelan migrants who either live or are detained in southern Texas.",
      "Later Tuesday, a third judge, Charlotte Sweeney, blocked the administration from detaining or removing migrants in Colorado who are subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act. In her\u00a0decision, Sweeney rejected the Trump administration's claim that federal courts have no role in determining whether the preconditions for using the law are satisfied, saying it \"staggers.\"",
      "\"It is wrong as a matter of law and attempts to read an entire provision out of the Constitution,\" she wrote.",
      "Sweeney, appointed by President Joe Biden, found that the plaintiffs in the case before her were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is unlawful.",
      "Challenges to Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act have been filed throughout the country in response to a Supreme Court decision last month that allowed removals under the law. But the high court said that Venezuelan migrants covered by the declaration are entitled to notice and the opportunity to challenge their confinement and removal under the Alien Enemies Act through habeas corpus proceedings brought in the district where they are being detained.",
      "The two-century-old law has only been employed previously during three periods of declared wars. But in March, Mr. Trump issued a proclamation claiming that the gang Tren de Aragua \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\" Mr. Trump's proclamation said that all Venezuelan citizens who are at least 14 years old and in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to apprehension and removal as \"alien enemies.\"",
      "The declaration claimed that the gang is undertaking \"hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare\" against the U.S. directly and at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's regime. But an April assessment from the National Intelligence Council obtained by the Freedom of the Press Foundation through a public records request found that \"while Venezuela's permissive environment enables TDA to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States.\"",
      "The declassified assessment said that most of the intelligence community \"judges that intelligence indicating that regime leaders are directing or enabling TDA migration to the United States is not credible.\"",
      "The case before Hellerstein was brought by two plaintiffs \u2014 identified in filings as G.F.F. and J.G.O. \u2014 who were initially detained at the Orange County Jail in New York and were transferred to an immigration facility in Texas to be deported to El Salvador. But they were removed from a plane in response to temporary orders issued by a federal district judge in Washington, D.C., as part of a challenge to Mr. Trump's efforts to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act. That case ultimately landed before the Supreme Court.",
      "The two plaintiffs were returned to the jail, where they remain confined and \"under threat of imminent removal,\" according to Hellerstein's opinion. The migrants brought a challenge under habeas corpus in early April in the Southern District of New York on behalf of themselves and other noncitizens in the region at risk of deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, and Hellerstein agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from removing them from the U.S. under the president's proclamation unless they received a notice in English and Spanish and a hearing.",
      "His temporary order was to remain in place while he considered the Venezuelan migrants request for a preliminary injunction, which he granted Tuesday after finding that absent such relief, they would be deported to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT. Hellerstein said that once there, \"they would endure abuse and inhumane treatment with no recourse to bring them back.\"",
      "In his opinion, Hellerstein first called the notice provided by immigration officers to those subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act a \"fleeting affair\" and a \"bare bones form letter.\"",
      "\"Petitioners have not been given notice of what they allegedly did to join TdA, when they joined, and what they did in the United States, or anywhere else, to share or further the illicit objectives of the TdA,\" Hellerstein wrote. \"Without such proof, petitioners are subject to removal by the executive's dictate alone, in contravention of the AEA and the constitutional requirements of due process.\"",
      "The judge said that the procedures used by the Trump administration have already led to the wrongful removal of at least two migrants to CECOT. One of those migrants is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who the Trump administration admitted was mistakenly removed to El Salvador as a result of an \"administrative error.\" A federal judge, U.S. appeals court and the Supreme Court have said the U.S. has to facilitate his release from Salvadoran custody, but the Trump administration has claimed it's up to El Salvador to return him.",
      "Hellerstein also said that the grounds for Mr. Trump's proclamation \u2014 that Tren de Aragua has engaged in either a war, invasion or predatory incursion of the U.S. \u2014 \"do not exist.\"",
      "\"There is nothing in the AEA that justifies a finding that refugees migrating from Venezuela, or TdA gangsters who infiltrate the migrants, are engaged in an 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote. \"They do not seek to occupy territory, to oust American jurisdiction from any territory, or to ravage territory. TdA may well be engaged in narcotics trafficking, but that is a criminal matter, not an invasion or predatory incursion.\"",
      "The Trump administration can appeal the decision.",

His predecessors John Paul II and Benedict XVI were far less accepting of LGBTQ people. Benedict XVI published the first modern formal statement denouncing homosexuality in 1986.",
      "The treatise was written by Benedict while he was still a cardinal under Pope John Paul II. John Paul endorsed Benedict's message, and he also explicitly denounced legal recognition for same-sex marriage. Those sentiments prevailed in 2003 when the Vatican officially opposed same-sex unions.",
      "In response to the Vatican's hardline stances, LGBTQ people held protests during John Paul's 1987 U.S. visit. During his trip he stopped in multiple cities, but the resistance was most notable during his time in San Francisco. San Francisco was reeling from the AIDS epidemic and during the visit, the pope was met with activists holding protest signs and participating in candlelight processions and prayer vigils, hoping to enact change.",
      "In the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which is an official document that outlines Catholic beliefs, the Church still views homosexual acts as \"intrinsically immoral and contrary to the natural law.\" The text says that homosexual tendencies are \"objectively disordered.\"",
      "Cristina Traina, a professor in the Theology department at Fordham University, says the language used in the catechism to describe homosexuality doesn't easily translate into everyday life.",
      "\"You could read [\"objectively disordered\"] as just a technical term, but people read it as fundamentally evil and broken,\" Traina said. \"It's a technical term, but it certainly does not work pastorally.\"",
      "With his public comments, Pope Francis began to change the narrative. Francis called homosexuality \"a human fact,\" during a May 2024 interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell. He personally met with LGBTQ Catholic groups, including DeBernardo's New Ways Ministry, and he clarified that transgender people can be baptized and serve as godparents.",
      "Potential for continued progress",
      "Traina sees the potential for continued progress within the Church despite the death of Pope Francis, because attitudes among everyday Catholics have changed.",
      "\"These things change on the ground and in practice, and then they change at the Vatican, and that's the last thing that changes,\" Traina said.",
      "A 2020 study from UCLA's Williams Institute found that there were approximately 11.3 million LGBTQ adults in the U.S., and about 5.3 million of them are religious, including about 1.3 million who are Roman Catholics.",
      "Although 69%\u00a0of Americans support same-sex marriage, political figures such as Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert, continue to push for traditional family values and support laws allowing for religious exemptions to LGBTQ protections. While campaigning for his U.S. Senate seat in 2022, one of the laws he said he would vote \"no\" for is the Respect for Marriage Act, which provided federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriages.",
      "Teresa Thompson is a member of Catholic Lesbians at the Church of St. Francis Xavier in New York. Catholic Lesbians was founded in 1995 and has over 300 members.",
      "Thompson, who grew up Catholic, started to distance herself from religion during college, which also coincidentally was when she came out as a lesbian. Although her move away from religion was not due to her sexuality, she felt as though she couldn't return to Catholicism. That began to shift when Francis adopted a more compassionate tone toward LGBTQ people, and Thompson discovered communities that welcomed her.",
      "Ahead of the conclave, Thompson expressed hope that the next pope will continue the work Francis started.",
      "\"I think there's a sense of nervousness, not being sure what is going to happen,\" Thompson said. \"If we look at the structure of the College of Cardinals, Francis appointed so many cardinals that it seems unlikely we would \u2026 go back, but also, who's to say?\"",
      "Sister Jeannine Gramick, co-founder of New Ways Ministry, believes the next pope will mirror the path of Pope Francis rather than undo his legacy.",
      "\"My sense is that the cardinal electors will elect somebody who [will follow] in the footsteps of Pope Francis,\" Gramick said. \"So if that proves correct, then the changes that Pope Francis brought about will not be undone.\"",
      "In her conversations with LGBTQ Catholics, Gramick says that she senses a lot of hope for the future, and there is hope for a pope who will go even further than Francis did.",
      "\"[LGBTQ] people, they're looking for more changes, and I think the primary change they're looking for is to change the sexual ethics teaching of the church,\" Gramick said. \"The catechism has not been changed yet.\"",
      "Watching the conclave for clues",
      "With the conclave set to begin, some of the cardinals who could be contenders seem poised to continue Francis's legacy. As CBS News has reported, they include:",
      "Cardinal Peter Erdo, archbishop of Budapest, HungaryCardinal Fridolin Ambongo, archbishop of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo\u00a0Cardinal Mario Grech, secretary general for the Synod of BishopsCardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state\u00a0Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, Latin patriarch of Jerusalem\u00a0Cardinal Luis Tagle of the PhilippinesCardinal Matteo Zuppi, archbishop of Bologna, Italy\u00a0Cardinal Anders Arborelius, archbishop of Stockholm\u00a0Cardinal Gerald Cyprien Lacroix of Quebec",

      "Cardinal Tagle has also spoken compassionately about LGBTQ Catholics and was an ally of Francis. Cardinal Zuppi is another contender supportive of Francis's embrace of LGBTQ Catholics, according to New Ways Ministry.",
      "\"I am voting for Cardinal Tagle to be the first Filipino pope,\" Thompson said. \"I think in character and ideas, he's very similar to Francis, and I used to live in the Philippines, so I also have a special place in my heart for the idea of a Filipino pope.\"",
      "Traina says she is also hopeful for someone like Tagle, but notes that predicting who will be the new pope is almost impossible.",
      "\"It's often hard to tell what (a cardinal) will actually do when they get into the papacy, because Francis was also a surprise,\" Traina said. \"Since we have a global College of Cardinals, now the list of possibilities is much longer.\"",
      "Although Thompson is throwing her personal support behind Cardinal Tagle, she urges the electorate to set aside their political motivations while casting their votes.",
      "\"I really hope this will be a moment where leaders can practice what they preach,\" Thompson said. \"In Ignatian spirituality, there's a practice of making decisions through discernment, [where you] let go ... of your preconceived notions [and] allow the Holy Spirit to guide you. ... I would say please try to let politics go and try to listen to how the church really wants to move forward.\"",

      "The plan to eliminate Energy Star was announced at an Environmental Protection Agency meeting on Monday, where the agency showed a chart marking the program for closure as part of a reorganization effort, according to a document obtained by Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) committee and shared with CBS News. The news was earlier reported by CNN.",
      "The slides were also confirmed by a union representing government employees, which said the workers were told at the meeting that the Energy Star program would be eliminated.",

      "Energy Star was created in 1992 under President George H.W. Bush with the idea of helping consumers save money while reducing energy consumption. Its blue stickers on appliances, inform shoppers that those products meet energy efficiency standards set by the EPA. During his first term, President Trump had sought to close the Energy Star program, but the effort was abandoned after pushback from appliance manufacturers and lawmakers in both parties.",

      "Cardinals of the conclave have been burning ballots since at least 1417, according to the professor, but it wasn't until the 18th century that the Sistine Chapel had its first chimney installed. After that, smoke at certain times meant a new pope had not been elected and the absence of smoke indicated that the was a new pope, according to Johnson.",
      "The first time white smoke was the indicator that a new pope was elected was in 1914. The previous pope, Pius X, had mandated in 1904 that all papers related to the election, not just the ballots, be burned, \"thus producing a great deal more white smoke for the final ballot and making it truly visible,\" historian Frederic J. Baumgartner wrote in his book, \"Behind Locked Doors: A History of the Papal Elections.\"",
      "Johnson also noted, \"A stereotypical association of the colour of the smoke \u2014 white (positive) and black (negative) \u2014 lies behind the use of the two contrasting smoke colours.\"",
      "How the conclave creates black and white smoke",
      "Over the years, the conclave has used different methods to create black and white smoke.",
      "After some confusion in past conclaves, including in 1958, when smoke first appeared white and then became darker, the conclave began using chemicals to get the proper color.",
      "In 2013, former Vatican spokesperson Federico Lombardi\u00a0said the cardinals added cartridges containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene \u2014 a component of coal tar \u2014 and sulfur to the burned ballots to create black smoke. And if a new pope has been elected, potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin would be added to produce white smoke.",
      "Has a pope ever been elected on the first ballot?",
      "It is possible for a pope to be elected on the first ballot, but a pope hasn't received the two-third majority on the first ballot in recent elections.",
      "The shortest conclave on record was in 1503, when it took the cardinals only 10 hours to choose Pope Pius III as the new pontiff. The late Pope Francis was elected in two days with five ballots and the two popes before him had been elected in two or three days.",
      "The longest conclave on record dragged on for nearly three years. Pope Gregory X was finally elected in September of 1271 after about 1,000 days.",

India has blamed Pakistan for backing the attack, something Islamabad has denied.",

      "There was a little hope for de-escalation as Pakistan reportedly reopened airports in several major cities on Wednesday afternoon, after the Indian strikes.

      "Indian politicians from different political parties lauded the strikes. \"Victory to Mother India,\" India's defense minister, Rajnath Singh, wrote on X.

Officials say the group has had no operational presence at the site since the ban.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, Jaish-e-Mohammed's chief, Maulana Masood Azhar, claimed India's attack killed 10 of his family members and four close associates. He criticized Modi, saying, \"This cruelty has broken all limits \u2014 do not expect mercy anymore.\"",

      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, President Trump called the strikes \"a shame.\"",
      "\"We just heard about it just as we were walking in the doors of the Oval,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They've been fighting for a long time. You know, they've been fighting for many many decades, and centuries actually, if you really think about it. No, I just hope it ends very quickly.\"",
      "China called for restraint from both sides following India's strikes.",
      "\"China expresses regret over India's military actions this morning and is concerned about the current developments.

      "But some, like Kathy Freeman, a Catholic flight attendant from New Jersey who flew to Rome for work, said, \"I see it more political than divine intervention.\"",
      "\"It's like politics in the United States,\" she said. \"It's another government up there.\"",
      "A new\u00a0CBS News poll found that 42% of American Catholics hope Pope Francis' successor continues his teachings. Freeman is among those, but adds she is still unsatisfied with aspects of the current church and raised her children outside of it.",

They would also look for a pope who supports letting priests marry; of letting women be ordained as priests; and \u2014 overwhelmingly \u2014 for the use of birth control.",

      "The question now turns to which man \u2014 and it will be a man, as women cannot be ordained priests in the Catholic Church \u2014 will step onto the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica in the papal regalia to greet the crowds massed in the square at the heart of Vatican City.",
      "Below is a look inside the conclave process, with a step-by-step breakdown of how the next pope will be chosen and anointed under Michelangelo's iconic fresco on the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel.",
      "What is the papal conclave?",
      "The papal conclave is the closely guarded gathering of the cardinal electors \u2014 serving cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 to elect the next pope.",
      "The exact number varies, but of the 135 cardinals eligible to serve as electors right now, the Vatican said 133 had gathered from around the world to choose the successor to Francis.",
      "Of the current cardinal electors, a large majority \u2014 108 \u2014 were appointed by Pope Francis during his 12-year papacy. They come from 71 different countries, including 10 from the United States.",
      "When will the papal conclave begin?",
      "The papal conclave's began on May 7.",
      "Under church rules, it must start 15 to 20 days after a pope's death; Francis died on April 21.",
      "Ahead of the conclave, Vatican officials and employees who will help support the process, including other clergy, security personnel, drivers, cleaning crews, doctors and nurses, took an oath of secrecy on Tuesday.",
      "The cardinal electors took their own oaths of secrecy as the ancient process began Wednesday, before all non-electors were asked to leave the Sistine Chapel.",
      "How does the papal conclave work?",
      "How this assembly proceeds to choose the next pope is a process that dates back hundreds of years \u2014 an intricate, choreographed series of rituals and votes.",
      "On the first day of the papal conclave, the cardinal electors shut themselves off from the outside world and begin the momentous task of choosing \u2014 likely from among their own ranks \u2014 the man who will become the 267th Bishop of Rome, better known as the pope.",
      "On Day One, the cardinals celebrated a morning Mass in St. Peter's Basilica. In the afternoon, they walked in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, which will have undergone a thorough security sweep to check for any illicit recording devices before their arrival.",
      "For centuries, the cardinal electors were physically locked inside the Sistine Chapel until they elected a new pontiff, left to eat and sleep beneath Michelangelo's vivid Renaissance masterpiece. These days, they do leave to rest and share meals at the Santa Marta House \u2014 a hotel-like residence inside Vatican City where Francis had his own personal apartment during his pontificate \u2014 for however many days it takes them to come to a decision.",
      "Once the cardinals have filed into the chapel on Wednesday, and any subsequent days required, its great bronze doors are dramatically closed and sealed, and the day's voting begins.",
      "How does the voting for a new pope work?",
      "The cardinals have already spent days discussing the merits of the various papal prospects during formal \"general congregations\" and other meetings at the Vatican, but during the conclave the actual voting begins. Choosing the new pope requires not just a majority, but a two-thirds plus-one vote by the cardinal electors for a single candidate to win. Pope Benedict XVI, who led the church prior to Francis, raised that threshold and enshrined the two-thirds requirement into church law two days before he stepped down.",
      "Each cardinal must swear an oath of absolute secrecy as the conclave begins. If they, or any other church official, disclose any information from within the conclave, they will be excommunicated by the church.",
      "To vote, each cardinal writes their chosen candidate's name on a ballot, disguising his handwriting, then walks to an altar at the front of the chapel and deposits the paper onto a ceremonial plate. He then tips the ballot from the plate into a chalice-urn.",
      "As they are counted and the handwritten entries recorded by three cardinals at the altar, known as scrutineers, the ballots are deposited into another urn.",
      "A third urn, made of gilded bronze and silver and adorned with Christian imagery, is used to ferry ballots from any cardinals too ill to leave their sleeping quarters to the chapel for counting.",
      "After the first vote is held on the first afternoon, the cardinals' ballots are placed into one of two small ovens inside the Sistine Chapel and burned. A plume of smoke flows up a chimney and into the air over St. Peter's Square, watched for eagerly by the faithful, and the world's media.",
      "If that round of voting yields no winner, the smoke will be black \u2014 a sign to the world that the Holy See remains vacant.",
      "How long can a conclave last?",
      "The voting process will repeat itself the following day, with the cardinals holding two ballots in the morning and two in the afternoon. If the morning sessions are inconclusive, black smoke will be seen again around lunchtime in Rome \u2014 early morning on the U.S. East Coast.",
      "If there's still no winner following the afternoon votes, more black smoke will stream into the early evening Roman sky.",
      "If there's no two-thirds majority after three days, voting is paused for a day to allow time for prayer, discussion and a \"brief spiritual exhortation\" by the senior cardinal in the Order of Deacons.",
      "Then the voting process resumes. A conclave will last until enough of the cardinal electors agree on a man to serve as the next pope.",
      "How long has it taken to choose a new pope in the past?",
      "The longest conclave in history was the one that brought Pope Gregory X to the papacy in 1281. It lasted almost three years from the time the cardinals first began their voting.",
      "Recent conclaves, however, have lasted just days. Pope John Paul II needed eight ballots, over two days, to become the pontiff in 1978. His successor, Benedict XVI, was chosen on the fourth ballot, after two days, in 2005.",
      "Francis, in 2013, needed a mere five ballots, with the voting taking just 24 hours.",
      "What will happen once the conclave chooses the next pope?",
      "When enough cardinals agree on a candidate and the vote reaches the two-thirds-plus-one threshold, the chosen man is asked if he accepts the role. He will acknowledge by simply saying the word for \"I accept\" in Latin: \"Accepto.\"",
      "At that point, he becomes the new pope and he will state his chosen pontifical name before the assembled cardinals. The most common papal name has been John, used 21 times. Others, including Simplicius, Hilarius and Zosimus, have only ever been used once. Pope Francis was also the first to choose his papal name.",
      "The ballots are then burned in the stove, but this time, a chemical additive is left out to create the much-anticipated plume of \"fumata bianca,\" white smoke.",
      "There was confusion during some past conclaves over the color of the smoke rising over the chapel, so two conclaves ago, in 2005, a new tradition began. In addition to the white smoke, bells now chime, heralding the news that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "The new pope then immediately goes into a chamber adjoining the Sistine Chapel to be clad in the papal robes.",
      "As the faithful and the curious crowd into St. Peter's Square below, the cardinal deacon steps out onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to introduce the new pontiff with the famous phrase, \"Habemus papam\" \u2014 We have a pope.",
      "Finally, the new leader of the Catholic Church emerges into the spotlight to deliver his first blessing.",

The punishment for leaking information about the ancient Catholic Church ritual is immediate excommunication.",
      "The 133 cardinal electors tasked with electing the next pontiff\u00a0took their own oaths on Wednesday, inside the Sistine Chapel, as the conclave officially got underway.",
      "In the days prior, they were seen going in and out of meetings to discuss the merits of the men among their own ranks \u2014 any one of whom could be chosen as the next pope, the leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.",
      "Among the issues that differentiate the presumed frontrunners for the job are some extremely controversial topics for Catholics, including exactly how far the church should open its doors \u2014 if at all \u2014 to people like Andrea Rubera, his husband, and their three children.",
      "Rubera, who has been in his same-sex relationship for years, told CBS News that \"when Pope Francis died, I cried.\"",
      "A decade ago, Rubera and his husband were struggling over whether they could raise their kids Catholic. Then he got a phone call.",
      "\"So I answered, and it was: 'Mr. Rubera, are you busy at the moment, because I see you are you are not answering my calls, and this is Pope Francis.'\"",
      "He recalled his surprise as the late pontiff asked if he could make time to talk. He did, and Francis encouraged the couple to behave like any other Catholic family. Rubera said he's worried that the next pope may not be as eager to welcome him and his family into the church.",
      "\"My personal fear is that our lives, our families, our rights, could be ... canceled,\" he said.",
      "Another big issue facing the next pope will be the role of women in the church. There has been fierce debate within the Catholic community for years about whether women should be allowed to become deacons, and eventually even priests. That door, even during the relatively progressive reign of Pope Francis, remained firmly closed.",
      "But Kate McElwee, executive director of the Women's Ordination Conference, told CBS News that, \"on this question, women are not going to wait much longer.\"",
      "\"Certainly there's a tipping point that we're facing,\" she said, predicting that if the Catholic Church doesn't offer new opportunities soon, \"I think women will vote with their feet \u2014 they will no longer go and participate in the life of the church.\"",

    "story": [
      "As the conclave to select a new pope begins, LGBTQ Catholics hope that whoever is picked will finish the inclusion work Pope Francis started more than 20 years ago.",
      "Pope Francis, who died at 88 last month, was the first pontiff to be publicly inclusive of the LGBTQ Catholic community. He didn't change doctrine, but he changed the conversation by voicing support for legal civil unions, personally meeting with LGBTQ groups and extending blessings to individuals in same-sex unions.",
      "\"Francis was really a breath of fresh air, and a revolutionary in the way he was telling Church leaders to approach and relate to LGBTQ people,\" said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, a Catholic outreach that educates about and advocates for LGBTQ persons.",
      "DeBernardo said the previous two popes before Francis held anti-gay views, probably the most strident in the Church's history. Under Francis, the papacy adopted a different tone toward the LGBTQ community.",
      "Some clergy and Catholics within the community hope the conclave \u2014 in which some front-runners appear to share Francis' inclusive views \u2014 will continue his work.",
      "\"Who am I to judge?\"",
      "Just four months after Francis became pope in 2013, he created controversy when, during a July inflight press conference, he responded to a journalist's question about gay clergy members. He said: \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\" Francis' answer went against years of Catholic precedent.",
      "These words, which reverberated worldwide, set a very different tone from the previous relationship the Church had with gay clergy and members. His predecessors John Paul II and Benedict XVI were far less accepting of LGBTQ people. Benedict XVI published the first modern formal statement denouncing homosexuality in 1986.",
      "The treatise was written by Benedict while he was still a cardinal under Pope John Paul II. John Paul endorsed Benedict's message, and he also explicitly denounced legal recognition for same-sex marriage. Those sentiments prevailed in 2003 when the Vatican officially opposed same-sex unions.",
      "In response to the Vatican's hardline stances, LGBTQ people held protests during John Paul's 1987 U.S. visit. During his trip he stopped in multiple cities, but the resistance was most notable during his time in San Francisco. San Francisco was reeling from the AIDS epidemic and during the visit, the pope was met with activists holding protest signs and participating in candlelight processions and prayer vigils, hoping to enact change.",
      "In the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which is an official document that outlines Catholic beliefs, the Church still views homosexual acts as \"intrinsically immoral and contrary to the natural law.\" The text says that homosexual tendencies are \"objectively disordered.\"",
      "Cristina Traina, a professor in the Theology department at Fordham University, says the language used in the catechism to describe homosexuality doesn't easily translate into everyday life.",
      "\"You could read [\"objectively disordered\"] as just a technical term, but people read it as fundamentally evil and broken,\" Traina said. \"It's a technical term, but it certainly does not work pastorally.\"",
      "With his public comments, Pope Francis began to change the narrative. Francis called homosexuality \"a human fact,\" during a May 2024 interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell. He personally met with LGBTQ Catholic groups, including DeBernardo's New Ways Ministry, and he clarified that transgender people can be baptized and serve as godparents.",
      "Potential for continued progress",
      "Traina sees the potential for continued progress within the Church despite the death of Pope Francis, because attitudes among everyday Catholics have changed.",
      "\"These things change on the ground and in practice, and then they change at the Vatican, and that's the last thing that changes,\" Traina said.",
      "A 2020 study from UCLA's Williams Institute found that there were approximately 11.3 million LGBTQ adults in the U.S., and about 5.3 million of them are religious, including about 1.3 million who are Roman Catholics.",
      "Although 69%\u00a0of Americans support same-sex marriage, political figures such as Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert, continue to push for traditional family values and support laws allowing for religious exemptions to LGBTQ protections. While campaigning for his U.S. Senate seat in 2022, one of the laws he said he would vote \"no\" for is the Respect for Marriage Act, which provided federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriages.",
      "Teresa Thompson is a member of Catholic Lesbians at the Church of St. Francis Xavier in New York. Catholic Lesbians was founded in 1995 and has over 300 members.",
      "Thompson, who grew up Catholic, started to distance herself from religion during college, which also coincidentally was when she came out as a lesbian. Although her move away from religion was not due to her sexuality, she felt as though she couldn't return to Catholicism. That began to shift when Francis adopted a more compassionate tone toward LGBTQ people, and Thompson discovered communities that welcomed her.",
      "Ahead of the conclave, Thompson expressed hope that the next pope will continue the work Francis started.",
      "\"I think there's a sense of nervousness, not being sure what is going to happen,\" Thompson said. \"If we look at the structure of the College of Cardinals, Francis appointed so many cardinals that it seems unlikely we would \u2026 go back, but also, who's to say?\"",
      "Sister Jeannine Gramick, co-founder of New Ways Ministry, believes the next pope will mirror the path of Pope Francis rather than undo his legacy.",
      "\"My sense is that the cardinal electors will elect somebody who [will follow] in the footsteps of Pope Francis,\" Gramick said. \"So if that proves correct, then the changes that Pope Francis brought about will not be undone.\"",
      "In her conversations with LGBTQ Catholics, Gramick says that she senses a lot of hope for the future, and there is hope for a pope who will go even further than Francis did.",
      "\"[LGBTQ] people, they're looking for more changes, and I think the primary change they're looking for is to change the sexual ethics teaching of the church,\" Gramick said. \"The catechism has not been changed yet.\"",

      "\"I am voting for Cardinal Tagle to be the first Filipino pope,\" Thompson said. \"I think in character and ideas, he's very similar to Francis, and I used to live in the Philippines, so I also have a special place in my heart for the idea of a Filipino pope.\"",
      "Traina says she is also hopeful for someone like Tagle, but notes that predicting who will be the new pope is almost impossible.",
      "\"It's often hard to tell what (a cardinal) will actually do when they get into the papacy, because Francis was also a surprise,\" Traina said. \"Since we have a global College of Cardinals, now the list of possibilities is much longer.\"",
      "Although Thompson is throwing her personal support behind Cardinal Tagle, she urges the electorate to set aside their political motivations while casting their votes.",
      "\"I really hope this will be a moment where leaders can practice what they preach,\" Thompson said. \"In Ignatian spirituality, there's a practice of making decisions through discernment, [where you] let go ... of your preconceived notions [and] allow the Holy Spirit to guide you. ... I would say please try to let politics go and try to listen to how the church really wants to move forward.\"",

      "\"Every papal conclave comes down, in some sense, to a referendum on the papacy that has just ended,\" John Allen, a longtime observer of the Vatican and editor of the Catholic news site Crux, said. Several of the likely front-runners would represent continuity with the direction set\u00a0by Pope Francis, he said, while others would signal \"a change in a slightly more traditional, conservative direction.\"",

      "Cardinal Peter Erdo, archbishop of Budapest, Hungary",

      "Erdo is also on the conservative side of the European cultural divide. On migration, a key issue for Hungary, he has conveyed a balanced approach, recognizing the right to migrate but also the importance of ensuring political stability.",
      "Erdo is considered a traditionalist but is also respected by liberals, which could make him a unifying force within the church.",
      "Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, archbishop of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo",
      "Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, president of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar, grew global attention for leading African bishops in unanimous rejection of \"Fiducia Supplicans,\" a declaration the Vatican issued in 2023 that included guidelines on the blessings of people in same-sex relationships.",
      "At 65 years old, he is known as a supporter of orthodoxy and defends priestly celibacy and the church's moral teachings. He is also known as a promoter of social justice and a champion of the poor and voiceless, and is outspoken in his criticism of the Congolese government.",
      "If elected he would be the first African chosen to lead the Catholic Church in more than 1,500 years. The last African pontiff was Pope Gelasius, who died in 496 after leading the church for a little over three years.",
      "Cardinal Mario Grech, secretary general for the Synod of Bishops",
      "Cardinal Mario Grech, 68, is a canon lawyer who has major influence on how synods in the church are run. Supporters have praised him for leading the charge in implementing a more consultative and inclusive approach to church governance.",
      "Grech comes from Malta, which is one of the smallest countries in the world.",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin, 70, is second-in-command at the Vatican and a career diplomat who has consistently risen above any turbulence marking the pontificate.",
      "John Allen, the Crux editor, sees him as a front-runner.",
      "\"The point of reference for this conclave is almost certainly Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the man who was Pope Francis' Secretary of State \u2014 his right-hand man for 12 years.\"",
      "He is regarded as a moderate who, if elected, could repair rifts inside the church. He is also considered a progressive with a global vision.",
      "But while Parolin has garnered a lot of speculation as a contender heading into the conclave, Allen cautioned against any notion of a sure thing in papal politics.",
      "\"There's a famous Italian saying, that he who enters a conclave as a pope, exits a cardinal \u2014 meaning that if you're getting a lot of buzz, you're not going to be elected,\" he said.",
      "Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, Latin patriarch of Jerusalem",
      "Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, is a pastoral candidate who has spoken out amid the Israel-Hamas war and visited Gaza during the conflict.",
      "He is a proponent of social justice and sees himself as a servant of the people. He is similar to Francis in his concern for migrants, interfaith dialogue and his disdain for clericalism.",
      "Cardinal Luis Tagle of the Philippines",
      "Cardinal Luis Tagle, 67, pro-prefect for the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, is known as the \"Asian Francis\" for his missionary spirit as well as his emphasis on caring for the poor and welcoming of LGBTQ and divorced and remarried Catholics.",

      "If elected he would become the first Asian pontiff in modern times.",
      "Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David of the Philippines",
      "Another Filipino, Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David, was also being spoken of ahead of the conclave as a potential new pontiff.",
      "David, often known as Cardinal Ambo, was one of the last cardinals appointed by Francis, gaining the rank only about five months ago.",
      "He attended the same school, led by Jesuit priests, as his compatriot Tagle during the 1970s. David gained notoriety for taking a firm and public stand against the alleged human rights abuses of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.",
      "In his role as a bishop, David focused much of his work on helping the poor and other social issues. His fellow Asian bishops chose him to lead a commission dedicated to making the church \"more inclusive,\" in his own words.",

      "Chicago-born Cardinal Robert Prevost is seen as having many of the qualities desired in a pope, and if elected, he would become the first U.S. pope in the church's history.",
      "Prevost is the head of the church's Dicastery for Bishops, meaning he oversees the selection of new bishops.

      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn.

    "summary": "Researchers and archaeologists found evidence that a pre-Inca civilization in Peru held exclusive rituals involving a psychedelic drug.",
    "story": [
      "An ancient society in the Peruvian Andes likely used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals that may have helped establish social and political hierarchies seen later throughout the region, according to a new study.",
      "The prehistoric Chav\u00edn people held private and potentially secret gatherings where elite figures used \"snuff tubes\" to consume tobacco and hallucinogenic plant residue with properties of DMT, which can be found in a wide variety of plants, said the study published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. When ingested, DMT causes brief, episodic visual hallucinations, according to the National Institute of Health.",
      "The study was conducted by a group of archaeologists and researchers from the United States and South America, who sought to investigate a centuries-old Chav\u00edn compound for evidence of drugs involved in the ritual practices already understood to be a central part of their culture. To do that, the team explored and analyzed artifacts found at Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Andean highlands some 250 miles north of Lima.",
      "Made from stone, the ruins there are believed to date back as far as 1200 B.C.E. The Chav\u00edn occupied that site and the region more broadly until around 400 or 500 B.C.E. and are considered a major predecessor to the better-known Inca civilization.",
      "While previous research has pointed to ritual activity at Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar, and Chav\u00edn iconography raised questions about whether psychedelic plants were involved, the new study offered material evidence not seen before that hallucinogens were a focal point of those gatherings.",
      "Daniel Contreras, an anthropological archaeologist and professor at the University of Florida who co-authored the study and has focused his work on Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar for about three decades, said in a statement released that consuming psychoactive drugs, in this context, \"was part of a tightly controlled ritual, likely reserved for a select few, reinforcing the social hierarchy.\"",
      "At Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar, archaeologists discovered a network of hidden rooms they called galleries, built into the larger stone complex. Inside them, the team found 23 artifacts believed to be drug paraphernalia \u2014 mainly, tubes constructed from the bones of birds that researchers say functioned as apparatuses for inhalation.",
      "Chemical tests subsequently conducted on those tubes revealed six of them contained traces of hallucinogenic substance dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, a powerful psychedelic that occurs naturally in plants and animals. In four of the six articles, researchers said they found microremains related to the roots of wild Nicotiana species \u2014 also known as tobacco plants \u2014 as well as vilca bean residue, a hallucinogen related to DMT.",
      "Although research into the drug's effects on humans largely acknowledges gaps in how medical and scientific fields currently understand the body's reaction to it, some reports note that DMT causes a temporary and intense response in the brain that can result in those who've taken it to anecdotally recall visions and hallucinogenic revelations.",
      "Contreras' team contended in their study that the tubes discovered at Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar may not have been used exclusively for psychotropic rituals. But, when those rituals did take place, the small size of the rooms where they were found suggests that only certain members of the Chav\u00edn society were invited to partake.",
      "By offering access to altered states of consciousness, the ceremonies were integral to the creation of early class structures, providing an ideology that \"justified or naturalized\" inequality in social orders, Contreras said. Hallucinogenics potentially played a vital role in all of that, he told CBS News in an email.",
      "\"This is compelling evidence that psychoactive plants were part of formalized and tightly-controlled rituals rather than individual vision-quests or shamanic healing practices,\" Contreras said. \"As such, they seem to have been an important element in the long-term transition from small egalitarian societies to large stratified ones, where social, political, and economic inequality were thought of as normal and to be expected rather than unusual.\"",

      "While decades have passed since the war's end, the pain and courage from that time is still very fresh for my parents.",
      "For my mom, her family's journey to the U.S. started 10 days before the fall of Saigon in 1975, when they escaped on a massive C-130 cargo plane the Americans sent to help refugees escape.",
      "All 10 of my mom's brothers and sisters, along with Grandma and Grandpa, flew to Wake Island, which was used as an American processing center during the end of the war.",
      "Each person was only allowed one personal bag and their birth certificates. There were also no goodbyes to loved ones they left behind, which included my mom, who was stuck in a small village with my great-grandmother.",
      "My mom would stay for another six years before she'd make it to the U.S.; forced to work in the labor camps the communists set up for the country's youth; watching as her beloved country changed and wondering if the government would figure out who she was; and whether she'd be punished since my grandfather worked for the American forces during the war as a translator and chauffeur.",
      "Interactive map: The journey of my mom's family",
      "As for the rest of my mom's family, they would spend three months at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas waiting for a sponsor. They had offers, but none were willing to take in a dozen people all at once, and they didn't want to be separated, so they waited.",
      "Then, First Baptist Church in Owego, New York, agreed to welcome all 12 in August 1975. It was big news for the small town. My grandpa and the family even made the local paper.",
      "Meanwhile, my dad fought alongside the Americans during the war in the South Vietnamese Navy. He was on his Navy ship at the time of the fall and his captain gave orders to sail out into the ocean for safety.",
      "After they realized South Vietnam had fallen to the communists, they knew they couldn't go back, even for just a brief moment, to say goodbye to family and friends. They just had to make a run for it.",
      "They sailed to Subic Bay, a U.S. Navy base in the Philippines, where they'd switch to an American ship and set sail for Guam. They weren't the only ones, as the front pages of the local newspapers captured the steady influx of refugees coming to the small island in the days and years following the fall.",
      "My dad would stay in Guam for 25 days. From there, he'd fly to Pennsylvania's Fort Indiantown Gap. A couple of weeks later, news arrived of a sponsor in Connecticut.",
      "Interactive map: My dad's journey",
      "My dad was alone in a new land, unfamiliar with the culture, the language, and with barely any money to his name. He had to leave both of his parents and six brothers and sisters behind in Vietnam.",
      "For four years, his family didn't know if he was dead or alive. That's how long it took for my dad to work up the courage to contact his family by mail. He was too afraid that his letters might get intercepted by the communist government and his family would pay the price for his escape.",

    "story": [
      "The Vietnam War started in 1955, nearly 8,000 miles away from the U.S. in the dense and remote jungles of South Vietnam. While the U.S. slowly deployed into Vietnam in the 1950s, the full deployment of combat units began in 1965.",

      "In October 1975, Minnesota had received the highest number of Southeast Asian refugees in the Midwest, according to then-Gov. Wendell Anderson.",
      "But the governor was thinking, long-term, how would these refugees get the services they needed in the state? What kind of help would they need in the future? And how would they adapt and succeed in a place with a completely different culture and language?",
      "In December 1975, Anderson established the Indochinese Resettlement Office, which later became the Refugee Programs Office in 1981. The office worked with groups like Catholic Charities, Lutheran Social Services and the American Red Cross, along with local families, church groups and community organizations to sponsor refugee families and helped them settle into their new homes.",
      "Anderson also created the Indochinese Refugee Task Force to advise his office, which included representatives from social service organizations, the Vietnamese-American Association, the Cambodian refugee community, the departments of welfare, employment services and education, and the private sector.",
      "The task force had two main jobs: Collect data about Southeast Asian households in the state and provide information about classes, programs and recent laws to the refugee community.",
      "The task force would also later make efforts to address racial discrimination, hiring bias and language barriers that refugees faced when arriving in Minnesota.",
      "Best estimates show\u00a0that today in Minnesota, there are more than 16,000 Laotian immigrants; more than 33,000 Vietnamese immigrants; and nearly 12,000 Cambodian immigrants.",

    "story": [
      "Former Acting ICE Director Jonathan Fahey discusses a federal judge halting deportations of suspected Venezuelan gang members on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg pressed Justice Department lawyers Wednesday evening\u00a0over public comments President Donald Trump and other Cabinet officials made about deportation proceedings under the Alien Enemies Act and floated the idea of moving some migrants to Guant\u00e1namo Bay.",
      "During the hearing, Boasberg specifically pressed Justice Department lawyers about statements made by Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem about CECOT, the maximum-security prison in El Salvador where the U.S. has deported hundreds of migrants, and the White House\u2019s ability to secure someone\u2019s release.",
      "He asked specifically about Trump's remarks in an interview with ABC News, in which Trump told ABC News he \"could\" secure the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran and alleged gang member, back to the U.S. from El Salvador if he chose to.",
      "\"Is the president not telling the truth?\" Boasberg asked Justice Department lawyer Abhishek Kambli. \"Or could he secure his release?\"",
      "WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?",
      "The question goes to the heart of whether El Salvador has custody of the deported migrants, a major question at the heart of the case.",
      "Another key part of the hearing focused on the lawfulness of the Alien Enemies Act proclamation used by Trump to quickly deport migrants from the U.S. to the Salvadoran prison.",
      "Boasberg asserted that the Supreme Court had not, in fact, upheld Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport certain migrants, quoting from the high court's ruling before noting to Justice Department lawyers that the Supreme Court \"did not decide one way or another\" on the validity of Trump's proclamation.",
      "Boasberg floated the idea of moving the migrants detained at CECOT to the U.S. Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention center, where the government could then ascertain if they are members of Tren de Aragua, the violent Venezuelan gang the Trump administration said prompted its use of the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "He also grilled Kambli over Noem's comment that CECOT is \"one of the tools in our toolkit\" the U.S. \"can use\" against individuals who commit crimes against the American people, and comments from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt that the U.S. has provided $6 million to El Salvador to house migrants at the CECOT prison.",
      "In response, Kambli said these remarks sometimes \"lack nuance\" and described the payments to El Salvador as \"grants.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg and President Donald Trump (Getty Images)",
      "The fast-paced hearing was marked by sharp lines of questioning from Boasberg, both over the claims made by Trump officials and whether the early wave of migrants deported to CECOT received any due process or prior notice before they were deported to El Salvador.",
      "Boasberg asked Lee Gelernt, an ACLU lawyer arguing for the plaintiffs, if they had any representations on whether the first class of migrants deported to CECOT under the Alien Enemies Act had prior notice or received any due process protections.",
      "Gelernt reiterated that the first group of migrants deported received no prior notice, telling the court the individuals had received declarations from the government as they were being loaded onto buses on the way to the airport from which they would be sent to the Salvadoran prison.",
      "TRUMP ADMIN SEEKS EMERGENCY RELIEF OF BOASBERG CONTEMPT THREAT",
      "Gelernt also noted that the notices handed to migrants said \"NO REVIEW IS AVAILABLE\" in English at the top.",
      "That phrase has since been removed from the declarations but has not been replaced with any details on eligibility for review or habeas relief.",
      "\"They got some notice,\" Kambli told Boasberg, notring he was not sure of the \"precise contours of that.\"",
      "\"If it wasn't even 12 hours, you're not going to say that they got due process,\" Boasberg fired back.",
      "Boasberg ended the hearing by telling both parties he planned to issue an order Thursday explaining next steps and giving the government until Friday to file any further declarations. From there, plaintiffs will have until Monday to review discovery, including requests for additional information.",

      "Trump officials have sought to portray Boasberg, a high-profile judge in D.C., as the face of judicial overreach, and today's hearing could put him back in their crosshairs.",
      "Unlike the previous lawsuit heard by Boasberg in March, which sought to temporarily block Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport certain U.S. migrants, the plaintiffs are asking the court to hear a larger request for more lasting relief.",
      "The preliminary injunction was filed as a class and seeks to protect two classes of migrants \u2014 detainees already removed from the U.S. to the infamous Salvadoran prison and those still detained on U.S. soil at risk of imminent removal.",
      "The plaintiffs are seeking broader and more lasting relief for two groups of individuals at risk of what they argue is \"grave and irreparable harm\" under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "For U.S. detainees who could be removed under the law, plaintiffs asked for an order blocking their removal under the AEA and requiring the Trump administration to provide them at least 30 days notice before any planned removals, notice they said would be sufficient to allow them to challenge their removals in U.S. court.",
      "Migrants who were already deported to CECOT could face a trickier path to relief.",

      "The plaintiffs asked Boasberg in their amended request to order the Trump administration to not only facilitate the return of already deported migrants, but to take \"all reasonable steps\" to do so.",
      "This could include requiring the administration to request any contractors or agents in El Salvador to transfer the individuals from CECOT and into the \"physical custody\" of the U.S., they said.",
      "It's unclear whether the Trump administration will take any steps to comply with the order should Boasberg move to grant the injunctive relief plaintiffs are seeking. If their responses are any indication, compliance in the near term seems unlikely.",

      "The hearing comes as the Trump administration has grown increasingly defiant in the face of court orders to return migrants from CECOT back to the U.S., including two migrants erroneously deported to the maximum security prison in March and ordered back to the U.S. by two separate federal judges.",
      "The administration has refused to return them. So far, the Trump administration has not said whether it has returned any migrants deported from the U.S. to CECOT under the law.",
      "And the identities of these individuals can be difficult to track. To date, the Trump administration has not released a list of the names of individuals it has deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act\u201a and the Salvadoran government has also shielded their identities from public disclosure.",

      "FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans introduced a bill Wednesday, the Punishing Illegal Immigrant Felons Act, which would dramatically increase penalties for criminal activity by illegal immigrants, something the bill\u2019s sponsors believe can help deliver a death blow to organized crime by illegals in the U.S.",
      "Rep. Brad Knott, R-N.C., said the bill already has robust support in the House and that key members of the Trump administration have been very \"supportive.\"",
      "This comes as the Trump administration has moved quickly to lock down the border and begin arresting the \"worst of the worst\" illegal aliens present in the country. The Trump administration has promised to be \"ruthlessly aggressive\" in cracking down on illegal criminal groups endangering Americans.",
      "However, Knott, who introduced the bill Wednesday, told Fox News Digital that, from his experience as a prosecutor, he believes Congress must act quickly to secure the permanent changes needed to deter many of the hardened criminals who have made organized crime in the U.S. \"big business.\"",

      "\"There is a very real set group of criminals that a wall and deportations alone is wholly insufficient to deter them from coming to the United States to commit crime,\" Knott said. \"I have prosecuted people who were deported more than ten times. Yet they come back exclusively to commit crime, whether that is human trafficking, whether it's drug trafficking, whether it's money laundering, you name it.\"",
      "Knott said, up until now, there has been an \"incentive\" for criminals, including members of migrant gangs like MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, to come to the U.S. \"because they are able to enrich themselves with very low risk of extreme cost.\"",
      "\"Two years is no deterrent,\" he said. \"I prosecuted cartel members, and if they got a 24-month sentence, a two-year sentence, it would not interrupt their criminal operation at all.\"",
      "During his time as a federal prosecutor, Knott said, instances of illegal felons returning to commit more crimes after being deported were \"too many to remember.\"",

He could enrich himself while poisoning the children that he would sell drugs to.",
      "\"This bill in large part closes that gap in the law,\" he explained. \"It categorizes illegal aliens who commit crimes in a wholly different category.\"",
      "If passed and signed into law, Knott\u2019s bill would increase the punishment for any crime committed by an illegal alien that is punishable by more than one year from a maximum of two years to a minimum of five years.",

      "Vance cited \"two big issues\" with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the formal name of the Iran nuclear deal secured in 2015 during the Obama administration.",
      "Trump has said the flawed deal did not prevent Iran from building an atomic bomb. The vice president on Wednesday added that former President Barack Obama's agreement had \"incredibly weak\" enforcement regarding inspections, and he, therefore, didn't believe \"it actually served the function of preventing the Iranians from getting on the pathway to nuclear weapons.\"",
      "Secondly, Vance said the Trump administration believes there were some elements of the Iranian nuclear program that were actually \"preserved\" under the JCPOA.",
      "\"Yes, there weren't nuclear weapons. Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon,\" Vance said, arguing the deal \"allowed Iran to sort of stay on this glide path towards a nuclear weapon if they flip the switch and press go.\"",
      "\"We think that there is a deal here that would reintegrate Iran into the global economy,\" Vance said ahead of the talks. \"That would be really good for the Iranian people, but would result in the complete cessation of any chance that they can get a nuclear weapon. And that's what we're negotiating towards. And as the president has said, that's Option A.\"",
      "If Option A is \"very good for the Iranian people,\" Vance offered that Option B \"is very bad.\"",
      "\"It's very bad for everybody. And it's not what we want, but it's better than Option C, which is Iran getting a nuclear weapon. That is what is completely off the table for the American administration. No ifs, ands or buts,\" Vance said.",

We really care not just about Iran, but about nuclear proliferation,\" Vance said. \"The president hates nuclear proliferation. I hate nuclear proliferation. And I think that the president would be very open to sitting down with the Russians and the Chinese and saying, 'look, let's get this thing in a much better place. Let's reduce the number of nuclear weapons that are in the world writ large.' That's obviously not a conversation for tomorrow. That's a conversation, God willing, for a few years from now.\"",
      "\"But there is no way you get to that conversation if you allow multiple regimes all over the world to enter this sprint for a nuclear weapon,\" Vance added. \"And we really think that if the Iran domino falls, you're going to see nuclear proliferation all over the Middle East. That's very bad for us. It's very bad for our friends. And it's something that we don't think can happen.\"",

This includes cards with \"INDEF\" (indefinite) expiration dates, despite past confusion and software glitches.",

If you have no other ID, a supervisor may review your document and allow you to proceed, but expect possible delays.",

      "If you show up at the airport today with a standard driver's license that isn't REAL ID compliant, and you don't have a passport or other approved ID, you could face delays, extra screening or even be denied entry at the security checkpoint. TSA is urging travelers to check their IDs before heading to the airport.",
      "However, if you have a valid Global Entry card, you do not need to obtain a REAL ID-compliant driver's license to fly domestically after May 7, 2025.

They may even improve road safety by eliminating accidents caused by human error. But risks remain. Public trust in driverless tech is still shaky. Many worry about what happens to jobs when machines take the wheel. The Teamsters are particularly vocal about this.",

    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reveals that a new AirPlay bug lets hackers take over Apple devices via Wi-Fi with no clicks needed.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Apple's AirPlay was designed to make life easier, letting users stream music, photos and videos from iPhones and MacBooks to TVs, speakers and other compatible devices with just a tap. But now, cybersecurity researchers have revealed that this same convenience may be opening the door to hackers. A new set of vulnerabilities, collectively called AirBorne, could turn AirPlay-enabled gadgets into stealthy entry points for malware and network infiltration.",
      "Join The FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":\u00a0Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free\u00a0\"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"\u00a0when you sign up.",
      "A person holding an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Researchers at Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm Oligo\u00a0recently disclosed AirBorne, a group of security flaws in Apple's proprietary AirPlay protocol. These bugs exist primarily in the AirPlay software development kit (SDK) used by third-party manufacturers to bring AirPlay support to smart TVs, speakers and other media devices. The security flaws mean if a hacker is on the same Wi-Fi network as a vulnerable device, they can hijack it without ever touching the device.",
      "From there, attackers could move laterally within a home or corporate network, silently hopping from one device to another. They might install malware or ransomware, disrupt operations or even lock users out of their own systems. In some cases, compromised devices could be added to a botnet, a network of hijacked machines working in unison for larger attacks. And because many smart gadgets come equipped with microphones, hackers could even turn them into tools for eavesdropping and surveillance.",

      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "What is Apple doing about the AirBorne bugs?",
      "Apple has already patched the AirBorne bugs on its own devices and issued updates to third-party vendors. However, researchers warn that many third-party AirPlay-enabled products, possibly tens of millions, may never receive a fix, either because they do not auto-update or because vendors are slow or unwilling to release security patches.",
      "A striking demonstration by Oligo showed how easily a Bose speaker was taken over to display the firm's logo, proving how simple it could be for a hacker to silently gain control. Though Bose was not specifically targeted, the example highlights the broader risk. Any unpatched device using AirPlay SDK could be a gateway for malicious actors.",
      "The researchers also discovered that Apple CarPlay is affected. While exploiting it would be harder and would require Bluetooth or USB pairing, more than 800 car and truck models are potentially vulnerable.",

      "Steps to update your iPhone\u2019s software (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO UPDATE ALL OF YOUR DEVICES AND KEEP THEM SAFE",
      "5 ways to protect yourself from AirPlay hackers",
      "1) Set up a separate Wi-Fi network for smart devices:\u00a0Most modern routers allow you to create multiple networks. Use this feature to keep your smart home devices such as AirPlay-enabled speakers, TVs or receivers on a dedicated \"IoT\" (Internet of Things) network. Keep this separate from your main devices, like phones, laptops and work computers. This segmentation ensures that even if a hacker gains access to a vulnerable smart device, they cannot easily reach more critical or sensitive devices on the primary network.",
      "2) Disable AirPlay when not actively using it:\u00a0AirPlay is designed to always be on and discoverable, which makes it convenient but also leaves it exposed. If you rarely use AirPlay or only use it occasionally, go into your device settings and turn it off completely. On Apple devices, AirPlay settings can be found under \"General\" or \"AirPlay & Handoff.\" For third-party devices, check their companion apps or manuals. Turning off AirPlay removes it as an open door for attackers.",
      "3) Avoid using AirPlay on public or unsecured Wi-Fi and use a VPN:\u00a0One of the key conditions for exploiting AirBorne vulnerabilities is that the attacker must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the target device. This makes public Wi-Fi networks in places like caf\u00e9s, airports, hotels or shared workspaces particularly risky. If you need to use your device in such environments, avoid casting, streaming or pairing with smart devices.",
      "Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Strengthen and secure your home Wi-Fi network:\u00a0Make it more difficult for attackers to gain access to your home network. Use a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi that is different from your other account credentials. Ensure that your router firmware is updated and that encryption is set to WPA2 or WPA3. Avoid older and less secure options like WEP or open networks. Turn off features like WPS, which are designed for easy setup but can also make your network more vulnerable. If possible, disable universal plug and play (UPnP) and similar features that make all devices on your network easily discoverable. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Limit device permissions and exposure:\u00a0Smart devices with AirPlay support often include features like microphones, auto-pairing and remote access. Review each device's settings and disable any features you do not actively use. For example, if your smart speaker has a microphone, but you never use voice commands, turn off the microphone or cover it. The fewer functions a device has exposed, the fewer opportunities a hacker has to exploit it. If your router supports it, use device-level firewall rules to limit which services or internet connections your smart gadgets can access.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Apple likes to market itself as the go-to for privacy and security, but the AirBorne vulnerabilities show that the company's devices are far from bulletproof. While they patched their own products, millions of third-party AirPlay devices are still wide open to attack. It's becoming clear that Apple's control over its ecosystem isn't as tight as they'd like you to believe. If they really want to be the privacy leader, they need to step up and fix these issues across the board, not just when it suits them.",

      "The recent surge of attacks on Tesla owners, dealerships and charging stations has morphed into a broader campaign of intimidation, fueled by weaponized personal data. But the fallout isn't limited to Tesla owners alone.",
      "Sites like \"Dogequest\" have published names, addresses and phone numbers supposedly belonging to Tesla owners, yet many victims never owned a Tesla or sold theirs years ago. Some were misidentified due to errors in public records or outdated databases, turning ordinary people into targets for harassment and threats. The site's operators have even demanded proof of sale from anyone seeking removal, putting the burden on innocent people to clear their names.",

The site didn't just list dealerships and charging stations; it exposed names, home addresses, phone numbers and emails, sometimes even in real time. The twist? Many of the people listed never owned a Tesla at all.",
      "The data fueling this attack came from public vehicle registration records and third-party databases, notorious for their inaccuracies. Some victims had sold their Teslas years ago. Others were never owners, just mistakenly linked by a typo, a recycled phone number or a database error. Yet they found themselves on a digital hit list, with their privacy and safety at risk.",
      "The real-world consequences",
      "This isn't just an online problem. Firebombings at showrooms, bullets through dealership windows and threats to families have all been linked to these doxxing campaigns.

      "Kurt Knutsson discusses how a paper pill bottle could revolutionize pharmacy packaging and cut plastic waste drastically.",
      "Have you ever stopped to think about what happens to those little orange pill bottles after you finish your prescription? Every year, around 200 billion of these bottles are produced worldwide, and sadly most of them end up in landfills. In the U.S. alone, about 4 to 5 billion plastic pill bottles are thrown away each year.",
      "That\u2019s enough plastic to circle the Earth multiple times.",
      "While they might seem harmless, these bottles contribute significantly to the growing plastic pollution crisis because they\u2019re often not recycled properly.",

      "Paper Tully Tube pill bottles (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A paper bottle that\u2019s changing the game",
      "Plastic has become the go-to material for packaging, including in medicine, because it\u2019s cheap, durable and easy to produce. However, the environmental cost is huge, and the pharmaceutical industry has struggled to find a sustainable alternative.",
      "Enter the\u00a0Tully Tube, a revolutionary new pill bottle made mostly from 100% sustainably sourced paper. Developed by Parcel Health, this isn\u2019t just any paper bottle. It\u2019s the first one to meet the strict U.S. FDA regulations for food-contact packaging, making it safe to use for prescription medications.",
      "What makes the Tully Tube really impressive is how it balances sustainability with practicality. The body of the bottle is made from recyclable and compostable paper, which means it can break down naturally instead of piling up in landfills. The cap, which needs to be child-resistant for safety, is still made from plastic but uses recycled materials to reduce its environmental impact.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "STOP SORTING YOUR GARBAGE WITH THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY",
      "How does it keep pills safe?",
      "You might be wondering how a paper bottle can protect pills from moisture, heat or damage during shipping. The Tully Tube uses a clever three-layer construction. It\u2019s coated with a food-safe compostable layer that keeps water and humidity out, ensuring your medication stays fresh and effective.",
      "When it\u2019s time to toss the bottle, a patented pull tab makes it easy to separate the paper body from the plastic cap and neck. This means the paper part can be composted or recycled, while the plastic pieces can be recycled separately. It\u2019s a simple but smart way to make sure every part of the bottle is handled properly at the end of its life.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "IS THIS TECHNOLOGY THE ANSWER TO CLEANING UP OUR OCEAN'S PLASTIC PROBLEM?",
      "Why should pharmacies care?",
      "One of the biggest hurdles for sustainable packaging is cost. Fortunately, the Tully Tube is priced competitively with traditional plastic bottles, so pharmacies don\u2019t have to pay more to go green. Plus, because the paper surface is easier and cheaper to print on, pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies can customize the bottles with logos, designs or even characters to make the packaging more engaging for customers.",
      "From an environmental perspective, the Tully Tube reduces carbon emissions by about 30% compared to plastic bottles. That\u2019s a significant cut in greenhouse gases, especially when you consider the billions of bottles used every year.",

      "AUTONOMOUS TRASH-GOBBLING ROBO BOAT WAGES WAR ON WATERWAY WASTE",
      "Real-world impact",
      "UVA Health is already leading the way by rolling out Tully Tubes across its system. This move is expected to eliminate millions of plastic bottles from their waste stream, showcasing how sustainable packaging can work even in industries with strict safety and regulatory standards. Their example proves that eco-friendly alternatives aren\u2019t just theoretical, they\u2019re ready for real-world use today.",

      "VeriSource discovered\u00a0the breach Feb. 28, 2024, when it noticed unusual activity disrupting some of its systems. The company later determined an unknown attacker had gained unauthorized access around Feb. 27, 2024, stealing data on or about that date.",
      "Somehow, it took VeriSource over a year to determine the full scope of the breach, including the identification all individuals who had their information exposed.",
      "According to the investigation, this was a criminal cyberattack carried out by external threat actors (hackers), as opposed to an insider mishandling data. The perpetrators accessed sensitive personal records stored by VeriSource. In a\u00a0sample notice filed with state authorities, VeriSource reported that the compromised information included individuals' full names, mailing addresses, dates of birth, gender and Social Security numbers (via\u00a0BleepingComputer).",

Information like your Social Security number, birth date and address can be misused for identity theft, such as opening fraudulent accounts or filing false tax returns in your name. Even beyond financial fraud, having such personal data in the wrong hands can lead to targeted phishing scams.",
      "What worries me the most is the delay in fully notifying everyone affected. VeriSource had sent out preliminary breach notices to about 55,000 people in May 2024 and then to another 112,000 people in September 2024. However, those early notifications covered only a small fraction of the approximately 4 million victims eventually identified. This means the majority of affected individuals did not learn of the breach until the final notification wave in April 2025, more than a year after the data was actually compromised.",

Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0VeriSource hackers have access to your name, Social Security number, mailing address and more, which they can easily use against you.\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to scam you. After the VeriSource breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the VeriSource breach, including Social Security numbers. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You can freeze your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus. They\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "4. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per yearor more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "5. Be wary of social engineering attacks and use strong antivirus software: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Also, never click on unexpected links or attachments in emails, texts or messages because they may contain malware or lead to phishing sites designed to steal your information.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "What stands out in the VeriSource breach isn\u2019t just the scale, but the silence. When a company sits on breach data for over a year, regardless of intent, it erodes trust in systems designed to protect workers. These aren\u2019t just compliance failures. They\u2019re human ones. Four million people had their most sensitive information exposed, and for many of them, the warning came far too late. This should be a moment of reckoning for how organizations define responsibility after a breach. A timely response isn\u2019t just good PR. It\u2019s a baseline expectation. And if it takes over a year to realize the full scope of a cyberattack, maybe the incident isn\u2019t the only vulnerability worth addressing.",

      "In a\u00a0notice posted on its website, the healthcare system said the stolen data varied by individual but could include names, dates of birth, postal and email addresses, phone numbers, race and ethnicity information, Social Security numbers, types of patients and medical record numbers. Reportedly, the number of affected individuals may still change as investigations continue. Importantly, electronic medical record systems and treatment information were not accessed, and no financial account, payment or employee HR information was involved.",
      "This is not the first time healthcare systems have been in the crosshairs of cybercriminals. In recent years, attacks on institutions like\u00a0UnitedHealth and\u00a0Ascension Health have led to months of operational disruption, massive financial costs and prolonged investigations.",

      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVER",
      "What Yale New Haven Health is doing",
      "Yale New Haven Health brought in cybersecurity firm Mandiant to assist with the investigation and said a rapid response helped contain the incident and prevent any disruption to patient care. The organization noted that it regularly updates and strengthens its systems to protect sensitive data and will continue those efforts. Notification letters began going out to affected individuals on April 14, and complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services have been offered to those whose Social Security numbers were compromised.",
      "The breach could have serious consequences for those impacted. The stolen data includes highly sensitive information that can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, phishing attacks or targeted scams. Healthcare data is especially valuable on the black market because it can be exploited for long periods without easy detection. Even if Social Security numbers or medical information aren\u2019t misused right away, the long-term risk for affected individuals remains significant.",
      "We reached out to Yale New Haven Health (YNHHS), and a health system spokesperson said in part:",
      "\"We take our responsibility to safeguard patient information incredibly seriously, and we regret any concern this incident may have caused. We are continuously updating and enhancing our systems to protect the data we maintain and to help prevent events such as this from occurring in the future. For more information on this incident, patients may visit YNHHS\u2019 website at\u00a0ynhhs.org or call our dedicated, toll-free call center at 1-855-549-2678, Monday through Friday, between 9:00 am and 9:00 pm Eastern Time, excluding major U.S. holidays.\"",

      "5 ways you can stay safe from insurance data breach",
      "If your information was part of the Yale New Haven Health breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Yale New Haven Health data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, social security number, and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The Yale New Haven Health data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Yale New Haven Health hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses..",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While Yale New Haven has been working with security experts to contain the breach and notify those affected, it is troubling that hackers were able to access the data of 5.5 million individuals before the organization detected the intrusion. The incident highlights a deeper issue, revealing gaps in the security infrastructure that many healthcare institutions are still not adequately addressing.",

      "Additionally, DAIA noted that Argentinian President Javier Milei\u2019s strong support of Israel and the U.S. has led to \"an increase in antisemitic and other conspiratorial rhetoric.\"",
      "DAIA also found some bright spots in Argentina, noting that 60% of Argentinians, especially those aged 25-34, have a favorable view of Israel and just 7% favor boycotting Israeli products and businesses. This could be because Argentina has felt the impact of a terrorist organization that has also attacked Israel. Hezbollah carried out two deadly bombing attacks in Buenos Aires, one in 1992 at the Israeli Embassy and another in 1994 at the AMIA-DAIA Jewish Center.",

In the 12-month period the ECAJ studied, it found 2,062 antisemitic incidents compared to 495 incidents in the previous year. In the decade prior, the number of antisemitic incidents each year ranged from 190 to 495.",

This, according to the report, is 10 times higher than the response in 2017.",
      "The Australian federal government in 2024, as well as many state governments, banned hate symbols such as swastikas and the Nazi salute. Symbols of terrorist organizations were also banned. However, ECAJ said it does not believe these laws do enough to combat \"post-Oct. 7 sources of antisemitism.\"",

Additionally, hate crimes against Jews increased by 71% from 2022 to 2023, according to CIJA.",

      "Two of Amer Fakhoury\u2019s daughters, Guila and Zoya Fakhoury, told Fox News Digital that on May 1, a U.S. District Court judge found Iran responsible for Fakhoury\u2019s imprisonment.",

      "Amer Fakhoury was arrested a week after traveling to Lebanon with his family in September 2019. After his arrest, a newspaper linked with Hezbollah alleged that Fakhoury, formerly a member of the South Lebanon Army, had been the \"butcher\" of Khiam, a detention center where grave human rights abuses were reported to have taken place.",
      "Though he was released from a military prison in December 2019, it was only after the Lebanese Supreme Court dropped charges against Fakhoury in March 2020 that he was able to return to the U.S. By the time of his return, Fakhoury had lost 60 pounds and was suffering from late-stage lymphoma, along with rib fractures and other health complications. He died in September 2020 at the age of 57.",
      "Proving Fakhoury\u2019s suffering and torture was a battle for the family, though Guila said the State Department\u2019s classification of her father as a hostage was instrumental in proving the nature of Fakhoury\u2019s captivity.",
      "SENS. CRUZ, SHAHEEN PROPOSE SANCTIONS AGAINST LEBANESE OFFIICALS OVER AMERICAN PRISONER",

      "Because Iran never responded to the suit, Guila said the family was forced to provide evidence her father witnessed of Hezbollah\u2019s control over \"every government agency in Lebanon,\" including the military hospital, military court, and the Lebanese General Directorate of General Security, the country\u2019s intelligence apparatus that Guila said arrested and tortured Fakhoury.",

      "Fakhoury\u2019s family faced difficulties even before filing their case in May 2021. Zoya says Hezbollah officials in Lebanon have been issuing threats to the family since Fakhoury\u2019s death. In addition to Iran failing to respond to the suit, Guila said Lebanese General Directorate of General Security officials interfered with the lawsuit by asking to have their names and agencies removed. She says the judge denied the request.",
      "Long periods of silence from the court also made the wait for justice difficult, Zoya said. \"The last four years, we were fearful,\" she explained. \"We were worried maybe nothing\u2019s going to come out of this.\"",
      "While the family is grateful for the judgment they received, Guila says they believe the settlement awarded through the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was \"a bit of an unfair decision\" and did not \"take into account the pain and the suffering of the family.\"",

      "Fleisher noted ongoing efforts by Palestinian authorities and others to rename historical Jewish sites. \"They call Hebron \u2018Al-Khalil,\u2019 and the Cave of the Patriarchs becomes the \u2018Ibrahimi Mosque.\u2019 The Temple Mount is now the \u2018Al-Aqsa complex,\u2019 and Rachel\u2019s Tomb has been rebranded as the \u2018Bilal Bin Rabah Mosque,\u2019\" he said.",
      "To counter this, he says Israeli advocates are working to mark and preserve ancient Jewish landmarks. \"We added an Israeli flag and a menorah to a building originally constructed by King Herod 2,000 years ago\u2014which itself stands atop a tomb dating back 3,500 years\u2014to make it unmistakably clear it\u2019s a Jewish site, despite the later addition of three minarets by Muslim conquerors.\"",
      "The Palestinian Authority, which gained non-member observer state status at the United Nations in 2012, has been spearheading the campaign to rewrite history in global forums that contain automatic anti-Israel majorities.",
      "Visitors arrive at Sebastia National Park in Samaria. Sebastia was the Israelite kingdom during the reigns of Omri and Ahab.\u00a0 (Hillel Maeir/TPS-IL)",
      "Among them is the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which in 2016 registered the Cave of the Patriarchs\u2014the resting place of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah located in Hebron\u2014in the name of the \"State of Palestine\" on its \"List of World Heritage in Danger.\" More recently, UNESCO, in September 2023, named the Tell es-Sultan site near Jericho, which contains ruins dating back to the ninth millennium BCE, including evidence of one of humanity\u2019s first-known villages, as a \"World Heritage Site in Palestine.\"",
      "In December 2021, the United Nations General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution referring to the Temple Mount, Judaism\u2019s holiest site\u2014located in Jerusalem but beyond the 1967 borders\u2014only by its Muslim name, \"Haram al-Sharif.\" In September 2024, P.A. leader Mahmoud Abbas called the Temple Mount the \"exclusive property of Muslims.\" Last week, Abbas said in a rare televised speech that the Koran describes the Jewish Temple as being in Yemen.",

      "Naomi Kahn, director of the international division at Regavim, a think tank focused on Israeli sovereignty, said the P.A. is actively building over key archaeological sites as part of this initiative.",
      "\"In Solomon\u2019s Pools, which is under P.A. jurisdiction in accordance with the Oslo Accords, they\u2019re constructing condominiums directly on top of ancient Jewish infrastructure,\" Kahn told Fox News Digital. \"These are internationally recognized heritage sites, but the agreements are being violated.",
      "She cited the Hasmonean fortresses near Jericho as a major example. \"The burial grounds of Hasmonean kings\u2014the largest necropolis in the Middle East from the Second Temple period\u2014have been plowed and used for farming and construction. In one case, we found human bones scattered in the fields. The Israeli Civil Administration had to collect and rebury them.\"",
      "Khan also referenced Sebastia, the Greco-Roman name for the ancient city of Samaria. Originally founded by King Omri in the 9th century BC, Samaria became the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel, as noted in the Hebrew Bible (1 Kings 16:24). It served as the kingdom\u2019s capital until it fell to the Assyrians in 722 BCE. Centuries later, Herod the Great rebuilt the city and renamed it Sebaste\u2014Sebastia in later usage\u2014in honor of the Roman Emperor Augustus, whose name in Greek, \"Sebastos,\" carried the same imperial meaning.",

      "Khan said other sites facing encroachment include Joshua\u2019s Altar, where a new Palestinian neighborhood is being developed nearby, and Joseph\u2019s Tomb, which is largely inaccessible to Jewish Israelis",
      "\"I\u2019m disgusted, but not concerned,\" Sandra Hagee Parker, Chairwoman of the Christians United for Israel Action Fund, told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"Where are the Romans, Ottomans, and Crusaders? The enemies of Israel are remembered only for their ultimate defeat by the God of Abraham and His children.",
      "\"Moreover, the grotesque effort to deny the Jewish connection to the Land is a rejection of God Himself,\" she continued. \"It is both antisemitic and anti-Christian\u2014and it will never succeed. My only concern is that America continues to stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel and her people,\" she added.",
      "Ze'ev Orenstein, Director of International Affairs at the Jerusalem-based City of David Foundation, stressed that \"from its inception in 1964, the Palestine Liberation Organization\u2014the forerunner of today\u2019s Palestinian Authority\u2014was founded on the denial of thousands of years of Jewish history and heritage rooted in the Land of Israel in general, and in Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria\u2014the Biblical heartland\u2014in particular.",
      "\"This denial,\" Orenstein told Fox News Digital, \"aimed to delegitimize and undermine the Jewish people's legal, moral and historical right to sovereignty in the Land of Israel, portraying a people with some of the deepest archaeological ties to the land as occupiers and colonizers.",
      "\"For that reason, the Islamic Waqf carried out a campaign of systematic destruction of antiquities atop the Temple Mount in the late 1990s, and Palestinian leadership continues to deny, damage, and destroy Jewish heritage sites throughout Judea and Samaria,\" he said.",
      "Following the destruction and severe damage by Palestinian rioters at the 'Joshua Altar' archeological site located on the spur of Mt. Ebal, dozens of Jewish worshipers arrived for morning prayers at the site. (TPS)",
      "In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July 2023 announced a $33 million program to safeguard and rehabilitate archaeological sites in the biblical heartland.",
      "\"In every corner of Judea and Samaria, one need only to put spade to ground in order to uncover archaeological finds that attest to our deep roots in the Land of Israel,\" Netanyahu said at the time. \"This plan will encourage tourism, education and [present] information for these important sites that tell the story of our people in Judea and Samaria.\"",
      "Rev. Dr. Petra Heldt, professor at the Jerusalem University College and director of the Ecumenical Theological Research Fraternity in Israel, cited biblical texts and ongoing excavations as proof of longstanding Jewish presence in the region.",
      "\"There are hundreds of biblical place names showing Jews lived in Judea and Samaria since the time of Abraham,\" Heldt told Fox News Digital. \"The Palestinian Authority has tried to erase this evidence, but it\u2019s nearly impossible to eliminate.\"",
      "Heldt pointed to Shiloh as a thriving example, with an active kibbutz and archaeological site where new discoveries are regularly unearthed. \"Jewish communities are not only living in their ancestral homeland\u2014they\u2019re documenting it. You can see the impact of various layers of occupation over the last hundred years.\"",

      "According to Heldt, whose organization hosts global lectures and educational programs on archaeological findings in Judea and Samaria, more international support is needed to protect these sites. \"We must involve the media, universities, artists, filmmakers and writers to tell these stories and make these places matter globally,\" she said.",
      "The struggle to preserve Jewish historical sites in Judea and Samaria is not just about stones or ruins\u2014it\u2019s a battle over narrative, legitimacy and identity, according to the experts.",
      "\"The way to fight this is to build, to educate and to assert our sovereignty,\" Hebron\u2019s Fleisher said. \"That\u2019s how we strengthen our connection to the land and protect the truth of our history.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it was leaving interest rates unchanged as it warned that the chances of both higher unemployment and higher inflation had climbed in the wake of President Donald Trump's tariffs plan.",
      "In its latest assessment of the economy, the Fed did not cite the tariffs specifically but noted that volatile trade activity affected the economic data it relies on to make its policy decisions \u2014 a reference to the negative gross domestic product figure reported last week.",
      "The central bank\u2019s federal funds rate was kept at a target of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "\"We don't have to be in a hurry. The economy is resilient and doing fairly well,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after the statement was released.",
      "It said that while economic activity overall expanded at a decent pace and labor market conditions remained \"solid,\" inflation is \"somewhat elevated\" and the risk of both higher unemployment and even higher inflation had risen.",
      "In a note to clients, Omair Sharif, president of Inflation Insights consultancy, said the Fed \"was pretty clear that the risks are now towards a stagflationary environment,\" as it also said uncertainty had increased \u201cfurther\u201d since its last meeting in April.",
      "Stagflation occurs when the inflation rate climbs but overall economic growth slows or even falls.",
      "Just before the Fed released its statement, Trump indicated he would not back down from his administration's current 145% tariff duties on China.",
      "Powell said in his post-statement comments that inflation sparked by the tariffs could either end up being short-lived or long-lasting, depending on how high the tariffs get and how long they are in effect.",
      "The rate is a benchmark for everything from auto loans to credit cards and personal loans. Their rates remain well above pre-pandemic levels, with credit card rates hovering at more than 21%. Auto loan interest rates have come down more substantially.",
      "Home mortgage rates are less tied to the federal funds rate, instead closely tracking government borrowing costs, which have also remained elevated.",
      "Investors believe the Fed will continue to hold interest rates steady through its next meeting in June, with the first cut of 2025 coming in July.",
      "The central issue for the Fed is determining how much tariffs will affect price growth going forward. At least one Fed official believes any price boost from tariffs will be short-lived and has advocated to start rate cuts sooner.",
      "That\u2019s also how Trump appears to feel. While he has backed off the idea that he would fire Powell, he continued his call for lower interest rates after Friday\u2019s jobs report, even though it showed the United States continued to add new jobs at a healthy clip.",
      "But most other Fed officials believe the prudent move would be to wait on lowering interest rates until there is a more material deterioration in labor markets. And although the hiring rate has slowed dramatically, layoffs have been subdued.",
      "\u201cThe best thing for them to do is wait to see: Do they have more of a problem with inflation or rising unemployment?\u201d said Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research consultancy, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which oversees monetary policy. \u201cAnd the evidence so far is that, for now, it\u2019s likely to be more of a cost problem than a labor-market problem.\u201d",
      "Yardeni said that he expects markets to remain \u201cchoppy\u201d into the second half of the year but that Trump will eventually relent on his tariff gambit given the political calendar.",
      "\u201cRepublicans can\u2019t afford a recession with people upset about higher prices going into next year,\u201d he said.",
      "As for stocks, they are likely to remain around current levels barring a significant downturn, said Michael Antonelli, market strategist for Baird Private Wealth Management group. While the shock of Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs announcement has worn off, investors waiting on hopes of a comprehensive \u201cdeal\u201d signed by Trump are likely to be waiting for some time.",
      "Still, retail investors \u2014 as opposed to large institutions like pension or hedge funds \u2014\u00a0are likely to keep the market afloat. Data from Bank of America shows that even as hedge funds were net sellers, individual private clients have now been net buyers\u00a0for 21 weeks, a record buying streak in its data history.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always the case that Americans will buy,\u201d Antonelli said. \u201cThey need to retire. They don\u2019t get as much press, but from my perspective, they\u2019re the ones who are the most important market players these days.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Just a few weeks ago, President Donald Trump and White House aides were boasting that his tariffs would force a legion of foreign nations to rush into new trade deals \u2014 and that Trump's prowess would yield more favorable terms for the U.S.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my a--,\u201d Trump said last month before his reciprocal tariffs were due to go into effect. \"They are dying to make a deal. \u2018Please, please, sir, make a deal. I\u2019ll do anything. I\u2019ll do anything, sir!\u2019\u201d",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "\"We've got 90 deals in 90 days possibly pending here,\" Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro said on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" a few days later \u2014 after Trump paused some of his tariffs and declared a three-month negotiating window.",
      "But Trump has changed his tone and his tune in recent days, as it has become clear that trade agreements don't materialize as quickly as he would like and that there aren't dozens in the queue. His shift also comes amid heavy criticism that his tariffs will hike prices for consumers and harm an American economy that had its first negative growth in years in the first quarter.",
      "\"You keep writing about deals, deals. When are we going to sign one? It\u2019s very simple. We\u2019re going to say, in some cases, we want you to open up your country. In some cases we want you to drop your tariffs,\" an obviously frustrated Trump told reporters Tuesday.",

      "It was Trump who set the 90-day clock.",
      "Beyond the ambitious sweep of trying to haggle with scores of nations at once, the U.S. has yet to open discussions with its largest trading partner \u2014 China \u2014\u00a0since Trump applied a 145% across-the-board tariff on that nation's products.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers Wednesday that his planned meeting with Chinese officials in Switzerland this weekend amounts to an early phase of negotiations that is not as far along as talks with less-crucial nations.",
      "\"On Saturday, we will begin, which I believe is the opposite of advanced,\" Bessent said under questioning from Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, D-N.Y.",
      "The previous day he said that discussions are occurring with a far smaller number of countries than Trump and Navarro have counted and that the time horizon for agreements could be much longer.",
      "\"There are 18 very important trading relationships, and we are currently negotiating with 17 of those trading partners,\" Bessent told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government on Tuesday. \"Approximately 97 or 98% of our trade deficit is with 15 countries, 18% of the countries are our major trading partners. And I would be surprised if we don\u2019t have more than 80 or 90% of those wrapped up by the end of the year, and that may be much sooner.\"",
      "Bessent went on to say that there could be deals announced this week. And yet, the end-of-year timeline is far different from what White House officials had previously suggested. The change in rhetoric is intentional, according to one White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.",
      "The substance matters more than the speed, the official said.",
      "\"Obviously, we're working as expeditiously as possible, but we're not trying to make deals that are Band-Aids for the sake of making deals,\" the official added.",
      "Trump has used his authority under an emergency declaration to raise tariffs on U.S. trading partners \u2014 and he can lower them in similar fashion if and when he chooses \u2014 but he might have to involve Congress for more comprehensive trade agreements. For now, Trump is operating with one blunt-force tool \u2014 the levies applied to goods entering the U.S. from abroad \u2014 in order to win concessions on both duties and \"nontariff barriers\" to trade.",
      "\"We don't need Congress to pass a bill\" because the U.S.-applied tariffs should be enough to win those concessions, the White House official said. \"The onus is obviously on the countries we're negotiating with.\""

      "\u201cIs the president not telling the truth, or could he secure the release of Mr. Abrego Garcia?\u201d Boasberg asked Deputy Assistant Attorney General Abhishek Kambli, who was representing the government Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWas the president telling the truth\u201d when he said he could pick up the phone and secure Garcia\u2019s release or not? Boasberg asked.",
      "\u201cThat goes towards the president\u2019s belief about influence he has,\u201d Kambli responded, saying, \"Influence does not equate to constructive custody.\"",
      "Under questioning from Boasberg, Kambli said a \"grant\" dated March 22 that was described as being for law enforcement needs related to the 238 men alleged to be Tren de Aragua members who were recently deported to El Salvador. Kambli confirmed that \u201cgrants were made\u201d that \u201ccan be used for detention of these individuals.\u201d",
      "Boasberg said the plaintiffs had \u201ca lot of facts in your favor\u201d in arguing that the United States had what is called \u201cconstructive custody\u201d of the men \u2014 which the Trump administration has argued in and out of court it does not have. Boasberg questioned Kambli about whether the government would concede that transferring people to CECOT without due process would mean the government had violated their rights.",
      "\u201cI don't know if I would put it in those terms,\" Kambli replied.",
      "Boasberg has ordered the Trump administration to provide sworn declarations from administration officials regarding the issue of who exactly has custody of the people at CECOT.",

      "The Supreme Court last month lifted Boasberg's order, which temporarily blocked the administration from sending members of Tren de Aragua to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, but it did not reach a decision on the merits of Trump's invocation of the act. Last week, a Trump-appointed judge became the first to strike down the administration's use of the act, which had previously been deployed only during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "While the Trump administration proclaimed that it won the Supreme Court argument, Boasberg questioned Kambli about the decision, noting that the court had not reached the merits of the administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg asked whether Kambli acknowledged that the Supreme Court did not reach the arguments about the administration's use of the act itself, and Kambli conceded that it \"did not analyze that precise issue.\"",
      "\"I assume that's a yes,\" Boasberg replied."

      "Castelli, who is Canadian, saw two career paths after his graduation this spring: He could join a U.S. biotech company, or he could find a postdoctoral position at a U.S. university or research laboratory.",
      "\u201cThis is where the money is at and where all the clinical trials are happening,\u201d Castelli said, making the U.S. \u201cthe only place in my mind I could push that forward.\u201d",
      "Then the Trump administration\u2019s science cuts hit.",
      "And so, on a rainy late April day in Seattle, Castelli stood at a lectern before his friends and family and defended his doctoral thesis \u2014 about using stem cells to express antibodies against HIV \u2014 with his scientific life at a crossroads.",
      "Should he join a lab in his native Canada? Accept recruiting calls to a European university? A Chinese biotech company? They were all possibilities now, and his U.S. visa is likely to expire in a few months\u2019 time.",
      "\u201cI have a personal interest in Jack getting the best opportunity for himself, and as much as I\u2019d love to say the U.S. is the place, I can\u2019t necessarily say that right now,\u201d said Jennifer Adair, who was Castelli\u2019s principal investigator at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center, a partner institute to the university.",
      "Castelli speaks three languages fluently and completed two internships while earning his doctoral degree. He is a generous colleague and an exceptional scientist, Adair said.",
      "But his uncertain future is hardly unique. The Trump administration\u2019s slowdown in science funding \u2014 which stalled thousands of grants at the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation, among other organizations \u2014 has left U.S.-based scientists and researchers scrambling to find homes for promising work that could lead to medical treatments and cures. Now many are looking abroad. As of May, Castelli had not made a decision on whether he\u2019ll stay in the U.S.",
      "The slowdown has forced the University of Washington, a top public university for biomedical research, to implement a hiring freeze, travel restrictions, class size reductions and furloughs. Some departments are pushing students to graduate sooner than expected. In a court filing, a university representative said it funds about 3,000 researchers through NIH grants.",
      "Interviews with more than 20 graduate students, faculty members and university administrators at UW describe a research hub thrown into chaos. Other institutions have made similarly drastic moves, according to court filings in lawsuits that aim to thwart the cuts.",
      "Many of those interviewed said a generation of scientists \u2014 and the innovations their research would bring \u2014\u00a0could be decimated.",
      "\u201cReally talented people are not able to get jobs; other really talented people are able to get jobs, but they\u2019re choosing not to take them because of the craziness,\u201d said David Baker, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Washington School of Medicine, who won the Nobel Prize in 2024 for protein research. \u201cWhy would you stay in a country where there\u2019s not really an obvious commitment to science, when you could go somewhere else and be better funded and not worry about what you can read in the news or what email you\u2019re going to get?\u201d",
      "In an April 14 court filing, the university\u2019s vice provost for research, Mari Ostendorf, said the campus mood had dimmed.",
      "\u201cFaculty and staff don\u2019t know if their funding will be cut, if their research will be terminated, whether they will be able to attend conferences, or even whether they will continue to have jobs,\u201d Ostendorf wrote. \u201cFunding gaps have forced researchers to abandon studies, miss deadlines, or lose key personnel.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the National Institutes of Health declined to comment.",
      "And there may be even more funding\u00a0lost in the future due to\u00a0Trump administration decisions. After a protest at the University of Washington campus Monday over the war in the Gaza Strip, the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, announced that it was part of a task force reviewing UW\u2019s response to the demonstration.",
      "About 30 people were arrested after occupying a campus building Monday, according to the university, which condemned the protest in a statement and described it as \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cviolent.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration previously canceled federal grants at Columbia University during a similar review and has said Harvard University will receive no new grants until it makes a series of reforms, including changes to policies about protests and antisemitism.",
      "Although the review was only announced Tuesday, the administration\u2019s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism said in a news release that \u201cthe university must do more to deter future violence and guarantee that Jewish students have a safe and productive learning environment,\u201d adding that it expected UW \u201cto follow up with enforcement actions and policy changes.\u201d",
      "A university science laboratory operates like a small factory where workers are churning out ideas, research and data, rather than furniture or light bulbs. Traditionally, these labs\u2019 primary customers are federal science agencies, like NIH or NSF.",
      "Think of a lab\u2019s principal investigator as akin to a\u00a0company president. In the grant process, they must convince the government or private funders to buy their product \u2014 unique research \u2014\u00a0and then pay graduate students in wages and tuition.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like a small-business owner,\u201d said Adair, who recently left Seattle to serve as a professor and associate director at the UMass Chan Medical School\u2019s gene therapy center. \u201cI have to pay myself. I have to pay my staff. I have to find the money to do the research.\u201d",
      "In the first few months of 2025, funding for NIH grants has lagged the year prior by at least $2.3 billion, according to STAT News. NIH has also canceled grant applications as it targets politically disfavored topics like infectious diseases, according to critics.",
      "That funding slowdown has forced many principal investigators to reduce their lab\u2019s size.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had to make personnel cuts,\u201d said Alex Greninger, a professor of laboratory medicine at UW Medicine, adding that he had been forced to rescind a job offer to a postdoctoral researcher from China who had been doing research in his lab for nearly three years.",
      "It\u00a0cost the researcher her visa, he said. Another member of his lab left to take a job at a Chinese gene synthesis firm.\u00a0Several have seen placements rescinded at other institutions.",
      "\u201cThis is the first year where people didn\u2019t get into graduate school,\u201d Greninger said, about technicians in his lab who have completed undergraduate degrees, adding that they had done \u201ceverything right.\u201d",
      "Dr. Anna Wald, the head of allergy and infectious diseases at UW Medicine, the university\u2019s school of medicine and hospital system, said several principal investigators in her department cut part of their own salaries to keep their staffers on.",
      "Meanwhile, Adair paid out of her own pocket to send students to conferences that could advance their careers.",
      "The uncertainty has also simply wasted time, some said.",
      "\u201cEverybody is spending a lot of time dealing with changes in how the university operates,\u201d said\u00a0Jakob Von Moltke, an associate professor of immunology at the University of Washington. \u201cEverything just functions less efficiently and there\u2019s less innovation.\u201d",
      "With so many professors uncertain about funding, many first-year graduate students seeking a lab are struggling to find positions. At some UW departments, first-year graduate students often rotate between labs for several months before they select a home for the following four or five years.",
      "\u201cA lot of people are scrambling to find a lab to settle into and a lot of faculty are unable to commit to taking students, or backing out of commitments,\u201d said Dustin Mullaney, a first-year doctoral student studying molecular and cellular biology.",
      "Still, many first-years consider themselves lucky \u2014 at least they got in. Most UW departments have reduced upcoming graduate classes by 25%-50%, according to court filings in a case filed by 16 state attorneys general aiming to restore the flow of NIH funding.",
      "\u201cI think we are going to lose most of a generation of scientists,\u201d said Henry Mangapalli, a first-year doctoral student in the laboratory medicine department.",
      "Meanwhile, doctoral students nearing graduation say they\u2019re being recruited to move abroad.",
      "Kristin Weinstein, a fourth-year doctoral student in the department of immunology working on autoimmune research, planned to graduate next year, find a postdoctoral research position at a U.S. university\u00a0and eventually become a professor.",
      "But now, faced with hiring freezes and shrinking labs, Weinstein said she\u2019s considering moving her family, including an infant son, out of the U.S. Before UW\u2019s austerity actions, Weinstein booked travel to Switzerland so she could present her research at the World Immune Regulation Meeting 2025, a key conference in her field.",
      "\u201cWhat it turned into was a lot of informational interviewing,\u201d Weinstein said.\u00a0\u201cI talked to faculty who are in Australia, faculty who are in Germany, faculty who are in Luxembourg and Denmark. \u2026 There was active recruiting happening.\u201d",
      "Baker, the Nobel winner who directs the Institute for Protein Design, said that more than 15 of his graduate students and postdoctoral researchers were aiming for new roles overseas. Meanwhile, other students have seen their research upended.",
      "Nelson Niu, a fourth-year doctoral student in mathematics, said he had planned to spend six years teaching students and completing his thesis, a timeline sanctioned by his department.\u00a0But on March 11 he received an email from his department chair saying the policy had changed for fourth-year students because of new financial realities, and people like Niu were now only guaranteed five years of funding.",
      "\u201cJarring,\u201d Niu said of the notice; now he\u2019d have to pack two years of study into one.",
      "Arjun Kumar, a third-year doctoral student studying why T cells lose their ability to fight off tumors, was working with National Cancer Institute researchers to potentially apply some of his research findings to a type of treatment pioneered there.",
      "But Kumar said he lost weeks of time after the NIH placed a temporary communications freeze on federal researchers this winter.",
      "\u201cThey were already working on key experiments for us and they already had data they couldn\u2019t send us because they couldn\u2019t email us,\u201d Kumar said.",
      "Later, Kumar learned the NCI researchers no longer had the bandwidth to help.",
      "\u201cIt was an exciting collaboration that was snuffed out in the moment,\u201d Kumar said.",
      "Washington is one of 16 states suing the NIH and HHS over its slowdown in grant funding. A judge will hear arguments Thursday as the state attorneys general seek a preliminary injunction.",
      "Meanwhile, the pressure on scientists to leave the U.S. is only increasing. On Monday, the European Union launched a drive to attract scientists to Europe, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a commitment of $566 million to attract U.S. talent and \u201cmake Europe a magnet for researchers.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has been really challenging to my identity as an American citizen to think about having to leave the country to pursue my career,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cIt feels like the American dream is dead.\u201d"

      "On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Arun\u00a0Subramanian told Geragos in a conversation in his chambers that he would be listening and watching him to make sure he doesn\u2019t say anything that could interfere with a fair trial.",
      "\u201cI think this is ridiculous,\u201d Subramanian said. \u201cI think referring to the prosecution in this case as a six-pack of white women is outrageous. ...\u00a0This would not be tolerated in any court from any lawyer anywhere across the nation.\u201d",

      "The print belonged to Willie Eugene Sims, 69, and it was discovered in the car of Jeanette Ralston, 24, Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Rob Baker said Tuesday  in a news release.",
      "Ralston appeared to have been strangled and sexually assaulted when her body was found wedged into the VW's back seat on Feb. 1, 1977, near a bar in San Jose, Baker said.",

      "He faces a maximum prison sentence of 25 years to life in prison.",
      "Baker said investigators had previously sought to identify the print through an FBI database. But those efforts had proved futile, he said.",
      "Then, last year, Baker said his office\u00a0\"threw a Hail Mary\" and ran the print again after the FBI updated the search algorithm in the fingerprint database. The effort was successful, he said, and produced a \"hit\" for Sims, who was living in Ashtabula County, northeast of Cleveland.",
      "Baker told NBC Bay Area that Ralston's son, who was 6 when his mother was killed, told him that he was thankful for Sims' arrest.",
      "\"His birthday is coming up,\" Baker said. \"He said this was such a great birthday present.\"",

      "At the time, Sims was a private assigned to what was then an Army base in Monterey County, south of San Francisco, Baker said.",
      "In 1978, he was convicted of assault with intent to commit murder and robbery in a Monterey County, California, case that involved another woman, court documents show. Sims was sentenced to four years in prison.",
      "Sims left California long before DNA became an essential forensic tool for law enforcement, Baker said, and although his prints were in the FBI's database, it was not until last August when Baker was notified of Sims' identity.",
      "\u201cForensic genealogy gets all the attention these days,\u201d Baker said. \u201cBut a retired cold case prosecutor from the San Diego DA\u2019s Office told me years ago to never underestimate latent print search since the FBI upgraded the algorithm.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The words of President Donald Trump and members of his administration undermined the government's contention at a court hearing Wednesday that the men deported from the country under the Alien Enemies Act and delivered to El Salvador were not in the constructive custody of the United States.",
      "At a hearing Wednesday evening, Chief U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg questioned a Justice Department attorney over whether Trump was telling the truth when he said he could secure the release of Abrego Garcia from the CECOT facility in El Salvador.",
      "Boasberg used Trump\u2019s own words, as well as statements from press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, to chip away at the government\u2019s contention that those incarcerated at CECOT in El Salvador were not in the constructive custody of the United States.",
      "\u201cConstructive custody\u201d refers to the legal notion that people can be held at the behest of the government even if they are not held in its physical custody.",
      "Trump\u00a0said last week\u00a0that he \u201ccould\u201d have Garcia returned to the United States with a phone call, while Leavitt said the United States was paying El Salvador \u201capproximately $6 million\u201d to keep the men and Noem said CECOT was \u201cone of the tools in our tool kit\u201d that the United States could use.",
      "\u201cIs the president not telling the truth, or could he secure the release of Mr. Abrego Garcia?\u201d Boasberg asked Deputy Assistant Attorney General Abhishek Kambli, who was representing the government Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWas the president telling the truth\u201d when he said he could pick up the phone and secure Garcia\u2019s release or not? Boasberg asked.",
      "\u201cThat goes towards the president\u2019s belief about influence he has,\u201d Kambli responded, saying, \"Influence does not equate to constructive custody.\"",
      "Under questioning from Boasberg, Kambli said a \"grant\" dated March 22 that was described as being for law enforcement needs related to the 238 men alleged to be Tren de Aragua members who were recently deported to El Salvador. Kambli confirmed that \u201cgrants were made\u201d that \u201ccan be used for detention of these individuals.\u201d",
      "Boasberg said the plaintiffs had \u201ca lot of facts in your favor\u201d in arguing that the United States had what is called \u201cconstructive custody\u201d of the men \u2014 which the Trump administration has argued in and out of court it does not have. Boasberg questioned Kambli about whether the government would concede that transferring people to CECOT without due process would mean the government had violated their rights.",
      "\u201cI don't know if I would put it in those terms,\" Kambli replied.",
      "Boasberg has ordered the Trump administration to provide sworn declarations from administration officials regarding the issue of who exactly has custody of the people at CECOT.",
      "Boasberg has ordered\u00a0lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward who brought the lawsuit to review the information and to decide by Monday whether to request discovery \u2014 and, if so, exactly what questions, depositions and documents they are requesting.\u00a0After that, Boasberg will decide what to order the government to produce, if necessary.",
      "The Supreme Court last month lifted Boasberg's order, which temporarily blocked the administration from sending members of Tren de Aragua to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, but it did not reach a decision on the merits of Trump's invocation of the act. Last week, a Trump-appointed judge became the first to strike down the administration's use of the act, which had previously been deployed only during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "While the Trump administration proclaimed that it won the Supreme Court argument, Boasberg questioned Kambli about the decision, noting that the court had not reached the merits of the administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg asked whether Kambli acknowledged that the Supreme Court did not reach the arguments about the administration's use of the act itself, and Kambli conceded that it \"did not analyze that precise issue.\"",
      "\"I assume that's a yes,\" Boasberg replied."

      "An HHS spokesperson declined a request to make an agency official available to discuss the project, including how it will be implemented, how it will define autism and how the data will be able to identify its causes.",
      "In a news release, the agency said researchers would focus on autism diagnosis trends, outcomes from medical and behavior therapies, access to care and disparities by demographics and geography, and health care costs.",
      "Scientists have identified a variety of risk factors linked to the development of autistic traits \u2014 most of which\u00a0exist before birth \u2014 including more than 100 genes believed to play a role in 60% to 80% of cases.",
      "Experts who\u2019ve already spent decades researching the disorder said they worry about patient privacy under the new plan.",
      "There\u2019s a \u201clack of clarity around how the data will be collected, how it will be shared, maintained, and how we know it\u2019s going to be accurate,\u201d said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, a nonprofit group that helps to fund evidence-based autism research.",
      "Singer said her team has been inundated with calls and emails from people in the autism community concerned over the lack of transparency from federal health officials about how their private medical data would be obtained and managed.",
      "The database project doesn\u2019t include input from the autism community and overlooks well-established genetic links to the disorder, experts say.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had expert scientists who have been studying this issue for 20 years,\u201d Singer said. \u201cIf there were one environmental toxin, I think we would have found it.\u201d",
      "The project, according to HHS, will focus on autism diagnosis trends over time, health outcomes from \u201cspecific medical and behavioral interventions,\u201d access to care and economic burden.",
      "In a statement, the HHS spokesperson said, \u201cWearable devices can provide continuous, real-world data on sleep patterns, physical activity, stress markers, environmental exposures, and more \u2014 all of which may help researchers identify early-life factors associated with autism spectrum disorder.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a question about how wearable devices would detect environmental exposures or who would be using them.",
      "Michael Snyder, a professor of genetics and director of the Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine at Stanford Medicine, called the idea of using wearables to learn more about autism in general a \u201cphenomenal idea.\u201d",
      "The challenge, he said, is that using wearables to get at the causes of autism would ideally require participants to wear them at an early age, before a diagnosis, and would also require a large sample size.",
      "Snyder is leading a small pilot study with a wearable device his team invented that measures environmental exposures as well as sleep and activity levels, to see if there are any links to autism.",
      "Singer said that currently, wearables are only used to alert teachers and caregivers to when an autistic person may become overwhelmed and overstimulated, and in need of a break.",
      "\u201cIn the profound autism community, we\u2019re using wearables to give an early warning as to when a meltdown might occur or self-injury may occur,\u201d she said. \u201cThat enables someone to intervene.\u201d",
      "Autism community backlash",
      "Autism and its possible causes have been an obsession for Kennedy over decades, starting with his false claim linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to the disorder \u2014\u00a0a connection that has been widely debunked by research from several countries. Experts predicted that Kennedy would revisit his mission as health secretary \u2014 which came true last month when he announced a study to identify the root causes by September.",
      "Following a report published in April by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found a rise in autism rates in children in the U.S., Kennedy said the study would look at \u201cenvironmental exposures,\u201d including mold, food additives, pesticides and medicines.",
      "Federal health officials were recently forced to walk back a plan to create a national registry of people with autism after backlash from the autism community.",
      "The registry would\u2019ve included data from private medical records, which autism advocacy groups warned could violate people\u2019s privacy and lead to people with autism to avoid or refuse medical care \u201cfor fear of their data being shared without their permission,\u201d according to the Autism Science Foundation.",
      "It's unclear how the new project, which will also rely on medical records, is any different.",
      "Zoe Gross, director of advocacy for the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, said, \u201cNone of us have been consulted on this. Under previous administrations, both Democratic and Republican, we have had more contact with HHS and more involvement in major projects involving autism.\u201d",
      "\u201cHad we been able to give input into this, we would have suggested more clarity and different research aids,\u201d Gross said."

    "summary": "Student protestors have taken over a room of Columbia University's Butler Library",
    "story": [
      "New York police officers were called Wednesday after protesters took over a room of a Columbia University library in a resurgence of the on-campus pro-Palestinian demonstrations that rocked the nation last spring.",
      "Columbia University said in a statement Wednesday afternoon that it was \"dealing with a disruption in reading room 301 of Butler Library,\" noting that its public safety team was \"working to mitigate the situation.\"",
      "Columbia did not call in New York Police Department officers until hours after the disruptions began. At 7:10 p.m., the department said it was \"responding to an ongoing situation on campus where individuals have occupied a library and are trespassing.\"",
      "Around 76 protesters in zip ties were ushered out of the building by officers, an NBC News crew witnessed.",
      "The school had asked people involved to identify themselves and leave the premises. It said in an evening update that it repeatedly asked the protesters for their identification, and said they \"were repeatedly told that failure to comply would result in violations of our rules and policies and possible arrest for trespassing.\"",
      "The demonstrators were barred from leaving the library without presenting public safety officers with their identifications. A large group of protesters, their faces obscured by keffiyehs, appeared to try to force their way through a set of doors where a group of what appeared to be security officers was standing, video posted to social media shows.",
      "Officers appear to resist and push the group back as someone on a megaphone pleads with the group to, \"Stop pushing, please,\" the video shows. The speaker says they would let the protesters go if they took out their ID cards, to which the group responds with a resounding, \"No!\" and a chant of, \"Let us go!\"",
      "The people involved in the protest refused to identify themselves and leave, the evening update from Columbia said, prompting the call to police.",
      "\"Due to the number of individuals participating in the disruption inside and outside of the building, a large group of people attempting to force their way into Butler Library creating a safety hazard, and what we believe to be the significant presence of individuals not affiliated with the University, Columbia has taken the necessary step of requesting the presence of NYPD to assist in securing the building and the safety of our community,\" the statement said.",
      "\"Requesting the presence of the NYPD is not the outcome we wanted, but it was absolutely necessary to secure the safety of our community,\" the statement continued.",
      "Two Columbia Public Safety Officers were injured during what the school called a \"crowd surge\" as people tried to \"force\" their way into the library, it said.",
      "The university allowed others in the library who were not involved in the protest to leave the building. In an alert sent to students, it said the library was closed and the area should remain clear.",
      "\"Disruptions to our academic activities will not be tolerated and are violations of our rules and policies; this is especially unacceptable while our students study and prepare for final exams,\" Columbia said in a statement. \"Columbia strongly condemns violence on our campus, antisemitism and all forms of hate and discrimination, some of which we witnessed today.\"",
      "Around 3:30 p.m., Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), a group that calls on the university to divest its ties from Israel, publicized an \"EMERGENCY RALLY: ALL OUT TO BUTLER LIBRARY\" in a social media post.",
      "The group said more than \"100 actionists have reclaimed the main reading room as the Basil-Al-Araj Popular University.\" The post called on others to \"support, bring noise, and wear a mask.\"",
      "\"The flood shows that as long as Columbia funds and profits from imperialist violence, the people will continue to disrupt Columbia's profits and legitimacy,\" CUAD wrote in a post on its Substack. \"Repression breeds resistance \u2014 if Columbia escalates repression, the people will continue to escalate disruptions on this campus.\"",
      "Videos\u00a0posted by the group Columbia Jewish & Israeli Students\u00a0show individuals chanting \"free, free, free Palestine\" as they walk throughout the building. A second video shows a large group of people, many wearing keffiyehs, gathered and loudly chanting in what appears to be the reading room.",
      "Those involved in the protest also appeared to have vandalized structures in the library.\u00a0Photos posted by CUAD\u00a0appear to show messages, including \"free Gaza\" and \"we will always come back for Palestine,\" scribbled in marker on tables and glass cases.",
      "Outside the library, other groups of masked protesters in various locations around campus continued chanting, videos from the scene showed.",
      "A video shows dozens of people pushing up against NYPD barricades just outside the university\u2019s campus at 114th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.",
      "The protest comes just two days after Israel's security Cabinet approved a plan to seize all of the Gaza Strip. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the plan an intensive military operation aimed at defeating Hamas.",
      "Gaza remains blockaded by Israel, the longest since the war began in October 2023, as Israel's\u00a0total ban on the entry of all goods, including food, fuel and medical supplies, enters its third month.",
      "The protest Wednesday also comes amid the Trump administration's efforts to block federal funding from some universities, including\u00a0Harvard\u00a0and\u00a0Columbia, over the fact that it says the schools are not doing enough to combat antisemitism on their campuses.",
      "In the Substack post, CUAD offered insight into the protest's location and meaning.",
      "The group said it \"renamed\" the library to Basel Al-Araj Popular University as a reference to Basel al-Araj, a Palestinian writer \"whose writings on the Palestinian resistance and on the nature of war guide revolutionaries around the world today.\"",
      "The group chose Butler Library to rebuke the building's namesake, Nicholas Murray Butler, a former president of the University who the group called \"a shameless Nazi sympathizer.\"",
      "CUAD also offered its demands of Columbia, including a full financial divestment from Israel, for police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to leave campus, and amnesty for all \"targeted by Columbia University's Discipline.\"",
      "In April of last year, after meeting with student groups amid pro-Palestinian protests on campus, then-President Minouche Shafik said the school would not divest from Israel and that it and the students were unable to reach any agreement at the time to end the protests.",
      "The university announced in March \"multi-year suspensions, temporary degree revocations and expulsions\" for people who participated in the protest occupying Hamilton Hall on campus last Spring. It was not clear how many students were disciplined in relation to the event.",
      "It is not clear whether ICE agents are ever-present on Columbia's campus, as CUAD's demands suggest, but agents were on the premises at least once in recent months, when they took student protest organizer Mahmoud Khalil into custody at his university-owned apartment building in March. Khalil has been detained in Louisiana since shortly after his arrest and has been fighting his detention and potential deportation in court.",
      "In three statements in the two days following Khalil\u2019s arrest, the university said its policy is to comply with the law but also to require law enforcement operating in its non-public spaces to have a judicial warrant. Khalil was detained without an arrest warrant, the Trump administration later said.",
      "In March, the school agreed to a list of demands from the administration to restore federal funding that it was stripped of. One of the demands was to hire 36 new campus security officers who, unlike previous security officers, will have the ability to arrest students."

    "summary": "Six years ago, a Canadian neurologist claimed to notice strange symptoms in a cluster of patients in New Brunswick, a province bordering Maine.",
    "story": [
      "Six years ago, a Canadian neurologist claimed to notice strange symptoms in a cluster of patients in New Brunswick, a province bordering Maine.",
      "According to the neurologist, Dr. Alier Marrero, the patients suffered hallucinations, spasms, rapid memory loss and the sensation that bugs were crawling underneath their skin, but their symptoms and brain scans didn\u2019t neatly fit an existing diagnosis. In other words, the cases were a mystery.",
      "But since then, neurologists who have reviewed the cases have identified clear diagnoses, including Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and cancer.",
      "A study published this week in JAMA Neurology reinforces those findings, putting the probability of a mystery disease at roughly 1 in a million.",
      "Doctors working on the study evaluated 25 people who had been identified as part of the New Brunswick cluster. Eleven of the patients had died, so neuropathologists used autopsies to determine their illnesses. For the 14 living patients, neurologists relied on cognitive assessments, among other tests. They concluded that all of the patients had well-known conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, cancer, traumatic brain injuries or post-concussion symptoms.",
      "\u201cWe really felt we had a good explanation for 100% of the cases,\u201d said an author of the study, Dr. Anthony Lang, a neurologist at University Health Network\u2019s Krembil Brain Institute.",
      "However, some doctors worry it won\u2019t be enough to quash speculation that the cases have an unknown origin \u2014 a theory many patients and their families have clung to.",
      "According to the study authors, 52 people identified as part of the New Brunswick cluster refused second opinions, and 42 more didn\u2019t respond to the authors\u2019 reaching out. The study attributes that to declining trust in health institutions and the spread of misinformation on both traditional and social media.",
      "\u201cThese were examples of misdiagnosis that then led to misinformation. And sadly, the physician involved continues to believe and convince the patients and families that they have a mysterious illness,\u201d Lang said.",
      "Marrero took issue with the study and its findings in a statement.",
      "\u201cI am in profound disagreement with the study conclusions and have many questions regarding the methods and the content,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sure that our patients, families, and communities share the same very serious concerns.\u201d",
      "Dr. Valerie Sim, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Alberta who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said there has been no proof that the patients\u2019 illnesses are related. In fact, she said, the cases are \u201cso broad in their description that we could all have this mysterious illness.\u201d",
      "\u201cSadly, the one thing that all the patients have in common is the same neurologist,\u201d Sim said. \u201cAnd the patients who have been seen by other neurologists get a diagnosis of a known entity that\u2019s not a mystery.\u201d",
      "James Mastrianni, a neurology professor at the University of Chicago who wasn\u2019t part of the research, said the study reinforces that \u201ca second opinion by an expert in the field is often helpful.\u201d",
      "An ongoing investigation",
      "The mystery illness theory gained traction in 2021 when Canadian health authorities began investigating cases based on Marrero\u2019s reports. But even after the investigation determined that most patients had known conditions, some families were skeptical. In November, the premier of New Brunswick, Susan Holt, called on the province\u2019s health minister to conduct a scientific review \u201cinto the mystery brain disease.\u201d",
      "\u201cNew Brunswickers deserve answers,\u201d Holt said in a statement last year. \u201cWe need to know what\u2019s making us sick.\u201d",
      "Some patient advocates now believe an environmental exposure is triggering the illnesses, claiming patients\u2019 blood and urine tests show the presence of heavy metals, pesticides and rare antibodies that warrant further study.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t ever about whether a patient could have an alternative diagnosis,\u201d said Kat Lanteigne, an advocate from New Brunswick. \u201cIt was what has triggered them to have this neurodegenerative disease?\u201d",
      "Dr. Yves L\u00e9ger, New Brunswick\u2019s chief medical officer of health, said in a statement Wednesday that the new study \u201cdoesn\u2019t change my Office\u2019s intention to complete its own investigation into cases of undiagnosed neurological illness in New Brunswick.\u201d",
      "His office has received 222 reports of cases identified as part of the cluster.",
      "Marrero said he has \u201cevaluated more than 500 patients in this cluster, and provided a significant amount of unequivocal, sometimes critical environmental exposure evidences, as well as rare autoimmune markers in many of them.\u201d",
      "But Lang said that just because a substance is in blood or urine doesn\u2019t mean it caused someone\u2019s neurological symptoms.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t do a shotgun approach looking for anything and everything and then finding something and claiming it\u2019s related to what the problem is,\u201d he said.",
      "The challenge of diagnosing neurological issues",
      "Neurologists with no connection to the New Brunswick cases point to a few reasons advocates, doctors and government officials are still debating the cause of the illnesses.",
      "For one, they said, accurate diagnoses can take time. And some of the conditions detected in the study, like Alzheimer\u2019s, can have complex presentations.",
      "\u201cIt really takes a cohesive story from the family and a timeline to understand if someone is developing dementia. There can be confusing signs on a neurologic exam,\u201d said Dr. Kimberly O\u2019Neill, a neurologist in the NYU Langone Health Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center.",
      "One of the core symptoms used to identify the New Brunswick patients was rapidly progressing dementia. But families sometimes miss early signs of neurodegeneration, making it appear that dementia came on suddenly, Mastrianni said.",
      "Once debilitating symptoms arrive, patients and their families are often desperate for answers and may be reluctant to let go of the first diagnoses they get, Sim said.",
      "\u201cWe see this all the time in medicine, that patients gravitate to a diagnosis or a group entity,\u201d Sim said. \u201cThat\u2019s clearly what\u2019s happening here.\u201d",
      "The misdiagnoses are \u201creally a tragedy,\u201d she added, because patients could be missing out on treatments or proper care."

      "The start of the deal: Why Trump stopped emphasizing speed on trade deals",
      "Just a few weeks ago, President Donald Trump and White House aides were boasting that his tariffs would force a legion of foreign nations to rush into new trade deals \u2014 and that Trump\u2019s prowess would yield more favorable terms for the United States.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my a--,\u201d Trump said last month before his reciprocal tariffs were due to go into effect. \u201cThey are dying to make a deal. \u2018Please, please, sir, make a deal. I\u2019ll do anything. I\u2019ll do anything, sir!\u2019\u201d",
      "After Trump paused some of his tariffs and declared a three-month negotiating window, his trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said a few days later on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got 90 deals in 90 days possibly pending here.\u201d",
      "But Trump has changed his tone and his tune in recent days, as it has become clear that trade agreements don\u2019t materialize as quickly as he would like and that there aren\u2019t dozens in the queue. His shift also comes amid heavy criticism that his tariffs will hike prices for consumers and harm an American economy that had its first negative growth in years in the first quarter.",
      "\u201cYou keep writing about deals, deals. When are we going to sign one? It\u2019s very simple. We\u2019re going to say, in some cases, we want you to open up your country. In some cases we want you to drop your tariffs,\u201d an obviously frustrated Trump told reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cSo I wish they\u2019d keep, you know, stop asking, \u2018How many deals are you signing this week?\u2019 Because one day we\u2019ll come and we\u2019ll give you 100 deals. And they don\u2019t have to sign.\u201d",
      "Beyond the ambitious sweep of trying to haggle with scores of nations at once, the United States has yet to open discussions with its largest trading partner \u2014 China \u2014 since Trump applied a 145% across-the-board tariff on its products.",

      "When President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that the Yemeni Houthis had agreed to stop firing on U.S ships in the Red Sea and that the United States had halted its airstrikes against the Iran-backed militia, America\u2019s closest ally in the Middle East was caught unaware.",
      "Israel didn\u2019t even know a ceasefire was in the works, and its vessels aren\u2019t covered by the truce. In fact, the same day, Israel had hammered the airport in Yemen\u2019s capital, retaliating for a Houthi strike almost hit Israel\u2019s Ben Gurion Airport. The Houthis haven\u2019t said whether they are also extending safe passage to other international shipping so they could resume sailing through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, a much cheaper route than the lengthier voyage around the Horn of Africa.",
      "The first public hint of a possible breach between U.S. and Israeli leadership came when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House last month, hoping the United Stateswould provide air support for a possible Israeli operation against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. Instead, Trump announced he would agree to direct talks with Iran.",
      "And now, the administration is pressuring Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release within days. That\u2019s because Trump wants to announce an agreement before he leaves next week for Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar for the first foreign trip of his second term. His impatience is rooted in his hope of making progress toward completing the Abraham Accords, which he initiated in his first term, by getting Saudi Arabia to take the first steps toward recognizing Israel. The effort continued under President Joe Biden, but it collapsed when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, triggering the war in Gaza. And the Saudis won\u2019t consider it while the war continues.",
      "But Hamas is entrenched, Israel has reoccupied two-thirds of Gaza, and Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet has called up the reserves to expand the fighting. This week, special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff keynoted Israel\u2019s Independence Day celebration in Washington, D.C., by gently chiding Israelis to overcome their political divisions. On Wednesday, Netanyahu\u2019s closest political adviser, Ron Dermer, the former ambassador to the United States, arrived in Washington for ceasefire talks with Secretary of State/national security adviser Marco Rubio and Witkoff.",
      "The question is: Will Netanyahu reverse course in Gaza to achieve an even more important shared goal with the United States \u2014 an economic and security agreement with Saudi Arabia, completing his dream of peace and prosperity with the Arab world?",

      "The road-rage killer of an Arizona man was sentenced last week to 10\u00bd years behind bars after his victim spoke to the court via artificial intelligence in what could be the first-of-its-kind use of the technology, officials said Wednesday.",
      "Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Todd Lang on Thursday\u00a0gave the maximum sentence to Gabriel Paul Horcasitas for the fatal shooting of Christopher Pelkey, 37, on Nov. 13, 2021, prosecutors said.",
      "Horcasitas, 54, was convicted of manslaughter and endangerment this year.",
      "Lang allowed Pelkey's loved ones to play an AI-generated version of the victim \u2014 his face and body and a lifelike voice that appeared to ask the judge for leniency.",
      "\u201cTo Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me: It is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,\" the artificial version of Pelkey said. \"In another life, we probably could have been friends. I believe in forgiveness.\"",
      "The idea of using an AI version of Pelkey came from his family, not the state, according to his loved ones and a Maricopa County Attorney's Office spokesperson.",
      "Stacey Wales, Pelkey\u2019s sister, and his brother-in-law both work in the AI field. When Wales suggested bringing her late brother to life like that, she said, her husband was more than hesitant.",
      "\"He recoiled,\" Wales told NBC News. \"And he said: 'Stacey, do you know what you're asking me to do? This is my best friend.' And I said: 'I know. It's my brother.' And then he said, 'If this isn't perfect, if this doesn't go out and really embody the spirit of Chris, I'm not going to let this be shown.'\"",
      "Horcasitas had been convicted of manslaughter and endangerment at trial in spring 2023. But a new trial was ordered when a judge ruled that prosecutors failed to property disclose potentially key evidence in a timely manner.",
      "Wales said she hadn't come up with the idea in 2023. After two years of trying to craft a victim impact statement, she said, she had the epiphany that the only voice that mattered was her late brother's.",
      "\"Every time I'd get in the shower or the car and my thoughts were quiet, I wrote down what I was feeling \u2014 frustrated, crying or emotions, yelling, anger, love, anything that I could think of,\" she said.",
      "\"I've been writing it for two years, but I never had the idea to help Chris speak until a week and a half before this second trial.\"",
      "She added: \"What I had to say did not seem like it would do justice to the last person listening to make a decision on Chris' life.\"",
      "Horcasitas faced seven to 10\u00bd years in prison. The defense asked for the lowest punishment.",
      "Lang delivered the maximum, but he acknowledged the words in the presentation. \"And as angry as you are, justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness,\" he said. \"I feel like that was genuine, that his obvious forgiveness of Mr. Horcasitas reflects the character I heard about [Pelkey] today.\"",
      "Defense lawyer Jason Lamm said the AI presentation created a strong issue for appeal.",
      "\"While judges certainly have latitude as to what to hear, particularly from victims, an appellate court will have to decide if this was error,\" Lamm said, \"if it was just simply too far over the line in terms of being inflammatory and to what degree the judge relied on it in imposing a sentence on my client.\"",
      "Arizona State University law professor Gary Marchant, who specializes in ethics and emerging technologies, praised Pelkey's loved ones for producing a work that appeared to be against their self-interest of securing a maximum penalty for Horcasitas.",
      "But he said he's worried about the precedent it set.",
      "\"The family did a really good job of representing what he would have said, and they would have the best sense of what he would have said,\" Marchant said. \"But on the other hand, it's completely fake, right? It's not true.\"",
      "While prosecutors and defense lawyers have long used visual aids, charts and other illustrations to make their points, Marchant said, AI presents new ethical challenges.",
      "\"I mean, it's a blurry line, right?\" said Marchant, who is on a state Supreme Court committee advising on the use of AI. \"You see someone speaking who isn't really speaking, right? You see that person in the courtroom actually speaking, and in reality, they're dead and they're not speaking. So this is an extra jump that I feel is going to get us into dangerous grounds.\""

    "summary": "PowerSchool is one of the largest education software providers in North America, and it was hit with a major data breach in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "One of the largest providers of education tech paid off hackers so that they wouldn\u2019t publish tens of millions of children\u2019s personal information. But school districts are facing extortion attempts anyway.",
      "The company, PowerSchool, missed a basic cybersecurity step, according to a cybersecurity audit obtained by NBC News, and was hacked last year, leading to one of the largest breaches to date of American children\u2019s personal data. PowerSchool reportedly paid an undisclosed sum to the hackers in exchange for a video of them purporting to delete the files they had stolen, which included some students\u2019 Social Security numbers and other information, like health and disciplinary records.",
      "But \"a threat actor\" is using that stolen data to try to extort schools and school districts in both the U.S. and Canada, according to statements from PowerSchool and various school districts issued Wednesday.",
      "\"PowerSchool is aware that a threat actor has reached out to multiple school district customers in an attempt to extort them using data from the previously reported December 2024 incident,\" PowerSchool wrote in a statement Wednesday. \"We do not believe this is a new incident, as samples of data match the data previously stolen in December.\"",
      "Public schools across North Carolina received extortion emails Wednesday morning, North Carolina Department of Public Instruction Superintendent Mo Green said in a public bulletin. The threat actor appears to have students' and staffers\u2019 names, contact information, birthdays, medical information, parental information, and in some cases Social Security numbers, he said.",
      "Several Canadian school authorities have announced they are also among the victims, including the Peel District School Board in Ontario and the Toronto District School Board. The Calgary Board of Education also issued a warning to parents this week based on communication it had received from PowerSchool.",
      "It was not immediately clear who was behind the current extortion attempt. PowerSchool said it believes that the threat actor is using data stolen from the original incident last year, indicating that the original hackers either are behind the current attempts or kept the data and made it accessible to other people.",
      "\u201cWe have reported this matter to law enforcement both in the United States and in Canada and are working closely with our customers to support them. We sincerely regret these developments\u2013 it pains us that our customers are being threatened and re-victimized by bad actors,\u201d PowerSchool's statement said.",
      "\u201cAs is always the case with these situations, there was a risk that the bad actors would not delete the data they stole, despite assurances and evidence that were provided to us,\u201d it said.",
      "It is not clear if other American school districts had been victims of the renewed extortion attempt. PowerSchool declined to name victims, saying only that it was aware of \u201cmultiple school district customers.\u201d A majority of U.S. states have at least one school district that was affected by the original breach.",
      "PowerSchool is one of the largest companies in the educational technology industry, which became particularly widespread during the Covid pandemic and uses software to streamline school processes. One of its primary programs helps school districts track students, and the company servers stored information like their names, family members, addresses and birthdays."

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is holding interest rates steady as it navigates uncertainty kicked up by a president who keeps pressuring the central bank to lower them.",
      "It\u2019s an ironic, whiplash-inducing reversal for Fed policymakers who just months ago were on the verge of a rare feat \u2014\u00a0wrestling down a historic run-up of inflation without triggering mass layoffs, known as a \u201csoft landing\u201d \u2014 and preparing to keep cutting borrowing costs. But President Donald Trump\u2019s rapid upending of global trade has pushed the Fed and its leader into a difficult position, in which they feel a wait-and-see approach may be their best strategy for now.",
      "\u201cThe Fed has been plunged into an almost impossible situation whereby its two mandates will likely move in opposite directions,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, referring to the Fed\u2019s dual mission of keeping employment high and inflation low.",
      "\u201cBut government policy \u2014 which is incredibly uncertain itself \u2014 will dictate both the timing and magnitudes of those moves,\u201d she wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.",
      "The concern is that an economy damaged by tariffs will force the Fed to cut interest rates to stave off job losses, at the risk of driving inflation higher. After having peaked above 9% in mid-2022, the annual inflation rate has been hovering just north of the central bank\u2019s 2% target for nearly a year.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that holding pat on rates allows the Fed to \u201cwait and see\u201d how the economy unfolds. But policymakers warned in their statement Wednesday that \u201cthe risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen,\u201d renewing concerns about \u201cstagflation\u201d \u2014\u00a0a situation in which job losses and price hikes both mount even as the economy lags.",
      "\u201cThe tariff shock will reduce real GDP growth and raise prices at the same time, putting the Fed on the horns of a dilemma,\u201d Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, warned in a note Wednesday afternoon. \u201cThe policy move necessary to maintain full employment is the opposite of that necessary to contain inflation. Moving one policy lever to hit two conflicting targets is problematic.\u201d",
      "Politics are adding to the difficulty, with the Fed\u2019s decision likely to draw Trump\u2019s ire. Trump has broken long-standing norms against political influence over monetary policy by repeatedly bashing Powell \u2014 whom he appointed in 2018 \u2014 and escalating his attacks in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cCUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!\u201d he wrote on Truth Social on April 4. Two weeks later, he posted again, nicknaming Powell \u201cToo Late\u201d and saying his \u201ctermination cannot come fast enough!\u201d In yet another post a week later, Trump called Powell a \u201cmajor loser.\u201d",
      "Powell told reporters Wednesday that Trump\u2019s comments had no impact.",
      "\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t affect either our job or the way we do it,\u201d he said, adding that neither has he asked for a meeting with Trump nor has the president requested one. President Joe Biden reappointed Powell in 2022, and despite the recent barrage of criticism, Trump told NBC News\u2019 Kristen Welker last week that he wouldn\u2019t seek to remove him before his term ends in May 2026.",
      "\u201cWhy would I do that? I get to replace the person in another short period of time,\u201d he said.",
      "The challenges of recent months mark the second time Powell has weighed how to handle economic fallout from Trump\u2019s trade policies. In 2019, Trump was similarly threatening higher duties on China. Powell, who faced similar jabs from Trump through a barrage of Twitter posts at the time, wound up cutting interest rates three times to pre-emptively cushion the U.S. economy from the blow of higher duties.",
      "Powell signaled Wednesday that this time is different. The Fed was less worried in 2019 about the inflationary impacts of lower rates, he indicated, because prices were rising more slowly at a slower pace than they are now. Core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, showed prices rising at an annual rate of 2.6% in March, whereas the same measure clocked in beneath 2% for all of 2019.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a situation where we can be pre-emptive, because we actually don\u2019t know what the right response to the data will be until we see more data,\u201d Powell said.",
      "Although markets expect the Fed to cut interest rates three times by the end of the year, some analysts aren\u2019t so sure. Bank of America researchers said Wednesday, \u201cIf our base case of a steady labor market and rising inflation is correct, we don\u2019t see a path to cuts in 2025.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, Powell has avoided committing to future moves given the widespread uncertainty Trump\u2019s tariffs have generated for corporate bosses, small-business owners and consumers alike.",
      "\u201cThere are cases in which it would be appropriate for us to cut rates this year. There are cases in which it wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Carmen Bonilla has barely slept for nearly two months, her mind filled with terrifying thoughts about what might be happening to her son, whose dream to go to the United States for a better life has turned into a waking nightmare.",
      "Andry Blanco Bonilla, 40, was among the nearly 240 Venezuelan immigrants who were boarded onto planes and taken to a mega-prison in El Salvador on March 15, in a case that has spurred multiple legal battles and reached the Supreme Court.",
      "Families and attorneys told NBC News they haven\u2019t heard from the men since, and that the United States and Salvadoran governments have given them little to no information. The Trump administration\u2019s action taken nearly two months ago has rippled across continents, leaving loved ones broken and in the dark, they said. They said that their family members have been wrongfully caught up in the administration\u2019s agenda to deport immigrants en masse.",
      "\u201cI know nothing about what\u2019s happening to him,\u201d Bonilla said in Spanish from her home in Venezuela. \u201cI don\u2019t sleep. I\u2019ve lost weight. Watching the news about this makes me sick.\u201d",
      "The men are expected to be held in El Salvador for at least a year, in a prison system that has faced multiple allegations of human rights abuses. The president of El Salvador has said that the one-year sentence is \u201crenewable.\u201d",
      "\u201cA whole year lost because he was unjustly sent to that prison?\u201d Bonilla said through tears. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a good son, father, brother and hard worker. He is not a criminal. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d",
      "It remains unclear what will happen to the men after a year spent in the prison. Bonilla and other families are praying they are somehow released before then, but legal pathways for that are also still uncertain.",
      "The Trump administration has said the men are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, but has shared little evidence of its claims or explained why these men were chosen to be sent to El Salvador. In a proclamation on March 15, Trump said that Tren de Aragua was designated a terrorist organization and was \u201cperpetuating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\u201dThe Department of Homeland Security and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Some of the men\u2019s families and attorneys strongly denied their loved ones have any ties to the gang and said they were unfairly targeted because of tattoos that may be popular in Venezuela and are unrelated to Tren de Aragua. They also say the migrants were denied due process and a chance to defend themselves from the accusations against them. Experts have said tattoos are not closely connected with affiliation to Tren de Aragua.",
      "The United States government has not released a list of the Venezuelan men who were taken, but their names were first reported by CBS News. A New York Times investigation found that most of the men don\u2019t have criminal records in the United States or in the region and that very few of them appear to have any documented evidence connecting them to the gang.",
      "Blanco Bonilla was living in Texas and seeking asylum when immigration authorities arrested him in February after an official stopped him at his cousin\u2019s immigration appointment and asked about his tattoos.\u00a0He was an engineer in Venezuela but had recently been working as a delivery man in the United States to make ends meet and support his family still in his home country, his mother said. He used to call her every day he could. Now, she hasn\u2019t heard his voice for nearly two months and has no idea when she will hear from him again.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if he\u2019s eating. How he\u2019s feeling. What he\u2019s going through,\u201d Blanco Bonilla\u2019s sister, Angy Blanco Bonilla, said. \u201cWe ask God for a sign that he\u2019s OK. Not having any information is what hurts us the most.\u201d",
      "Some of the Venezuelan men had open immigration cases, including asylum-related, while others had orders of deportation, according to attorneys representing them.",
      "\u201cHow did they end up in El Salvador?\u201d asked Martin Rosenow, a Miami attorney who represents one of the Venezuelan men, asylum-seeker Franco Jose Caraballo Tiapa.",
      "Caraballo Tiapa, 26, a barber and father of two, was in the United States seeking asylum because of political persecution related to his advocacy against the current Venezuelan government and has no criminal history, Rosenow said. He had been released into the United States with his wife before he was detained after a routine immigration appointment in February.",
      "\u201cThe fact that en masse, these individuals have been sent without due process to another country, this has never happened before,\u201d Rosenow said.",
      "What has been alarming to Rosenow and a group of attorneys representing the men, is how \u201cthe Trump administration has casually dismissed the possibility of bringing these people back,\u201d he said.",
      "Even for those who had orders of removal against them, the orders were for them to be returned to Venezuela, not to be sent to a different country, said attorney Natalie Cadwalader-Schultheis. She represents three Venezuelan men who had orders of removal to their home country and were sent to El Salvador instead. The men all entered the United States legally through a Biden-era app that set appointments for migrants with immigration authorities, she said, adding that the men did not have criminal convictions.",
      "\u201cI hope people recognize that this is a really dangerous precedent to set. We are seeing people disappeared by the government to a torture prison in another country,\u201d Cadwalader said.",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was also taken to the prison in El Salvador despite a judge\u2019s order that barred him from being sent there, has become a center of the legal battles relating to the deportations. His attorneys have brought a lawsuit against the federal government seeking his return to the United States.",
      "The Trump administration has accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the gang MS-13, which his attorney and family deny. He was also subject to a judge\u2019s order that he could not be returned to El Salvador, based on evidence presented in court that he would be targeted by gang members.",
      "The Supreme Court has weighed in and ordered that the Trump administration facilitate his return.",
      "President Donald Trump said in an interview with ABC News last week that he \u201ccould\u201d have Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to the United States with one phone call, even though the administration had argued previously in court that the government had no ability to get him back.",
      "\u201cIf he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that. But he is not,\u201d Trump said in the interview.",
      "Rosenow responded to the president's comment. \u201cIt\u2019s very disheartening for him to say he does have the authority. It also shows a kind of blatant disregard for the Supreme Court\u2019s order to facilitate his return.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe whole fight has to do with due process. He should be entitled to due process as the Constitution dictates,\u201d he said.A federal judge, an appeals court and the Supreme Court have all ordered the administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d Abrego Garcia\u2019s return to the United States. Lawyers for the Justice Department have acknowledged in court filings that the deportation was a mistake because an immigration judge had ruled he could not be sent back to his native El Salvador. Lawyers have argued that Abrego Garcia and the other men were denied due process and the chance to defend themselves in court.",
      "Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March after declaring the Venezuela gang Tren de Aragua an invading force. Immigration officials have since used that act to deport hundreds of people, without immigration hearings, alleging that they are members of the gang. Many have ended up in the mega-prison in El Salvador known for its harsh conditions and reported abuse.",
      "On May 1, a Trump-appointed judge rejected the administration\u2019s invocation of the act from 1798 to deport Venezuelans it alleges are members of Tren de Aragua. The Supreme Court also put a pause on deportations under the act in April, as buses with Venezuelans were headed to an airport.",
      "In Venezuela, a group of mothers has been closely following Abrego Garcia's case.",
      "\u201cIf they bring Kilmar back, then there\u2019s still hope that they could bring the more than 200 Venezuelan men back as well,\u201d Bonilla said. \u201cBut when I see Trump talk like this, every day I lose more hope.\u201d",
      "Austria Pulgar, 65, whose son is also in El Salvador, said Trump\u2019s latest comments \u201care so unjust. The Venezuelan men have no reason to be there. They have wrongly accused people and sent them to El Salvador without a chance to defend themselves.\u201d She denies her son has gang ties.",
      "\u201cAll I do is cry. I miss my son so much,\u201d she said in Spanish from her home in Venezuela. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this is going to give me a heart attack.\u201d",
      "Frizgeralth de Jes\u00fas Cornejo Pulgar, 25, entered the United States with his girlfriend in June 2024, his mother said. His girlfriend was released into the country, but his mother said Cornejo Pulgar was detained because he had a floral tattoo on his neck. He was seeking asylum and remained in detention until he was sent to El Salvador, she said.",
      "Like many families, she discovered her son was taken to El Salvador when she recognized his face in propaganda videos and photos released by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Republicans on Capitol Hill are scrambling to resolve intense divisions over Medicaid as they hammer out a key piece of their massive bill for President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda with hopes of advancing it through a House committee next week.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is facing new conflicting pressure from within his narrow majority: Swing-district Republicans are growing increasingly wary of significant Medicaid cuts as they face political heat, while conservative hard-liners are threatening to torpedo the bill unless it contains $2 trillion in cuts.",
      "Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee met behind closed doors Wednesday to try to resolve their differences, and will meet again Thursday. The panel is tasked with finding $880 billion in savings, most of which will have to come from Medicaid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and it has already delayed releasing legislative text and holding a hearing.",
      "While GOP lawmakers sounded upbeat as they exited Wednesday\u2019s meeting, disagreements persisted at the highest levels about the path forward.",
      "Most notably, Johnson told reporters on Tuesday he believed two major Medicaid cuts under discussion \u2014 lowering the federal match (the\u00a0Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP) to states for enrollees added under the Obamacare expansion, and slapping per capita caps on spending \u2014 were off the table.",
      "But after Wednesday\u2019s meeting, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., wasn\u2019t so sure.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll hopefully get to talk to leadership about it a little later. My understanding \u2014 what I saw, though, was per capita caps were still kind of alive,\u201d Guthrie told reporters. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see.\u201d",
      "Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a centrist who represents a swing district Trump lost last fall, said that if FMAP changes and per person spending caps are included in the bill, it will probably fail.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think these measures will pass the House, let alone the Senate,\u201d Bacon told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The House majority is 220-213, meaning Johnson can spare just three Republican votes before the bill risks collapsing. Johnson has set a goal of passing the bill through the House by Memorial Day.",
      "Meanwhile, a group of 32 Republicans sent a letter to Johnson on Wednesday insisting that \u201cthe reconciliation bill must include at least $2 trillion in verifiable savings either through spending reductions or scaling back the size of the tax package\u201d in order to win their votes.",
      "\u201cCritically, the deficit reduction target must be met with real, enforceable spending cuts \u2014 not budget gimmicks,\u201d the GOP lawmakers wrote in the letter, led by Rep. Lloyd Smucker, R-Pa.",
      "Ahead of the letter\u2019s release, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., a former chair of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, said in an interview he simply won\u2019t vote for a bill that adds to the deficit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not worried. I got a vote, and if somebody\u2019s gonna ask me to vote to bankrupt the country \u2014 I don\u2019t know what that coalition is, but I\u2019m not going to be in it,\u201d said Perry, a rare GOP hard-liner in a competitive district who narrowly won re-election last fall.",
      "What is a 'benefit cut'? Republicans disagree",
      "Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, insisted categorically that there will be no cuts to benefits under Medicaid in the bill, which Republicans are aiming to pass on a party-line basis in both chambers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to cut benefits to American citizens. That should be the headline of every news article you guys ever do. The Republicans are not going to cut benefits to American citizens,\u201d Moreno said in an interview. \u201cSo you can talk about anything you want in the other chamber, but if it comes here with a cut of benefits, it\u2019s not going to pass.\u201d",
      "But what constitutes a \u201cbenefit cut\u201d? Republicans have different views on how that should be defined.",
      "Some Republicans say anything that cuts benefits for those who are lawfully on Medicaid today \u2014 or restricts their access to the program \u2014 amounts to a benefit cut. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said lowering the federal match to states and imposing per capita caps may well be benefit cuts, leaving Missouri with a choice of slashing programs, raising taxes or throwing residents off Medicaid. If so, he\u2019d vote no.",
      "But GOP fiscal hawks see it differently: Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, argued that aggregate Medicaid spending is likely to rise in the long term even if those restrictions are implemented, therefore it should not be construed as a cut.",
      "And Perry defended the idea of reducing the federal payment to states, saying the Medicaid expansion created by the Affordable Care Act went too far.",
      "\u201cThe policy as it currently exists incentivizes states to add people to the rolls that are decidedly not within the design of Medicaid as envisioned. Medicaid is for the poor,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWe\u2019re disadvantaging the poor even more for the sake of those who don\u2019t really qualify for the program.\u201d",
      "Republicans broadly agree on some new limits to Medicaid, like work requirements for able-bodied adults, citizenship verification and more frequent eligibility checks. They say those provisions are about program integrity and rooting out fraud and waste.",
      "But that saves a limited sum of money \u2014 probably not enough to meet their targets. GOP lawmakers are at loggerheads over policies that would save larger sums of money, while not affecting benefits.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re making sure that anyone who is eligible remains eligible, and people who should not be on the program, aka illegals, are not on the program,\u201d Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., said after Wednesday\u2019s Energy and Commerce Committee meeting.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats are turning up the political heat over Medicaid. Outside the Capitol, prominent Democrats and outside allies held what they termed a \u201c24-hour vigil for Medicaid\u201d as they warned of horrific consequences, including to older adults, if the program gets the ax.",
      "A new report Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office analyzed some of the ideas Republicans are considering. The report, requested by Democrats to score GOP ideas that have been floated, found that lowering the FMAP under Medicaid and slapping on per capita caps would save hundreds of billions of dollars, while removing millions of Americans from Medicaid.",
      "\u201cNo more bulls--- letters or cable TV appearances from the fake moderates. If they really wanted to save Medicaid, they had the opportunity to vote \u2018no\u2019 on their extreme budget \u2014 twice \u2014 but refused,\u201d said Justin Chermol, a spokesman for the Democrats\u2019 House campaign arm, which has focused on Medicaid. \u201cThis new CBO report is further proof that their words are meaningless.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Improbably, the Golden State Warriors beat a younger, higher-seeded NBA playoff opponent without its best player.",
      "Their challenge? Do it again and again \u2014 for at least a week.",
      "After Warriors superstar Stephen Curry suffered a Grade 1 hamstring strain in Tuesday\u2019s Game 1 victory at Minnesota, he will be re-evaluated in one week, the team said.",
      "Based on the schedule of the conference semifinals, that timeline likely will leave the Warriors without Curry for the next three games, if not longer. Should the series reach a Game 5 on May 14, there will be three days off before Game 6, a potential break for Curry\u2019s recovery.",
      "The 37-year-old Curry, the most prolific 3-point shooter in NBA history and the cornerstone around which the Warriors four-championship run was built, leaves no ordinary void. And for his team, it poses no ordinary challenge, as Golden State has rarely before been forced to play without him in the postseason.",
      "Though the predominant image of Curry\u2019s first seasons in the NBA was of him on the sideline, struggling to deal with recurring ankle injuries, since undergoing ankle surgeries in 2011 and 2012, Curry has become an extremely durable playoff fixture. Since 2013, he has played in 155 postseason games while missing only 12.",
      "He had gone seven years without a playoff absence, a stretch of 65 consecutive appearances.",
      "That consistency was perhaps why, despite their stunning Game 1 win, the tone of Golden State\u2019s postgame interviews was at times mournful rather than celebratory. His team understood it was about to deal with a challenge it had rarely encountered.",
      "Warriors coach Steve Kerr recounted Curry\u2019s mood at halftime as \u201cabsolutely crushed.\u201d",
      "Seeing Curry injured was a \u201clittle deflating,\u201d Draymond Green said. Losing Curry means more than losing his 40% 3-point shooting during these playoffs, which exceeds his career average. Curry\u2019s mere presence pulls defenders toward him and away from teammates, an effect that is described in the NBA as \u201cgravity\u201d and which creates openings for others.",
      "Because the Warriors have rarely needed to compensate without Curry during the postseason, there is little precedent pointing to how Kerr might adjust his playoff rotation for a multi-game absence. But the Curry-less Game 1 victory showed something of a blueprint, one that shifts the burden onto the 35-year-old Green, the team\u2019s longtime defensive disruptor, and scorers Jimmy Butler and Buddy Hield, who combined for 44 points.",
      "In many ways, this is the reason the Warriors traded with Miami for Butler at midseason \u2014 a bet that the 35-year-old\u2019s All-Star-caliber talent and past playoff heroics while leading Miami to two NBA Finals appearances, could provide a margin for error for a Warriors franchise that is nearing the end of its dynastic run anchored by Curry and Green. Butler added 11 rebounds and eight assists to his 20 points.",
      "Whether Hield and Butler can continue to replace Curry\u2019s scoring will be a focus for the next week, but his team\u2019s path to victory Tuesday and in the future appears on the defensive end. Minnesota scored only 11 points in the second quarter as part of a 31-point first half while missing all 15 of its first-half 3-pointers. That poor shooting, and Golden State\u2019s defense, led the 3-point-centric Timberwolves to play out of character. Two-thirds of its shots came inside the 3-point arc. They are now 4-0 when 3-pointers account for around 40% or more of their total shots, and 0-2 when less.",
      "In the second half, backup guard Pat Spencer \u2014 a former top collegiate lacrosse player who had played sparingly previously in this postseason \u2014 added to that effort with two steals off the bench. Jonathan Kuminga, a former first-round draft pick who was effectively out of Golden State\u2019s rotation just one round earlier, was among the cast of reserves and backups who held together late leads and will be called upon to do the same again.",
      "The Timberwolves are expected to be sharper. Their coach criticized the lack of tone-setting performance by star Anthony Edwards, who missed his first 10 shots, and Minnesota\u2019s \u201cdiabolical\u201d fast-break decision-making, which turned 18 Golden State turnovers into just 10 points.",
      "It had other self-inflicted errors, too.",
      "Of its 28 3-pointers taken when the closest defender was at least four feet away \u2014 what the NBA classifies as \u201copen\u201d and \u201cwide-open\u201d shots \u2014 it made just five.",
      "It was enough to allow Golden State to hang on for 24 second-half minutes without their star. Whether they can pull it off again for potentially at least three more games will decide the series."

      "When \"Real Women Have Curves\" opened on Broadway at the James Earl Jones Theatre on April 27, audiences were met with a celebration of resilience, culture and unapologetic authenticity.",
      "Based on the play by Josefina L\u00f3pez, which was also adapted into a 2002 HBO film starring America Ferrera, \"Real Women Have Curves\" is set in a small sewing factory in East Los Angeles during the sweltering summer of 1987.",
      "At the center of the story is Ana Garc\u00eda, a bright, ambitious Mexican-American teenager caught between fulfilling her family's obligations and achieving her own dreams.",
      "She is the only American citizen in her family and works at the factory alongside her mother and other undocumented Latina women, hiding that she\u2019s been accepted to her dream college in New York on a full scholarship.",
      "The play, which L\u00f3pez drew from her own experiences growing up in L.A., doesn\u2019t shy away from the harsh realities faced by immigrant women \u2014 addressing fear of deportation and financial insecurity, while conversations about weight, looks and body image carry on in the background.",
      "In the musical adaptation, this same story is set to music and lyrics by Joy Huerta and Benjamin Velez, injecting vibrant sounds and rhythm into a narrative often presented in a much more somber tone.",
      "\u201cI love the music,\u201d Justina Machado tells TODAY.com. Machado earned a Tony Award nominee for originating the role of Carmen, the matriarch of the Garc\u00eda family in the musical.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so joyous and it\u2019s so important and it\u2019s so timely and it\u2019s so authentic and it\u2019s just something I\u2019m really proud to be a part of.\u201d",
      "This is a full circle moment for Machado, who also originated the role of Ana in the 1993 play, just as her own acting career was taking off.",
      "\u201cThat was the first big regional theater project that I had,\u201d Machado says.",
      "Years later, when director Sergio Trujillo first approached her with hopes she would tackle the blunt and strong-willed mother figure, Machado was hesitant.",
      "\u201cI could never see myself playing that role,\u201d Machado says. But after participating in a reading of the show, she says it just clicked. \u201cI just fell in love with the character. I fell in love with the women. I fell in love with the story. I fell in love with the music.\u201d",
      "That love radiates onstage, with Machado artfully portraying Carmen as a captivating and endearing figure, a bright and welcomed contrast to the harsher character we came to know in the film.",
      "She\u2019s charming, but Carmen still ascribes to stifling ideas of body image that her daughter fights against in the musical. Her constant commentary about her daughter\u2019s weight culminates in the musical\u2019s title song.",
      "Overcome by the summer heat inside the factory, which has only been intensified by an army of irons and garment steamers, the women strip down to their undergarments, confronting their insecurities and celebrating their bodies in the process.",
      "\u201cI have hesitation every night,\u201d Machado says of stripping down. \u201cBut I know how important that number is, and I know what it does for people.\u201d",
      "The relationships are the show\u2019s emotional heart. Mothers, daughters, coworkers and friends, all navigating personal and systemic obstacles together.",
      "\u201cThese women are working under horrible conditions,\u201d Machado says. \u201cThese women are scared that that La Migra is going to show up any second, and they\u2019re working in 100 degree weather, and they\u2019re still finding joy and love and compassion.\u201d",
      "Making her Broadway debut as Ana, Tatianna C\u00f3rdoba also shines in the coming-of-age tale.",
      "\u201cYou just have to listen to each other, react to each other, and if you like each other, that really helps, and we really like each other,\u201d Machado says about C\u00f3rdoba. \u201cShe\u2019s easy to love.\u201d",
      "The tension that anchors the emotional arc of the show, whether or not Ana will convince her parents to let her move to New York and go to Columbia University, resonates across cultural boundaries.",
      "\u201cPeople can be very strong in their opinions, and still have all the love for their child,\u201d Machado says. \u201cNo matter what ethnicity you are, what nationality you are, that is a universal story.\u201d",
      "\"Real Women Have Curves\" reclaims narratives long flattened or ignored, spotlighting the women who hold communities together under impossible circumstances. And it does so with music, a lot of laughter, and hope.",
      "\u201cThis story is just really, truly an immigrant story,\u201d Machado says."

      "\u201cUsually I\u2019m described as eccentric or flamboyant \u2014 and Claude is all those things,\u201d he told me, laughing. \u201cBut at the heart of it, Claude\u2019s entire identity is tied to Danny. If Danny disappears, Claude fades. That fear fuels everything, even his joy.\u201d",

      "MANILA \u2014 On a balmy night outside Manila\u2019s Baclaran church, Gerald Concepcion, 32, and his fellow devotees were decorating a float of the Virgin Mary with fragrant lilies and pink carnations. He added artificial white doves to the arrangement, saying they were in honor of the late Pope Francis, who had led a radical shift in the Catholic Church\u2019s treatment of LGBTQ people.",
      "\u201cPope Francis is a testament that God is alive,\u201d Concepcion, a devout Catholic who works as a street vendor, told NBC News. \u201cHe accepted everyone, including us gay people who have long been marginalized.\u201d",
      "Francis\u2019 death on April 21 has opened the eternal tension between choosing a successor that represents continuity, or one who will bring change, including a possible return to the church\u2019s recent past of more conservative positions on issues like homosexuality.",
      "Luis Antonio Tagle, a Filipino cardinal often dubbed the \u201cAsian Francis\u201d for his emphasis on poor and marginalized people, has emerged as a possible leading contender, or papabile, when the conclave meets on May 7 to elect Francis\u2019 replacement.",
      "If chosen as pope, Tagle could carry with him some lessons from the Philippines. Despite being the biggest Catholic nation in Asia \u2014 about 80% of Filipinos are Catholic \u2014 and the third-largest in the world, it is also one of the more LGBTQ-friendly countries in the region.",
      "Many gay Catholics, like Concepcion, remain active and visible members of the church, and he says Tagle offers the possibility of continuing Francis\u2019 embrace of gay Catholics into the next papacy.",
      "\u201cBeing gay is not wrong because we were also created by God and all things that God created are beautiful,\u201d Concepcion added.",
      "The Philippine Catholic Church has become more open to gay Catholics in recent years, including in a 2024 position paper in which the church acknowledged the LGBTQ community\u2019s \u201cimportant role in the life of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines.\u201d",
      "And while Tagle, who is known for avoiding provocative rhetoric and controversial issues, has rarely spoken publicly about homosexuality in his statements and homilies, he has lamented the church\u2019s \u201charsh words\u201d in the past about gay and divorced people. Filipino Catholics say they have felt supported by some of his actions and see them as potential signs of his approach to the community if he were to be elected pope.",
      "Edwin Valles, former president of Courage Philippines, an LGBTQ organization under the Archdiocese of Manila, says he is certain that Tagle would continue embracing the gay community.",
      "In 2014, Valles said he approached Tagle, then head of the Archdiocese of Manila, to request a priest to be assigned to guide their members, a request Tagle granted.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a commitment on his part,\u201d Valles said. \u201cHe puts money where his mouth is. So I like to think that he will also do the same if and when he becomes pope.\u201d",
      "Valles tells a story from a 2018 event they both attended, when a young faithful asked the cardinal about the status of LGBTQ Catholics.",
      "\u201cAnd his answer was something like: All of us are Catholics, all of us are parishioners, all of us are children of God. So why make that label and distinction? That just serves to separate or put people in boxes,\u201d Valles recalled Tagle saying.",
      "A man of the people",
      "The Jesuit-educated Tagle, 67, was born to a Filipino father and a Filipino Chinese mother who were both bankers, and Tagle grew up in a well-to-do family. He was ordained as a priest in 1982 at the age of 24, and like Francis, adopted a simple life.",
      "From 2001 to 2011, he served as the bishop of the Diocese of Imus, a city south of Manila, and his hometown. There, Tagle took to walking the streets, greeting street vendors and motorcycle taxi drivers. Residents affectionately recalled how Tagle would sit on a wooden bench outside a humble neighborhood barbershop, Bible in hand, his presence so regular that it earned Roland, the shopkeeper, the nickname, \u201cHoly Barber.\u201d",
      "Tagle then became Manila\u2019s archbishop in 2011 and was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012. In 2015, he was elected president of Caritas Internationalis, the humanitarian and development organization of the Catholic Church, and was re-elected again in 2019. That year, he moved to the Vatican after Francis appointed him head of the Dicastery for Evangelization, the church\u2019s missionary arm.",
      "He would fly back to the Philippines, unannounced and without fanfare, to check on his ailing parents, have his hair cut by Roland, and make surprise visits to neighbors and relatives eager to receive a blessing from a cardinal back home from the Vatican.",
      "He \u2018does not possess a prophetic voice\u2019",
      "Tagle is highly respected in the Philippines, where he is widely perceived as \u201cwarm, gentle, approachable, humble and at times funny,\u201d just like Francis, Noel Asiones, an academic researcher from the University of Santo Tomas, a Catholic university in Manila, told NBC News.",
      "As a top cleric, Tagle\u2019s pastoral approach \u201creflects a leader eager to serve and emphasize meeting the needs of his flock,\u201d Asiones said.",
      "But the similarities seemed to end there. Unlike Francis, who spoke with forceful, moral authority on worldly issues like exploitative capitalism or the injustices of war, Asiones said, Tagle \u201clacks or does not possess a prophetic voice.\u201d",
      "Tagle has been criticized for his inaction on sexual abuse by priests, and his silence on the extrajudicial killings ordered by the Philippines\u2019 former President Rodrigo Duterte, in a crackdown on drugs that left tens of thousands, including children, dead. Duterte openly attacked and threatened the church, which in the Philippines has historically stood up against political power.",
      "In the face of the flagrant human rights abuses, however, Tagle responded with statements Duterte\u2019s opponents criticized as vague and unchallenging.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Tagle will be entirely Francis 2.0. For one, he opts for political correctness, often avoiding confrontational language, and seems reticent, if not afraid, to hold truth to power,\u201d Asiones said.",
      "A good theologian, but a poor administrator",
      "Tagle has had significant experience in the Vatican, but observers say it has been far from stellar.",
      "In 2022, Francis dismissed Tagle and the rest of the leadership team of Caritas Internationalis after a Vatican-led audit found \u201creal deficiencies\u201d in management and procedures.",
      "What the Roman Curia needs is a pope who is also a good administrator, said Charles Collins, managing editor of Crux, an international publication focusing on the Catholic Church.",
      "\u201cTagle is considered intelligent, a good theologian and a good communicator. But in many ways he has not been a very good administrator in some of the jobs he\u2019s had in the Vatican,\u201d Collins said. \u201cHe has not proven himself in that role.\u201d",
      "Francis had shaken things up in the Vatican and the cardinals may look to someone who could provide stability to replace him.",
      "\u201cI think the conclave is going to look at a European cardinal to become pope,\u201d Collins said.",
      "Three issues are expected to hound the next pope: clerical abuse, poor finances of the Vatican and the ongoing cultural war between progressives and conservatives.",
      "Tagle might be one of the more popular papabili, but Collins cautioned that in every conclave, \u201cthere are always people who are being promoted more in the media than among the cardinals.\u201d",
      "\u201cA pope from Asia or Africa is a good news story, but that does not reflect the views of the cardinal electors.\u201d",
      "Camille Elemia reported from Manila and Imus, Philippines."

      "In an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that aired over the weekend, Trump said he believed the U.S. was \"closer\" in making progress with one party, \"and maybe not as close with the other.\" He declined to say which side was the one making progress. At the same time, however, the president admitted that \"maybe it's not possible to do\" a deal.",

      "When the fighting in Sudan broke out, the focus of the battles initially was the country\u2019s capital, Khartoum, which turned into a war zone. Withing weeks, Port Sudan, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) to the east of Khartoum, turned into a safe haven for the displaced and those fleeing the war. Many aid missions and U.N. agencies moved their offices there.",
      "The attacks on Port Sudan are also seen as retaliation after the Sudanese military earlier this month struck the Nyala airport in South Darfur, which the paramilitary RSF has turned into a base and where it gets shipments of arms, including drones.",
      "The RSF is allied with the United Arab Emirates, which U.N. experts say has provided weapons, including drones to the paramilitary. The UAE denies the claim. Sudan\u2019s miliary is backed by Egypt.",
      "Sudan plunged into chaos in April 2023, when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open warfare in Khartoum. From there, the fighting spread to other parts of the country.",
      "Since then, at least 24,000 people have been killed, though the number is likely far higher. The war has driven about 13 million people from their homes, including four million crossed into neighboring countries. It also pushed parts of the country into famine.",
      "The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western Darfur region, according to the United Natios. and international rights groups."

Nobody was onboard when the ship listed and then sank, the Philippine military said.",
      "American and Philippine forces proceeded with other live-fire maneuvers off Zambales on Monday despite the premature sinking of the Malvar. The ship was built as a patrol vessel for the U.S. Navy in the 1940s and was transferred to Vietnam\u2019s navy before the Philippine military acquired it, Philippine navy Capt. John Percie Alcos said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an 80-year-old dilapidated ship and it wasn\u2019t able to withstand the rough seas,\u201d Philippine Lt. Col. John Paul Salgado told The Associated Press.",

      "\u201cWhat we have seen since Trump returned to the White House is a remarkable level of continuity in the U.S.-Philippines alliance not only in joint military drills, but also on American statements that the alliance is \u2018ironclad,\u2019\u201d said Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at RAND Corporation.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is trying to keep the pressure on China through its support to the Philippines,\u201d Grossman said.
