      "A federal judge says Russian soprano Anna Netrebko can move forward with her case claiming national original discrimination by the Metropolitan Opera",
      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge says Russian soprano Anna Netrebko can move forward with her case claiming national original discrimination by the Metropolitan Opera, which dropped her after she refused to repudiate President Vladimir Putin over Russia's campaign against Ukraine.",
      "The decision by U.S. District Judge Analisa Nadine Torres in Manhattan was made public Wednesday, a day after it was issued. The case, which will proceed alongside her claim of gender discrimination, has yet to be scheduled for trial.",
      "The Met did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Met General Manager Peter Gelb had demanded that she repudiate Putin shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, but she refused and was withdrawn from three Met productions. The Met replaced her with Ukrainian soprano Liudmyla Monastyrska in at least one of those productions.",

      "Last August, Torres dismissed the performer's national original discrimination claim, when she also threw out allegations of defamation and breach of contract. But in her latest decision, the judge wrote that the \u201callegations support the inference that Netrebko\u2019s replacement by non-Russian artists occurred under circumstances giving rise to at least a \u2018minimal\u2019 inference of discrimination.\u201d",
      "The American Guild of Musical Artists filed a grievance on Netrebko\u2019s behalf and arbitrator Howard C. Edelman ruled in February 2023 that the Met violated the union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement when it canceled deals with Netrebko for three productions. Edelman awarded compensation the union calculated at $209,103.48.",
      "Torres allowed Netrebko to proceed with her separate allegation of gender discrimination under the New York State Human Rights Law and New York City Human Rights Law. She said the Met treated Netrebko's male counterparts with connections to Putin and the Russian government more favorably. She cited bass-baritone Evgeny Nikitin and baritones Igor Golovatenko and Alexey Markov, who have continued to sing at the Met.",

      "Blues legend Buddy Guy will release a new album on Wednesday, his 89th birthday",
      "NEW YORK -- For Buddy Guy \u2014 a stalwart and staunch defender of the blues \u2014 there's nothing more important than keeping his chosen genre at the forefront of conversation. It comes naturally: Guy is one of America's greatest guitar players, a singular artist with a thick roster of A-list super fans \u2014 Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Gary Clark Jr. among them.",
      "The list also includes innovative writer and director Ryan Coogler, who tapped Guy for his critically acclaimed film \u201cSinners\u201d earlier this year, and artists like Peter Frampton and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, who feature on his new album \u201cAin't Done with the Blues.\u201d It releases Wednesday, on Guy's 89th birthday.",
      "For the eight-time Grammy Award-winning musician, those recognitions aren't priority. The longevity of the music that made his life is his primary concern. \u201cLike I promised B.B. King, Muddy Waters and all of them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press over the phone, \u201cI do the best I can to keep the blues alive.\u201d",
      "He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons \u201cAin't Done with the Blues\u201d is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten \u2014 like on the album closer \u201cTalk to Your Daughter,\u201d a rendition of the J.B. Lenoir tune.",
      "In Guy's performance, there's an undeniable universality. \u201cBlues is based on everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cA good time or a bad time.\u201d",
      "Or, another way Guy explains it: \u201cMusic is like a bowl of real good gumbo. They got all kinds of meat in there. You got chicken in there, you got sausage in there. You got a seafood in it. ... When we play music, we put everything in there.\u201d",
      "It's resonating. In its 2025 midyear report, Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, found that U.S. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of \u201cSinners.\u201d",

We left them in the last movie walking out of prison early after good behavior and trying to turn their back on bad-hood.",
      "It's not that easy since would-be employers these days want to know about gaps in their job experience \u2014 they were robbing banks, after all \u2014 workplace trust issues and salary expectations. No one wants to hire a bunch of ex-cons.",

It was all nicely set against a zombie guinea pig uprising.",
      "This time the writers have just given up on what side of the ethical divide their anti-heroes are on. \u201cAre we bad again?\u201d ask the confused piranha. Replies Mr. Wolf: \u201cI get it.

      "Rene\u00e9 Rapp's second album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d gave the 25-year-old multi-hyphenate an outlet to work through the whirlwind that has been her career so far",
      "NEW YORK -- Rene\u00e9 Rapp was clear on her intentions for her sophomore album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d from the start.",
      "\u201cI wanted to love this,\u201d Rapp says. \u201cI wanted to be able to walk away from this and be so proud of myself and impressed, no matter what anybody else thought.\u201d Her first album, 2023's \u201cSnow Angel, \u201d  had been an experiment in figuring out her sound (a mix of pop, R&B and heart-wrenching ballads), and assembling a collection of songs that worked together. This album, out Friday, offered the chance to do it again, with an eye toward the way her life had changed in the intervening years.",
      "\u201cThat intention, and also wanting to prove it to myself, was really grueling,\u201d Rapp told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd also really fun.\u201d",
      "The writing process gave Rapp, 25, an outlet to work through the burnout-inducing whirlwind that was her career in those two years. Uncharacteristically restrained in its vocal styling, the album's lead single, \u201cLeave Me Alone,\u201d is strikingly open \u2014 clever zingers allude to her departure from HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d the media frenzy that surrounded her turn as Regina in the 2024 remake of \u201cMean Girls,\u201d and the external pressure she felt to put out more music after the positive reception of \u201cSnow Angel.\u201d Basically, anything that's been said about her in the last few years? She reframes it, poking fun at her reputation and the industry.",
      "\u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d felt like a proper introduction to the album, Rapp says, and \u201cBite Me\u201d \u2014 both a warning and a tease \u2014 the appropriate title. Paris Hilton and Monica Lewinsky were among the famous faces that teased the album upon its announcement, donning merch emblazoned with the title in bold print. Rapp herself posed in front of a newsstand filled with mock tabloids depicting her as a diva, concealed behind big sunglasses and a fur coat, to promote the second single, \u201cMad.\u201d (\u201cThat's a Rapp!\u201d the headline read.)",
      "\u201cIt really feels just like a time capsule of those two years of my life, a lot having to do with the business and the industry and people\u2019s expectations of me,\u201d Rapp says of the album. \u201cAnd then also me wanting things for myself and being confused where those two roads diverge.\u201d",
      "Rapp's confidence and humor is evident across the album, just as it is on stage \u2014 \u201cI write lyrics in the way that I talk,\u201d she says. Many of the tracks tackle the destabilizing emotions that accompany the beginning and end of relationships, whether platonic or romantic, and how her now-very public career has amplified the challenges of creating, and maintaining, those connections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so surrounded all the time, but I feel so lonely, and it feels really heavy and isolating. And I think a lot of that is just being an artist. And I also think a lot of that is just like the nature of like the business, for better or for worse,\" she says. The can't-be-bothered attitude heard on \u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d is countered by the ache of \u201cThat's So Funny,\u201d which recounts the end of a deeply affecting, but ultimately toxic friendship in Rapp's signature soaring vocals.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The man charged with ordering the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur in Las Vegas is asking the Nevada Supreme Court to dismiss his murder charges.",
      "Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis filed an appeal with the court Tuesday after a lower court judge upheld his charges.",
      "Davis, the only man ever to be charged in Shakur's killing, was arrested in September 2023. Other conspirators in the drive-by shooting have since died.",
      "The 62-year-old has admitted in interviews and in his 2019 tell-all memoir, \u201cCompton Street Legend,\u201d that he provided the gun used in the shooting.",
      "His attorney, Carl Arnold, said Davis\u2019 constitutional rights were being violated.",
      "\u201cMr. Davis cooperated with law enforcement over the course of more than a decade, relying on repeated assurances that his statements would not be used against him \u2014 yet those very statements now form the core of the State\u2019s case,\u201d Arnold said in a statement.",
      "Arnold first filed a motion to dismiss the case in January of this year, alleging constitutional violations because of a 27-year delay in prosecution. He also said Davis had immunity agreements granted to him by federal and local authorities.",

      "According to the appeal, Davis was interviewed in 1998 and 1999 by federal prosecutors under the agreement that his statements would not be used to prosecute him. At the time, he denied knowing who was involved in Shakur's killing.",
      "He was interviewed again in 2008 and 2009 under the same conditions that he would not be prosecuted with his statements, according to the appeal. It was then that he described his \u201calleged involvement in the murder and identified the alleged shooter,\" the appeal said.",
      "Arnold said prosecutors had not presented any evidence connecting Davis to the slaying other than his own statements, which is not enough for a trial. He asked the Nevada Supreme Court to grant their motion to dismiss the case, or recognize that he was granted immunity from prosecution for the statements he made during law enforcement interviews.",
      "Davis remains in custody at the Clark County Detention Center. His trial is scheduled to begin in early February 2026.",

      "The Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival is back for its 23rd year, celebrating Black filmmakers, actors and tastemakers",
      "LOS ANGELES -- No matter the time on Martha's Vineyard, a shimmering glow will be powered by the star presence of Black filmmakers, actors and tastemakers like Issa Rae, Mara Brock Akil and Michelle Obama who are shaping culture on their own terms.",
      "For two-plus decades, the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival has been a cultural reunion, a summer sanctuary and a safe haven where some of the industry's most influential voices converge in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts. This week marks the return of the 23rd annual nine-day celebration, which kicks off Friday with a stacked slate that includes appearances from singer-actor Jennifer Hudson and Hall of Fame basketball player Dwyane Wade, screenings like Spike Lee 's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d and intimate conversations with figures such as the Rev. Al Sharpton.",
      "Over the years, the festival has drawn the who\u2019s who of Black Hollywood \u2014 including Ava DuVernay, Kerry Washington, Tyler Perry and Regina King. The Obamas made a surprise appearance in 2022.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a moment when so many of us converge and gather in a location that has historically received us incredibly well,\u201d said Tracee Ellis Ross, who will screen her new Roku Channel series \u201cSolo Traveling with Tracee Ellis Ross.\u201d The three-episode show follows Ross as she embarks on solo journeys to unplug, indulge and reconnect through Morocco, Mexico and Spain.",
      "Ross said traveling solo is a way of life. She said sharing her project at MVAAFF felt right, noting that the Vineyard-set episode of Akil's \u201cForever\u201d captures the spirit and beauty of the picturesque island.",
      "\u201cIt felt like the perfect location to kind of share,\u201d she said. \u201cThe timing was perfect from when the show came out.\u201d",
      "Set on the campus of the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Performing Arts Center and the Vineyard Lounge, the festival has grown from a grassroots gathering into a premier destination where Black creatives can find inspiration, connection and support.",
      "Akil paid homage to festival founders Stephanie and Floyd Rance, crediting them for building a creative pipeline where stories rooted in Black culture live and are seen.",
      "\u201cThey know the value. They know the need,\u201d said Akil, who will screen \u201cThe Vineyard\u201d episode from the Netflix series \u201cForever\u201d at the festival. \u201cRegardless of what the institution or systems of Hollywood sees as valuable, we claim the value of our stories. We have a chance to celebrate them, complete them, tell them, view them and share them with an audience. It allows for the completion of the story, so that we can move on to many, many, many more stories that need to be told.\u201d",
      "Floyd Rance described MVAAFF as a vital part of the entertainment ecosystem, offering a platform where Black voices and stories are given the spotlight they deserve.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have somewhat of a convergence for folks of like mind in the arts and entertainment to gather, coalesce, share ideas, rekindle friendships and fellowship,\u201d said Floyd, who along with Stephanie said they did not expect their festival to become such a main attraction.",
      "\u201cDespite the political climate and what\u2019s going on in entertainment, it\u2019s always a good time for birds of a feather to flock together.\u201d",
      "In addition to the panels and screenings, Stephanie Rance said this year's festival centers on the theme of joy, focusing more on celebration than struggle. She\u2019s especially excited for attendees to experience a range of conversations, from little-known moments in Black history to a panel on Ralph Lauren\u2019s Oak Bluffs collection with Morehouse and Spelman.",

We talk to each other and herald the filmmakers that came before us and the ones currently working. We get this grand opportunity to come together in that form.\u201d",

      "U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.",
      "It has. The question now is whether some of the public reactions the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.",
      "Titled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",
      "Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.",
      "Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.",
      "\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d",
      "Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.",
      "\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.",
      "American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.",
      "A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.",
      "Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.",
      "Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,\u201d Adamson said.",
      "Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that \u201cSydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,\u201d and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched.",
      "The campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature.",
      "American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service.",
      "In a news release, the company noted \u201cSweeney\u2019s girl next door charm and main character energy \u2013 paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously \u2013 is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.\u201d",
      "In one video, Sweeney walks toward an American Eagle billboard of her and the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes.\u201d She crosses out \u201cgenes\u201d and replaces it with \u201cjeans.\u201d",

      "The video appeared on American Eagle\u2019s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the campaign.",
      "While remarking that someone has good genes is sometimes used as a compliment, the phrase also has sinister connotations. Eugenics gained popularity in early 20th century America, and Nazi Germany embraced it to carry out Adolf Hitler\u2019s plan for an Aryan master race.",
      "Civil rights activists have noted signs of eugenics regaining a foothold through the far right's promotion of the \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d a racist ideology that alleges a conspiracy to diminish the influence of white people.",

      "\u201cAmerican Eagle, I guess, wants to rebrand itself for a particular kind of white privileged American,\u201d Shankar said. \u201cAnd that is the kind of aspirational image they want to circulate for people who want to wear their denim.\u201d",
      "Many critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters.",
      "Viewers mocked the spot for appearing to trivialize protests of police killings of Black people. Pepsi apologized and pulled the ad.",
      "The demonstrations that followed the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis pushed many U.S. companies to make their advertising better reflect consumers of all races.",

      "The retailer has an ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion program that is primarily geared toward employees. Two days before announcing the Sweeney campaign, American Eagle named the latest recipients of its scholarship award for employees who are driving anti-racism, equality and social justice initiatives.",
      "Marketing experts offer mixed opinions on whether the attention surrounding \u201cgood jeans\u201d will be good for business.",

      "Other experts say the buzz is good even if it's not uniformly positive.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Fans of the Grateful Dead are pouring into San Francisco for three days of concerts and festivities marking the 60th anniversary of the scruffy jam band that came to embody a city where people wore flowers in their hair and made love, not war.",
      "Dead & Company, featuring original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, will play Golden Gate Park's Polo Field starting Friday with an estimated 60,000 attendees each day. The last time the band played that part of the park was in 1991 \u2014 a free show following the death of concert promoter and longtime Deadhead Bill Graham.",
      "Certainly, times have changed.",
      "A general admissions ticket for all three days is $635 \u2014 a shock for many longtime fans who remember when a joint cost more than a Dead concert ticket.",

      "\u201cThis is the spiritual home of the Grateful Dead,\u201d said Aberdeen, who works at Amoeba Music in the bohemian, flower-powered Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. \u201cIt seems very right to me that they celebrate it in this way.\u201d",
      "Formed in 1965, the Grateful Dead is synonymous with San Francisco and its counterculture. Members lived in a dirt-cheap Victorian in the Haight and later became a significant part of 1967\u2019s Summer of Love.",
      "That summer eventually soured into bad acid trips and police raids, and prompted the band's move to Marin County on the other end of the Golden Gate Bridge. But new Deadheads kept cropping up \u2014 even after iconic guitarist and singer Jerry Garcia \u2019s 1995 death \u2014 aided by cover bands and offshoots like Dead & Company.",

    "story": [
      "Netflix's animated musical film \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d has become the surprise hit of the summer",
      "NEW YORK -- In the colorful, animated, musical world of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d everyone is a fan. The general public rocks T-shirts supporting their favorite idols. They hold light sticks and stare starry-eyed at stadium stages; they scream, they cry, they cheer, they buy the merch.",
      "It shouldn't come as much of a surprise, then, that the Sony Pictures/ Netflix film itself has inspired similar fanfare, having topped the streamer\u2019s global rankings. Fans have flooded the internet with art, covers, cosplay and choreography in response to the movie, which follows the fictional K-pop girl group HUNTR/X as they fight demons.",
      "And it's not just the film that's a summer hit. The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack has topped the charts \u2014 debuting at No. 1 on Billboard's Soundtracks chart and No. 8 on the all-genre Billboard 200.",
      "Here's how \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d became the year's surprising success story.",
      "The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack utilizes some of the best and brightest in the genre. That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 \u2014 empowered girl groups used as references for the film\u2019s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X.",
      "It's one of the many reasons the musical film's soundtrack stands on its own. Filmmakers \u201creally did their homework,\u201d says Jeff Benjamin, a music journalist who specializes in K-pop.",
      "Indeed, they did a lot of research. One of the film\u2019s directors, Maggie Kang, said that her team prioritized \u201crepresenting the fandom and the idols in a very specific way,\u201d as to not disappoint K-pop fans.",
      "They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys\u2019 hit song \u201cSoda Pop,\u201d for example, references the \u201990s K-pop group H.O.T.",
      "And it has worked. \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is the highest charting soundtrack of 2025, with eight of its songs landing on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200. To put that in perspective: Lorde's \u201cVirgin\u201d and Justin Bieber's \u201cSwag\u201d did the same.",
      "In some ways, it recalls Disney's \u201cEncanto,\u201d which topped the Billboard 200 and produced a No. 1 hit, \u201cWe Don't Talk About Bruno \u201d in 2022. Similarly, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d embraces \u201cthe original soundtrack, which is a lost art form,\u201d adds Benjamin.",
      "Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says the movie succeeds because it embraces animated musical tradition and authentic K-pop music production styles in equal measure. She considers \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d to be \u201ca musical with songs inspired by K-pop,\u201d not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for \u201cMamma Mia.\u201d",
      "The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. Where many animated films rely on adapting existing intellectual property, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is original. And it comes from an original perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely Korean, it\u2019s not completely Western and it\u2019s kind of right in that middle,\u201d says Kang. \u201cIt\u2019s like not pulled from one side; it\u2019s kind of flavors of both. So, I think that\u2019s what makes the movie feels a little different.\u201d",
      "And \u201cthe core story is what\u2019s drawing everybody in,\u201d says Kang.",
      "San Francisco-based cosplayer and content creator Nanci Alc\u00e1ntar, who goes by Naanny Lee online agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a K-pop group, but it also tells a story of their journey, of how they transform into powerful warriors,\u201d said Alc\u00e1ntar in Spanish. For her, it goes beyond K-pop \u2014 it\u2019s about the narrative.",
      "Kang\u2019s approach to cultural authenticity, too, may have contributed to the film\u2019s crossover appeal. Rather than explaining Korean elements like HUNTR/X\u2019s visit to a traditional medicine clinic or translating K-pop light stick culture for Western audiences, she opted for full immersion. \u201cWe just wanted everybody to just accept that they were in Korea,\u201d Kang said.",
      "The director said this method of \u201cthrowing people into the deep end of a culture\u201d breaks down barriers better than heavy-handed explanation. \u201cWe just wanted to keep everything feeling normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.\u201d",

      "Indeed \u2014 if the film wasn't authentic to K-pop fans' experience, or mocked them, it is unlikely to have become so popular, says Benjamin. Instead, there are Easter eggs for the dedicated K-pop listener.",

      "Andre wrapped his tree-trunk arms around the champ and tried to wring the final breaths out of Hogan with a bear hug so tight that more than 90,000 fans in Detroit almost witnessed the final day of Hulkamania.",
      "But, wait!",
      "This was Hulk Hogan.",
      "Wrestling\u2019s biggest star had more late comebacks than fellow 1980s sports stars John Elway or Michael Jordan combined. Hogan had some gas left in the tank, some extra bite in those 24-inch pythons, and hammered away at Andre. One right hand, then another one, and another! Wrestling fans roared as they knew the bad news that was coming for Andre. Hogan fought back \u2014 much as he did against those 1980s baddies out of the Cold War or Iran \u2014 and finally body-slammed Andre the Giant. Hogan hit the hopes and delivered his famous leg drop on Andre\u2019s chest to get the three count.",
      "Hulk Hogan won again at WrestleMania.",
      "He always won, of course. It\u2019s what the story called for and there was no reason for WWF owner and pro wrestler puppeteer Vince McMahon to ever deviate from the plan of Hulkamania running wild.",
      "Why would he?",
      "Hogan had the hulking size, the charisma and catchphrases \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019cha gonna do when Hulkamania runs wild on you?\u201d \u2014 that led the industry out of gyms and regional arenas and into NFL stadiums, like that 1987 night when Hogan beat Andre at the Pontiac Silverdome in WrestleMania III.",
      "\u201cThere he is,\u201d announcer Gorilla Monsoon said, as Hogan played to the crowd, \u201cthe greatest professional athlete in the world today.\u201d",
      "Whether you break out an eye roll or crank up Hogan\u2019s \u201c Real American \u201d anthem to that statement depends, of course, on one\u2019s ability to suspend disbelief. There is no denying, though, just how real Hogan\u2019s impact was on professional wrestling and pop culture in the 1980s. He stood toe-to-toe with Rocky Balboa. He fought side-by-side with Mr. T. He hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and flexed on the cover of Sports Illustrated.",
      "\u201cHe did what he set out to do,\u201d WWE Hall of Famer Sgt. Slaughter said Friday by phone. \u201cHe became the most recognized, not only professional wrestler and sports entertainer in the world, he\u2019s probably top-five of anybody you\u2019d recognize when you saw him.\u201d",
      "WWE has long claimed the paid attendance of WrestleMania III was 93,173, a number some historians claim is as artificially inflated as the chemically-enhanced biceps of that era. What can\u2019t be disputed, when the two had their match in 1988, live on national television, more than 33 million fans tuned in to NBC, still far and away the record for largest viewing audience in American televised wrestling.",
      "Making money and moving merch. That was the real power of Hulkamania.",
      "Hogan, who died Thursday in Florida at age 71, left behind more than three decades of memorable matches that captured the spirit of those little Hulkamaniacs to the ones that loved to hate him in the 1990s as \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan in the New World Order.",
      "Here are some of his best moments.",
      "Hogan wasn\u2019t some upstart when he returned to the WWF (now WWE) in late 1983. He tested the waters of Hulkamania in the old American Wrestling Association and made his famous appearance as Thunderlips in \u201cRocky III,\u201d when was beckoned back to WWE and became an instant contender to face the champion, the hated Iron Sheik. Hogan broke out of the dreaded camel clutch and pinned the Sheik to become the new champion on Jan. 23, 1984, at Madison Square Garden \u2014 the building paid tribute to Hogan on Thursday night \u2014 and set the course for Hulkamania.",

      "Back before the internet spilled behind-the-scenes secrets, and there was easy access to watch wrestling around the globe, WWE created its own version of wrestling history. If the company said Andre the Giant had never been slammed, and had never been pinned over a 15-year undefeated streak, then it was believed to be true (neither were, of course).",
      "Yet, the faux hype set the stage for the match that changed wrestling forever.",
      "\u201cAndre the Giant was a momentum-shifting moment where he passed his torch,\u201d Hogan said in a 2009 interview with the AP. \u201cHe was like the icing on the cake. Once he blessed me, it was up to me to mold that business and carry it through.\u201d",
      "By 1996, Hogan\u2019s good-guy, beats-the-odds character had grown stale as he made the shift from WWE to Ted Turner\u2019s World Championship Wrestling. Hogan even started to get booed as wrestling fans clamored for a new direction, a new star on top.",
      "They got one. \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan.",
      "For weeks, two former WWE stars had \u201cinvaded\u201d WCW and claimed they were taking over the company. That led to a six-man tag-team match where the two outsiders, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, promised a third man to help with their cause. No one showed to help the two until the end, when Hogan walked out in his red-and-yellow attire, and stunned the crowd when he put the leg drop on Randy Savage. Hogan was third man. He ditched his traditional colors for black-and-white, sunglasses, dark facial hair and embraced the \u201cHollywood\u201d heel persona.",
      "Much as he did a decade earlier, Hogan led WCW to new heights and the company would defeat WWE in the TV ratings for 83 straight weeks in what would be known as the \u201cMonday Night Wars.\u201d Hogan lost as much as he won without his Hulkamania powers. He still moved the needle where it mattered most and made WCW must-see TV every Monday night.",
      "With WCW out of business and bought by McMahon, Hogan kept a low profile until he made a comeback with WWE in 2002. He returned with Hall and Nash as the NWO but at this point, WWE fans wanted their old Hulkster back.",
      "Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson was WWE\u2019s baby-faced crowd favorite when he met the villainous Hogan at WrestleMania in an \u201cIcon vs. Icon\u201d match in WrestleMania in 2002. One problem, the Toronto crowd decided to back Hogan.",
      "\u201cWhen we hit the ring, 70,000 loyal people didn\u2019t want to hate Hulk Hogan,\u201d Hogan said in 2009. \u201cEverybody kind of started to panic and I just said, \u2019Brother, stick with me and I\u2019ll get you through this.\u201d\u2019",
      "After the match, the cheers for Hogan called for a last-second change of plans, with his former NWO allies running down to attack him. The Rock helped Hogan fight off the NWO and the two men posed together to riotous cheers.",
      "\u201cAs I raised his hand and said he\u2019s the greatest wrestler in the world, they had to turn me back red and yellow immediately,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting, that was going to be the nail in my coffin. It turned out to be the fountain of youth for me.\u201d",

      "Cleo Laine, whose husky contralto was one of the most distinctive voices in jazz and who was regarded by many as Britain\u2019s greatest contribution to the quintessentially American music, has died",
      "LONDON -- Cleo Laine, whose husky contralto was one of the most distinctive voices in jazz and who was regarded by many as Britain's greatest contribution to the quintessentially American music, has died. She was 97.",
      "The Stables, a charity and venue Laine founded with her late jazz musician husband John Dankworth, said Friday it was \u201cgreatly saddened\u201d by the news that \u201cone of its founders and Life President, Dame Cleo Laine has passed away.\"",
      "Monica Ferguson, artistic director of The Stables, said Laine \"will be greatly missed, but her unique talent will always be remembered.\u201d",
      "Laine's career spanned the Atlantic and crossed genres: She sang the songs of Kurt Weill, Arnold Schoenberg and Robert Schumann; she acted on stage and on film, and even played God in a production of Benjamin Britten's \"Noye's Fludde.\"",
      "Laine's life and art were intimately bound up with band leader Dankworth, who gave her a job and her stage name in 1951, and married her seven years later. Both were still performing after their 80th birthdays. Dankworth died in 2010 at 82.",
      "In 1997, Laine became the first British jazz artist to be made a dame, the female equivalent of a knight.",
      "\"It is British jazz that should have received the accolade for its service to me,\" she said when the honor was announced. \"It has given me a wonderful life, a successful career and an opportunity to travel the globe doing what I love to do.\"",
      "Laine was born Clementina Dinah Campbell in 1927. Her father, Alexander Campbell, was a Jamaican who loved opera and earned money during the Depression as a street singer. Despite hard times, her British mother, Minnie, made sure that her daughter had piano, voice and dance lessons.",
      "She began performing at local events at age 3, and at age 12 she got a role as a movie extra in \"The Thief of Bagdad.\" Leaving school at 14, Laine went to work as a hairdresser and faced repeated rejection in her efforts to get a job as a singer.",
      "A decade later, in 1951, she tried out for the Johnny Dankworth Seven, and succeeded. \"Clementina Campbell\" was judged too long for a marquee, so she became Cleo Laine.",
      "\"John said that when he heard me, I didn't sound like anyone else who was singing at the time,\" Laine once said. \"I guess the reason I didn't get the other jobs is that they were looking for a singer who did sound like somebody else.\"",
      "Laine had a remarkable range, from tenor to contralto, and a sound often described as \"smoky.\"",
      "Dankworth, in an interview with the Irish Independent, recalled Laine's audition.",
      "\"They were all sitting there with stony faces, so I asked the Scottish trumpet player Jimmy Deuchar, who was looking very glum and was the hardest nut of all, whether he thought she had something. 'Something?' he said, 'She's got everything!'\"",
      "Offered 6 pounds a week, Laine demanded \u2014 and got \u2014 7 pounds.",
      "\"They used to call me 'Scruff', although I don't think I was scruffy. It was just that having come from the sticks, I didn't know how to put things together as well as the other singers of the day,\" she told the Irish Independent. \"And anyway, I didn't have the money, because they weren't paying me enough.\"",
      "Recognition came swiftly. Laine was runner-up in Melody Maker's \"girl singer\" category in 1952, and topped the list in 1956 and 1957.",
      "She married Dankworth \u2014 and quit his band \u2014 in 1958, a year after her divorce from her first husband, George Langridge. As Dankworth's band prospered, Laine began to feel underused.",

      "A reviewer for Variety in 2002 found her voice going strong: \"a dark, creamy voice, remarkable range and control from bottomless contralto to a sweet clear soprano. Her perfect pitch and phrasing is always framed with musical imagination and good taste.\"",
      "Perhaps Laine's most difficult performance of all was on Feb. 6, 2010, at a concert celebrating the 40th anniversary of the concert venue she and Dankworth had founded at their home, during which Laine and both of her children performed.",

      "West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class",
      "When school starts in West Virginia next month, 240,000 students in districts large and small will notice something missing from their cafeteria trays.",
      "Gone will be red Jell-O fruit cups, yogurt topped with brightly hued sprinkles and Cool Ranch Doritos \u2014 all foods made with synthetic dyes.",
      "In their place will be foods that contain colors made only from natural sources \u2014 such as vegetables, spices and seeds \u2014 after West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a sweeping new law in March banning seven artificial dyes from school meals.",
      "Other states have enacted similar laws that would strip artificial dyes from school meals, but West Virginia\u2019s action is the first to take effect, starting Aug. 1. It triggered a four-month sprint that that left state and local nutrition directors reeling.",
      "\u201cI think the initial reaction was like, \u2018Wow, what are we going to do?\u2019\" said Tony Crago, director of child nutrition for the West Virginia Department of Education. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d",
      "Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3.",
      "\u201cWhen it went into law, it was shocking,\u201d said Diane Miller, who leads child nutrition and food services for Kanawha County Schools in the state\u2019s central region. \u201cWe began to realize that these dyes were in much more than just your cereals.\u201d",
      "West Virginia's ban on synthetic dyes was cheered by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has successfully pressured food makers to agree to remove artificial colors from their products. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028.",
      "The move is aimed at halting potential health effects from the dyes, which have been linked to neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. It's part of a larger focus on limiting artificial ingredients in food, Morrisey said in March.",
      "\u201cBy eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we\u2019re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges,\u201d he said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of the dyes, citing mixed evidence of potential harm. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the color additives are safe when \u201cused properly,\u201d in the amounts and products approved by the agency. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, \u201cbut some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.\u201d",
      "More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects.",
      "\u201cWhen you get rid of petroleum-based dyes, kids aren't gonna all suddenly be healthy,\u201d Makary said on a recent podcast. \u201cWe're not going to address the fact that 30% of our nation's kids have prediabetes by simply removing petroleum-based food dyes. But these are steps in the right direction.\u201d",
      "Nutrition experts agree that removing artificial colors from foods doesn\u2019t address the main drivers of America\u2019s chronic health problems. Those stem largely from ingredients such as added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",

      "Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. Overall, Best said she removed just five foods from her menus.",
      "General Mills said 98% of its products for schools were already made without the banned colors. The company \u201cwill be compliant\u201d with West Virginia's law immediately and plans to remove the dyes from school foods nationwide by next summer, said Mollie Wulff, a company spokesperson.",
      "In Miller\u2019s district, with 23,000 students in 67 schools, the new law affects about 10% of the foods served, she estimated. She expected some foods to contain artificial colors, like strawberry milk and Pop-Tarts. Others were surprising, such as pickles, salad dressing and certain snack chips.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, \u2018Oh my gosh, no more Doritos?'\" Miller said. The popular Cool Ranch flavor contains dyes Red 40, Blue 1 and Yellow 5.",
      "The challenge is finding substitutes that will still appeal to children, Miller said.",
      "\u201cBecause the last thing we need them to do is to choose not to participate in our school lunch program,\u201d she said, adding that schools provide many students their healthiest meals of the day.",
      "Parents of children with sensitivities or allergies to artificial dyes had already raised concerns, according to school food directors. But for others, the presence of synthetic colors in school meals hasn\u2019t been an issue. Chris DeRico, nutrition director of Barbour County Schools, with 2,000 students, said few parents seemed worried about dyes.",
      "\u201cThey'd be in the minority, I believe,\" he said. \u201cIn rural West Virginia, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really on radar screens.\u201d",
      "In Best's district, dyes were already out of the food dished up during the summer session in July. That didn't make much difference to Lilith Wilson, 9, who said her meal of a meatball sub sandwich, sweet potato fries and ice cream was \u201creally good.\u201d",
      "Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: \u201cSometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.\u201d",

      "A bipartisan program in Michigan aims to address the high costs of parenting by giving mothers thousands of dollars in cash with no strings attached",
      "FLINT, Mich. -- A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \u201cbaby parade.\u201d",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\u201d said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don\u2019t have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies\u2019 lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breast feeding supplies and baby clothes but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She\u2019s heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade Friday.",
      "\u201cFor so long moms have been vilified and not supported,\u201d Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",
      "\u201cSo this time around, I didn\u2019t have to stress about anything. I just had to worry about my baby,\u201d she said.",

      "That was clear, they said, during the new panel's first meeting, in June.

      "A group of more than 20 states are suing the Trump administration over efforts to cut Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- More than 20 mostly Democratic-led states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its efforts to cut Medicaid payments to the nation's largest abortion provider \u2014 Planned Parenthood.",
      "The move comes in response to the package of tax breaks and spending cuts Trump signed earlier this month. A portion of the new cuts are focused on services such as cancer screenings and tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted infections \u2014 by ending Medicaid reimbursements for a year for major providers of family planning services.",
      "The cuts apply to groups that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023. The goal was to target Planned Parenthood, but the legislation also affected a major medical provider in Maine.",
      "California, New York, Connecticut, other states and Washington, D.C. argue in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts that the provision's language is unclear about which groups it applies to. They also say it retaliates against Planned Parenthood for advocating for abortion access, violating the free speech clause of the First Amendment.",
      "The states are asking that the portion of the law be blocked and deemed unconstitutional.",
      "The cuts threaten health care access for many low-income Americans, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference.",
      "\u201cThis attack isn't just about abortion,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cIt's about denying vulnerable communities access to care they rely on every day.\u201d",
      "But the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, named a defendant in the suit, defended the provision.",
      "\u201cStates should not be forced to fund organizations that have chosen political advocacy over patient care,\u201d spokesperson Andrew G. Nixon said in an email. \u201cIt is a shame that these democrat attorney generals seek to undermine state flexibility and disregard longstanding concerns about accountability.\u201d",
      "Maine Family Planning, which operates 18 clinics offering a range of services across the state, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America filed separate lawsuits earlier this year challenging the cuts. Planned Parenthood said although it is not specifically named in the law, the provision was meant to affect its nearly 600 centers in 48 states. About a third of those clinics risk closure because of the legislation, which would strip care from more than 1 million patients, the group argues.",

      "The prevalence of undernourishment, a key measure of progress, surpassed 20% in Africa and rose to 12.7% in western Asia, it said.",
      "The report is the latest to suggest that eliminating food insecurity universally remains a serious challenge. Africa remains the most vulnerable continent.",
      "According to the current projection, 512 million people in the world may be chronically undernourished in 2030, with nearly 60% of them to be found in Africa, the report said.",

      "A former Ukrainian prisoner of war has embraced life with urgency since his release in April",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Since his release from a Russian prison in April, Stanislav Tarnavskyi has been in a hurry to build the life in Ukraine he dreamed about during three years of captivity.",
      "The 25-year-old has proposed to his girlfriend, bought an apartment and adopted a golden retriever. And that was just what he accomplished one week in July.",
      "But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. The U.N. says many endured beatings, starvation and humiliation at the hands of their captors \u2014 experiences that will leave lifelong scars.",
      "Tarnavskyi, who was captured during the battle for Mariupol in April of 2022, regularly has nightmares about the prisons where he was held.",
      "\u201cI see the officers who watched over us. I dream they want to harm me, catch me,\u201d he said. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges \u2014 until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk.",
      "As the three-year war drags on, Tarnavskyi is one of more than 5,000 former POWs back in Ukraine rehabilitating with the help of regular counseling. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations.",
      "In a photography studio high above Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, sunlight floods the white walls. After a shoot that lasted several hours Tarnavskyi said the brightness was hurting his eyes, which are still sensitive from years spent in a dark cell.",
      "But his mood couldn't be dimmed. The girlfriend who waited for his return had just consented to his surprise proposal.",
      "\u201cI love you very much, I am very glad that you waited for me,\" Tarnavskyi said, holding a thick bouquet of pink roses and a ring. \"You have always been my support, and I hope you will remain so for the rest of my life. Will you marry me?\u201d",
      "Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva \u2014 whom he met in 2021 \u2014 that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity.",
      "Still, he finds it hard to talk with Baieva about his time in prison. He doesn't want to be pitied.",
      "Soon after he returned home, he was paranoid, feeling watched \u2014 a reaction to constant surveillance in prison. \u201cIf you stepped out of line, they\u2019d (Russians) come and beat you. I still get flashbacks when I see (surveillance) cameras. If I see one, I get nervous,\u201d he said.",
      "But with each passing week, he is feeling better, progress Tarnavskyi credits to the work he is doing with a psychologist.",
      "Any small stimulus \u2014 a smell, a breeze, a color \u2014 can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv.",
      "Yet contrary to stereotypes, ex-POWs aren\u2019t more aggressive. \u201cThey tend to isolate themselves, avoid large gatherings, and struggle with trust,\u201d said Voznitsyna.",
      "\u201cThey say time heals \u2014 five or 10 years, maybe \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t,\" she added. \"It just feels less intense.\u201d",

      "The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV",
      "LONDON -- The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug aimed at preventing HIV, which scientists say could help end the virus' transmission.",
      "In a statement on Friday, the EU drug regulator said its evaluations of lenacapavir, sold as Yeytuo in Europe by Gilead Sciences, showed the drug is \u201chighly effective\u201d and \u201cconsidered to be of major public health interest.\u201d Once the regulator's guidance is accepted by the European Commission, the authorization is valid in all 27 EU member countries as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.",

      "Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the U.N. AIDS agency, has said the drug \u201ccould change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic\u201d if it is made available to everyone who needs it.",
      "In June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized lenacapavir to prevent HIV. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization recommended countries offer the drug as an additional option to people at risk of the virus.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly. Other medication aimed at preventing HIV include daily pills that people can take and another injectable drug called cabotegravir, which is given every two months. Lenacapavir\u2019s six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more visits to health clinics or stigma from taking daily pills.",
      "Critics have raised concerns, however, that lenacapavir may not be made widely enough available to stop global outbreaks of HIV. Drugmaker Gilead has said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates \u2014 mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.",

      "Michigan has become a leader in safe drinking water after the Flint crisis, but mobile home parks remain a rough spot",
      "After the Flint water crisis, Michigan became a national leader on safe drinking water, requiring the removal of lead pipes and the reduction of harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d years before the federal government acted.",
      "But the state has a blind spot when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who live in its mobile home parks.",
      "Regulators say they have little power to enforce the rules in the state's estimated 100 or more unlicensed parks when owners fail to provide safe water. The problem is compounded by private equity firms that have been buying up parks over the past two decades and now control about 1 in every 6 parks in Michigan \u2014 among the highest rates in the country, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a group that advocates against such purchases.",
      "Officials say it can be a struggle to even contact those park owners, let alone get them to comply with regulations.",
      "\u201cWith private equity moving into this space, the goal these companies seem to have is to return the absolute highest return they can to investors even if that means providing inadequate service or engaging in exploitative practices, or unsafe practices for the residents,\u201d said state Sen. John Cherry, a Democrat who sponsored legislation to strengthen enforcement in the communities.",
      "But the state doesn't attempt to track unlicensed parks. And an industry spokesperson said Michigan officials \u2014 particularly law enforcement \u2014 have the power to do more if they choose.",
      "At North Morris Estates where Theo Gantos lives outside Flint, conditions got so bad that the state refused to renew the park\u2019s license to operate.",
      "Water often flowed weakly from the tap because the wells that service the park didn\u2019t produce enough, Gantos said. Sometimes the water was discolored. It could stain laundry and destroy appliances. He installed a multistage filter system just to be able to use it.",
      "Eventually, local law enforcement investigated. In March, the owner pleaded guilty to a criminal charge for operating without a license, agreeing to pay a fine and sell the park.",
      "That might not have happened if Gantos had not been so pugnacious. He spent years battling Homes of America, an affiliate of private equity group Alden Global Capital that local prosecutors said owns North Morris. That included filing a public records request for emails on officials\u2019 handling of problems at his park, pushing regulators to enforce rules and speaking out to media over what he calls blight conditions.",
      "\u201cThese guys, they don\u2019t care,\u201d Gantos said about complying with the rules.",
      "Representatives of North Morris and Homes of America, including an attorney who appeared for the park in legal proceedings, did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, called LARA, has the authority to inspect and investigate complaints at licensed mobile home parks. But it\u2019s typically fallen to law enforcement to pursue criminal charges against unlicensed parks.",
      "The North Morris conviction for operating without a license is likely the first such under the state\u2019s mobile home law that has been on the books since 1987, the county prosecutor said.",

And what we\u2019ve seen so far with both the state and local units of government is they\u2019ve elected not to.\u201d",
      "Mobile home parks without a license are \u201cessentially operating unregulated,\u201d Cherry said. One of the state\u2019s few options is to shut down a park, a rarely used last resort that can mean throwing people out of their homes.",
      "Mobile home parks have long been an important affordable housing option. But that affordability is fading.",
      "A study by Lending Tree, a lending marketplace, found new mobile home sale prices rose more than 50% nationally from 2018 to 2023 \u2014 new single-family home price averages, by contrast, rose 38% over that period.",
      "Last year, LARA supported legislation that would have given the department more power to penalize unlicensed parks, force parks to provide owner contact information and limit rent increases. That failed.",
      "This year, Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin has proposed a narrower law that would give state drinking water officials more power to make sure water in all mobile home parks is drinkable. Right now, they only have direct authority over parks that provide their own water. But it\u2019s common for parks to take city water from a pipe connecting to the nearby town.",
      "That water is usually safe when it reaches the park, but if the park\u2019s water pipes crack or fail, water protections won\u2019t apply on the private property. That keeps officials from stepping in and forcing change except in limited situations when there\u2019s a public health threat. It can leave residents unsure where to turn when the owner refuses to fix problems.",
      "\u201cWe take those issues very seriously,\u201d said Eric Oswald, director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy\u2019s drinking water and environmental health division. He said they try to work with licensing officials to ensure water is safe, though \u201cthe problem is, I\u2019m not resourced for that.\u201d",
      "The Michigan Manufactured Housing Association opposed last year\u2019s legislation, arguing it would make mobile homes less affordable. The group says it supports extending water protections to within parks, as called for in this year\u2019s legislation. It passed the state Senate in late June and is now in the GOP-controlled House.",

      "Samuel Doria Medina is running for president of Bolivia",
      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- It's no surprise that Samuel Doria Medina is running for president of Bolivia: The 66-year-old multimillionaire ran as a center-right candidate in the elections of 2005, 2009 and 2014. He failed each time as Bolivia's leftist ruling party, founded by former President Evo Morales, maintained a tight grip over politics.",
      "What\u2019s unexpected is that next month, after almost two decades of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party in power, the candidate who promises to arrest Morales and cozy up to U.S. President Donald Trump stands a real chance of victory.",
      "Polls show Doria Medina, owner of hotel chains and Bolivia\u2019s Burger King restaurants, as a front-runner in the Aug. 17 election.",
      "\"Not only are we going to change the president, but the political cycle,\" Doria Medina, a former cement magnate, told The Associated Press Wednesday from his sleek office on the 20th floor of one of Bolivia\u2019s tallest towers that he helped build. \u201cPart of that change will be the emergence of new figures.\u201d",
      "Doria Medina, a successful businessman and entrepreneur, is tapping public outrage over Bolivia\u2019s worst economic crisis since 1991.",
      "He promises unity to voters frustrated by the fracturing of the MAS party between current President Luis Arce and his erstwhile ally, the larger-than-life Morales, who oversaw a so-called economic miracle of rising growth and falling poverty for much of his tenure from 2006-2019.",
      "But Morales' statist economic model, built on natural gas exports, has gone bust. Now the landlocked nation of 12 million is approaching a watershed moment as crippling dollar shortages, mass unrest and fuel scarcity threaten the once-unquestioned dominance of the MAS party founded in the 1990s.",
      "\u201cWe have a population that wants the economic conflict and lack of fuel to be solved,\u201d Doria Medina said.",
      "Much remains uncertain in the run-up to the highly anticipated vote, with Morales\u2019 large base of loyalists vowing to leave their ballots blank on account of the former president\u2019s contentious exclusion from the race \u2014 in part a result of his bitter political fight with Arce.",
      "Facing a humiliating defeat, Arce dropped out of the race.",
      "The only leftist candidate leading polls is Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez, the 36-year-old president of the senate and vice president of Morales\u2019 coca-farming union. Rodr\u00edguez would be considered the political heir of Morales' MAS if it weren't for Morales branding him a traitor for running against him.",
      "With other opposition candidates further to the right, analysts see the moderate Doria Medina as best-positioned to win over traditional MAS party supporters as he promises to put the brakes on the foreign exchange rate and resolve fuel shortages within his first 100 days.",
      "The value of a boliviano on the black market is now around half the official exchange rate.",
      "\u201cThis type of crisis has to be resolved very quickly,\" Doria Medina said, citing as a model the shock adjustment of radical libertarian President Javier Milei that drove down Argentina's double-digit inflation.",
      "To achieve such a swift transformation, Doria Medina told AP he would first scrap fuel subsidies, which have long been a politically sensitive pillar of the MAS party\u2019s economic policy. When Morales tried to eliminate the generous subsidies in 2010, mass nationwide riots forced him to backtrack.",
      "\u201cIt's the biggest absurdity that in Bolivia it's $0.30 per liter of gasoline and in all neighboring countries it's $1,\u201d Doria Medina said, dismissing possible fallout from the move. Bolivia hemorrhaged $3 billion subsidizing gasoline and fuel last year.",

      "Afghanistan is seeing the emergence of local female tour guides, in a country whose Taliban government imposes the world\u2019s harshest restrictions on women and girls",
      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- They wandered through the museum, listening attentively as their guide explained the antiquities in display cabinets. It could have been any tour group, anywhere in the world. But there was something unusual about this one.",
      "The group of foreigners visiting the National Museum of Afghanistan was made up only of women. Its guide was a woman, too \u2014 one of the first Afghan female tour guides in a country whose Taliban rulers impose the severest restrictions on girls and women anywhere in the world.",
      "Somaya Moniry, 24, hadn't known that tour guides existed, as a profession or even as a concept. But while browsing the internet for help on improving her English language skills, she stumbled upon Couchsurfing, an app where travelers connect with locals and stay in their homes.",
      "After hosting a traveler, \u201cI became very passionate about it and it was very interesting for me,\u201d Moniry said. \u201cIt was very unique. I have never heard about it before, so I said: \u2018Why not (do) this?\u2019\u201d",
      "As she showed that first visitor around her hometown in western Afghanistan, she saw a new side to her country.",
      "\u201cMost of the things that we have heard (about Afghanistan) was just \u2026 negativity. The focus of the people, focus of the media, focus of headlines, all of them were just the negativity. And definitely we get influenced by that,\u201d Moniry said.",
      "But for her, Afghanistan is far more nuanced. While there are undoubtedly problems in a place recovering from decades of war and chaos, there is also another side to the complex, stunning country. Her love for her homeland runs deep, and she is eager to share it. She hopes to gradually change people\u2019s perceptions.",
      "\u201cWhenever \u2026 I saw all of that natures, all those beauty, all those positivity, it changed my view totally,\u201d Moniry said in her enthusiastic English. \u201cAnd definitely this can be also for other people.\u201d",
      "One of those visitors is Australian Suzanne Sandral. She originally wanted to see Afghanistan in the 1960s but the pressures of having a family kept her away. Now at 82, she was part of Moniry\u2019s women-only tour group in Kabul.",
      "Afghanistan surprised her.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not what I expected at all. I expected to feel rather fearful. I expected to be given a lot of ... accusatory looks. Not at all,\u201d she said during a pause in sightseeing. \u201cWherever you go in the streets, if you smile at someone and give them a little nod or say hello, you get a terrific response. So it\u2019s very different.\u201d",
      "Jackie Birov, a 35-year-old independent traveler from Chicago who was not part of the tour group, called the Afghan people \u201cunbelievably hospitable.\u201d",
      "However, \u201cI\u2019m very aware that I have a lot more freedom than local women,\u201d she said.",
      "Four decades of war have kept tourists away from Afghanistan. But while the Taliban\u2019s takeover of power in August 2021 sent thousands of Afghans fleeing and shocked the world, the end of its insurgency against the previous U.S.-backed government also marked a sharp drop in violence.",

      "Tourist visas, typically single-entry ones valid for stays of up to 30 days, have become relatively simple to obtain from the few embassies that issue them. Regular flights connect Kabul with major transit hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul.",
      "For some, the idea of visiting Afghanistan as a tourist is morally abhorrent, particularly given the government\u2019s treatment of women.",
      "Girls are banned from education above primary school level, and women live under myriad restrictions. The government dictates what they can wear in public, where they can go and who they can go with. They cannot walk in parks or eat in restaurants. Beauty salons are banned. A very limited number of professions, such as teaching and carpet weaving, are open to them.",
      "And the rules can change quickly.",
      "But those involved in tourism point to the positive effects that visiting Afghanistan can have.",
      "\u201cI truly believe in ethical tourism,\u201d said Zoe Stephens, 31, a British tour leader at Koryo Tours, a company specializing in unusual destinations. \u201cI believe that you can divide politics and people, and that is the main thing for me. \u2026 A country is not a sum of its politics. It\u2019s a sum of so much more, it\u2019s a sum of its culture, its history, its food, and especially in Afghanistan, its people.\u201d",
      "Of the three recent tours Stephens led in Afghanistan, two were women-only. Working with local female guides, including Moniry, they combine key attractions with visits to women\u2019s centers and cooking and embroidery classes from local women \u2014 worlds that are closed to male travelers.",
      "\u201cWe always try and do something a little bit different that really makes our tours unique, as well as something that kind of gives back to the community,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cSo I felt that working with the female tour guides does both of those things really well.\u201d",
      "The groups are small \u2014 one had eight women, the other three \u2014 but the company is looking to build a network of female guides across Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cWhat we try and do with this tour, especially the women\u2019s tour, is conquer those ethical concerns,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThe idea is to learn about the lives of Afghan women in context.\u201d",

      "Ibrahim Anoba, an Africa affairs analyst at the Atlas Network, was speaking a day after Ouattara ended months of speculation about his contested candidacy with an announcement that is likely to lead to a near-guaranteed extension of a presidency that started in 2010.",
      "While Ouattara, 83, said his decision to run was informed by the \u201cunprecedented security, economic, and monetary challenges\u201d the country faces, his announcement comes after the disqualification of most of his prominent rivals, including former Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam.",

      "With Ivory Coast considered a regional powerhouse, analysts say a weakened opposition and the constitutional change that kept Ouattara in power after abolishing initial term limits could lead the country to an era of one-man rule, especially in a region where democracy is increasingly being challenged.",

      "Fears for Wine's safety have grown in recent months, fueled by regular attacks on X from Museveni\u2019s son and presumptive heir, army chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba. In January, Kainerugaba wrote he \u201cwould cut off\u201d Wine\u2019s head if the president allowed it, and he drew widespread criticism in May for saying he was holding Wine\u2019s missing bodyguard \u201cin my basement.\u201d The bodyguard later appeared unable to walk without support when presented in court, the apparent victim of torture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a constant reminder that the threat is real, because this is no ordinary person,\u201d Wine said, speaking of Gen. Kainerugaba. \u201cThis is a person that is not only the son of the person in charge of the country but is also the person in charge of all the organs of violence. He heads the military, the police, the prisons, you know. He is above the law, and he has acted as such.\u201d",
      "Wine, 43, spoke to The Associated Press in an exclusive interview at the headquarters of his National Unity Platform party in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, a site briefly occupied by security forces in a raid last month.",
      "Museveni, 80, who has ruled Uganda since 1986, dismisses Wine as an agent of foreign interests and has even questioned his patriotism. But Wine, who denies the allegations, has a large following among working-class people in urban areas, and his party has the most seats of any opposition party in Parliament.",
      "In the 2021 election, Wine secured 35% of the vote, while Museveni, with 58%, posted his worst-ever result, establishing Wine as the president's most potent challenger in decades. Wine alleged his victory was stolen through widespread ballot stuffing and other malpractices. Electoral authorities disputed the allegations.",
      "Wine\u2019s party claims dozens of its followers have been jailed or disappeared since 2021. For Wine, the attacks are meant to \u201csend fear down the nerves of all those that work with me and all those that stand for what I stand for.\u201d",
      "Wine and Museveni are set to face each other again in presidential polls scheduled for January 2026.",
      "Museveni has been campaigning in recent days in Kampala as he tries to bolster his chances among people likely to support Wine, urban dwellers often without a reliable source of income and who hope a change of government will benefit them.",
      "Wine often describes himself as a \u201cghetto president,\u201d citing his early days in a poor neighborhood in Kampala. He has maintained a high profile in this East African nation since the early 2000s, when he rose to fame as a singer whose dancehall music captivated audiences. Wine\u2019s compositions later grew critical of the government, earning him a reputation as a prominent contrarian while his musical peers were sometimes seen to be supportive of the government.",

      "His seizure from his home in the Luhansk region in April 2022 \u2014 weeks after Moscow's full-scale invasion \u2014 was part of a coordinated operation by pro-Russian forces who detained him and two other Ukrainian OSCE workers. Maksym Petrov, an interpreter, also was seized in the Luhansk region, while Vadym Golda, another security assistant, was detained in neighboring Donetsk.",
      "More than three years later, the three Ukrainian civilians who had worked with the international group\u2019s ceasefire monitoring efforts in the eastern regions remain behind bars. They have not been part of recent large-scale prisoner exchanges with Russia.",

She said her husband believed that \u201cinternational service could protect lives and make the world a little more just.\u201d",
      "The OSCE had operated a ceasefire monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow separatists had been fighting Ukrainian government troops since 2014, with about 14,000 killed even before the full-scale invasion. The monitors watched for truce violations, facilitated dialogue and brokered local halts in fighting to enable repairs to critical civilian infrastructure.",

They cleared offices, safeguarded OSCE assets, including armored vehicles, drones and cameras, and oversaw evacuations of their international colleagues. That operation was completed by October 2022.",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",

Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump may have gotten his way with tariffs on some countries, but his overhaul of American trade policy has not gone unchallenged",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has been getting his way on trade, strong-arming the European Union, Japan and other partners to accept once unthinkably high taxes on their exports to the United States.",
      "But his radical overhaul of American trade policy, in which he's bypassed Congress to slam big tariffs on most of the world's economies, has not gone unchallenged. He's facing at least seven lawsuits charging that he's overstepped his authority. The plaintiffs want his biggest, boldest tariffs thrown out.",
      "And they won Round One.",
      "In May, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized federal court in New York, ruled that Trump exceeded his powers when he declared a national emergency to plaster taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country in the world. In reaching its decision, the court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.",
      "Now it goes on to Round Two.",
      "On Thursday, the 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which typically specializes in patent law, are scheduled to hear oral arguments from the Trump administration and from the states and businesses that want his sweeping import taxes struck down.",
      "That court earlier allowed the federal government to continue collecting Trump\u2019s tariffs as the case works its way through the judicial system.",
      "The issues are so weighty \u2014 involving the president\u2019s power to bypass Congress and impose taxes with huge economic consequences in the United States and abroad \u2014 that the case is widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, regardless of what the appeals court decides.",
      "Trump is an unabashed fan of tariffs. He sees the import taxes as an all-purpose economic tool that can bring manufacturing back to the United States, protect American industries, raise revenue to pay for the massive tax cuts in his \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u2019\u2019 pressure countries into bending to his will, even end wars.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives the power to impose taxes \u2014 including tariffs \u2014 to Congress. But lawmakers have gradually relinquished power over trade policy to the White House. And Trump has made the most of the power vacuum, raising the average U.S. tariff to more than 18%, highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.",
      "At issue in the pending court case is Trump\u2019s use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs without seeking congressional approval or conducting investigations first. Instead, he asserted the authority to declare a national emergency that justified his import taxes.",

      "Trump later suspended the reciprocal tariffs, but they remain a threat: They could be imposed again Friday on countries that do not pre-empt them by reaching trade agreements with the United States or that receive letters from Trump setting their tariff rates himself.",

They also note that the trade deficit hardly meets the definition of an \u201cunusual and extraordinary\u2019\u2019 threat that would justify declaring an emergency under the law.

      "\u201cIt takes three years to get more cows \u2014 between making a decision, having that gestation period, having the calf born, raising the calf until it, too, can have a calf,\" said Michael Swanson, chief agricultural economist for the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute in Minneapolis.",
      "The Williamses' county was hard hit by drought over the previous few seasons. Because of the lack of their grass and uneconomically high hay prices, they had to sell all their young females last year that could have produced more calves for them this year, she said.",
      "Their area has caught some rain lately, though. It has improved to just \u201cabnormally dry\u201d in recent U.S. Drought Monitor reports. But Williams said they\u2019re simply playing catch-up.",

      "\u201cSometimes we have good times, and sometimes we don\u2019t,\u201d Woodall said. \u201cAnd we are just coming off what was a pretty significant negative hit to the cattle industry in \u201919, \u201920 and \u201921, with the height of the pandemic. So we have a lot of producers who are still trying to pay off bills from those times.\"",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting some good moisture now. But will it be that way in the fall? Will it be that way next year?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the last thing you want to do is pay to rebuild your herd and then just have to liquidate them again in six months to a year.\u201d",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned.

Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",

Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",

    "story": [
      "Investigators have found that a helicopter involved in a deadly crash with a passenger plane over Washington was flying above its height limit",
      "Incorrect altitude readings on the Army helicopter that collided with a passenger plane over Washington, D.C., in January contributed to the aircraft getting too close, but air traffic controllers warned about the hazards helicopter traffic presented years before the crash.",
      "Those warnings came even before the 85 near misses near the airport in the three years before the crash. But despite the concerns that were raised about the route the Black Hawk helicopter followed that night, the Federal Aviation Administration didn\u2019t make changes to it or warn pilots about it.",
      "The details came out of the first day of National Transportation Safety Board hearings in Washington, where investigators highlighted several of the factors that contributed to the crash between the American Airlines plane from Wichita, Kansas, and the Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan National Airport that was the deadliest aviation disaster in America since November 2001.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so bureaucratic,\u201d NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said. \u201cI mean we heard it in the testimony today: \u2018Oh you could bring it up in another symposium or another group. or you could take this option or we said no.\u2019 But then I asked did you provide an alternative? That\u2019s why people are so critical of the federal government because you can\u2019t ensure safety.\u201d",
      "Representatives of the Army and Federal Aviation Administration tried to deflect responsibility throughout the hearing. The Army acknowledged that their Black Hawks altimeters might be more than 100 feet (30 meters) off, but they seemed to say that was acceptable because their pilots\u2019 goal is to maintain altitude within 100 feet of a limit.",
      "Army officials instead raised concerns about the lack of separation between landing aircraft and helicopters flying on approved FAA routes near the airport. But later in the day, FAA and Army officials both implied that those routes were never supposed to ensure separation. Instead they suggested that it was up to the air traffic controller to keep helicopters from flying on that route anytime planes were taking off or landing from that runway.",
      "Aviation lawyer Bob Clifford, who is representing several of the victims\u2019 families said there was a lot of \u201cfinger pointing\u201d and \u201cno acceptance of responsibility and accountability\u201d during the hearing.",
      "The board\u2019s final report won\u2019t be released until sometime next year, but it became clear Wednesday how small a margin of error there was for helicopters flying the route the Black Hawk took the night of the crash.",
      "The January nighttime incident was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation.",
      "A video animation showed where the helicopter and airliner were leading up to the collision. It showed how the helicopter flew above the 200 feet (61 meters) altitude limit on the helicopter route along the Potomac River before colliding with the plane.",
      "Investigators said Wednesday the flight data recorder showed the helicopter was actually 80 feet to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) higher than the barometric altimeter the pilots relied upon showed they were flying. So the NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters.",
      "Dan Cooper with Sikorsky helicopters said that when the older Black Hawk helicopter involved in the crash was designed in the 1970s, it used a style of altimeter that was common at the time. Newer helicopters have air data computers that help provide more accurate altitude readings.",
      "Army Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that she wouldn\u2019t find an 80 to 100 foot discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter alarming because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Below 500 feet (152 meters), Lewis said she would be checking both instruments and cross referencing them, although that's not something every Army pilot is trained to do.",
      "Army officials said the greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Reagan airport that included such separation distances as small as 75 feet between helicopters and planes when planes are landing on a certain runway at Reagan.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we have less than 500 foot separation is a concern for me,\u201d said Scott Rosengren, chief engineer in the office that manages the Army\u2019s utility helicopters.",
      "But Rosengren said that \u201cif he was king for a day\u201d he would immediately retire all the older Black Hawk models like the one involved in this crash and replace them with newer versions of the helicopters.",
      "Army officials and the head of a local medevac helicopter company that flies around Washington told the board they believed air traffic controllers would never let them fly the helicopter route involved in the crash anytime a plane was approaching the runway.",

      "Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vetchen said after the crash that he talked to many of his fellow pilots and everyone had the same assumption that controllers would never allow them to fly across the path of the runway the American plane was approaching before the crash. But Homendy said other pilots in the unit told investigators they were allowed to fly underneath landing planes.",
      "Citing the numbers for runways, Van Vetchen said that \u201c100% of the time when I was on route four and 33/15 was active\u201d he would be instructed to hold until after the plane landed or took off from that runway.",
      "During the two minutes before the crash, one air traffic controller was directing airport traffic and helicopters in the area, a task that involved speaking to or receiving communications from several different aircraft on two different frequencies, according to the NTSB\u2019s History of Flight Performance Study released Wednesday.",
      "The air traffic controller had spoken to or received communications from the Black Hawk helicopter, an airplane that was taking off, an Air Force helicopter, an airplane on the ground, a medical helicopter and an inbound flight that was not the American Airlines plane that would crash.",
      "\u201cAll aircraft could hear the controller, but helicopters could only hear other helicopters on their frequency and airplanes only other airplanes,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThis resulted in a number of stepped on transmissions as helicopters and airplanes were not aware when the other was communicating.\u201d",
      "Stepped on transmissions are those that are unheard or blocked because of other transmissions. The NTSB report provides a list of 29 separate communications between the airport tower and other aircraft during approximately the 1 minute and 57 seconds before the collision.",
      "Previously disclosed air traffic control audio had the helicopter pilot telling the controller twice that they saw the airplane and would avoid it. Officials on Wednesday also raised the use of night vision goggles, which limit the wearer's field of view, on the helicopter as a factor.",
      "Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army's helicopters routinely flew around the nation's capital with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off.",
      "On Wednesday, it came out that even if they had been turned on, the ADS-B Out systems on most of the helicopters in the same unit as the one that crashed wouldn't work because they had been installed incorrectly. When the NTSB uncovered that problem, the Army sent out an alert about it and worked to quickly reprogram the units so they would work.",
      "Homendy highlighted that an FAA working group raised concerns about all the helicopter traffic around Reagan airport and the risk of a collision in 2022, but the FAA refused to add a warning to helicopter charts urging pilots to use caution when this runway was in use.",
      "Homendy said \u201cevery sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that.\u201d But after the accident the FAA transferred managers out of the tower instead of acknowledging that they had been warned.",
      "\u201cWhat you did is you transferred people out instead of taking ownership over the fact that everybody in FAA in the tower was saying there was a problem,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cBut you guys are pointing out, \u2018Welp, our bureaucratic process. Somebody should have brought it up at some other symposium.\u2019 Are you kidding me? 67 people are dead. How do you explain that?\u201d",
      "U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, introduced legislation Tuesday to require all aircraft operators to use both forms of ADS-B, or Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, the technology to broadcast aircraft location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B Out equipment but the airlines would have to add the more comprehensive ADS-B In technology to their planes.",
      "The legislation would revoke an exemption on ADS-B transmission requests for Department of Defense aircrafts.",
      "Homendy said her agency has been recommending that move for decades after several other crashes.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that while he\u2019d like to discuss \u201ca few tweaks,\u201d the legislation is \u201cthe right approach.\u201d He also suggested that the previous administration \u201cwas asleep at the wheel\u201d amid dozens of near-misses in the airspace around Washington's airspace.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge ticked higher last month in a sign that President Donald Trump\u2019s broad-based tariffs are starting to lift prices for many goods.",
      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher. The figures are above the Fed\u2019s 2% goal.",
      "The uptick in prices helps explain the central bank\u2019s reluctance to cut its key interest rate this week, despite repeated demands from Trump that it do so. On Wednesday, the Fed left its key rate unchanged at 4.3%, and Chair Fed Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the import duties will cause just a one-time rise in prices or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than consistent with the 2% target.",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",

      "Thursday's report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.3% from May to June, a modest rise that suggests Americans are still spending cautiously. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was just 0.1%, the government said.",
      "Consumers have been cautious all year. On Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a solid showing but one that masked some red flags. Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government\u2019s calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",
      "Earlier this month, the government reported that its more closely-watched consumer price index, its primary inflation measure, also ticked higher in June as the cost of heavily-imported items such as appliances, furniture, and toys increased.",

      "Officials and workers in the textile industry of the small African nation of Lesotho are holding their breath as a key deadline for U.S.-imposed tariffs approaches",
      "MASERU, Lesotho -- The deafening roar of hundreds of sewing machines has gone silent. Spools of thread in every color are covered in dust. The warehouse is dark and empty.",
      "In the tiny African nation of Lesotho, clothing manufacturer Tzicc's business has dried up in the face of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. A few months ago, work was steady. The factory's 1,300 employees have made and exported sportswear to American stores, including JCPenney, Walmart and Costco.",
      "But when Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners in April, Lesotho found itself topping the list, with a rate of 50% \u2014 higher even than that of China, where the economy is 8,000 times larger. Officials here and economic experts said they were baffled.",
      "Since then, Trump backed off \u2014 temporarily. During a monthslong pause for trade talks, the U.S. has charged a baseline 10% tariff and announced new rates for dozens of countries starting Friday. Lesotho\u2019s rate will be set at Trump\u2019s whim, with aides suggesting that tariffs charged on goods from smaller African countries could top 10%.",
      "Many nations have received letters laying out a new tariff. With the pause set to expire Friday, Lesotho officials say they've not received one and they find themselves among the countries where Trump says officials simply don\u2019t have time for one-on-one negotiations. Leaders \u2014 and the 12,000 people employed by garment factories exporting to the U.S. market \u2014 are still waiting.",
      "The damage has already rippled through Lesotho\u2019s economy, where textile manufacturing comprises the largest private industry with more than 30,000 workers in 2024.",
      "For Tzicc and its customers, the threat and apparent singling out of Lesotho were enough. Management decided to rush to deliver preexisting orders before tariffs resumed. But American buyers stopped placing new orders. With no work left, virtually all the factory's employees were sent home \u2014 potentially permanently.",
      "\u201cWell, unfortunately, we finished,\u201d factory compliance manager Rahila Omar said, pointing out the irony of the strategy as she walked among rows of silenced and covered machines. \u201cThat is why now we don't have any work.\u201d",
      "Omar is one of a handful of employees left in the eerily quiet factory. A few remain in the accounting department; others empty leftover stock to a warehouse elsewhere.",
      "Officials and workers fear this may be a sign of what's to come for other factories in Lesotho, where poverty is widespread among the population of 2 million and most textile workers single-handedly support their families.",
      "In March, a month before slapping Lesotho with the 50% tariff, Trump described it as a place \u201cnobody has ever heard of,\" struggling to pronounce the nation's name in a speech criticizing U.S. foreign aid.",
      "It's true Lesotho is a \u201cvery minuscule economy,\" as its own trade minister, Mokhethi Shelile, described it.",
      "But its relationship with Washington dates back decades. The U.S. was the first country to open an embassy in the capital, Maseru, after Lesotho declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. The military received U.S. training, and hundreds of millions in U.S. funds were sent to Lesotho to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic via the now defunctUSAID office and the PEPFAR program.",
      "As textiles grew to become Lesotho's main export, some 75% of its product went to the U.S. Lesotho became known as Africa's denim capital. If an American purchased jeans from a U.S. brand such as Wrangler or Levi's, they may have been \u201cMade in Lesotho,\u201d as tags still note.",
      "In 2000, the U.S. signed the African Growth and Opportunity Act, allowing Lesotho and other African nations to export goods to the U.S. duty free.",
      "Shelile said he was in the process of negotiating AGOA\u2019s September renewal when he was awakened in the middle of the night by texts from aides bearing news of the 50% U.S. tariffs.",
      "\u201cNo, this cannot be real,\u201d Shelile remembers thinking. \u201cWhat did we do to deserve this?\u201d",
      "According to the Trump administration, Lesotho charges a 99% tariff on U.S. goods. The government here said it doesn\u2019t know how the U.S. calculated that.",
      "In theory, the tariff decision was based on trade deficit: Lesotho\u2019s exports to the U.S. were around $240 million last year \u2014 mainly clothing and diamonds \u2014 and imports from the U.S. were only $2.8 million. But in practice, the math is more complicated than that. And in reality, Lesotho simply cannot afford to import more U.S. products. Nearly half the population lives below the poverty line.",
      "\u201cThe trade deficit that exists between Lesotho and the U.S. is a natural trade deficit that can happen when you have these types of disparities between two economies,\" Shelile said. \"It cannot be breached and certainly cannot be breached by imposing tariffs.\u201d",
      "Last year, Lesotho's overall unemployment rate was about 30%, national data shows. For those 35 and younger, it was nearly 50%.",

      "On the first day, investigators highlighted a number of factors that may have contributed to the crash and the warnings about helicopter traffic that FAA received years before the tragedy over the Potomac River.",
      "It\u2019s too early for the board to identify what exactly caused the crash. The board\u2019s final report won\u2019t be released until sometime next year. But it became clear Wednesday how small a margin of error there was for helicopters flying the route the Black Hawk took the night of the nation\u2019s deadliest plane crash since November 2001.",
      "The January incident was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation.",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said an FAA working group raised concerns about all the helicopter traffic around Reagan airport and the risk of a collision in 2022, but the FAA refused to add a warning to helicopter charts urging pilots to use caution when this runway was in use.",

      "Video and animation presented during the proceeding's first day showed the helicopter flying above the 200 feet (61 meters) altitude limit before colliding with the plane.",
      "Investigators said Wednesday the flight data recorder showed the helicopter was actually 80 feet to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) higher than the barometric altimeter the pilots relied upon showed they were flying. So the NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters.",
      "Dan Cooper with Sikorsky helicopters said that when the Black Hawk helicopter involved in the crash was designed in the 1970s, it used a style of altimeter that was common at the time. Newer helicopters have air data computers that didn\u2019t exist back then that help provide more accurate altitude readings.",
      "Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that she wouldn\u2019t find an 80 to 100 foot discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter alarming because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Below 500 feet (152 meters), Lewis said she would be checking both instruments and cross referencing them.",
      "Army officials said a discrepancy of 70 to 100 feet (21 to 30 meters) between the Black Hawk\u2019s altimeters is within the acceptable range because pilots are expected to maintain their altitude plus or minus 100 feet.",

      "The air traffic controller had spoken to or received communications from the Black Hawk helicopter, an airplane that was taking off, an Air Force helicopter, an airplane on the ground, a medical helicopter and an inbound flight that was not the American Airlines plane that would crash.",
      "\u201cAll aircraft could hear the controller, but helicopters could only hear other helicopters on their frequency and airplanes only other airplanes,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThis resulted in a number of stepped on transmissions as helicopters and airplanes were not aware when the other was communicating.\u201d",

      "The new tariffs were part of a flurry of trade activity that included a series of executive actions regarding Brazil, copper and shipments of goods worth less than $800, as well as a reduced 15% tax on imports from South Korea, including its autos. It was all a prelude to Friday when Trump's new tariff regime is scheduled to start, an event the White House has portrayed as a testament to Trump's negotiating skills even as concerns persist about the taxes hurting growth and increasing inflationary pressures.",
      "India \u201cis our friend,\u201d Trump said on his Truth Social platform announcing the taxes, but its tariffs on U.S. products \u201care far too high.\u201d",
      "The Republican president added India buys military equipment and oil from Russia, enabling Moscow's war in Ukraine. As a result, he intends to charge an additional \u201cpenalty\u201d starting on Friday as part of the launch of his administration\u2019s revised tariffs on multiple countries.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking to India now,\" the president said. \"We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d",

      "Trump on Wednesday also signed separate orders to tax imports of copper at 50% and justify his 50% tariffs on Brazil due to their criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro and treatment of U.S. social media companies. Trump also signed an order saying that government now had the systems in place to close the tariff loophole on \u201cde minimis\u201d shipments, which had enabled goods priced under $800 to enter America duty-free, largely from China.",
      "The South Korea agreement will impose a 15% tariff, instead of the 25% Trump had threatened. South Korea would also buy $100 billion in energy resources from the U.S. and provide $350 billion for \u201cinvestments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself, as president,\u201d Trump said.",
      "There is also an agreement with Pakistan that includes the development of its oil reserves. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent briefed Trump on trade talks with China.",
      "Trump's announcement comes after a slew of negotiated trade frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia \u2014 all of which he said would open markets for American goods while enabling the U.S. to raise tax rates on imports. The president views tariff revenues as a way to help offset the budget deficit increases tied to his recent income tax cuts and generate more domestic factory jobs.",
      "While Trump has effectively wielded tariffs as a cudgel to reset the terms of trade, the economic impact is uncertain as most economists expect a slowdown in U.S. growth and greater inflationary pressures as some of the costs of the taxes are passed along to domestic businesses and consumers.",
      "There's also the possibility of more tariffs coming on trade partners with Russia as well as on pharmaceutical drugs and computer chips.",

The two countries have had five rounds of negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement.

      "Officials have confirmed that two girls and a relative died in an explosion at a Nebraska biofuels plant",
      "FREMONT, Neb. -- The remains of two girls and a relative who were killed in a massive explosion at a Nebraska biofuel plant were recovered Wednesday after crews battled smoldering wreckage and an unstable building for more than 24 hours.",
      "Fremont Mayor Joey Spellerberg said earlier at a news conference that the children were at the Horizon Biofuels plant ahead of a doctor\u2019s appointment, waiting for their relative to finish work. He was unsure of their exact ages but believed both were under age 12.",
      "Officials identified the adult as Dylan D. Danielson, 32, of Columbus. They would not name the girls, according to a statement from the Dodge County Sheriff's Office.",
      "Sheriff Sgt. Brie Frank said heavy equipment was brought in to remove rubble, allowing crews to suppress the fire and access part of the building for the recovery mission.",
      "The plant makes animal bedding and wood pellets for heating and smoking food, using tons of wood waste. Spellerberg said authorities believe Tuesday's blast was likely a wood dust explosion in the tall elevator tower.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s really the only thing that makes sense,\u201d Spellerberg said. He said Horizon Biofuels is cooperating \u201cas far as I know.\u201d",
      "The company did not immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment.",
      "The top of the elevator tower was torn apart, exposing a mangled concrete-and-rebar core. Metal siding on the building below was left crumpled and charred, while wisps of white smoke drifted into the air Wednesday despite rain overnight.",
      "Spellerberg said fire crews had been evaluating whether the whole facility might collapse.",
      "\u201cMy heart hurts,\u201d Spellerberg told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy. We pray for all the families involved.\u201d",
      "The company has 10 employees, according to the Nebraska Manufacturing Extension Partnership.",

      "\u201cWe were really unsure when the explosion happened which plant it was, because there are so many in that area,\u201d she said.",
      "Emily Anderson, who lives just blocks from the plant, said she heard \u201cone really big boom\u201d before police cars flooded in.",
      "\u201cThere were just huge plumes of very, very black smoke,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt was scary.\u201d",
      "Fremont, a city of about 27,000 and the sixth-largest in Nebraska, is 32 miles (52 kilometers) northwest of Omaha.",

Last year, he pivoted awkwardly as he was taking his lead on the bases and wound up tearing the ACL in his left knee, ending his season after 49 games.",

      "Growing up in a family of horsemen in Ontario, John Campbell knew how prestigious the Hambletonian was. Then he saw good friend Ray Remmen win the first to take place at the Meadowlands in 1981.",
      "\u201cIt was beyond a big deal,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIt was something special.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, the biggest event in harness racing celebrates a centennial anniversary with the 100th running of Hambletonian. While harness racing, like its thoroughbred equivalent, no longer holds the same prominence it once did in the U.S. sporting landscape, the storied history of the Hambletonian and its evolution to grow interest in Europe are responsible for its longevity.",
      "\u201cTo have this big event still going on 100 years, it\u2019s something that I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t even envision when it was formed,\u201d said Campbell, a Harness Racing Hall of Fame driver who won the Hambletonian a record six times and participated a record 32 consecutive times from 1983-2014. \u201cIt's the consistency of it. They raced it no matter what, through the Depression, through World War II, so it was always there.\u201d",
      "Campbell is now president and CEO of the Hambletonian Society that has shepherded the race named for the founding sire of standardbred horses through changing times. The purse is the sport's richest at $1 million, a long way from the nearly $75,000 on the line during the inaugural rendition in 1926 at the New York State Fair in Syracuse.",
      "The Hambletonian bounced around to Lexington, Kentucky; Goshen, New York and Du Quoin, Illinois, before finding a home in East Rutherford, New Jersey.",
      "\u201cEven during the war, they did have to because of gas rationing take it to Yonkers,\u201d said Tom Charters, who worked at the Hambletonian Society from 1984-2017, including a lengthy stint as president. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the charm of it, I think: the multiple venues and where it\u2019s gone and where it\u2019s been.\u201d",
      "Another charm? The winning horse gets to drink out of the trophy. That is something Charters saw pictures of and made sure would become part of the Hambletonian ceremony \u2014 with the name of the race and the horse logo always facing the cameras.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s become as symbolic as drinking milk at Indianapolis, for me, anyway,\u201d Charters said, referring to the Indy 500 tradition.",
      "Campbell has his favorite memories, notably, he said, \u201cWinning.\" His first victory with Mack Lobell in 1987 and winning with Tagliabue\u2014 trained by his brother, Jim, and named after longtime NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue \u2014 in '95 stand out as special, along with 2006 with Glidemaster to revitalize his career after injury.",

    "story": [
      "College coaches are racing to master retention as revenue sharing and NIL opportunities steer athletes toward the transfer portal",
      "Whether it was an ACC, SEC, Big Ten or Big 12 coach taking the podium at media days, one theme remained consistent: In an era where revenue sharing and NIL opportunities can swiftly steer athletes toward the transfer portal, programs across the country are racing to master the art of player retention.",
      "Its importance is clear to Arkansas coach Sam Pittman, who has seen all but five players from his 2023 recruiting class leave for different programs.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s what it\u2019s not because of: the way they\u2019re treated, because of the way they\u2019re developed, because of the way they\u2019re taught,\" he said. \"That\u2019s not the reason. It could be playing time. It could be finances. Probably the majority of it is finances, but you\u2019d have to ask those guys.\u201d",
      "More than 3,000 Bowl Subdivision players reportedly entered the transfer portal this past spring, which would average out to about 22 players per team. For the Razorbacks, 10 starters will be back and one of them is senior defensive lineman Cam Ball. He has remained with Arkansas his entire career, a somewhat rare occurrence for an NFL hopeful these days.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a loyal guy. I\u2019m loyal to the state of Arkansas; Arkansas has been loyal to me,\" Ball said.",
      "Arkansas, like many schools, is also trying to scare up more money from donors as it faces the financial ramifications of the $2.8 billion House settlement; last fall, the athletic director said the school needed some $12 million more annually to \u201cbe in the NIL game from a football perspective.\u201d Besides the money, the Razorbacks have to find talented players; Ball grew up in Atlanta, just barely within the regional footprint in which Pittman prefers to recruit.",
      "\u201cWe have to go outside our state,\" Pittman said. \u201cIn-state recruiting has changed over the last three or four years because of NIL. So you have to think about the talent \u2014 who it is versus what pay is expected. So that\u2019s been a little bit more difficult in our state.\u201d",
      "Pittman isn\u2019t the only coach who wants prospects to be familiar with what their college experience will look like before making any life-changing decisions. Florida coach Billy Napier paints a clear picture of life in Gainesville and the challenges and perks that come with it.",
      "\u201cWe present our product in a way where we\u2019re selling the degree, the alumni network, the Gator-made program, and you have to be up for the challenge of trying to get Florida back to where it\u2019s been before,\" he said. \"And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve been able to keep it together.\u201d",
      "Florida\u2019s 2023 recruiting class remains mostly intact, and from Napier\u2019s perspective, hungrier than ever. Compared to other SEC teams, the Gators have had more success with retention. Napier doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence.",
      "\u201cWe told them when they came in, you know, look, it\u2019s not going to be all sunshine and rainbows here. We\u2019re in this thing for the long haul,\u201d Napier said. \u201cI think a lot of this is how you pitch it in recruiting. We\u2019re going to continue to do that, and retention is more important than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d",
      "Coaches scrambling to prevent transfers and maintain consistency isn\u2019t exclusive to the SEC. The approval of the House settlement is a double-edged sword when it comes to retention, and Power Four schools and beyond are feeling the effects. Third-party NIL deals are no longer the only negotiation tactic schools need to worry about.",
      "Complex contracts are becoming common and legal risks grow for athletes and programs alike as college football increasingly resembles the pros. Some deals are being negotiated solely by athletes as young as 18.",

If you\u2019re comfortable with their offer, then sign. Then you have some guys that\u2019ll leave and go to schools to get more money and stuff. That was never really like a big pusher for me, to go out and get more money because I feel like I\u2019m in a good situation here at Louisville.\u201d",
      "Quinn's loyalty could be the most convincing negotiation tactic of them all. While programs use revenue-share dollars to sway prospective transfers, coaches have begun to reward loyalty.",
      "\u201cTo some degree, it\u2019s capitalism that you get what you earn.

      "\u201cA guy that\u2019s been on a team three years, that\u2019s playing well and earned it on the field should make more than a guy coming in the door.

      "TAMPA, Fla. -- Mike Evans streaked into the secondary, cut outside and leaped to catch a perfect post-corner toss from Baker Mayfield.",
      "Fans at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2019 indoor practice facility roared.",
      "They\u2019re used to Evans making all the plays but No. 13 still manages to impress everyone watching.",
      "The six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver makes it look so effortless the way he glides after the ball. His routes are smooth and precise, his hands soft. At 6-foot-5, 231 pounds, he has a powerful frame so he can outmuscle defenders or outfinesse them when he needs to.",
      "Evans is the only player in NFL history to start his career with 11 consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons. Only Jerry Rice had that many at any point. Evans is aiming for 12 in a row in a year when the Buccaneers celebrate the franchise\u2019s 50th season. There are no signs the 31-year-old is slowing down and his team goals are bigger than his personal ones.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just happy that we have a really great team and we\u2019re using this training camp to put everything together to have one of the best seasons for the 50th,\u201d Evans said Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m excited to put on a great show for y\u2019all.\u201d",
      "At a position known for players with look-at-me personalities \u2014 Tyreek Hill, Michael Irvin, Terrell Owens, Chad Johnson \u2014 Evans lets his performance do most of the talking. He\u2019s quiet, humble and community-oriented. Evans is a four-time NFL Walter Payton Man of The Year nominee for the work he does along with his wife, Ashli, through their foundation, which empowers youth, encourages education and stands against domestic violence.",
      "Evans joined the Buccaneers in 2014 as the seventh overall pick and has become one of the greatest players in franchise history. Evans and Chris Godwin were a big reason why Tom Brady chose Tampa Bay in 2020 and the Buccaneers ended up winning a Super Bowl that season.",
      "From catching passes from Josh McCown and Mike Glennon as a rookie to Jameis Winston to Brady to Baker Mayfield, Evans continues to produce. He has 836 career catches for 12,684 yards and 105 touchdowns.",
      "Evans missed three games last season due to injury and didn\u2019t reach 1,000 yards until he caught a 9-yard pass on the final play of a 27-19 victory over the Saints that the Buccaneers needed to secure their fourth straight NFC South title.",
      "The reaction from Evans\u2019 teammates and the fans after that catch showed how much he\u2019s loved.",

      "\u201cPrime\u2019s talking about his stance and all these things, and he wants to know how that\u2019s going,\u201d Livingston recounted. \u201cHis leadership is one of one. He\u2019s the Pied Piper \u2014 the world will follow him if they just listen to him.\"",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

      "China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",
      "U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cUkraine was a warning shot for the rest of us,\u201d said Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of the Takshashila Institution, a public policy research center based in Bangalore, India. \u201cFor the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

      "A 16-year-old\u2019s Roblox game, Grow a Garden, has shattered records for the most concurrent players in history",
      "Whether it serves as a chill escape from the onslaught of the real world or simply a way to beat vacation doldrums, a viral Roblox game about gardening has become the surprise hit of the summer.",
      "Grow a Garden, created by a 16-year-old in a few days, has shattered records for the most concurrent players of any game in history, beating out video games that take years and millions of dollars to develop.",
      "And there\u2019s no one to shoot, fight or race. If your last attempt at cultivating vegetables was FarmVille in 2010, don't worry \u2014 your tomatoes will grow even if you never water them.",
      "Grow a Garden is as simple as its name suggests \u2014 players can fill a plot of land with plants and animals, harvest and sell, trade or steal each others' bounty. The game is low stress, with an aesthetic reminiscent of Minecraft and a soundtrack of soothing classical tunes such as Mozart's Rondo Alla Turca playing in the background. Its popularity has further cemented Roblox' place not just in the gaming world but in popular culture \u2014 for better or for worse, it's where the kids hang out.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep hearing used over and over to describe this particular game is that it\u2019s chill, which is just such a nice alternative. I get a lot of sort of that Animal Crossing vibe from it. You know, like you can check in, you can check your gardens, you can get some new seeds, you can plant them,\u201d said Becky Bozdech, editorial director at the nonprofit Common Sense Media. \u201cI have an 11-year-old son who (plays it) and he says to him the big difference is that a lot of games have a big giant objective that you have to do, but in Grow a Garden, you can just kind of hang out and do what you want.\u201d",
      "Coincidence or not, Grow a Garden soared to popularity around the same time that Take-Two Interactive announced it would delay the launch of its wildly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 until next year. In late June, the gardening game logged 21.6 million concurrent players, surpassing Fortnite\u2019s previous record of 15.2 million according to Roblox. Analysts who follow Roblox's stock say Grow a Garden is helping boost the company's revenue and will push the company's quarterly earnings numbers above Wall Street's expectations.",
      "While it's not clear if the GTA audience flocked to this simple gardening game to pass the time until then, the timing reignited the age-old debate about who gamers are and what titles are taken seriously by the video game establishment. It happened with Candy Crush, with puzzle games, with Animal Crossing. Are people who play cozy games true gamers? Or is the title reserved for the folks who shoot enemies in Call of Duty or drive around creating mayhem in GTA?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge percentage of gamers that play Roblox and the actual industry just views it as like this esoterically immature platform of weird gameplay habits,\u201d said Janzen Madsen, the New Zealand-based CEO and founder of Splitting Point studios, which acquired the game from its teenage creator. \u201cWell, I actually think in five years this is what player expectation is gonna be. And because you guys haven\u2019t embraced it, like you\u2019re not gonna know how to make games.\u201d",
      "To start growing your garden, you'll need a Roblox account. The game will start you out with an empty plot and some money \u2014 sheckles \u2014 and a starter seed. From there, you can plant seeds, harvest and sell your crops and buy more seeds, animals or tools for your garden. While it is possible to play the game without spending real-world money, it will take longer. Once you sell enough crops, you earn money to buy more expensive seeds beyond basic carrots and blueberries.",

      "Bozdech said that \u201cif you have the right supervision and guidance,\u201d Roblox can be a positive experience for kids, allowing them to create their own designs or practice coding, for instance.",
      "\u201cSomething like Grow a Garden, particularly, is a nice opportunity maybe for parents and kids to play together,\u201d she said.",
      "And perhaps the slow cultivating of a magical garden can benefit parents too.",

      "The Australian government has announced YouTube will be required to ensure account holders are at least 16 years old starting in December",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government announced YouTube will be among the social media platforms that must ensure account holders are at least 16-years-old from December, reversing a position taken months ago on the popular video-sharing service.",
      "YouTube was listed as an exemption in November last year when the Parliament passed world-first laws that will ban Australian children younger than 16 from platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and X.",
      "Communications Minister Anika Wells released rules Wednesday that decide which online services are defined as \u201cage-restricted social media platforms\u201d and which avoid the age limit.",
      "The age restrictions take effect Dec. 10 and platforms will face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for \u201cfailing to take responsible steps\u201d to exclude underage account holders, a government statement said. The steps are not defined.",
      "Wells defended applying the restrictions to YouTube and said the government would not be intimidated by threats of legal action from the platform\u2019s U.S. owner, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\u201cThe evidence cannot be ignored that four out of 10 Australian kids report that their most recent harm was on YouTube,\u201d Wells told reporters, referring to government research. \u201cWe will not be intimidated by legal threats when this is a genuine fight for the wellbeing of Australian kids.\u201d",
      "Children will be able to access YouTube but will not be allowed to have their own YouTube accounts.",

      "\u201cWe share the government\u2019s goal of addressing and reducing online harms. Our position remains clear: YouTube is a video sharing platform with a library of free, high-quality content, increasingly viewed on TV screens. It\u2019s not social media,\u201d a YouTube statement said, noting it will consider next steps and engage with the government.",

      "\u201cPlatforms have to provide an alternative to providing your own personal identification documents to satisfy themselves of age,\u201d Wells said. \u201cThese platforms know with deadly accuracy who we are, what we do and when we do it. And they know that you\u2019ve had a Facebook account since 2009, so they know that you are over 16.\"",
      "Exempt services include online gaming, messaging, education and health apps. They are excluded because they are considered less harmful to children.",
      "The minimum age is intended to address harmful impacts on children including addictive behaviors caused by persuasive or manipulative platform design features, social isolation, sleep interference, poor mental and physical health, low life-satisfaction and exposure to inappropriate and harmful content, government documents say.",

      "The fictitious rock group, Velvet Sundown, which comes complete with AI-generated music, lyrics and album art, is stoking debate about how the new technology is blurring the line between the real and synthetic in the music industry, and whether creators should be transparent with their audience.",
      "Computer software is widely used in music production, and artificial intelligence is just the latest tool that disc jockeys, music producers and others have added to their production pipeline. But the rise of AI song generators such as Suno and Udio is set to transform the industry because they allow anyone to create songs with just a few prompts.",
      "While some people do not care whether they're listening to AI-generated music, others might be curious to know.",
      "If you encounter a new song that leaves you wondering whether it's 100% made with AI, there are some methods that could reveal how it was created.",
      "If you're wondering who's behind a song, try some old-fashioned detective work.",
      "The \u201cmost obvious cues\u201d come from \u201cexternal factors,\u201d said Manuel Mousallam, head of research and development at streaming service Deezer.",
      "Does the band or artist have social media accounts? Lack of a social presence might indicate there's no one there. If they do exist online, examine the kind of content they post, and how long it goes back.",
      "Is there any sign that the artist or band exists in real life? Are there any upcoming concerts and can you buy a ticket for a gig? Is there footage of past concerts on YouTube? Has an established record label released their singles or albums?",
      "Try going to the source. Song creators often \u2014 but not always \u2014 publish their generated tunes on the Suno or Udio platforms, where they can be found by other users.",
      "The catch is that you'll have to sign up for an account to get access. Users can look up songs by track name or the creator's handle, and browse genres and playlists. But it can still be difficult to spot a song, especially if you don't know the name of the song or creator.",
      "Deezer has been flagging albums containing AI-generated songs, as part of its efforts to be more transparent as it battles streaming fraudsters looking to make quick money through royalty payments.",
      "The Deezer app and website will notify listeners with an on-screen label \u2014 \u201cAI-generated content\u201d \u2014 to point out that some tracks on an album were created with song generators.",

The company hasn't specified how many songs it has tagged since it rolled out the feature in June, but says up to 18% of songs uploaded to its platform each day are AI-generated.",

      "As a cross-check, I also uploaded some old MP3s from my song library, which got a very low AI probability score.",

      "Casual users, though, might prefer to just let the machine write them. So bad rhyming schemes or repetitive lyrical structures might be a clue that a song is not man-made. But it's subjective.",

      "The brain-eating amoeba enters the body when water is forced up the nose, like when someone jumps or dives in the water.",
      "It causes an infection that swells the brain and destroys tissue. Fewer than 10 cases are reported each year in the U.S., but almost all are fatal.",
      "Here are some things to know about the amoeba, its latest victim and other dangers on freshwater lakes:",
      "The amoeba's scientific name is Naegleria fowleri and it is most dangerous in water that stays for a while over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), including in lakes and rivers in the U.S. and other places with hot, sometimes dry summers like Pakistan and Australia. Infections have been reported in 26 U.S. states as far north as Minnesota.",
      "The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.",
      "Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.",
      "One infection in a body of water doesn\u2019t increase the chances of another infection in the same body of water, the agency said. The amoeba cannot move from one person to another.",
      "It was the first death from the amoeba in South Carolina since 2016, the CDC said.",
      "Jaysen Carr went swimming at Lake Murray about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia over the July Fourth weekend.",

      "The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.",
      "There are other dangers in swimming in lakes and rivers instead of pools, where chemicals can kill off dangerous bacteria and other organisms.",
      "A mouthful of water could contain E.coli bacteria. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to the Mayo Clinic.",

      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- An artificial intelligence data center that would use more electricity than every home in Wyoming combined before expanding to as much as five times that size will be built soon near Cheyenne, according to the city's mayor.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a game changer. It\u2019s huge,\u201d Mayor Patrick Collins said Monday.",

      "Gov. Mark Gordon praised the project's value to the state's gas industry.",
      "\u201cThis is exciting news for Wyoming and for Wyoming natural gas producers,\" Gordon said in the statement.",
      "While data centers are energy-hungry, experts say companies can help reduce their effect on the climate by powering them with renewable energy rather than fossil fuels. Even so, electricity customers might see their bills increase as utilities plan for massive data projects on the grid.",
      "The data center would be built several miles (kilometers) south of Cheyenne off U.S. 85 near the Colorado state line. State and local regulators would need to sign off on the project, but Collins was optimistic construction could begin soon.",

Data centers, demanding vast amounts of energy and water, have aroused strong opposition in some communities.",
      "The AI Action Plan Trump announced last week would seek to sweep aside NEPA, as it's commonly known, to streamline environmental reviews and permitting for data centers and related infrastructure.

      "Here's what to know about this key environmental law, and Trump's effort to weaken it:",
      "NEPA is a foundational environmental law in the United States, \u201cessentially our Magna Carta for the environment,\u201d said Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, another environmental group, referring to the 13th century English legal text that formed the basis for constitutions worldwide.",
      "Signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1970, NEPA requires federal agencies proposing actions such as building roads, bridges or energy projects to study how their project will affect the environment. Private companies are also frequently subject to NEPA standards when they apply for a permit from a federal agency.",
      "In recent years, the law has become increasingly important in requiring consideration of a project's possible contributions to climate change.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a really important function because otherwise we\u2019re just operating with blinders just to get the project done, without considering whether there are alternative solutions that might accomplish the same objective, but in a more environmentally friendly way,\" Park said.",
      "But business groups say NEPA routinely blocks important projects that often take five years or more to complete.",
      "\u201cOur broken permitting system has long been a national embarrassment,'' said Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Global Energy Institute. He called NEPA \u201ca blunt and haphazard tool\u201d that too often is used to block investment and economic development.",
      "The White House proposal comes as Congress is working on a permitting reform plan that would overhaul NEPA, addressing long-standing concerns from both parties that development projects -- including some for clean energy -- take too long to be approved.",
      "NEPA's strength \u2014 and usefulness \u2014 can depend on how it's interpreted by different administrations.",
      "Trump, a Republican, sought to weaken NEPA in his first term by limiting when environmental reviews are required and limiting the time for evaluation and public comment. Former Democratic President Joe Biden restored more rigorous reviews.",
      "In his second term, Trump has again targeted the law.",
      "An executive order that touched on environmental statutes has many agencies scrapping the requirement for a draft environmental impact statement. And the CEQ in May withdrew Biden-era guidance that federal agencies should consider the effects of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions when conducting NEPA reviews.",

      "The U.S. Forest Service had maintained that the herbicides' impact on humans and red alders wasn\u2019t a problem. But under NEPA, a court required the agency to redo their analysis and they ultimately had to write a new environmental impact statement.",

      "In the first seven months of the 2024-25 season, krill fishing in Antarctica reached 518,568 tons, about 84% of the 620,000-ton limit that, once reached, will force the fishery to automatically close. In one hot spot, the catch through June 30 was nearly 60% higher than all of last year\u2019s haul, according to a report from the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the world's southernmost fishery.",
      "The report, which has not been publicly released and CCAMLR said contains confidential data, was shared with The AP by someone concerned about overfishing in Antarctica on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of the krill take is from an increasingly smaller area,\u201d said Capt. Peter Hammarstedt, campaign director for conservation group Sea Shepherd Global, which this year made its third voyage to Antarctica to document the fishery. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of a hunter saying that they\u2019re only killing 1% of the U.S.\u2019 deer population but leaving out that all of the deer were shot in Rhode Island.\u201d",
      "Krill is one of the most abundant marine species in the world, with an estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill\u2019s Omega-3 rich oil \u2013 for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements \u2014 have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 industrial trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill \u2014 until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.",
      "AP journalists traveled to the icy waters around Antarctica in 2023 and observed how factory ships trawl in close proximity to whales whose numbers are still recovering from a century of industrial culling that nearly drove them to extinction.",
      "Underscoring the competition between humans and whales, three humpback whales were found dead or seriously injured last year in the long, cylindrical nets deployed by the vessels to vacuum up the paper-clip sized crustacean.",
      "Officials have been negotiating for years a new management plan that would balance the growing market for krill with calls for greater protection of the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's northernmost point and an area teeming with whales and, increasingly, tourists. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected \u2014 well behind CCAMLR\u2019s target and a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030.",
      "But a tentative deal fell apart at last year\u2019s CCAMLR meeting over a last minute proposal by the United Kingdom and Australia for an even lower catch limit than the one agreed to during talks, AP reported last year. China, objecting to the persistent Western demands, then withdrew its support for the marine reserve and refused to renew the existing management system.",
      "\u201cThe truth was it was the UK,\u201d Matts Johansen, chief executive of Norway's Aker BioMarine, the world's largest supplier of krill-based products, said at the United Nations Oceans conference in June. \u201cJust a couple days before the vote, the UK threw another suggestion and that's when the Chinese backed off.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office rejected that characterization and said the British government continues to push for a krill management strategy that better safeguards Antarctic marine species and vulnerable ecosystems.",
      "In the absence of a deal, restrictions adopted 15 years ago to spread out the catch limit expired, allowing the krill fleet to essentially fish anywhere at any time, including in smaller habitats preferred by whales and other animals such as penguins and seals.",

      "Javier Arata, the executive director the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies, whose members are responsible for 95% of the krill taken from Antarctica, said the catch limit that lapsed was always intended as an interim measure.",

      "Scientists in Mexico are testing innovative methods they hope can be employed to locate the overwhelming number of people missing due to cartel violence",
      "ZAPOPAN, Mexico -- First the scientists dress dead swine in clothes, then they dispose of the carcasses. Some they wrap in packing tape, others they chop up. They stuff the animals into plastic bags or wrap them in blankets. They cover them in lime or burn them. Some are buried alone, others in groups.",
      "Then they watch.",
      "The pigs are playing an unlikely role as proxies for humans in research to help find the staggering number of people who have gone missing in Mexico during decades of drug cartel violence.",
      "Families of the missing are usually left to look for their loved ones with little support from authorities. But now, government scientists are testing the newest satellite, geophysical and biological mapping techniques \u2014 along with the pigs \u2014 to offer clues that they hope could lead to the discovery of at least some of the bodies.",
      "The ranks of Mexico\u2019s missing exploded in the years following the launch of then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n\u2019s war against drug cartels in 2006. A strategy that targeted the leaders of a handful of powerful cartels led to a splintering of organized crime and the multiplication of violence to control territory.",
      "With near complete impunity, owing to the complicity or inaction of the authorities, cartels found that making anyone they think is in their way disappear was better than leaving bodies in the street. Mexican administrations have sometimes been unwilling to recognize the problem and at other times are staggered by the scale of violence their justice system is unprepared to address.",
      "Mexico\u2019s disappeared could populate a small city. Official data in 2013 tallied 26,000 missing, but the count now surpasses 130,000 \u2014 more than any other Latin American nation. The United Nations has said there are indications that the disappearances are \u201cgeneralized or systematic.\u201d",
      "If the missing people are found \u2014 dead or alive \u2014 it is usually by their loved ones. Guided by information from witnesses, parents and siblings search for graves by walking through cartel territory, plunging a metal rod into the earth and sniffing for the scent of death.",
      "Around 6,000 clandestine graves have been found since 2007, and new discoveries are made all the time. Tens of thousands of remains have yet to be identified.",
      "Jalisco, which is home to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, has the largest number of people reported missing in Mexico: 15,500. In March, human bone fragments and hundreds of items of clothing were discovered at a cartel ranch in the state. Authorities denied it was the site of a mass grave.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Luis Silv\u00e1n, a coordinator of the mapping project and scientist at CentroGeo, a federal research institute focused on geospacial information, said Jalisco\u2019s disappeared are \u201cwhy we\u2019re here.\u201d",
      "The mapping project, launched in 2023, is a collaboration by Guadalajara University, Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University and the University of Oxford in England, alongside the Jalisco Search Commission, a state agency that organizes local searches with relatives.",
      "\u201cNo other country is pushing so strongly, so creatively\" to test and combine new techniques, said Derek Congram, a Canadian forensic anthropologist, whose expertise in geographic information systems inspired the Mexican project.",
      "Still, Congram warns, technology \u201cis not a panacea.\u201d",
      "\u201cNinety percent of searches are resolved with a good witness and digging,\u201d he said.",
      "Silv\u00e1n walks by a site where scientists buried 14 pigs about two years ago. He says they may not know how well the technology works, where and when it can be used, or under what conditions, for at least three years.",
      "\u201cFlowers came up because of the phosphorous at the surface, we didn\u2019t see that last year,\u201d he said as he took measurements at one of the gravesites. \u201cThe mothers who search say that that little yellow flower always blooms over the tombs and they use them as a guide.\u201d",

      "Pigs and humans are closely related, famously sharing about 98% of DNA. But for the mapping project, the physical similarities also matter. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, pigs resemble humans in size, fat distribution and the structure and thickness of skin.",
      "A big Colombian drone mounted with a hyperspectral camera flies over the pig burial site. Generally used by mining companies, the camera measures light reflected by substances in the soil, including nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and shows how they vary as the pigs decompose. The colorful image it produces offers clues of what to look for in the hunt for graves.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t pure science,\u201d Silv\u00e1n said. \u201cIt is science and action. Everything learned has to be applied immediately, rather than wait for it to mature, because there\u2019s urgency.\u201d",
      "Researchers also employ thermal drones, laser scanners and other gadgets to register anomalies, underground movements and electrical currents. One set of graves is encased behind a pane of transparent acrylic, providing a window for scientists to observe the pigs\u2019 decomposition in real time.",
      "The Jalisco commission compares and analyzes flies, beetles, plants and soil recovered from the human and pig graves.",
      "Each grave is a living \u201cmicro ecosystem,\u201d said Tunuari Ch\u00e1vez, the commission's director of context analysis.",
      "Triggered by the disappearance of 43 students in 2014, Silv\u00e1n and his colleagues started gathering information about ground-penetrating radar, electric resistivity and satellite imagery from around the world. They studied University of Tennessee research on human corpses buried at a \u201cbody farm.\u201d They looked at grave-mapping techniques used in the Balkans, Colombia and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWhat good is science or technology if it doesn\u2019t solve problems?\u201d he said.",
      "They learned new applications of satellite analysis, then began their first experiments burying pigs and studying the substances criminals use to dispose of bodies. They found lime is easily detected, but hydrocarbons, hydrochloric acid and burned flesh are not.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s team worked to combine the science with what they knew about how the cartels operate. For example, they determined that disappearances in Jalisco commonly happened along cartel routes between Pacific ports, drug manufacturing facilities and the U.S. border, and that most of the missing are found in the same municipality where they disappeared.",
      "The experience of the families of the missing also informs the research.",
      "Some observed that graves are often found under trees whose roots grow vertically, so those digging the graves can remain in the shade. Mothers of missing loved ones invited by researchers to visit one of the pig burial sites were able to identify most of the unmarked graves by sight alone, because of the plants and soil placement, Silv\u00e1n said.",
      "\u201cThe knowledge flows in both directions,\u201d he said.",
      "Maribel Cede\u00f1o, who has been looking for her missing brother for four years, said she believes the drones and other technology will be helpful.",
      "\u201cI never imagined being in this situation, finding bodies, becoming such an expert,\u201d she said of her quest.",
      "H\u00e9ctor Flores has been searching for his son since 2021. He questions why so much time and effort has been invested in methods that have not led to concrete discoveries, when the families have proven track records with little official support.",
      "Although the research has not yet concluded, the Jalisco Search Commission is already using a thermal drone, a laser scanner and a multispectral camera to help families look for their missing relatives in some cases. But it is unclear whether authorities across Mexico will ever be willing to use, or able to afford, the high-tech aides.",
      "Congram, the forensic scientist, said researchers are aware of the limitations of technology, but that \u201cyou always have to try, fail, fail again and keep trying.\u201d",

      "It's the latest action by a top global tourist destination to push back against the infiltration of vacationers into residential neighborhoods and tourism overwhelming their communities. In May, Spain ordered Airbnb to block more than 65,000 holiday listings on its platform for having violated rules. Last month, thousands of protesters in European cities like Barcelona and Venice, Italy, marched against the ills of overtourism.",
      "The Maui County Council's housing committee voted 6-3 to pass the bill, which would close a loophole that has allowed owners of condos in apartment zones to rent their units for days or weeks at a time instead of a minimum of 180 days.

      "A dozen members of Congress who have been blocked from making oversight visits at immigration detention centers are suing the Trump administration to ensure they are granted entry into the facilities, even without prior notice",
      "A dozen Democratic members of Congress who have been blocked from making oversight visits at immigration detention centers filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday against the Trump administration that seeks to ensure they are granted entry into the facilities, even without prior notice.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the District of Columbia\u2019s federal court, said the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are obstructing Congressional oversight of the centers at a time when there's been an increase in ICE arrests, with reports of raids across the country and people taken into custody at immigration courts.",
      "By law, members of Congress are allowed to visit ICE facilities and don\u2019t have to give any notice, but increasingly, the members have been stopped at the door. ICE officials have said a new rule requires a seven-day waiting period and they prohibit entry to the ICE field offices. The lawsuit asks the court for full and immediate access to all ICE facilities.",
      "ICE Director Todd Lyons told a congressional committee in May that he recognized the right of members of Congress to visit detention facilities, even unannounced. But DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told a different committee that members of Congress should have requested a tour of an immigration detention facility in New Jersey where a skirmish broke out in May.",
      "As President Donald Trump's immigration agenda plays out, detention facilities have become overcrowded and there have been reports of mistreatment, food shortages, a lack of medical care and unsanitary conditions, the lawsuit said. Congress has a duty to make sure the administration is complying with the law while operating the facilities, the lawsuit said.",
      "The recently passed budget bill allocates $45 billion for ICE detention \u2014 more than 13 times ICE\u2019s current annual detention budget, the lawsuit said. Members of Congress must ensure those funds are spent efficiently and legally, the suit said.",
      "But recent attempts by House members to visit facilities were blocked, the lawsuit said.",
      "\u201cThese members of Congress could have just scheduled a tour; instead, they\u2019re running to court to drive clicks and fundraising emails,\" DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told the AP in an email.",
      "Requests for visits to detention centers should be made \u201cwith sufficient time to prevent interference with the President\u2019s Article II authority to oversee executive department functions\u2014a week is sufficient to ensure no intrusion on the President\u2019s constitutional authority,\u201d she said.",
      "Also, ICE has seen a surge in assaults, disruptions and obstructions to law enforcement so any requests for tours of ICE processing centers and field offices must be approved by Secretary Noem, McLaughlin said.",
      "When Rep. Veronica Escobar tried to visit the El Paso center on July 9, ICE told her that they could not accommodate her attendance and said it is \u201cnow requiring requests to be made seven calendar days in advance,\u201d the lawsuit said. When the Democrat arrived at the center, she was denied entry.",

      "While ICE is demanding a week's notice for detention center visits, it said it's prohibiting members of Congress from inspecting ICE field offices, where some detainees are being held.",
      "When Rep. Daniel Goldman, D-New York, tried to tour the ICE New York Field Office in June, he was told his oversight authority doesn't apply there, because it's not a \"detention facility.\" When Goldman went to the office, the deputy director barred his entry, but confirmed that people were being held overnight, sometimes for several days, but the facility did not have beds or showers.",
      "Reps. Joe Neguse, D-Colorado; Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi; and Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, made a similar attempt to enter the ICE Washington Field Office in Chantilly, Virgini,a on July 21 after learning that people were being detained there. But they also were turned away without being able to view the conditions at the site.",
      "The other House members who are fighting for ICE access include: California Democratic Representatives Norma Torres, Raul Ruiz, Jimmy Gomez, Jose Luis Correa and Robert Garcia. Also suing is Adriano Espaillat, D-New York.",

      "Wednesday marks 50 years since the iron-fisted former Teamsters union boss disappeared from a restaurant about 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of the city. Presumed dead long before being legally declared deceased in 1982, Hoffa's remains were not found beneath the concrete shed floor in Roseville in 2012.",
      "Nor were they uncovered eight years earlier, below floorboards in a Detroit house. Neither were they found in 2013 at a horse farm miles northwest of the city.",
      "In 2013, digging equipment found mostly dirt as authorities excavated a field in Oakland Township, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Detroit. And no signs of Hoffa were found in 2022 during a search of land beneath the Pulaski Skyway in New Jersey.",
      "Hoffa, the son of a coal miner who died when he was 7, was born in Brazil, Indiana, but moved with his mother to Detroit while still a boy. He quit school at 14 and went to work, landing a job on a grocery warehouse loading dock.",
      "In 1932, Hoffa led a workers\u2019 strike over poor labor conditions and unfair treatment of workers by the store, according to a post about him on the International Brotherhood of Teamsters website.",
      "He joined the union a year later and became a business agent for Local 299 in Detroit, the website said.",
      "Hoffa was elected the local's president in 1937 and would become a union organizer. He often found himself on the other end of the law. In 1937, he was convicted of assault and battery. In 1940, he pleaded no contest to charges of conspiring with unionized waste-paper companies to prevent non-union competitors from selling their products. Seven years later, he was arrested for attempted extortion. Each time, Hoffa only received fines.",
      "He continued to rise in the union's ranks. From 1957 to 1971, he served as the Teamsters general president.",

      "The Secretary of the Army has directed the U.S. Military Academy at West Point to review its hiring practices and rescind the appointment of a newly announced hire who led the nation's cybersecurity agency under President Joe Biden",
      "NEW YORK -- The Secretary of the Army on Wednesday directed the U.S. Military Academy at West Point to review its hiring practices, bar outside groups from choosing employees and remove a newly announced hire who led the nation\u2019s cybersecurity agency under President Joe Biden.",
      "The directive, shared on the social platform X by Secretary Dan Driscoll, came just a day after Jen Easterly was announced as the Robert F. McDermott Distinguished Chair in West Point\u2019s social sciences department.",
      "It demonstrated how vigorously President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has sought to wield control over the ideology and leadership of higher education and the military during the president\u2019s second term.",
      "It also highlighted how deeply concerns about censorship have seeped into the Republican Party and the Trump administration. As the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, Easterly faced harsh criticism from Republicans who argued that her work to counter misinformation about elections and the COVID-19 pandemic amounted to censorship.",
      "CISA secures the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, including the nation\u2019s dams, banks and nuclear power plants. It also secures voting systems \u2014 work that became controversial as Trump has made false claims to create doubt about the integrity of elections in recent years.",
      "Easterly has denied claims that her agency censored anyone and said last fall that \u201callegations against CISA are riddled with factual inaccuracies.\u201d She said in January she hopes the agency will be allowed to continue its election-related work despite \u201ccontentiousness\u201d around that part of its mission.",
      "Driscoll's directive came after far-right activist Laura Loomer posted about Easterly\u2019s new role on X, saying \u201cBiden holdovers\u201d at the Defense Department were \u201cundermining\u201d Trump\u2019s administration. Loomer has frequently urged Trump\u2019s administration to purge staffers she deems insufficiently loyal to his agenda, and on multiple occasions, they have been fired.",

      "The federal government distributed $350 billion to state, local, territorial and tribal governments as part of the American Rescue Plan approved by Congress and President Joe Biden in 2021. More than 30,000 governments, from the largest state to the tiniest town, were to get a share.",
      "Governments had until the end of 2024 to obligate the money for specific projects and were supposed to file either quarterly or annual progress reports, depending on their population and how much money they received. Most complied. But as of January, about 1,000 mostly smaller governments had failed to file any reports with the Treasury detailing how they used a total of $139 million, according to an analysis by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.",

      "As of June 24, a total of 740 local governments subsequently filed reports and will no longer be subject to repaying their funds, the Treasury said in a letter attached to the GAO report. Thirteen governments returned their funds to the Treasury. But that still left 235 local governments that had never filed a report nor returned their pandemic relief funds.",
      "The GAO told The Associated Press it does not have list of the specific governments that haven't complied with the reporting requirements. The Treasury has not responded to an AP request for a list of the 13 governments that returned their funds and those that still haven't reported how they used it.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is pushing an initiative for millions of Americans to upload personal health data and medical records on new apps and systems run by private tech companies, promising that will make it easier to access health records and monitor wellness.",
      "Leaders from more than 60 companies, including major tech companies such as Google and Amazon, as well as prominent hospital systems like the Cleveland Clinic, will convene at the White House on Wednesday afternoon to discuss what the administration is calling a \u201cdigital health ecosystem.\" The new system will focus on diabetes and weight management, conversational artificial intelligence that helps patients, and digital tools such as QR codes and apps that register patients for check-ins or track medications.",
      "The initiative, spearheaded by an administration that has already freely shared highly personal data about Americans in ways that have tested legal bounds, could put patients' desires for more convenience at their doctor\u2019s office on a collision course with their expectations that their medical information be kept private.",
      "\u201cThere are enormous ethical and legal concerns,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in public health. \u201cPatients across America should be very worried that their medical records are going to be used in ways that harm them and their families.\u201d",
      "Officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in charge of maintaining the system, have said patients will need to opt in for the sharing of their medical records and data, which will be kept secure.",
      "Officials say patients will benefit from a system that lets them quickly call up their own records without the hallmark difficulties, such as requiring the use of fax machines to share documents, that have prevented them from doing so in the past.",
      "\u201cWe have the tools and information available now to empower patients to improve their outcomes and their healthcare experience,\u201d Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for CMS, said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Once the system is set up, popular weight loss and fitness subscription service Noom, which has signed onto the initiative, will be able to pull medical records, including labs or tests, of its users into its AI-driven analysis of what might help users lose weight, CEO Geoff Cook told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cRight now you have a lot of siloed data,\u201d Cook said.",
      "Patients who travel across the country for treatment at the Cleveland Clinic often have a hard time obtaining all their medical records from various providers, said the hospital system's CEO, Tomislav Mihaljevic. He said the new system would eliminate that barrier, which sometimes delays treatment or prevents doctors from making an accurate diagnosis because they do not have a full view of a patient's medical history.",
      "Having seamless access to health app data, such as what patients are eating or how much they are exercising, will also help doctors manage obesity and other chronic diseases, Mihaljevic said.",

      "Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is set to headline a major Republican event in South Carolina",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is set to headline the latest iteration of an event previously billed as the largest annual gathering of Republicans in South Carolina, a state traditionally key to picking the GOP's presidential nominees, and one in which she already has deep relationships.",
      "Rep. Sheri Biggs of South Carolina\u2019s 3rd District told The Associated Press that Sanders would be the featured speaker at her Salute to Liberty, slated to take place Aug. 18 in Anderson. In an interview last week, Biggs said she felt the governor \u201crepresents what the people in the 3rd District believe in, our morals, just down-to-earth hardworking people that love the Lord and want to live in peace with their families and uphold our conservative values.\u201d",
      "Historically a catalyst for Republican White House hopefuls, the South Carolina venue provides Sanders a chance to introduce herself to a large number \u2014 typically around 2,000 \u2014 of party activists. It\u2019s also a crowd with which President Donald Trump \u2014 whom she served as press secretary during his first administration \u2014 remains popular.",
      "Sanders, whose name comes up among potential 2028 presidential contenders, has been making trips to South Carolina since her father, former Arkansas governor and current U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, sought the 2008 GOP nomination. She's recently been in other early-voting states herself, including a speech earlier this month at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, an annual event held by a conservative Christian group.",
      "For years, the South Carolina occasion was billed as Rep. Jeff Duncan's Faith & Freedom BBQ, a fundraiser benefiting his reelection campaign. In a conservative-rich area, it became a showcase for future White House contenders, including then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sens. Ted Cruz, Tim Scott and Marco Rubio, and former U.N. Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.",
      "The barbecue was upended just weeks after the 2023 event, when Duncan's wife filed for divorce, saying the congressman left her, was having a sexual relationship with a lobbyist and had been unfaithful before during their 35-year marriage. Last year, Duncan opted not to seek reelection to an eighth term, following the 2023 diminishment of his reputation for conservative family values.",
      "In her first political run, Biggs \u2014 a nurse practitioner and Air National Guard officer \u2014 defeated a Trump-backed primary opponent last year. Mark Burns, a Black pastor who has been by Trump\u2019s side for nearly a decade, had unsuccessfully run for Congress twice before.",

      "Biggs easily won the general election in the district, which has been in GOP hands since Republican Lindsey Graham, who is now seeking his fifth U.S. Senate term, won it in 1994. Six months into her first term, Biggs said that she knew she wanted a district-unifying event of her own, as well as one that could continue to act as a showcase for potential GOP presidential candidates seeking to get to know its voters.",
      "\u201cI do want people to know that I'm here to serve this district, and that means making myself available and being out front and accessible to our voters, and hearing their needs,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm here to serve the district, and that doesn't just mean everybody who voted for me.\u201d",
      "In some ways, Biggs\u2019 event will be familiar. It\u2019s being held in the same venue as Duncan\u2019s barbecue, a civics center in Anderson, and there will still be $1 tickets for law enforcement officers and first responders. As for the menu, Biggs said she\u2019ll be shifting away from the buffet line of barbecue, baked beans and rolls, with a catered, \u201cmore of a sit-down type of dinner.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not so much that I don\u2019t think the barbecue was great, I just want my own identity,\u201d Biggs said. \u201cI want people to realize that it\u2019s a new ballgame, and I want to move forward on my own accord.\u201d",

      "Officials say a 28-year-old Arkansas man has been arrested in the killings of a married couple in front of their children at Devil\u2019s Den State Park over the weekend",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Arkansas police on Wednesday charged a 28-year-old man in the killing of a married couple who were hiking with their children at Devil\u2019s Den State Park, finding him in a nearby town after a five-day search and public pleas for trailgoers to look through their photos.",
      "State Police arrested Andrew James McGann, of Springdale, at a barbershop in the town, said Col. Stacie Rhoads, commander of the department's criminal investigation division. McGann was charged with two counts of capital murder. Police would not say what the motive was.",
      "McGann had recently moved to the area and was working at a school, according to authorities, though they did say not in what job.",
      "A lawyer couldn't be located for McGann, and a message was left for a number listed for him. He was being held in the Washington County jail Wednesday. It was not immediately clear when his first court appearance was.",
      "\u201cIf you commit a violent, senseless act here in our state, our law enforcement will hunt you down and bring you to justice, because that\u2019s what the people of Arkansas frankly deserve,\u201d Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said a news conference Wednesday night.",
      "Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, were found dead Saturday on a walking trail at Devil\u2019s Den. Their daughters, who are 7 and 9, were not hurt and are being cared for by family members, authorities have said.",
      "Police had released a composite sketch and photo of a person of interest they were searching for in the attack. Along with the drawing, police released a statement saying the suspect \u201clikely sustained an injury while attacking the couple.\u201d It did not go into further detail.",
      "The State Police have released few details, including how the couple was killed. The FBI has said its Little Rock field office is assisting in the investigation. The head of the State Police praised the cooperation among law enforcement on catching McGann.",
      "\u201cBecause of their hard work and investigative skill, we were able to take a monster off the streets, and bring relief to those two precious girls, and the rest of our citizens,\u201d Col. Mike Hagar said.",
      "Rhoads said the public's help and video footage they received was instrumental in capturing McGann. Tips came in from as far away as Washington state, she said.",
      "\u201cIt was overwhelming,\u201d she said.",
      "Clinton and Cristen Brink had just moved from South Dakota to the small city of Prairie Grove in northwest Arkansas. Their water had been connected less than two weeks ago, Mayor David Faulk said.",

      "A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin for malicious prosecution and civil rights violations in the 2021 fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of the Western movie \"Rust.\"",
      "The judge in a ruling made public Wednesday dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of any significant action with the claim, which was filed in state district court earlier this year. Baldwin's attorneys will have 30 days to file a motion seeking reinstatement.",
      "Luke Nikas, Baldwin's lead attorney, told The Associated Press in an email that the dismissal amounted to a nonevent since his team has been waiting to prosecute the case.",
      "\"We have been in good-faith settlement discussions with the parties to the lawsuit and will be refiling promptly if those discussions are not promptly and favorably resolved,\" he said.",
      "Defendants include special prosecutor Kari Morrissey and Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, along with three investigators from the Santa Fe County sheriff's office and the county board of commissioners.",
      "A charge of involuntary manslaughter against Baldwin was dismissed at trial last year on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense. The trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff's office months earlier by a man who said it could be related to the killing of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.",
      "The allegations in Baldwin's tort claim include defamation, with his attorneys saying that prosecutors and investigators targeted the actor and coproducer for professional or political gain.",
      "Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during a rehearsal for the movie \"Rust\" in October 2021 at a film-set ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when it discharged, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the revolver fired.",
      "The actor recently spoke to The Associated Press at San Diego's Comic-Con International, saying he couldn't believe what happened that day in court as the trial came to an abrupt end, and that his life over the last year has been far better than the few years that preceded it.",
      "Still, Baldwin and other producers of \"Rust\" are being sued in New Mexico state court by the parents and younger sister of Hutchins. Court records show a deposition for Baldwin in that case was put off in May and has yet to be rescheduled.",

    "published": "Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:53:42 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

    "summary": "The Oscar-nominated star of \"The English Patient\" and \"Slow Horses\" has directed and co-written her first film: the heartfelt \"My Mother's Wedding,\" about three daughters who come together to attend their mom's third nuptials \u2013 a story inspired by Thomas' own childhood losses.",
    "story": [
      "She may be Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, but you're just as likely to find her living in Paris as you might in London. \"My blood is English, but my culture is French,\" she said.",
      "There is a duality about her. She can be as heartwarming in English (\"Darkest Hour\") as she can be heartwrenching in French (\"I've Loved You So Long\"). Many of her foreign films have been showcased at the Cine Lumiere, a French art house in London. \"A little slice of Paris,\" she said.",
      "It's convenient, now that she's back in London, playing the deputy director of MI5 in the Apple TV+ series \"Slow Horses.\"",
      "A chilly, stiff upper-lip has often been a calling card for Thomas \u2013 too stiff, she admits, early on: \"I think it was Sydney Pollock \u2013 or it might have been Robert Redford, take your pick,\" she laughed. \"One of them said to me, 'You know, you have to be generous. Forget what you're trying to defend. Forget trying to hide. Be more generous.' And I'm not sure I really understood what he meant by that. He just planted a seed, and then I was able to kind of unzip a bit more.\"",
      "And she about to unzip even more, creatively digging into something intensely personal in her past. She said, \"When I was five, my father was killed, and my mother remarried. And tragically, he was killed five years later. And I know that a lot of the time when I was a younger woman, I had this feeling of something missing, this piece of my puzzle missing having grown up with only one parent.\"",
      "Both had been pilots in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm; both were lost in remarkably similar training accidents; and both left a hole that had her climbing out into her imagination. When she was a little girl she wrote and illustrated stories: \"A mommy and a daddy and two children, just doing ordinary things, like going away on holiday and things like that\" \u2013 a family experience she never knew.",
      "The memories of her dad were incomplete, fuzzy, like sketches she played out in her head. But those images became the seeds for what grew into a screenplay, and then came to life as the first movie she's ever directed: \"My Mother's Wedding.\"",
      "It garnered an all-star cast: Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller and Emily Beecham play Thomas' daughters who are each struggling in different ways  with the loss of a father or stepfather, just as their mother prepares to marry again.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"My Mother's Wedding\" click on the video player below:",
      "Thomas has already done movie weddings, of course, as in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" Early on, she had a sarcastic confidence about her. She didn't have the most lines in that 1994 film, but in brevity she was brilliant:",
      "That demeanor might have been a surprise to those who knew her when she was bouncing around Royal Naval bases, a bit of a wallflower as a child, even into adulthood. \"I was excruciatingly shy,\" she said. \"I don't know when it changed, to be honest.\"",
      "She's hardly shy anymore, if her character in \"Fleabag\" is any indication. Perhaps it's fitting she was discovered by another admittedly shy success story, Prince. You'd think that would make her a pretty cool mom (she has three children with her first husband), but it turns out \u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I hadn't watched it with them, but as I was leaving my teenage children alone one evening, and they were having pizza and a friend 'round, I said, 'Watch \"Under the Cherry Moon,\" it's on the telly! Come on, it'll be fun!' And when I got back, they weren't actually very polite about it.\"",
      "She has more than made up for it, later starring opposite Robert Redford (\"The Horse Whisperer\"), Harrison Ford (\"Random Hearts\"), and Tom Cruise (\"Mission: Impossible\").",
      "\"I'm so proud to be in 'Mission: Impossible,' I cannot even get over it!\" she said. \"I'm in this thing, which is this enormous monster, and you know, these kids, they have no idea about 'Gosford Park.' They have no idea about 'Four Weddings,' but they've all seen 'Mission: Impossible'! And they have no idea I speak French or do all these other kind of slightly murkier films in France, you know?\"",
      "And then, of course, there was \"The English Patient,\" which earned her an Academy Award nomination for best actress. \"It's quite moving actually, when you see yourself at sort of 30 acting your socks off,\" she said.",
      "Another place she acted her socks off is at the Royal Court Theatre, where she won an Olivier Award for her performance in \"The Seagull,\" a role she later took to Broadway. \"New York audiences, when they are enjoying themselves, I mean it's electric \u2013 you can really, really feel it,\" she said.",
      "And London audiences? \"We are much more kind of passive, perhaps. Reserved. Of course we are!\" she laughed.",
      "But even while talking at the Royal Court, she found herself thinking about her film. As intimate as the stage may be, for her, \"My Mother's Wedding\" is more so. \"I love working on stage, as you can probably tell. I really, really love it. But the joy and satisfaction and exhaustion that comes from filmmaking when you are being a director, that is not far off. Pretty good. It's just extraordinary.\"",
      "At 65, and now a grandmother, she's working as hard as ever, not taking a lot of time to smell the roses per se, but she'll surely stop for someone who has a kind word or two: \"A lady came up to me the other day and said, 'I know you hate this, but I just wanted to say...' \u00a0and I said, 'I don't hate this at all! Keep it coming!'\"",

    "summary": "It took the art world decades to recognize Louise Nevelson, whose monochromatic and immersive sculptures, often incorporating found objects, verged on the monumental.",
    "story": [
      "Louise Nevelson's artwork looks right at home at the Whitney Museum of American Art, mingling with the skyscrapers of Manhattan. She found inspiration in the city as early as the 1920s, yet it would take the art world decades to recognize her and her iconic sculptures.",
      "\"She was given her first respective at the Whitney in 1967,\" said Maria Nevelson, the artist's granddaughter, who runs the Louise Nevelson Foundation. \"I was seven years old. And there was a line of people all the way around the block, up to the front door. I really did get chills. It was the first time I responded to artwork in general, and to my grandmother's artwork.\"",
      "Nearly six decades later, the Whitney is holding a new Nevelson exhibition, which is open until August 10.",
      "Asked what Louise was like as a grandmother, Maria laughed: \"Oh, she was intimidating and unconventional. What comes to mind first is her atmospheric dressing. Anything could have been pulled into this assemblage and this layering of rich brocades and silks.\"",
      "That fancy wardrobe didn't stop Nevelson from getting her hands dirty: \"She'd dumpster dive, she'd get into the garbage can, she'd pull out filthy pieces of wood, and we'd have to take 'em home,\" said Maria. \"I would say the streets of New York weren't paved with gold for her; it was paved with garbage. And she loved it!\"",
      "Nevelson's attraction to wood may have grown from her family tree \u2013 her family owned lumber yards in present-day Ukraine, where she was born in 1899. Louise was a young girl who spoke no English when her father decided to move the family to Rockland, Maine.",
      "\"It was a bustling seaport town,\" said Maria. \"They got off the train and, she said, rednecks threw mud at them. And she said, 'I knew I was a Jew, I knew I was different.' She was about five, six years old then. That's her greeting to America.\"",
      "Undaunted, Nevelson learned English, and at age nine, announced she was going to be a sculptor.",
      "\"She knew always what she wanted to be and do, and she pursued it fiercely,\" said Brooke Minto, executive director and CEO of the Columbus Museum of Art, where Nevelson's work is also currently on display. \"It was a decade's long journey, and she just kept at it.\"",
      "Nevelson would choose a monochromatic palette to unify her materials. Minto said, \"She really understood that she could create an all-over, immersive experience in her sculpture by pairing them down to a single color. It's this wonderful accumulation of very simple and humble objects into something that's quite monumental and immediately historical.\"",
      "According to Maria Nevelson, Louise did her best work when she was in her 70s and 80s, \"right up to when she passed away at 88.\"",
      "In 1979, Charles Osgood, of \"Sunday Morning,\" spoke to Louise when she was 79 years old and, arguably, at the height of her career. The artist remarked, \"You see, dear, if you are doing your creative work, you don't have age or time as such, and consequently you're not caught in it. So, you go on.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 11:52:40 -0400",
    "summary": "A bipartisan program in Michigan aims to address the high costs of parenting by giving mothers thousands of dollars in cash with no strings attached.",
    "story": [
      "A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers, made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \"baby parade.\"",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump's administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\"There's all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\" said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don't have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies' lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician, associate dean for public health at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breastfeeding supplies and baby clothes, but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities\u00a0near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She's heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade on Friday.",
      "\"For so long, moms have been vilified and not supported,\" Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",
      "\"So this time around, I didn't have to stress about anything. I just had to worry about my baby,\" she said.",
      "Celeste Lord-Timlin, a Flint resident and program participant, attended the baby parade with her husband and 13-month-old daughter by her side. She said the deposits helped her pay for graduate school while she was pregnant.",
      "\"It allowed us to really enjoy being new parents,\" she said.",
      "The program relies heavily on philanthropic donations, but Hanna's long-term goal is for the government to be the main provider.",
      "\"I see philanthropy as the doula of this program; they are helping birth it,\" she said. \"They are helping us prove that this is possible.\"",
      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. But with a divided Legislature only able to pass six bills total this year, it's unlikely the program will yet expand statewide soon.",
      "Even Damoose, among the program's top backers, said he doesn't think Michigan can afford statewide expansion yet. But the lawmaker who represents parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan does want to keep growing it.",
      "For fellow Republicans who oppose abortion as he does, the approach is a \"no-brainer\" way to help pregnant women, Damoose said.",
      "\"We've been accused for years and years, and not without cause, of being pro-birth, but not pro-life,\" he said. \"And this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.\"",
      "A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate.",
      "But a recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that most Americans want the government to focus on the high costs of child care, not just the number of babies being born here.",
      "Under Trump's tax and spending bill that Congress passed in July, the child tax credit is boosted from $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. But millions of families at lower income levels will not get the full credit.",
      "The bill will also create a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "That's not available until children grow up and is more focused on building wealth rather than immediate relief, Hanna said.",
      "\"We don't have that social infrastructure to invest in our families,\" Hanna said. \"No wonder people aren't having children and our birth rates are going down.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 \"baby bonuses,\" a policy similar to Rx Kids.",
      "Critics have rightly pointed out that it doesn't come close to covering the cost of child care or other expenses. Defenders of a cash-in-hand approach, though, say any amount can help in those critical early months.",
      "\"I think it's part of a new narrative or the rekindling of an old narrative where we start to celebrate children and families,\" said Damoose.",

      "\"The Fed got validation this morning with inflation coming in a little higher than expected,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X in an emailed comment. \"There is some evidence of tariff impact in the inflation data, but it remains modest. Health care, housing and utilities continue to be key sources in driving inflation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Thursday is considering\u00a0President Trump's use of an emergency powers law to impose sweeping tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is hearing arguments in the Trump administration's appeal of a ruling from a trade-focused lower court that found the president did not have the authority to hit foreign nations with 10% tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.",
      "While a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked the sweeping duties that the president assessed on most countries, the Federal Circuit temporarily reinstated the tariffs while it considers the dispute.",
      "The legal fights before the appeals court were brought by a group of 12 states and five small businesses, and their cases are a major test of the centerpiece of Mr. Trump's economic agenda. The Federal Circuit's decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court, though a ruling in favor of Mr. Trump from the conservative court is far from certain.",
      "The president pointed to the hearing on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning, saying, \"To all of my great lawyers who have fought so hard to save our Country, good luck in America's big case today. If our Country was not able to protect itself by using TARIFFS AGAINST TARIFFS, WE WOULD BE \"DEAD,\" WITH NO CHANCE OF SURVIVAL OR SUCCESS. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "The president has relied on tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he said are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Since Mr. Trump announced his sprawling tariff regime on April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" the administration has said it reached trade deals with five Asian countries, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Many economists argue tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth.",
      "The tariffs announced in early April set a 10% baseline tariff on nearly every country, and reciprocal tariffs above the 10% rate on dozens of trading partners. While the reciprocal levies were initially supposed to take effect April 9, Mr. Trump issued a 90-day pause and lowered the rate for countries subject to the higher tariffs to 10%. Some of those higher\u00a0reciprocal duties are set to go back into place Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump has since said that he would increase the blanket tariff rate for nations that don't enter into trade deals with the U.S. to \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range.\"",
      "Only the so-called Liberation Day tariffs, and higher levies on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican imports that the president said were to combat the trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S., are at issue in the cases before the Federal Circuit.",
      "No president before Mr. Trump had invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs, and the Constitution vests the power to assess levies in Congress. IEEPA does not include any references to tariffs or duties, and it has typically been used by presidents to impose economic sanctions on foreign nations.",
      "Under IEEPA, the president can exercise the law's authority in instances involving \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security or the economy for which \"a national emergency has been declared.\"",
      "In rolling out his tariffs, Mr. Trump claimed that trade deficits and the flow of illicit drugs across U.S. borders constituted national emergencies and were threats to national security and the economy.",
      "But the challengers to his tariffs argue that trade deficits have persisted for 50 years, and they warned that if allowed, the president would have limitless power to set tariffs of any amount against any product.",
      "\"By the government's telling, IEEPA empowers the president to impose whatever tariffs he chooses any time he finds (in his assertedly unreviewable discretion) that a trade deficit is creating significant national problems,\" lawyers for the small businesses wrote in a filing.",
      "They also argued that a different law, a provision of the Trade Act of 1974, governs the president's imposition of tariffs in response to trade deficits, but caps the duties at 15% and limits their duration to five months.",
      "In addition to claiming that IEEPA does not authorize Mr. Trump's tariffs, lawyers for the small businesses and states argue that they violate the major questions and nondelegation doctrines, legal principles that have in recent years been raised by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "Under the major questions doctrine, an agency that seeks to decide an issue of major political or economic significance must have clear authorization from Congress. And under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress cannot delegate its legislative power to executive branch agencies unless it sets out an \"intelligible\" and judicially enforceable principle to guide an agency.",
      "\"Congress alone has constitutional authority to impose tariffs,\" lawyers for the states wrote in a filing. \"But under President Trump's reading of IEEPA, Congress gave him the authority to rewrite the tariff schedules at his whim.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended the tariffs and said they were imposed because the president believes they are needed to address \"grave threats\" to U.S. national security and the economy.",
      "\"President Trump has found that America's exploding trade deficit, the implications of that deficit for our economy and national security, and a fentanyl importation crisis that has claimed thousands of American lives constitute national emergencies,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They noted that Mr. Trump's plans for tariffs were a key component of his 2024 presidential campaign and said they've been successful at sparking negotiations on trade deals with U.S. partners.",
      "\"The CIT's injunction would, if affirmed, disrupt the Executive Branch's ongoing, sensitive diplomatic negotiations with virtually every major trading partner. And it would unilaterally deprive the United States of a powerful tool for combating systemic distortions in the global trading system, thus allowing other nations to continue to hold American exporters hostage to their unreasonable, discriminatory, and sometimes retaliatory trade policies,\" Justice Department lawyers argued.",

      "Most countries, including South Korea, have faced 10% tariffs since April, when Mr. Trump delayed a set of higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days to buy his administration time to negotiate. Then this month, the president sent letters to South Korea and around two dozen other trading partners telling them to expect higher tariffs starting Friday, Aug. 1, unless deals are reached.",

      "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That's higher than the 2% pace forecast for the April-to-June period, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The number represents a turnaround from the first three months of 2025, when GDP fell 0.5%, the worst quarterly performance for the economy since early 2022. The new data also shows consumers increased spending since the last quarter, with growth of 1.4%, up from 0.5% from January to March. The number is still down significantly from 4% in the\u00a0final\u00a0quarter of 2024.",
      "When it comes to assessing the strength of the economy, a more revealing number tucked into the GDP report is what is known as \"final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which excludes government spending, inventories and net exports. That number rose at only a 1.2% annual rate from April to May \u2014 the weakest since late 2022 and a sign that demand is weakening.",
      "What the numbers mean",
      "GDP data offers a broad yardstick for measuring the overall health of the economy, with periods of fast growth typically coinciding with robust consumer spending, ample job growth and healthy corporate profits. This year, however, experts say the Trump administration's tariffs on U.S. economic partners have complicated the picture.",
      "\"As was the case in Q1, volatile trade flows are skewing the GDP performance (the 3% growth primarily reflects a decrease in imports and an acceleration in consumer spending that were partially offset by a downturn in investment),\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment research firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investor advisory firm Capital Economics, said in a note that the surge in GDP \"overstates the economy's underlying strength\" because the growth spurt in the second quarter was largely driven by a 30% decline in imports after U.S. tariffs took effect.",
      "GDP slumped in the first quarter, falling 0.5% from January to March, largely due to a surge in U.S. imports as consumers and businesses rushed to buy goods from abroad before stepped-up tariffs took effect.",
      "In calculating GDP, imports are seen as reducing growth because they reflect purchases from overseas, rather than goods and services produced in the U.S. By contrast, exports boost a country's GDP because they reflect domestic goods and services that were sold abroad.",
      "The upshot: Through the first half of 2025, the economy grew at an average rate of 1.25%. That's markedly slower than the pace of growth in 2024, when GDP for the full year rose 2.8%, noted Dean Baker, a senior economist at Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "Where the economy is headed",
      "Although the 3% GDP rate in Wednesday's report may be skewed by the president's trade policies, experts say the overall economy remains solid and shows no signs of crumbling.",
      "\"Beneath the topline figure, the economy is switching to a lower gear but not going in reverse,\" Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Yaros added that consumers are slowing \u2014 but not switching off \u2014 their spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds economic activity.",
      "Still, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco notes that economic activity is slowing as inflationary pressures rise \u2014 a trend likely to persist throughout the summer. He predicts real GDP growth to slow to a rate of 0.9% year over year by the fourth quarter.",
      "Another indicator of the health of the economy will come Wednesday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announces its rate decision. The central bank is again expected to hold rates steady. The Labor Department is also scheduled to release its monthly jobs report on Friday, offering a snapshot of how the labor market is faring.",

      "Zuckerberg's vision of the future also involves something else: glasses. Meta has teamed up with Ray Ban and other eyewear makers to develop AI glasses that let wearers make phone calls, take photos and handle other tasks.",
      "\"I think personal devices like glasses that can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our main computing devices,\" he said in a social media\u00a0video on X discussing the new initiative.",

That said, as the market has pushed to recent highs of late, today Americans who say their finances are impacted by the market are also more likely to say those finances are good. They also give better ratings to the national economy.",

      "President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending what's known as a de minimis exemption allowing low-value parcels that are shipped to the United States to avoid tariffs.",
      "The White House said it's closing what it called a \"catastrophic loophole\" that shippers use to \"evade tariffs and funnel deadly synthetic opioids or below-market products\" into the U.S. The order goes into effect Aug. 29.",
      "The exemption had applied to parcels valued at $800 or less, and allowed overseas retailers to ship inexpensive goods to consumers in the U.S. tax-free.",
      "\"President Trump is putting an end to the proliferation of shippers worldwide that, among other things, deceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties, inspection, and U.S. law,\" the White House said in a fact sheet outlining the new policy.",
      "Mr. Trump in May ended the de minimis loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong, which had allowed retailers like Shein and Temu to ship ultra low-cost apparel and other goods to U.S.-based consumers at bargain-basement prices. Shipments from China and Hong Kong account for most de minimis shipments to the U.S. according to the White House.",
      "The de minimis provision, which was added to the Tariff Act of 1930 several years after that law's passage, was intended to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting modest import duties on low-cost goods.",

    "story": [
      "More high-income Americans around the U.S. are falling behind on their credit cards and auto loans, a sign that even people earning more than six figures are more likely to struggle financially amid shifts in the economy.",
      "Delinquencies across all loan products for households earning more than $150,000 have more than doubled since 2023. That compares with a 60% increase in delinquencies during that time for households earning between $45,000 and $150,000, and a 22% increase for people earning less than $45,000, according to data from credit-scoring company VantageScore.",
      "High-income households had weathered the post-pandemic years better than lower-earning Americans because they had more of a cushion to absorb soaring inflation and other shocks, according to VantageScore chief economist Rikard Bandebo.",
      "But these Americans are now feeling the impact of several economic changes, including a weaker job market for white-collar workers and higher housing costs, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For white-collar workers, it's probably tougher than it has been,\" Bandebo said. \"This trend has been consistent and seems to be continuing \u2014 it's not abetting.\"",
      "About 38% of all new jobs created in the five years before the pandemic paid above-average wages, VantageScore's data shows. But this year that share has fallen to 7%, signaling that companies are creating fewer white-collar positions. That poses a challenge to higher-income Americans who suffer a job loss because it may be tougher to find new employment than in previous years.",
      "\"This group is being hit from a number of different aspects, which is making it harder for them to make ends meet,\" Bandebo said.",
      "To be sure, the overall rate of loan delinquencies in the U.S. remains higher for low- and middle-income consumers than for high-income earners, according to VantageScore. For instance, the delinquency rate for households earning at least $150,000 now stands at about 0.34%, versus 1.75% for low-income households. But the rise in delinquencies has accelerated faster for higher-income households than for other groups, the firm's data shows.",
      "A worrying sign?",
      "A key question for the U.S. is whether the financial challenges facing high-income Americans could portend a broader economic downturn. Notably, consumption by wealthier Americans now contributes about half of all consumer spending, the main engine for economic growth. By comparison, in 1990 spending by Americans higher up the economic ladder accounted for about one-third of all spending.",
      "At the same time, low- and middle-income households are also facing stiffer financial headwinds with about six in 10 middle-income consumers saying they're financially stressed, according to a recent survey from financial services company Primerica.",
      "More than one-third of middle-income households, or those earning between $30,000 to $130,000, say they've increased their credit card usage, the survey found.",
      "Retailers and major consumer brands have also been warning that some consumers are cutting back or are more cautious in their purchases.",
      "Shoppers are \"looking for value, either in smaller packs and promotions or in larger pack sizes in the club channel and online,\" Procter & Gamble Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten said on an earnings conference call Tuesday. \"That's the behavior we've been outlined before, but it's not stopped. It continued.\"",
      "Widespread consumer frustration with high prices is thought to have boosted President Trump during the 2024 electoral campaign against Joe Biden, when Mr. Trump vowed to end\u00a0the \"inflation nightmare.\" So far, inflation has remained relatively muted in 2025, although June's 2.7% annualized rate remains higher than the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% rate.",
      "Yet more consumers are now expressing frustration with the Trump administration's economic policies, according to a new CBS News poll that found nearly 64% of Americans now disapprove of how the president is handling inflation. The survey was conducted from July 16-18 and polled 2,343 adults.",
      "As for Americans who are struggling to keep up with credit-card debt and auto loans, they aren't likely to see relief anytime soon. Although Mr. Trump has been pushing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, economists think the central bank is very likely to stand pat when officials announce their latest policy move on Wednesday.",

      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates today?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted.\u00a0On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said second-quarter GDP rose at an annual rate of 3%, far outpacing the forecast for 2% growth.",
      "The threat from tariffs as well as stronger-than-expected GDP data means \"the Fed is all but certain to keep rates unchanged again this week, with futures markets pricing in effectively no chance of a cut,\" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, in an email.",
      "The Fed is likely to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

      "Indeed and Glassdoor, the job search and employee review firms, are slashing a total of roughly 1,300 jobs as their parent company, Japan's Recruit Holdings, embraces artificial intelligence.",
      "In an email to employees Thursday, Recruit Holdings CEO Hisayuki \"Deko\" Idekoba said that \"AI is changing the world\" and that the company must adapt accordingly. The layoffs represent about 6% of Recruit Holdings' HR technology workforce.",
      "The cuts will target the companies' research and development, as well as \"people & sustainability,\" teams in the U.S., but other areas and regions will also be affected, according to Recruit Holdings. The company will send notices to employees who are losing their jobs on Thursday.",
      "The move reflects Recruit Holdings' focus on using AI to transform how job-seekers look for work and how employers handle recruitment. As part of that effort, the company will fold Glassdoor operations into Indeed, the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong is stepping down.",
      "\"[W]hen we think about HR industry, which is $300 billion-plus industry, but it includes like 60% or 65% of human labor manual cost. It's very difficult to find that big industry with such a high percentage of human labor manual cost,\" Idekoba said in May at a JPMorgan Chase technology conference. \"And so what we believe is, basically, how can we simplify hiring with using AI and technology and data to reduce manual work. That's what we are focusing on.\"",
      "He added that about one-third of the company's new programming code is written by AI, and that he expects that figure to jump to one-half. \"It's going to be 50% pretty soon,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs come as corporate leaders tout AI's capabilities, while some experts warn that the technology could lead to job losses. Speaking in June at the the Aspen Ideas Festival, for example, Ford CEO Jim Farley said AI is likely to replace half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits.",
      "\"Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Thursday in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President\u00a0Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer.",
      "The lawsuit challenges President Trump's claim that he has authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to issue tariffs, a process that normally requires congressional approval.",
      "A victory by the plaintiffs could deal a blow to Mr. Trump as he seeks to negotiate trade deals with U.S. economic partners. The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday\u00a0announced a pact, easing tension over a brewing trade war. But the White House has yet to reach deals with other major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and China.",
      "What both sides are arguing",
      "The plaintiffs in the V.O.S. case argue that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he bypassed congressional approval and invoked IEEPA as the legal\u00a0basis\u00a0for imposing his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on April 2. Mr. Trump also drew on IEEPA in deploying a separate set of\u00a0tariffs\u00a0in February against Canada, Mexico and China that he said was aimed at stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl.",
      "\"This case is about more than high tariffs,\" Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonpartisan think tank, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's about whether a president can stretch a vague statute beyond recognition to sidestep Congress.\"",
      "IEEPA, among other things, gives the president authority to regulate transactions with foreign countries during national emergencies. However, no U.S. president has ever invoked IEEPA as a justification for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It's limited to emergencies where there is an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 and the trade deficit is hardly an emergency. It's been with us for basically 50 years\" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonpartisan public interest law representing the five businesses that have filed suit in the case.",
      "The White House has defended President Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs.",
      "\"The administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Why the case is important",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to eliminate trade imbalances with other countries, which he said constitutes an \"unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.\"",
      "But a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could have broader implications for trade policy, forcing Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval in imposing tariffs, Schwab said.",
      "\"If the court holds that the President's Liberation Day and fentanyl tariffs are unlawful, then he would not have authority to set those tariff rates, but still Congress could approve these deals \u2014 just like it did the NAFTA renegotiation in the first Trump term,\" Schwab said in an email.",
      "Presidents can draw on\u00a0other statutes, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to authorize the use of tariffs.",
      "How we got here",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade in May\u00a0struck down Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a three-judge panel ruling that the levies exceeded \"any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "At the time, the trade court said the 10% reciprocal tariffs are designed to deal with trade imbalances, which the judges said did not constitute an emergency under IEEPA. But a federal appeals court in May\u00a0blocked the trade court ruling\u00a0and reinstated the tariffs after the Trump administration appealed.",
      "After the trade court ruling in May, Desai\u00a0said\u00a0Mr. Trump would use \"all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "The case now heads to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where lawyers from both parties will present their arguments. The court could issue a decision as early as August, Schwab told CBS MoneyWatch.",

However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April said there is no longer a shortage of GLP-1s and\u00a0ordered compounding pharmacies to stop selling their copycat versions of the popular weight-loss drugs.",

      "Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly\u00a0declined\u00a0\u2014 and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly?",
      "For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024: While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change.",
      "About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group.",
      "Which young voters have dropped off?",
      "Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent.",
      "There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March, while it was not until April\u00a0\u2014 and the downturn in the U.S. stock market \u2014 that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.)",
      "CBS News polling over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days.",
      "A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question.",
      "On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations:",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",

      "And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",

      "Looking back and ahead ...",
      "Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many to the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded. His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office.",
      "Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again.",
      "Estimating small subgroups in polls",
      "To more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date.",
      "Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly \u2014 for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender.",
      "Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups.",
      "The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 11:40:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Union Pacific is seeking to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country.",
      "The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific's vast rail network in the West with Norfolk's rails that snake across 22 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia.",
      "The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage.",
      "The railroads argue a merger would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods nationwide by eliminating delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week.",
      "Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic.",
      "Pressure on remaining railroads",
      "If the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads \u2014 BNSF and CSX \u2014 will face tremendous pressure to merge to create a second transcontinental railroad so they can compete. The continent's two other major railroads \u2014 Canadian National and CPKC \u2014 may also get involved. The Canadian rails span all of that nation and feed into America. CPKC rails stretch south into Mexico",
      "Some big shippers like chemical plants in the Gulf may be wary of the deal due to fears of a monopoly that could would wield immense influence over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may be in favor if it means packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.",
      "Consumers could benefit if the transcontinental rail does reduce shipping rates and delivery times. Union Pacific said that combined, the railroads would improve delivery times.",
      "There's speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered.",
      "Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal.",
      "Union Pacific's stock fell nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern's stock dipped more than 3% to $277.40.",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has championed a merger, said lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh will all reach their destinations more seamlessly.",
      "\"It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,\" Vena told investors Tuesday.",
      "From 30 to 6",
      "U.S. railroads have already undergone extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads handle the majority of shipments nationwide.",
      "Western rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of CSX, to the east, if it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and the consummate dealmaker may want to swing for the fences one last time before stepping down as planned at the end of the year.",
      "Buffett recently threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC, but he rarely uses investment bankers anyway. Buffett reached an agreement to buy the parts of the BNSF railroad he didn't already own for $26.3 billion after a private meeting with its CEO more than a decade ago.",
      "Yet there's widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial rail industry.",
      "That's largely due to the aftermath of a consolidation in the U.S nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. It merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups in the East.",
      "\"We're committed to making sure that doesn't happen in this case,\" said Norfolk CEO Mark George. He added that the railroads will spend the next two years planning for a smooth integration before this deal might get approved.",
      "Just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad.",
      "There were compelling factors in that deal, however, that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America. The deal announced Tuesday would merge the nation's largest freight railroad, with the smallest.",
      "Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027. They predict that they would be able to eliminate $1 billion in costs annually, but Vena said that every union worker at both railroads should still have a job. The railroads also predict they would be able to boost revenue by at least $1.75 billion each year by winning more business from trucking companies and other railroads.",
      "On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That's up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs.",
      "Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.",

      "The automaker acknowledged that Mr. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports of autos and auto parts to the U.S. are hurting its business, particularly in North America. Stellantis builds its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brand vehicles in factories in Canada and Mexico, meaning they're subject to the new levies.",
      "While Mr. Trump's deal with the EU, calling for 15% tariffs across the board will make BMW and Mercedes-Benz vehicles more expensive for U.S. consumers, according to analysts. Stellantis is largely unaffected by the EU agreement.",

    "summary": "Trump says he's \"very disappointed\" with Vladimir Putin, and he's shortening the deadline for the Russian leader to agree a ceasefire with Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Monday a significant tightening of his deadline for Russia's Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. He said as he met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during his visit to Scotland that the 50-day deadline he announced earlier this month would be reduced to less than two weeks, citing a lack of progress in negotiations.",
      "Mr. Trump said as he headed in for his meeting with Starmer that he was \"very disappointed\" in Russia's leader over the ongoing bombing of Ukrainian cities, and that the deadline he gave Russia a couple weeks ago to agree to a truce would be reduced.",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier this month that if Russia failed to agree to a ceasefire within the 50-day timeframe, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that continue to do business with Russia. That would have meant a deal agreed by around the end of August.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday, as he sat down with Starmer, that he was \"going to make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days from today.\"",
      "\"There's no reason in waiting,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We just don't see any progress being made.\"",
      "\"I've spoken to President Putin a lot, I've gotten along with him very well,\" Mr. Trump said earlier, before sitting down with Starmer.",
      "But he lamented that the Russian leader, \"goes out and starts launching rockets into some city, like Kyiv, and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever, you have bodies lying all over the street.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was \"very disappointed in Putin,\" adding: \"I'm going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number, because I think I already know the answer what's going to happen.\"",
      "Russia rejected the deadline when the White House first announced it, calling it \"unacceptable.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Starmer is also touching on trade, though the U.S. and the U.K. already\u00a0agreed on a framework trade deal\u00a0last month. Starmer has made it clear he wants to keep pushing Mr. Trump to further ease tariffs on British steel and other imports as the details of the agreement are hashed out.",

      "Mr. Trump said the tariff rate for the EU's 27 member countries would be 15% for most imports, including vehicles. The EU, meanwhile, agreed to purchase U.S. military hardware, $750 billion of American energy, and to increase its collective investment in the U.S. by $600 billion.",

      "President Trump on Monday said the tariff rate for most countries that don't reach individual trade deals with the U.S. will be \"somewhere in the 15 to 20% range,\" different from the 15% to 50% range he floated only last week.",
      "Asked about a tariff rate \"for the world,\" as Mr. Trump put it, the president responded, \"I would say it'll be somewhere in the 15 to 20% range.\" The U.S. president made the remarks seated alongside U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland, as Mr. Trump visits his golf courses there and meets with European leaders.",
      "The U.S. and U.K. have already reached a trade agreement, and over the weekend, after meeting with European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the two leaders announced a trade deal between the U.S. and the EU.",
      "A Trump administration deadline of Aug. 1 for other countries to reach trade deals with the U.S. is rapidly approaching. Without an individual deal, Mr. Trump says most countries' products will see a flat tariff rate.",
      "\"I just want to be nice. I would say in the range of 15 to 20%,\" Mr. Trump said Monday, adding, \"probably one of those two numbers.\"",
      "But as recently as Wednesday, Mr. Trump floated a higher range, between 15% and 50%. Mr. Trump, who in April said the U.S. had 200 trade deals with other nations, has since said there are too many countries for individual trade deals with all of them and the U.S. will have \"simple\" tariffs for \"most\" countries.",
      "\"We have over 200 countries, people don't realize, that's a lot of, that's a lot of deals ... that would be too much for anybody,\" the president said Wednesday.",
      "Tariffs are paid for by the importing business to the U.S. government, and are not directly paid by a foreign company's government or company. Companies may pass along those higher expenses to U.S. consumers.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Sunday that the United States and the European Union had reached a trade deal after high-stakes meetings in Scotland, just days shy of Friday's White House deadline to enact tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump met with top European officials demanding fairer trade with the 27-member European Union at his golf course on the Scottish coast.",
      "\"It was a very interesting negotiation. I think it's going to be great for both parties,\" the president said.",
      "The deal, according to European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, is a 15% tariff across the board. She praised Mr. Trump, calling it a \"good deal\" and a \"huge deal\" that followed \"tough negotiations.\"",
      "\"We have a deal. We have a trade deal between the two largest economies in the world, and it's a big deal, it's a huge deal,\" she said. \"It will bring stability. It will bring predictability.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said, \"I think we both wanted to make a deal,\" and he predicted it would \"bring us closer together.\" Mr. Trump also said more than once to reporters Sunday that it was the \"biggest of all the deals.\"",
      "Von der Leyen said the negotiations addressed the EU's trade surplus with the U.S., and the deal would be carried out in a way that would enable trade to continue while jobs on \"both sides of the Atlantic\" would be rebalanced.",
      "According to Mr. Trump, the deal also includes that all European Union countries will be \"opened up for U.S. goods\" at 0% and the bloc will invest $600 billion in the U.S. The EU will also purchase $750 billion of U.S. energy as part of the deal.",
      "\"They are going to agree to invest into the United States $600 billion more than they're investing already,\" Mr. Trump said. \"So they're investing a large amount of money. You know what that amount of money is--It's very substantial.\"",
      "In remarks before the session, Mr. Trump pledged to change what he characterized as \"a very one-sided transaction, very unfair to the United States.\"",
      "\"I think the main sticking point is fairness,\" he said while also noting, \"We've had a hard time with trade with Europe, a very hard time.\"",
      "Without a deal, Mr. Trump had threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tariff rate. The president has long been critical of the U.S.-EU trade relationship, claiming the U.S. has been treated unfairly. Last year, the U.S. trade deficit with the EU was about $235 billion.",
      "Joining von der Leyen were Maros Sefcovic, the EU's chief trade negotiator; Bj\u00f6rn Seibert, the head of von der Leyen's Cabinet; Sabine Weyand, the commission's directorate-general for trade, and Tomas Baert, head of trade and agriculture at the EU's delegation to the U.S.",
      "Von der Leyen had a mandate to negotiate because the European Commission handles trade for member countries. But the Commission should now present the deal to member states and EU lawmakers \u2014 who will ultimately decide whether or not to approve it",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Sunday welcomed the trade deal, which he said avoided \"needless escalation in transatlantic trade relations.\"",
      "\"We have thus managed to preserve our fundamental interests, even if I would have wished for more relief in transatlantic trade,\" he said in a statement released soon after the deal was announced.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday said he's considering issuing rebate checks for Americans based on the billions in new tariff revenue collected by his administration.",
      "\"We're thinking about a little rebate. But the big thing we want to do is pay down debt. But we're thinking about a rebate,\" Mr. Trump said in comments to reporters before he left for a\u00a0four-day visit to Scotland.",
      "Federal debt, which currently stands at more than $36 trillion, is projected to rise due to the new tax cuts and spending bill signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, according to forecasts from economists and public policy think tanks. The nation's deficit could rise by $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years because of the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0said, citing estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "Mr. Trump added that the rebate could be \"for people of a certain income level,\" although he didn't specify the threshold that he's considering.",
      "The federal government has collected about $100 billion in tariff revenue since the Trump administration instituted its higher import duties earlier this year, which could increase to $300 billion per year, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business' \"Mornings with Maria\" on Tuesday.",
      "Tariffs vary from country to country, but they're paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart, or manufacturers that import materials and components from other countries, like Ford Motor. So far, some companies have been\u00a0swallowing the higher costs\u00a0rather than passing them on to consumers, although the\u00a0latest inflation report\u00a0signaled that higher tariff rates may be edging into consumer prices.",
      "Rebate checks have been floated by Mr. Trump previously, with the president saying in February he was considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. During the pandemic, taxpayers received three rebate checks \u2014 two under the first Trump administration, and the third under the Biden administration \u2014 aimed at offsetting the economic impact of the crisis.",
      "Typically, such rebates are issued through the tax code, which would require Congress to pass new tax legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to issue checks.",
      "Lawmakers earlier this month passed a massive tax and spending bill that was signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, which authorizes some new tax breaks, but doesn't include a rebate based on tariffs.",
      "Some of the bill's new tax cuts are limited to low- and middle-income taxpayers. For instance, its new $6,000 deduction for senior citizens phases out for single taxpayers with incomes over $75,000 and married filers with earnings over $150,000.",

      "The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE \u2014 ticked higher last month, signaling that President Trump's tariffs are pushing some prices higher.",
      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher.",
      "The figures help illustrate the central bank's reason for\u00a0its decision Wednesday to keep its\u00a0key interest rate steady, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressing that inflation still remains above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the president's new import duties would cause just a one-time rise in prices, or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "\"The Fed got validation this morning with inflation coming in a little higher than expected,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X in an emailed comment. \"There is some evidence of tariff impact in the inflation data, but it remains modest. Health care, housing and utilities continue to be key sources in driving inflation.\"",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than what would be consistent with the 2% target.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook and inflation that remains higher than its 2% annualized goal. The central bank last cut rates in December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's January inauguration.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pressuring Powell to cut rates, arguing that lower rates are justified because inflation remains tame and that other nations have been cutting their benchmark rates this year. Nevertheless, the majority of the Fed's 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, voted on Wednesday to maintain rates in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, although there were two dissenting votes in favor of a cut.",
      "The rise in the PCE's inflation data may lessen the likelihood of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, said Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm.",
      "\"The above-target rise in core prices in June, upward revisions to previous months' data and the sharp rise in core goods inflation will do little to ease the Fed's concerns about tariff-driven inflation,\" Chambers said.",
      "Higher grocery and gas prices",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting some of the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",
      "Thursday's report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.3% from May to June, a modest rise that suggests Americans are still spending cautiously. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was just 0.1%, the government said.",
      "Americans' incomes also saw a modest increase, rising 0.3% last month, a rebound after a 0.4% drop in May. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, however, incomes were flat in June.",
      "Consumers have been cautious all year. On Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a solid showing but one that masked some red flags.",
      "Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government's calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",
      "Earlier this month, the government reported that its more closely watched Consumer Price Index, its primary inflation measure, also ticked higher in June as the cost of heavily imported items such as appliances, furniture and toys increased.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review a trade court's decision invalidating President Trump's 10% tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Thursday is considering\u00a0President Trump's use of an emergency powers law to impose sweeping tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is hearing arguments in the Trump administration's appeal of a ruling from a trade-focused lower court that found the president did not have the authority to hit foreign nations with 10% tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.",
      "While a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked the sweeping duties that the president assessed on most countries, the Federal Circuit temporarily reinstated the tariffs while it considers the dispute.",
      "The legal fights before the appeals court were brought by a group of 12 states and five small businesses, and their cases are a major test of the centerpiece of Mr. Trump's economic agenda. The Federal Circuit's decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court, though a ruling in favor of Mr. Trump from the conservative court is far from certain.",
      "The president pointed to the hearing on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning, saying, \"To all of my great lawyers who have fought so hard to save our Country, good luck in America's big case today. If our Country was not able to protect itself by using TARIFFS AGAINST TARIFFS, WE WOULD BE \"DEAD,\" WITH NO CHANCE OF SURVIVAL OR SUCCESS. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "The president has relied on tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he said are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Since Mr. Trump announced his sprawling tariff regime on April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" the administration has said it reached trade deals with five Asian countries, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Many economists argue tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth.",
      "The tariffs announced in early April set a 10% baseline tariff on nearly every country, and reciprocal tariffs above the 10% rate on dozens of trading partners. While the reciprocal levies were initially supposed to take effect April 9, Mr. Trump issued a 90-day pause and lowered the rate for countries subject to the higher tariffs to 10%. Some of those higher\u00a0reciprocal duties are set to go back into place Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump has since said that he would increase the blanket tariff rate for nations that don't enter into trade deals with the U.S. to \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range.\"",
      "Only the so-called Liberation Day tariffs, and higher levies on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican imports that the president said were to combat the trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S., are at issue in the cases before the Federal Circuit.",
      "No president before Mr. Trump had invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs, and the Constitution vests the power to assess levies in Congress. IEEPA does not include any references to tariffs or duties, and it has typically been used by presidents to impose economic sanctions on foreign nations.",
      "Under IEEPA, the president can exercise the law's authority in instances involving \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security or the economy for which \"a national emergency has been declared.\"",
      "In rolling out his tariffs, Mr. Trump claimed that trade deficits and the flow of illicit drugs across U.S. borders constituted national emergencies and were threats to national security and the economy.",
      "But the challengers to his tariffs argue that trade deficits have persisted for 50 years, and they warned that if allowed, the president would have limitless power to set tariffs of any amount against any product.",
      "\"By the government's telling, IEEPA empowers the president to impose whatever tariffs he chooses any time he finds (in his assertedly unreviewable discretion) that a trade deficit is creating significant national problems,\" lawyers for the small businesses wrote in a filing.",
      "They also argued that a different law, a provision of the Trade Act of 1974, governs the president's imposition of tariffs in response to trade deficits, but caps the duties at 15% and limits their duration to five months.",
      "In addition to claiming that IEEPA does not authorize Mr. Trump's tariffs, lawyers for the small businesses and states argue that they violate the major questions and nondelegation doctrines, legal principles that have in recent years been raised by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "Under the major questions doctrine, an agency that seeks to decide an issue of major political or economic significance must have clear authorization from Congress. And under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress cannot delegate its legislative power to executive branch agencies unless it sets out an \"intelligible\" and judicially enforceable principle to guide an agency.",
      "\"Congress alone has constitutional authority to impose tariffs,\" lawyers for the states wrote in a filing. \"But under President Trump's reading of IEEPA, Congress gave him the authority to rewrite the tariff schedules at his whim.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended the tariffs and said they were imposed because the president believes they are needed to address \"grave threats\" to U.S. national security and the economy.",
      "\"President Trump has found that America's exploding trade deficit, the implications of that deficit for our economy and national security, and a fentanyl importation crisis that has claimed thousands of American lives constitute national emergencies,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They noted that Mr. Trump's plans for tariffs were a key component of his 2024 presidential campaign and said they've been successful at sparking negotiations on trade deals with U.S. partners.",
      "\"The CIT's injunction would, if affirmed, disrupt the Executive Branch's ongoing, sensitive diplomatic negotiations with virtually every major trading partner. And it would unilaterally deprive the United States of a powerful tool for combating systemic distortions in the global trading system, thus allowing other nations to continue to hold American exporters hostage to their unreasonable, discriminatory, and sometimes retaliatory trade policies,\" Justice Department lawyers argued.",

Since Harris' defeat in her truncated 2024 presidential run, which followed then-President Joe Biden's decision to drop his reelection bid, the Democratic Party has wondered what Harris' next political move will be. In May, sources familiar with Harris' thinking said she was weighing a campaign to be California's chief executive, a third run for the White House or not seeking elected office.",

      "A source close to Vice President Kamala Harris told CBS News that while Harris \"seriously considered\" a run for California governor in 2026, she ultimately decided against it \u2014 concluding she can have more impact for her party on a national stage and that her \"heart wasn't into running for governor\".",
      "\"She grappled with it,\" the source said about a possible gubernatorial bid. \"There were a lot of conversations over the last few months. But she's been a public servant for her whole career.\" The source said she wants to take time to experience life as a private citizen.",
      "According to the source, Harris felt tempted by the idea of leading her home state, but instead, she is finding other ways to remain engaged in public life \u2014 including potentially writing a book, launching her nonprofit and traveling the country to campaign for Democratic candidates ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"She genuinely has not decided about a 2028 presidential run,\" the source said, adding the decision not to seek the governorship \"keeps the door open\" for a potential run in 2028.",
      "Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, are back in California. Emhoff returned to private law practice, and he teaches at the University of Southern California.",

      "I have extraordinary admiration and respect for those who dedicate their lives to public service\u2014service to their communities and to our nation. At the same time, we must recognize that our politics, our government, and our institutions have too often failed the American people, culminating in this moment of crisis. As we look ahead, we must be willing to pursue change through new methods and fresh thinking\u2014committed to our same values and principles, but not bound by the same playbook.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-south-korea-tariff-deal/",
    "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 09:19:00 -0400",
    "summary": "South Korea appears to be the latest key U.S. trading partner to reach an agreement with the Trump administration, ahead of a Friday deadline when hefty tariffs take effect.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Wednesday he has struck a trade deal with South Korea.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on\u00a0Truth Social\u00a0that South Korean goods will face a 15% tariff \u2014\u00a0lower than\u00a0the 25% he threatened earlier this month \u2014 while U.S. imports to South Korea will not face tariffs. He said South Korea will be \"OPEN TO TRADE\" and will accept U.S. automobiles.",
      "South Korea is the latest key U.S. trading partner to reach an agreement with the Trump administration, ahead of a Friday deadline when Mr. Trump says he'll impose hefty tariffs on dozens of countries.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae-myung confirmed his country had reached a deal with the U.S. in a Facebook post.",
      "In addition to the 15% tariff, Mr. Trump said South Korea agreed to \"give to the United States $350 Billion Dollars for Investments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself.\" Lee said the fund will help South Korean companies enter the U.S. market, especially in industries like semiconductors and biotech, and $150 billion of the total $350 billion will focus on shipbuilding.",
      "South Korea will also buy $100 billion dollars' worth of liquified natural gas or other energy products, and will \"invest a large sum of money for their investment purposes,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "South Korea was the U.S.'s sixth-largest trading partner last year, not including multi-country blocs like the European Union, according to Census Bureau data. The U.S. imported $131.5 billion worth of South Korean goods, and South Korea bought $65.5 billion in American goods.",
      "More than $45 billion worth of U.S. imports from South Korea were cars and car parts, according to federal statistics. Cars from South Korea will be subject to the 15% tariffs, rather than the blanket 25% rate that Mr. Trump has imposed on foreign cars and car parts from other countries, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said on X.",
      "The president also\u00a0announced a deal with Japan last week\u00a0and a deal with the 27-nation EU on Sunday. Deals are still outstanding with the U.S.'s three largest single trading partners:\u00a0Canada, Mexico and\u00a0China.",
      "Trump strikes trade deals as tariff threats loom",
      "Mr. Trump has spent much of his first six months in office pressing U.S. trading partners to agree to trade deals \u2014 and floating large-scale tariffs if they don't correct what he views as imbalanced trading practices.",
      "Most countries, including South Korea, have faced 10% tariffs since April, when Mr. Trump delayed a set of higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days to buy his administration time to negotiate. Then this month, the president sent letters to South Korea and around two dozen other trading partners telling them to expect higher tariffs starting Friday, Aug. 1, unless deals are reached.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood behind that deadline, writing on Wednesday: \"THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE IS THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE \u2014 IT STANDS STRONG, AND WILL NOT BE EXTENDED.\"",
      "Trading partners like Indonesia, the Philippines, the EU and Japan have struck trade deals before then \u2014 generally agreeing to tariffs that are lower than the ones threatened by Mr. Trump but higher than the 10% baseline.",
      "Meanwhile, negotiations with China, Canada and Mexico remain ongoing. Higher tariffs on Chinese goods are set to take effect on Aug. 12 unless the two countries strike a deal, though an extension is possible, U.S. officials have said.",
      "All told, the president said this week he expects that most imports to the U.S. will face a baseline tariff of 15% to 20%. By comparison, the average tariff rate on U.S. imports in 2023 was around 2.5%, according to figures from the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan policy research center.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing. But many economists warn tariffs can lead to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves rattled financial markets.",
      "Consumer prices have been relatively stable so far this year \u2014 though above the Federal Reserve's 2%-per-year target. Some economists say that's partly because companies have taken steps to prevent short-term shocks from tariffs.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-arrests-border-and-southern-states/",
    "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 06:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Statistics indicate Texas saw nearly a quarter of all ICE arrests during President Trump's first 5 months in office. About 11% of arrests occurred in Florida and 7% in California.",
    "story": [
      "Most of the more than 109,000 arrests carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first five months of President Trump's second term took place in border and Southern states, according to a CBS News analysis of government data.",
      "States in the southern U.S., as well as those along the border with Mexico, saw the highest levels of ICE arrests between the start of Mr. Trump's second term on Jan. 20 and June 27, the figures show.",
      "That continued a trend that predates the current administration, though ICE arrests have increased sharply across the country since last year. During the same time period in 2024, under the Biden administration, ICE made over 49,000 arrests, meaning that arrests by the agency have increased by 120% under the Trump administration.",
      "The statistics indicate that Texas saw nearly a quarter of all ICE arrests during that time period. About 11% of ICE arrests occurred in Florida and 7% in California, followed by 4% in Georgia and 3% in Arizona. ICE made the fewest arrests in Vermont, Alaska and Montana, about 100 total apprehensions combined.",
      "The locations of a small percentage of the arrests could not be discerned from the dataset, which was obtained by a group known as the Deportation Data Project through litigation.",
      "Overall, the individuals arrested by ICE between Jan. 20 and June 27 came from nearly 180 countries, but most were from Latin America or the Caribbean, according to the data.",
      "Mexico was the most common country of citizenship, with nearly 40,000 of those taken into ICE custody listed as Mexican citizens. Nationals of Guatemala and Honduras followed with around 15,000 and 12,000, respectively. Nearly 8,000 were citizens of Venezuela and over 5,000 of El Salvador.",
      "Immigration experts said the concentration of arrests in Southern and border states is not necessarily surprising and can largely be attributed to geography, demographics and the extent to which local law enforcement agencies cooperate with ICE.",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, explained that ICE tends to focus its resources in areas where local policies permit law enforcement interaction with federal immigration authorities, such as Texas and Florida. Other places, like California, may also see high levels of ICE arrests because they have large communities of immigrants, including those in the U.S. illegally, even though state and local policies limit collaboration with ICE.",
      "\"It's easier for ICE to be picking people up from state and local jails where there's cooperation,\" Bush-Joseph said. In cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies, \"ICE has to spend more resources picking up people for at-large arrests,\" she added.",
      "Bush-Joseph also noted the countries of origin for those arrested by ICE align with broader immigration trends. \"Generally, we're talking about countries that are geographically close\" to the U.S., she said.",
      "Latin American and Caribbean immigrants accounted for 84% of all unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2023, according to a recent report from the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "ICE is responsible for arresting, detaining and deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, as well as other noncitizens who lose their legal status, including because of criminal activity. The agency has been given a sweeping mandate by Mr. Trump, tasked with carrying out his campaign promise of overseeing the largest mass deportation effort in American history.",
      "Under the Trump administration, ICE has reversed Biden-era limits on arrests in the interior of the country and allowed deportation agents to arrest a broader group of individuals, including those who are in the U.S. illegally but who lack a criminal record.",
      "Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director, told CBS News recently that while his agents are still prioritizing the arrest of violent offenders who are in the U.S. illegally, anyone found to be in the country in violation of federal immigration law will be taken into custody.",
      "Halfway into Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, ICE recorded 150,000 deportations, putting the agency on track to carry out the most removals since the Obama administration, over a decade ago, CBS News reported. The tally is still far short of the 1 million annual deportations Trump officials have said they're targeting.",

    "summary": "The workforce of a federal agency that oversees billions in grants for primary health care, AIDS/HIV, maternal and child health services, and workforce training has been slashed, sparking fears of what's to come.",
    "story": [
      "A little-known federal agency that sends more than $12 billion annually to support community health centers, addiction treatment services, and workforce initiatives for America's neediest people has been hobbled by the Trump administration's staffing purges.",
      "The cuts are \"just a little astonishing,\" said Carole Johnson, who previously led the Health Resources and Services Administration. She left the agency in January with the administration change and has described the sweeping staff cuts as a \"big threat\" to the agency's ability to distribute billions of dollars in grants to hospitals, clinics, nonprofits, and other organizations nationwide.",
      "Since February, about a quarter of workers at HRSA \u2014 including analysts, auditors, scientists, grant managers, and nursing consultants \u2014 have left, according to a KFF Health News analysis.",
      "The agency, headquartered in a nondescript gray-and-glass office building tucked into side streets in Rockville, Maryland, employed about 2,700 staffers in early 2025. Employees worked behind the scenes to manage and monitor thousands of projects nationwide that fund primary health providers, HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention, maternal and child care programs, rural hospitals, and workforce training.",
      "On the ground, HRSA's grants have helped create telehealth initiatives for mothers in rural New Mexico, funded workforce training for Indigenous nurses in South Dakota, and supported Healthy Start programs for expectant mothers and babies in places like rural Georgia.",
      "Ryan Alcorn, a co-founder and the chief executive of GrantExec, a company that helps organizations match and apply for funding, said every American benefits from the programs HRSA's funding supports: \"When the safety net fails, hospitals become overwhelmed, unpaid costs rise, and premiums go up for everyone.\"",
      "Several former HRSA leaders, who have been in touch with employees, confirmed the magnitude of the cuts estimated by KFF Health News. Johnson said she believes the actual number of workers lost is larger.",
      "More than 700 workers were fired or chose to leave from February through the end of June. The analysis is based on data from the HHS employee directory, which may not include workers who opted out of being listed, and may not be an exact count of the worker roster, which is in flux.",
      "Johnson, who is now a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, and several other former employees interviewed by KFF Health News said they are concerned that specific programs will be eliminated, but also that reduced staffing could affect ongoing program oversight. The agency's workforce ethos, Johnson said, is one in which \"if there were two people left at HRSA, they would work around the clock to try to get the money out.\"",
      "For at least one program, revealed during a tense moment on Capitol Hill in July, money to help low-income and minority students has already stopped flowing to colleges and universities. The Scholarship for Disadvantaged Students program, established through congressional legislation, helped schools pay for students to train to become dentists, physician assistants, midwives, and nurses \u2014 all of whom are in short supply in rural and some urban areas. Candice Chen, acting associate administrator of HRSA's health workforce bureau, confirmed the agency \"did have competitions that were canceled.\"",
      "When U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) asked whether they were canceled by the Trump administration, Chen paused before speaking again: \"Well, the funding decisions were made across the administration.\"",
      "Asked about the canceled funding, officials from several schools declined to comment. Patrick Gonzales, a spokesperson for the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley, said in an emailed statement that the school is \"helping students navigate this transition with clarity and care.\"",
      "U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) has called for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s resignation or firing, \"whichever one comes first,\" saying there was \"no defensible answer\" to eliminating thousands of workers across federal agencies.",
      "In April, nearly a dozen Democratic senators sent a letter to Kennedy demanding answers about the mass firings, noting HRSA is the \"primary agency tasked with improving access to health care for vulnerable populations.\"",
      "HHS did not respond to the senators' letter. Kennedy and the Department of Health and Human Services \"has refused to answer basic questions about why the administration conducted mass firings in this office,\" said Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.).",
      "President Trump's proposed fiscal 2026 budget eliminates HRSA as well as some of its programs, including grants to rural hospitals, workforce training, Ryan White HIV/AIDS programs, and emergency medical services for children. HRSA spokesperson Andrea Takash said in an emailed response that HHS is \"undertaking organizational changes that support multiple goals while ensuring continuity of essential services.\"",
      "HRSA continues to process new funding announcements and awards for the health centers, workforce programs, child and maternal health initiatives, and \"many more of our critical programs and services,\" Takash said.",
      "HRSA's largest bureau supports thousands of community health centers that serve over 31 million people nationwide. Before the end of September, the agency's grants are still scheduled to pay out billions more to health clinics and other organizations nationwide.",
      "Cuts to health centers could come under more scrutiny because their funding has \"a lot of bipartisan\" support, said Celli Horstman, a senior research associate at the Commonwealth Fund, a health research nonprofit. HRSA's funding, which includes Section 330 grants, goes to \"keeping the doors open\" at federally qualified health centers nationwide, Horstman said.",
      "An additional 42% of health center funding comes from Medicaid, a federal and state insurance program that covers people with low incomes and those with disabilities, she said. Congress recently voted to reduce Medicaid funding.",
      "Joe Stevens, spokesperson for the Virginia Community Healthcare Association, said health centers are rethinking \"how they do business\" because of the Medicaid cuts and the increased administrative challenges faced when processing their HRSA grants, which have been more challenging to obtain since February. Virginia's health clinics treat about 400,000 people annually, Stevens said.",
      "\"It's a system that's been in place for 50-plus years, and this is the first time they're having issues receiving their funds,\" he said, noting that clinics now must also provide an itemized list of how the money is to be used after grants have been approved.",
      "\"Our health centers are understaffed, so having somebody to have to enter that information every two weeks is just more time,\" Stevens said.",
      "For months, HRSA staff across all departments have worked through changes to their technology systems and transitioned work to others as employees left their jobs. Workers have continued to process grants despite a February executive order that froze federal funding and a March announcement that HHS would lay off 10,000 workers and shut down entire agencies \u2014 including HRSA.",
      "One former employee said that, at this point, \"all we're doing now is keeping the lights on.\"",
      "Michael Warren, who left the agency in June, ran HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau. Warren described the bureau's staffing cuts as \"substantial.\" The bureau awarded more than $628 million in grants between Oct. 1, 2024, and July 22, 2025, to programs that included providing block grants to states and funding home visiting programs, through which trained staffers work with families with young children.",
      "Warren, who is now the chief medical and health officer for the March of Dimes, said America faces a crisis as one of the \"most dangerous places in the world to give birth among other high-income countries, and that shouldn't be the case.\"",
      "With tears brimming, Warren said his former employees \"wake up every morning, they work all day, and they go to sleep every night thinking about what they can do for mothers, children, and families.\"",
      "Methodology",
      "For this article, KFF Health News calculated workforce reductions at the Health Resources and Services Administration using public information from the Department of Health and Human Services directory posted online. We compared the number and type of employees listed with HRSA in February to those in early July. Our employee totals exclude people listed as interns, fellows, student trainees, or volunteers. The directory is not an official count of HRSA employees, but it offers detailed snapshots of trends so far this year. Reporters also cross-checked the estimates with former employees.",

    "story": [
      "Top Texas Democrats are sounding the alarm over a GOP plan to redraw Texas' congressional maps, warning in interviews with CBS News it would dramatically dilute minority representation in the Lone Star State and set off a nationwide ripple effect.",
      "Republican state lawmakers unveiled a draft congressional map on Wednesday that would turn five U.S. House districts currently held by Democrats into GOP-leaning seats \u2014 an idea blessed by President Trump as Republicans angle to hold onto their narrow congressional majority in next year's midterms.",
      "One Democratic member of Congress whose district could be impacted called the proposed map \"grossly unfair,\" arguing Black and Latino communities are being \"scrambled\" and intentionally fractured for political gain.",
      "\"They've already gerrymandered the map \u2014 and now they're trying to make it 30 to 8 in favor of Republicans,\" the lawmaker told CBS News, referencing the state's congressional delegation. \"This is grossly unfair and starts a dangerous domino effect. If Texas lights the fire, it will spread to other states like California and New York. It's going to be a mess across the country.\"",
      "The Democratic representative also argued that Texas Republicans are banking on maintaining the historic margins they saw among Hispanic voters in November's election, but warned that recent polling shows a softening in GOP support among Latino voters \u2014 particularly in the wake of backlash over the Trump administration's deportation policies.",
      "Those voters \"may not be there,\" the lawmaker said, cautioning the strategy could backfire and jeopardize Republican gains.",
      "Another top Democrat who has previously run statewide in Texas echoed the concern, calling the proposal \"deeply undemocratic.\"",
      "\"We're seeing losses of representation for people of color in Texas,\" the Democrat said. \"Five of the affected districts are Latino-majority seats. They're not just stacking the deck \u2014 they're doing it without any expectation of being held accountable. But they will be held accountable.\"",
      "New congressional map could expand GOP's House edge",
      "Mr. Trump has publicly encouraged Texas Republicans to reshape the state's congressional districts, predicting to reporters earlier this month a \"simple redrawing\" could net five extra seats for his party. The GOP currently controls 25 of Texas' 38 House districts, which were last redrawn after the 2020 Census.",
      "House Republicans are defending a razor-thin seven-seat majority in next year's congressional elections \u2014 a challenging task since the party that controls the White House almost always loses upwards of a dozen seats in the midterms.",
      "Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called the state legislature into a special session, and on Wednesday, lawmakers released an early draft map \u2014 though changes could be made. It will need to pass the GOP-controlled state House and Senate.",
      "The map would improve the GOP's edge by tilting two Democratic seats in the Rio Grande Valley to the right, making a pair of districts in the Dallas and Houston area redder and merging two Democratic seats near Austin into one.",
      "For example, Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar \u2014 who already represents a district won by Mr. Trump in 2024 \u2014 would lose parts of the San Antonio suburbs under the new map. And the Dallas-area district held by Democratic Rep. Julie Johnson would be redrawn to stretch more than 100 miles from Dallas County to deep-red parts of rural North Texas.",
      "Texas Republicans have pledged to ensure the redistricting plans are constitutional. Abbott has argued the maps need to be redrawn due to \"constitutional concerns\" raised by the Justice Department. CBS News has reached out to the Texas GOP for comment.",
      "But Democrats have blasted the map, which Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin called a \"blatant gerrymander\" and a \"likely violation of the Voting Rights Act.\" Rep. Greg Casar \u2014 whose Austin-area district would be merged with that of fellow Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett \u2014 called the move \"illegal voter suppression of Black and Latino Central Texans.\"",
      "The governors of some Democratic states, including California and New York, have floated launching their own mid-decade redistricting processes, with an eye to creating more blue seats. But those plans could require constitutional amendments since, unlike Texas, those two states have put independent commissions in charge of redistricting.",
      "Johnson \u2014 whose Texas district is set to be redrawn \u2014 says other states should redraw their maps in response.",
      "\"This is an all-out war,\" she told CBS News senior White House correspondent Ed O'Keefe. \"I am for fair and independent redistricting across the country, so long as we all do it. But if we're going to do partisan gerrymandering, then game on, we all should.\"",
      "Meanwhile, some experts have suggested Texas' plan to create five extra GOP-leaning districts could make some of those newfound red seats more competitive, by distributing Republican voters across more districts.",
      "The state has also undergone significant demographic changes in recent elections. The fast-growing Dallas and Houston suburbs have shifted toward Democrats, but the once reliably blue Rio Grande Valley has become redder with more Hispanic voters supporting Republican candidates. Those shifts could complicate efforts to rearrange the congressional map.",

    "summary": "Ghislaine Maxwell's deposition is scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, where she is serving her sentence.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of aiding sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is willing to provide information to a congressional committee next month during a deposition but only if she is granted immunity or is pardoned, according to a letter from her attorney obtained by CBS News.",
      "Last week, the GOP-led House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence, to sit for a deposition as fallout over the Trump administration's handling of the case continues to intensify. A deposition was scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, where Maxwell is serving her sentence.",
      "However, in a letter Tuesday addressed to House Oversight chairman Rep. James Comer, Maxwell's attorney David Markus said she is willing to sit before the committee but only after certain legal appeals are finalized or his client is granted clemency or a pardon by President Trump.",
      "\"Public reports \u2014 including your own statements \u2014 indicate that the Committee intends to question Ms. Maxwell in prison and without a grant of immunity. Those are non-starters. Ms. Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity,\" Markus wrote.",
      "Markus wrote that any questions to Maxwell would have to be given to her in advance to \"ensure accuracy and fairness,\" and that conducting the deposition in prison would create \"security risks and undermines the integrity of the process.\"",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.",
      "Markus wrote that because Maxwell's ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction and other legal issues are currently pending, \"any testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights, prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool.\"",
      "However, Markus wrote, if President Trump were to pardon Maxwell or commute her sentence, \"she would be willing\u2014and eager\u2014to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "If those conditions are not agreed to, Markus wrote, Maxwell \"will have no choice but to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee said in a statement that the committee will respond to Markus' letter \"soon,\" but said it \"will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony.\"",
      "In a letter to Maxwell informing her of the subpoena, Comer wrote that the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony \"to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "Todd Blanche, the second highest-ranking Justice Department official, met with Maxwell in Tallahassee on July 24 and 25\u00a0 to discuss Epstein.",
      "After the questioning had ended, Markus declined to comment \"on the substance\" of the meeting, but told reporters outside the office that \"there were a lot of questions and we went all day.\"",
      "Neither President Trump nor Markus have ruled out the possibility of a pardon for Maxwell, but on Monday Mr. Trump said he is \"allowed\" to pardon Maxwell but that nobody has asked him to issue one, yet.",
      "Virginia Giuffre's relatives say Maxwell should \"rot in prison\"",
      "Several family members of Virginia Giuffre \u2014 one of the most prominent people to accuse Epstein and Maxwell of abuse \u2014 said in a statement Wednesday that the government should \"never consider giving Ghislaine Maxwell any leniency,\" calling her a \"monster who deserves to rot in prison for the rest of her life.\"",
      "\"Maxwell destroyed many young lives, and she was convicted for only a fraction of the crimes she actually committed. She must remain in prison \u2013 anything less would go down in history as being one of the highest travesties of justice,\" read the statement, which was penned by two of Giuffre's siblings and their spouses.",
      "The relatives also criticized the decision to meet with Maxwell.",

    "summary": "A dozen congressional Democrats are suing the Trump administration for limiting access to ICE detention facilities.",
    "story": [
      "A dozen Democratic members of Congress sued the Trump administration on Wednesday over its effort to limit their access to detention centers housing immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, accusing the White House of inhibiting lawmakers' oversight responsibilities.",
      "The lawsuit alleged the Trump administration had blocked attempts by Democratic lawmakers in states throughout the U.S. to enter Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers and sought to delay plans to visit and inspect such facilities.",
      "The lawmakers argued in their complaint that the actions by the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, violate a provision of federal law that guarantees members of Congress access to facilities holding those awaiting deportation.",
      "\"These illegal actions have harmed each Plaintiff's right as an individual member of Congress to conduct oversight and obtain information about DHS facilities and the conditions of immigration detention,\" the lawmakers said in their lawsuit, which was filed by lawyers from the groups Democracy Forward and American Oversight.",
      "The complaint asked the federal district court in Washington, D.C., to require DHS to give members of Congress unfettered access to ICE holding facilities \u2014 even during unannounced visits \u2014 for the purposes of conducting congressional oversight.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have sparred with the Trump administration for months over access to ICE facilities. One May\u00a0clash with ICE officials\u00a0at a Newark detention center led the Justice Department to charge Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey with assaulting law enforcement officers. She has\u00a0pleaded not guilty. Six Maryland Democrats said they were\u00a0denied access to an ICE facility in Baltimore\u00a0earlier this week, and Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado\u00a0said he couldn't get into a facility\u00a0in a Denver suburb last week.",
      "The complaint noted that appropriations law dating back to 2019 says DHS cannot use funds allocated by Congress to \"prevent\" members of Congress from entering detention facilities housing immigration detainees for the purposes of oversight. The Fiscal Year 2024 Appropriations Act also included a provision that states DHS should not require members of Congress to \"provide prior notice of the intent\" to inspect such facilities.",
      "But DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin said the department is now requiring lawmakers to give a week of prior notice before any oversight visit to an ICE detention facility, citing President Trump's constitutional powers to oversee the executive branch. She said requests to shorten that time must be approved by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "\"As for visits to detention facilities, requests should be made with sufficient time to prevent interference with the President's Article II authority to oversee executive department functions \u2014 a week is sufficient to ensure no intrusion on the President's constitutional authority,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "DHS has also taken the position that lawmakers don't automatically have access to visit ICE field offices and other short-term processing facilities, since they are not long-term detention centers. Some ICE field offices, however, have been used as makeshift detention centers recently, with holding facilities in New York and other cities housing detainees for days.",
      "Citing an increase in threats and attacks against ICE officers, McLaughlin said any visits by lawmakers to ICE field officers or processing sites that are not detention centers would need to be approved by Noem.",
      "McLaughlin said the members of Congress who sued the administration Wednesday \"could have just scheduled a tour.\" Instead, she said, \"they're running to court to drive clicks and fundraising emails.\"",
      "The dozen Democrats who joined the lawsuit were Reps. Joe Neguse and Jason Crow of Colorado; Adriano Espaillat and Dan Goldman of New York; Bennie Thompson of Mississippi; Jamie Raskin of Maryland; Veronica Escobar of Texas; and Robert Garcia, Luis Correa, Jimmy Gomez, Raul Ruiz and Norma Torres of California.",
      "Wednesday's lawsuit comes as the Trump administration escalates its aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration. In recent weeks, ICE has transferred a record number of detainees to its sprawling detention system. As of this week, the agency was holding 57,000 individuals facing deportation, according to internal government data.",
      "As the number of those in ICE custody has ballooned since the start of the year, some detainees have reported unsanitary and substandard conditions in facilities across the country. A recently released video showed detainees lying on the floor at an ICE holding facility in New York in what advocates called \"inhumane\" conditions. The Trump administration has categorically denied all claims of subpar conditions at ICE facilities.",

    "story": [
      "Former NBA star Gilbert Arenas and five other defendants, including a suspected high-level member of an Israeli transnational organized crime group, were arrested Wednesday for allegedly operating an illegal gambling and poker ring out of a California home that Arenas owned, according to unsealed court documents.",
      "According to an indictment that was filed on July 15, federal prosecutors in the Central District of California allege that between September 2021 and July 2022, Arenas allegedly rented out a mansion in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles so he and his co-conspirators could run illegal high-stakes poker games out of the house.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Arenas ordered one of the co-defendants to stage the mansion to host the poker games and collect rent, while another co-conspirator Yevgeni Gershman, a suspected Israeli organized crime member, hired women, who allegedly in exchange for tips, served drinks, provided massages, and \"offered companionship\" to the poker players.",
      "Arenas, nicknamed \"Agent Zero\" from his playing days as an all-star guard in the NBA, was charged with one count of conspiracy to operate an illegal gambling business, one count of operating an illegal gambling business, and one count of making false statements to investigators.",
      "Arenas pleaded not guilty Wednesday in United States District Court in Los Angeles and was released on $50,000 bond, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles said. His trial is scheduled for Sept. 23.",
      "Arenas' successes on the court, including being a three-time All-NBA team player and making three NBA All-Star game appearances as a member of the Washington Wizards, were overshadowed by his off-the-court issues, including multiple incidents involving firearms.",
      "In January 2010, Arenas was charged with felony gun possession in Washington, D.C. after allegedly getting into a card-game dispute with a former teammate in December 2009, which resulted in both men drawing guns on each other in the Wizards locker room.",
      "As a result of the incident, D.C. prosecutors charged Arenas with one count of carrying a pistol without a license, which Arenas pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to two years' probation and 30 days of time in a halfway house and was suspended by the NBA during the investigation. Arenas, now 43, played his last NBA game in 2012.",
      "Since leaving the NBA, he has hosted a range of daily sports shows and podcasts.",
      "Arenas' five co-conspirators were charged with conspiracy to operate an illegal gambling business and one count of operating an illegal gambling business.",
      "Separately, Gershman, an Israeli citizen, was charged with three additional charges relating to immigration and marriage fraud.",

    "summary": "Brown University is now the third Ivy League university to reach a deal with the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Brown University has cut a deal with the Trump administration to restore research grant funding to the school, in exchange for commitments on women's sports, antisemitism and admissions practices and a promise to donate $50 million to workforce development programs.",
      "The Rhode Island-based school is now the third Ivy League university to reach a deal with the administration, which has lashed out at a range of colleges. Columbia University agreed to pay the federal government a $200 million settlement earlier this month, and the University of Pennsylvania reached a deal with the government over transgender athletes.",
      "Brown announced the deal in a statement Wednesday and shared a copy of a nine-page agreement with the federal government. The Department of Education also confirmed in a statement that it had struck a deal with Brown.",
      "Under the terms of the three-year deal released by Brown, the federal government agreed to restore frozen Health and Human Services grants to the school and close pending federal non-discrimination investigations into the university.",
      "The school said Wednesday it has lost dozens of federal grants and hasn't been reimbursed for over $50 million in expenses related to National Institutes of Health grants \u2014 and that total is growing by over $3 million a week.",
      "In exchange for the end to the grant freeze, Brown agreed to pay $50 million to local workforce programs over the next decade. It also promised to provide female student-athletes with locker rooms \"strictly separated on the basis of sex,\" define male and female for athletic purposes in a way that's consistent with President Trump's executive orders and not offer gender-affirming medical care to minors.",
      "Brown also said it will not promote \"unlawful DEI goals,\" would commission a campus survey that asks about \u2014 among other things \u2014 issues of antisemitism and give the government access to admissions and discrimination complaint data. The school promised not to offer racial preferences in admissions \u2014 though the Supreme Court previously barred affirmative action policies in 2023.",
      "The agreement says Brown did not admit to wrongdoing and \"expressly denies liability regarding the United States' allegations,\" and specifies that the government does not have the \"authority to dictate Brown's curriculum or the content of academic speech.\"",
      "In a message to the school community, Brown President Christina Paxson also says Brown will not promise to make any direct payments to the government. She described it as a voluntary agreement.",
      "Paxson says Brown was under \"threat\" \u2014 Ed. Secretary assails \"woke\" policies",
      "In her message, Paxson argued that many parts of Wednesday's agreement line up with commitments Brown had already made to \"ensure compliance with federal laws prohibiting discrimination.\" She said the provisions on gender and sports are \"consistent with NCAA requirements and Brown's current policies,\" and the government is already entitled to ask for demographic data. She also noted that the agreement doesn't define the term \"unlawful DEI.\"",
      "But the university president noted that some parts of the deal stemmed from \"priorities of the federal administration in resolving the funding freeze.\" She said the school \"took great care to balance these interests with the core needs of the institution.\"",
      "Paxson said the deal \"preserves the integrity of Brown's academic foundation, and it enables us as a community to move forward after a period of considerable uncertainty.\" She wrote that the school's mission was \"under threat\" from financially painful grant cancellations and a \"growing push for government intrusion into the fundamental academic operations of colleges and universities.\"",
      "In a statement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the administration is \"successfully reversing the decades-long woke-capture of our nation's higher education institutions,\" and pointed to the agreement's measures on antisemitism and women's sports.",
      "\"Because of the Trump Administration's resolution agreement with Brown University, aspiring students will be judged solely on their merits, not their race or sex,\" she wrote.",
      "The White House called the deal a \"historic settlement with Brown University to restore fairness, merit, and safety in higher education.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 18:23:47 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration filed a complaint this week against Judge James Boasberg, an unusual move that follows tension over President Trump's deportation policies.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration filed a complaint Monday against Judge James Boasberg, an unusual move that follows clashes in court between the D.C.-based federal judge and the government over President Trump's deportation policies.",
      "It's rare for the Justice Department to formally accuse judges of misconduct. The move will kick off a long, complex review process \u2014 though some legal experts say the Trump administration could have a difficult time demonstrating that Boasberg violated judicial rules.",
      "Why did the Trump administration file a complaint against Boasberg?",
      "The complaint accuses Boasberg of \"making improper public comments\" about Mr. Trump, and criticizes the judge's rulings in a high-profile case involving Venezuelan migrants who were deported to El Salvador, according to a copy obtained by CBS News.",
      "Much of the complaint focuses on a March session of the Judicial Conference of the United States, a panel of federal judges led by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts that weighs in on how the judicial branch is run.",
      "The Justice Department accused Boasberg of speaking up during one part of the biannual meeting to warn that the Trump administration could \"disregard rulings of federal courts,\" leading to a \"constitutional crisis.\"",
      "The source of those quotes is unclear, but they were first reported earlier this month by The Federalist, a conservative digital outlet that says it obtained a memo summarizing the meeting. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for further details.",
      "Those comments, the government argues, violated rules requiring judges to avoid publicly comment on cases and to \"act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\"",
      "The complaint also takes issue with Boasberg's handling of Venezuelan migrants who were rapidly flown to a Salvadoran prison under the wartime Alien Enemies Act in mid-March, less than a week after the Judicial Conference meeting.",
      "Boasberg verbally ordered the government to return the migrants to the U.S., even if officials needed to \"turn the planes around,\" but the deportees were still sent to El Salvador. Since then, the judge has accused the administration of defying his orders, and has threatened to hold the government in contempt.",
      "The Justice Department argued Monday that Boasberg \"rushed the government through complex litigation, sometimes giving the Trump Administration less than 48 hours to respond.\"",
      "\"Judge \u202fBoasberg publicly forecasted his baseless predictions of presidential lawlessness, then issued erroneous rulings based on that preconceived notion,\" says the complaint, which was signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, Chad Mizelle.",
      "In April, the Supreme Court halted a ruling by Boasberg blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, deciding the lawsuit should have been brought in Texas, not Washington, D.C.",
      "Legal experts say Boasberg complaint is misdirected",
      "Several legal experts told CBS News the complaint could face a tough path.",
      "Federal law defines judicial misconduct as \"conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts.\" That covers everything from harassment to making partisan statements and treating people in a \"demonstrably egregious and hostile manner.\"",
      "Several law professors say that the parts of Monday's complaint that focus on Boasberg's handling of the deportation case are misdirected.",
      "In general, if a party in a federal case has issues with how a judge has ruled, they're expected to file an appeal \u2014 not a complaint against a judge \u2014 said Jeffrey Bellin, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who has served as a judicial ethics investigator.",
      "\"You're not supposed to use the misconduct process to complain about the judge's behavior in the case that you're involved in,\" Bellin told CBS News.",
      "The parts of the complaint that criticize Boasberg for warning the Trump administration may defy court orders are less straightforward, says Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law professor.",
      "The government accused the Obama-appointed judge of violating a section of the code of conduct for federal judges that says they \"should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court.\"",
      "Geyh said that in some circumstances, Boasberg's comments could be \"a potential problem.\"",
      "But he still doesn't believe Boasberg deserves disciplinary action. He said courts have been \"overwhelmed\" by Trump-era executive actions, \"many of which are of dubious constitutionality,\" and need to figure out how to preserve their legitimacy and ensure their rulings are followed.",
      "\"They need to talk about it somehow,\" said Geyh.",
      "Also, while public comments about cases aren't allowed, if Boasberg's remarks were made in a session of the normally private Judicial Conference, \"you could make a pretty good argument, I think, that that is something different,\" Geyh said.",
      "Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School, said remarks at Judicial Conference meetings typically aren't meant for public consumption.",
      "She also argued Boasberg's alleged comments about the risk of the Trump administration skirting court orders are based on \"very real concerns.\"",
      "\"This is not a novel issue being raised by one particular judge about, 'what if the administration doesn't comply,'\" said Levenson.",
      "What happens next?",
      "It's a complicated process that can take months.",
      "When a complaint is filed, the first step is usually for the region's chief appellate court judge \u2014 in this case, Judge Sri Srinivasin of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \u2014 to review the issue and decide how to proceed.",
      "In the vast majority of situations, the misconduct complaint is dismissed at that stage, Geyh said, noting that many complaints are from \"disgruntled litigants who don't like how their case went, and so they kvetch about what went on in their case.\"",
      "The appeals court judge can also privately take corrective action before the issue escalates. For example, they can encourage the judge to admit their mistake, said Geyh.",
      "If the appellate judge decides a complaint has merit, they can refer it to a special committee of judges to conduct an investigation and make recommendations. Then, the region's judicial council \u2014 yet another committee of judges \u2014 decides whether to punish them.",
      "\"The quickest thing is if they dismiss it,\" Bellin said. \"If they don't dismiss it \u2026 we won't hear about it for a while.\"",
      "How can judges be punished for misconduct?",
      "First off, district court judges can't be fired \u2014 unless they're impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate, which requires two-thirds of senators to vote in favor.",
      "\"It's very hard to discipline a sitting federal judge because they have life tenure,\" said Bellin.",
      "Short of that, a judge found to have engaged in misconduct can be publicly censured or reprimanded, or barred from taking on any new cases. The judicial conference can also choose to refer a judge to Congress for impeachment proceedings.",
      "How common are judicial misconduct complaints?",
      "They're not unheard of, though punishments are rare.",
      "Last year, Boston-based U.S. District Judge Michael Ponsor was the subject of a misconduct complaint after he criticized Supreme Court Justice Alito in a New York Times op-ed. An appellate judge didn't take further action because Ponsor apologized.",
      "Bellin said it's \"pretty common\" for parties in cases to file complaints about judges, but \"these are not usually done by people who are professional litigators.\" Instead, most attorneys just work their issues with judges into their appeals.",
      "It's especially unusual for the Justice Department to file complaints.",
      "\"You just don't have a history of the Justice Department having an acrimonious relationship with the judiciary,\" said Geyh. \"Historically, it's just a dumb thing to do. You want an amicable relationship with the judges who are going to be deciding your cases. You don't want to be suing them. You don't want to be filing complaints against them.\"",
      "Still, Mr. Trump has been more openly critical of judges than his predecessors.",
      "Besides Boasberg, the Trump administration filed a misconduct complaint in February against D.C. District Judge Ana Reyes, accusing her of \"hostile and egregious misconduct\" during a hearing. The D.C. appeals court has not addressed the complaint.",
      "The administration also sued every judge in Maryland over a standing order in that court district blocking the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removal.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump and his staff have lashed out at judges who have ruled against the government. The president has called for Boasberg to be impeached.",
      "\"It strikes me as a bit of posturing, as an aggressive pushback by the administration against the federal judges,\" Levenson said of the complaint against Boasberg. \"I think it's a real uphill battle for the administration, but the mere filing of the complaint is sort of the shot across the bow.\"",
      "Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley voted with Democrats to advance legislation to ban members of Congress from owning individual stocks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri joined Democrats Wednesday to advance legislation that would ban members of Congress from buying, selling or owning individual stocks.",
      "In an 8-7 vote, Hawley and Senate Democrats on the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs voted the legislation out of committee, with all other Republicans on the committee voting against it. It's not yet clear if the legislation, which Hawley introduced, will receive a floor vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.",
      "\"I practice what I preach,\" Hawley said in an awkward exchange with fellow Republicans on the panel. \"I don't have individual stocks, I don't trade in stocks. I'm not a billionaire, unlike others on this committee. And what I think is, the American people are sending us a clear message.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Rick Scott, who was not born wealthy but is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to his public filings, said he agrees lawmakers shouldn't be trading stocks. But he defended the ability for members of Congress to be rich, and called attacks on the wealthy \"disgusting.\"",
      "\"He made a reference to billionaires, okay?\" Scott said of Hawley. \"I don't know when in this country it became a negative to make money. But somehow, if you've made money, you're supposedly \u2014 I think Senator Hawley suggests \u2014 you shouldn't be serving, because you might trade stocks.\"",
      "\"Anybody want to be poor? I don't.\" Scott continued. \"Right? So this idea that we're going to attack people because they make money is wrong. Is absolutely wrong. We should cherish all of our different backgrounds. ... So, I think it's disgusting what is going on here.\"",
      "Some Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security Committee insisted that blind trusts are sufficiently restrictive. But Hawley said blind trusts are \"often workarounds,\" and members can still influence decisions.",
      "The measure, originally called the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act, would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from trading or holding individual stocks, giving them 180 days to sell their stocks. Members would also have to supply their House or Senate ethics committee with written certification of compliance each year, and the Government Accountability Office would conduct a compliance audit every two years. Hawley, as a part of negotiations with Democrats, agreed to call it the Honest Act.",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi voiced support for the legislation in a statement.",
      "\"While I appreciate the creativity of my Republican colleagues in drafting legislative acronyms, I welcome any serious effort to raise ethical standards in public service,\" Pelosi said.",
      "Hawley also said the legislation would ban the next president and vice president from holding or trading individual stocks while in office, meaning the legislation wouldn't affect President Trump. A reporter asked the president if he supports Hawley's bill.",
      "\"Well, I like it conceptually,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I don't know about it. But I like it conceptually.\"",
      "But later in the afternoon, Mr. Trump went off on Hawley on Truth Social with a very different tone than he took only hours earlier, calling him a \"second-tier Senator.\"",
      "\"The Democrats, because of our tremendous ACHIEVEMENTS and SUCCESS, have been trying to 'Target' me for a long period of time, and they're using Josh Hawley, who I got elected TWICE, as a pawn to help them,\" the president wrote. \"I wonder why Hawley would pass a Bill that Nancy Pelosi is in absolute love with \u2014 He is playing right into the dirty hands of the Democrats. It's a great Bill for her, and her 'husband,' but so bad for our Country!\"",
      "Hawley introduced similar legislation in 2023, but it didn't make it out of committee.",
      "The proposed measure is more restrictive than the\u00a0STOCK Act, which requires lawmakers and senior government officials including the president and vice president to disclose their stock trades and bans them from trading on information they learn in the course of their public service.",
      "Hawley wrote on X after the committee vote that the legislation should come to the Senate floor \"NOW.\"",

    "story": [
      "The United States has repatriated an American child separated from their family from a sprawling camp in northeastern Syria that houses tens of thousands of people with alleged ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, the State Department said Tuesday.",
      "The department estimates that some 30,000 people from 70 countries remain in al-Hol Camp and one other similar camp, most of them wives and children of ISIS fighters as well as supporters of the extremist group. They include Iraqis as well as nationals of Western countries who traveled to join the U.S.-designated foreign terrorist group.",
      "Human rights groups for years have cited poor living conditions and pervasive violence in the al-Hol camp, which the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have administered for years. The SDF are Washington's key ally in combating ISIS in Syria and its sleeper cells, and for years have run large swaths of northeastern Syria.",
      "CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams visited the al-Hol camp in 2019 and spoke with the camp's residents. Many of them expressed remorse for their prior ties to ISIS and said they wanted to return to their home countries \u2014 often in Western Europe \u2014 but some others defended the group's terror attacks.",
      "The State Department did not give any details about the repatriation, except to say in a statement that the child \"has known nothing of life outside of the camps\" and will be reunified with their family.",
      "The U.S. military for years has been pushing for countries to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol and the smaller, separate Roj Camp. Iraq has taken back an increasing number in recent years, but many other countries have remained reluctant.",
      "\"The only durable solution to the humanitarian and security crisis in these displaced persons camps in northeast Syria is for countries of origin to repatriate, rehabilitate, reintegrate, and where appropriate, ensure accountability for their nationals,\" the State Department statement read. \"The same goes for former ISIS fighters held in detention centers in northeast Syria,\" it said, using a different abbreviation for IS.",
      "Despite difficult talks to formally merge with the country's new rulers under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, Damascus and the SDF in May reached an agreement to repatriate Syrians in the camp. Since the ouster of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December, Washington has been pushing for the two sides to implement their deal and unify Syrian territory, which would ultimately put the camp under the control of the government.",
      "Last year, shortly after Assad's government fell, CBS News was taken inside the al-Hol camp. Guards said the security situation had deteriorated since word had spread about Assad's ouster, raising optimism that they could leave the camp.",
      "The SDF did not immediately comment to the Associated Press on the repatriation.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans are mulling a possible rule change to allow them to more swiftly confirm President Trump's nominees amid Democrats' efforts to slow the process in protest to the president's policies.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday that interest is \"growing quickly\" among Senate Republicans for a change to the rules governing the nominations process as he's bemoaned an \"unprecedented level of obstruction and delay\" by Democrats in recent days.",
      "\"There's certainly interest in looking at options that might enable us to break the logjam and expedite consideration of nominees in a way that, in the end, would benefit both parties when their party has the presidency,\" Thune said.",
      "With around 1,300 positions requiring Senate confirmation, the process is an arduous one that has become more cumbersome in recent years. The average time to confirm a president's nominee has nearly quadrupled during the last six administrations, according to the Center for Presidential Transition. And Democrats have taken their slow-walking of Mr. Trump's nominees to new extremes in recent months, putting up procedural hurdles to delay the confirmations nearly across the board.",
      "Still, the opposition by Democrats has not been universal, since any single senator can effectively stall the path to swift confirmation.",
      "In recent years, both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process, like by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Senate Republicans have been tight-lipped about the possible new changes to the process, which would represent a further change to the institution that has traditionally been resistant to change. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told CBS News that Senate Republicans are \"actively discussing\" possible changes, calling the obstruction of Mr. Trump's nominees \"unconscionable.\" He noted that he would say the same if the dynamic was occurring under a Democrat.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, told CBS News that \"we are actually not looking to do reforms, but we don't have a choice.\"",
      "\"This is Chuck Schumer's fault. He's the one that's forcing this. And, and so I don't know what he expects to happen, but we will have to have some reforms if this is the way they continue to operate,\" Mullin added.",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican who during the Biden administration delayed the nominations of hundreds of military officers, argued that the chamber should remain in session to get the nominations done. \"We ought to stay if we don't get as many as we want to get,\" he said.",
      "\"President Trump says he wants us here,\" Tuberville said. \"We work for him.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump called for Senate Republicans to stay in session into their August recess to get the nominations done. And some other Senate Republicans, like Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, have echoed the sentiment. Lee has argued that the GOP should either \"exhaust\" Democrats by working through August \u2014 or give Mr. Trump the ability to make recess appointments.",
      "Asked about recess appointments, which afford the president the ability to temporarily fill vacancies while the Senate is in recess, Thune suggested that Senate Republicans would be more likely to \"make a modification to our rules\" to sidestep Democrats' delay.",
      "\"At some point, we may need to look at doing things differently on nominees generally, if the Democrats continue this path of obstruction that they're on right now,\" Thune said.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump took aim at another facet of the Senate's confirmation process late Tuesday in a post on Truth Social, urging Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, to end blue slips \u2014 a practice that gives senators veto power over judicial nominations in their home state.",
      "Thune told reporters that the blue slip process is \"something that's been used for a long time by both sides, and neither side has violated its usage in the past.\"",
      "\"I don't sense any rush to change it, and I think the key is to make sure that we're making good headway on moving the list of judges that are on the President's list,\" he added.",

      "The grand jury transcripts that the Justice Department is attempting to unseal from the investigations into the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell contain testimony from only two law enforcement officers, top Justice Department officials said in a court filing late Tuesday.",
      "The grand juries that indicted Epstein and Maxwell did not hear direct testimony from any alleged victims, Attorney General Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told a judge in the Southern District of New York in their attempts to unseal the testimony.\u00a0 They said the testimony is just that of two witnesses, an FBI agent and a New York Police Department detective.",
      "It is not unusual for law enforcement to be the only witnesses testifying in front of a grand jury.",
      "The new information comes after President Trump directed Bondi and the Justice Department to move to unseal \"any and all pertinent grand jury testimony,\" related to the federal investigations into Epstein and Maxwell in an attempt to quiet the political storm that has ensnared the Trump administration since the Justice Department and FBI said a review of the investigation related to disgraced financier found that there was no \"client list\" or evidence that he blackmailed prominent figures.",
      "Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges, with investigators ruling his death a suicide. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping him recruit, groom and abuse underage girls.",
      "This latest filing again urged the New York court to release the records, and tried to convince the judges overseeing the case that the release of more information would not harm Epstein and Maxwell's victims.",
      "\"There is undoubtedly a clearly expressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein's and Ghislaine Maxwell's crimes. Beyond that, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes,\" Justice Department leadership wrote in its argument that the transcripts should be released, adding that its goal in unsealing the material would \"provide information to the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims.\"",
      "The Justice Department also said in the filing that they have submitted a fuller list under seal of witnesses whose accounts were conveyed in the grand jury proceedings and another list of which witnesses testified at trial to the judges, and have informed notice to all but one victim who is referenced in the grand jury transcripts of their attempts to unseal them.",
      "\"The Government has attempted to contact the remaining victim, but such efforts have been unsuccessful.\u00a0 In addition, the Government is in the process of providing notice to any other individuals identified in the transcripts,\" the Justice Department wrote.",
      "Last week, a federal judge in Florida denied the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury material stemming from investigations in 2005 and 2007 into Epstein in the state. That ruling only applied to transcripts of proceedings by federal grand juries that were convened in Florida, and did not apply to the transcripts in New York.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Treasury Department on Wednesday sanctioned a Brazilian Supreme Court justice who is overseeing the case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, claiming the judge is responsible for human rights violations and politicized prosecutions.",
      "The sanctions announced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent target Alexandre de Moraes, who has served on the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court since 2017. The Trump administration accused de Moraes of abusing his authority to target political opponents, including Bolsonaro, an ally of Mr. Trump's.",

      "\"Alexandre de Moraes has taken it upon himself to be judge and jury in an unlawful witch hunt against U.S. and Brazilian citizens and companies,\" Bessent said in a statement. \"De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions \u2014 including against former President Jair Bolsonaro. Today's action makes clear that Treasury will continue to hold accountable those who threaten U.S. interests and the freedoms of our citizens.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. is sanctioning de Moraes for \"serious\" human rights abuses, including detaining people without bringing charges and for infringing on freedom of expression.",
      "Rubio said de Moraes also \"abused his authority by engaging in a targeted and politically motivated effort designed to silence political critics through the issuance of secret orders compelling online platforms, including U.S. social media companies, to ban the accounts of individuals for posting protected speech.\"",
      "\"The United States will use all appropriate and effective diplomatic, political, and legal instruments to protect the speech of Americans from foreign malign actors who would seek to undermine it,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Bolsonaro is on trial for allegedly orchestrating a scheme to remain in office after Brazil's 2022 election. He was indicted in November, and prosecutors accused Brazil's former leader and seven others of seeking to \"violently overthrow the democratic order.\" Bolsonaro lost the 2022 race to his left-wing opponent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. He has denied the allegations and called the prosecution a \"witch hunt.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has publicly defended Bolsonaro and called the treatment of him an \"international disgrace.\" In a July 9 letter to Lula posted to social media, the president said the trial involving Bolsonaro is a \"witch hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\"",
      "Mr. Trump also slapped 50% tariffs on Brazilian products imported into the U.S. on Wednesday. In an executive order imposing the levies, the president said the actions of Brazil's government are \"repugnant to the moral and political values of democratic and free societies and conflict with the policy of the United States to promote democratic governments throughout the world, the principle of free expression and free and fair elections, the rule of law, and respect for human rights.\"",
      "The directive mentioned de Moraes by name and said his actions \"chill and limit expression in the United States, violate human rights, and undermine the interest that the United States has in protecting its citizens and companies at home and abroad.\"",
      "The president had said in a letter to Lula earlier this month warning of the tariffs that his administration concluded that the U.S. \"must move away from the longstanding, and very unfair trade relationship engendered by Brazil's tariff, and non-tariff, policies and trade barriers.\"",
      "The U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil and exported roughly $49 billion worth of goods to the country last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Brazil exported roughly $42 billion in products to the U.S. in 2024.",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are trying to force the Justice Department to release the Jeffrey Epstein files using a little-known law that directs executive agencies to turn over information to congressional oversight committees, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Wednesday.",
      "\"Today Senate Democrats take additional action to try and uncover the truth about the Epstein files,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor, and he proceeded to describe the nearly century-old law the minority would use to try to compel the release of the \"full and complete Epstein files.\"",
      "The federal law, known as Section 2954 and referred to as the \"Rule of Five,\" allows five members on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs to submit an information request on matters within its jurisdiction to a federal agency. Enacted in 1928, the obscure law is part of Congress' ability to wield influence over executive branch agencies, and gives minority members of the oversight committees the ability to request information without the help of the committee chairman.",
      "The move comes as controversy has swirled around the Epstein files in recent weeks, after the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that was met with anger from many of Mr. Trump's supporters. The review found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019, had blackmailed prominent figures. But the issue has divided Mr. Trump's base, with many in both parties calling for more transparency as the president has called the controversy a \"hoax.\" And Democrats have sought to capitalize on the GOP infighting.",
      "\"The situation with the Epstein files is very simple \u2014 Donald Trump promised transparency and he has broken that promise,\" Schumer said. \"As a candidate, Trump said on many occasions he would release the Epstein files if elected, and yet he has refused to do so.\"",
      "Schumer accused Republicans of choosing to \"hide\" on the Epstein files, saying, \"if there's nothing to hide, why all the evasiveness?\"",
      "The rule has rarely been used. In 2017, Democrats tried to force the release of documents relating to the leasing of the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., which became the site of a Trump hotel. And in 2001, Democrats under former President George W. Bush attempted to compel documents about the 2000 census. Still, with infrequent use, whether the rule could be enforced in court remains to be seen.",
      "Schumer said the request covers \"all documents, files, evidence or other materials in the possession of the Department of Justice or the FBI related to the case of United States v. Jeffrey Epstein.\" He noted the request includes records related to Epstein and his clients, while \"ensuring that the private information of any victims is protected.\" The minority leader said the Democrats expect the Justice Department to provide the information by Aug. 15.",

      "Long a critic of the FDA for granting emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccine boosters, Prasad had called Marks \"one of the most dangerous, pro-pharma regulators of the 21st century\" and said he was \"either incompetent or corrupt to authorize a booster without clinical, randomized data.\"",
      "In his three-month tenure at the FDA, the agency decided to limit COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to people 65 years of age and older and others who are at high risk of becoming seriously ill if they are infected, and will require manufacturers to conduct clinical trials to show whether the vaccines are of benefit to healthy younger adults and children.",
      "Earlier this month, the FDA released records that showed Prasad overrode career staff at the agency to limit the approvals of COVID-19 shots from Novavax and Moderna.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 20:16:00 -0400",
    "summary": "From vaccines to fluoride, here's what the newly confirmed CDC director Susan Monarez has said about some key health topics.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Senate voted Tuesday along party lines, 51 to 47, to confirm Susan Monarez as the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "President Trump nominated her for the role in March, praising her as \"an incredible mother and dedicated public servant\" who \"understands the importance of protecting our children, our communities, and our future.\"",
      "Monarez has been serving as the acting head of the CDC since January, and previously worked as the head of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. She was viewed as somewhat surprising pick for the CDC role because unlike most recent CDC directors, she holds a Ph.D. but is not a medical doctor.",
      "The CDC\u00a0said\u00a0Monarez \"brings decades of distinguished experience in health innovation, disaster preparedness, global health, and biosecurity\" to the agency, and will help advance the \"mission to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "At her confirmation hearing before the Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pension (HELP) committee on July 9, Monarez garnered praise from the Republican chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, who is a physician, for her commitment to rebuilding public trust in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats on the committee grilled her about the impact of cuts in federal funding for health programs and medical research, and expressed concern about the CDC's role under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Monarez was questioned by committee members about a range of health topics. Here are some of those highlights.",
      "Monarez on vaccines",
      "Monarez faced a number of questions about vaccine recommendations.\u00a0Kennedy\u00a0has been a longtime vaccine critic who has pushed a discredited theory linking routine childhood shots to autism, but during her hearing, Monarez refuted that view and stated that she has \"not seen a causal link between vaccines and autism.\"",
      "Amid a growing measles outbreak this year, Kennedy has\u00a0acknowledged the vaccine's efficacy\u00a0against the disease while still saying he supports individual choice. In a March interview with CBS News, Kennedy publicly encouraged people to get the measles vaccine.",
      "\"If I'm confirmed as CDC director, I look forward to supporting the secretary with science and evidence, and making sure that I am giving him the best information possible,\" Monarez said at her confirmation hearing. \"Measles is an important health threat and we have to make sure we are doing everything that we can to prevent and mitigate it.\"",
      "Monarez was also asked about the continued availability and affordability of vaccines if the CDC's vaccine advisory panel, made up of new RFK Jr. appointees, makes changes to recommendations.",
      "\"Vaccines absolutely save lives, and if I'm confirmed as CDC director, I commit to making sure we continue to prioritize vaccine availability,\" she said.",
      "Monarez on fluoride",
      "Fluoride, another topic Kennedy has spotlighted, was also a subject of discussion during Monarez's hearing. This year, two states, Utah and Florida, became the first to ban the use of fluoride in drinking water, where it's been added for decades to help prevent tooth decay.",
      "\"Fluoride is an important component to oral health, and there are various aspects of using fluoride to improve oral health \u2014 a direct application can be very valuable,\" Monarez said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland specifically asked Monarez whether the water in Potomac, Maryland, which has fluoridation, is safe for families.",
      "Monarez replied: \"I believe the water in Potomac, Maryland is safe.\"",
      "Monarez on RFK Jr. and the measles outbreak",
      "Measles came up repeatedly as senators questioned Monarez about how she would interact with Kennedy in her role at the CDC.",
      "\"The CDC director can't perform this critical role unless they are politically independent. Which means that you must be willing to disagree with political leaders based on scientific evidence,\" Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire said. \"So, is there anything that you disagree with Secretary Kennedy about?\"",
      "\"If I'm confirmed as CDC director, I look forward to having technical discussions with the secretary. He has said he values and prioritizes independent thinking and using science to drive decision making,\" Monarez replied. \"I am an independent thinker, and I am a scientist, and I will welcome the opportunity to share my opinions based on science and evidence with him as he makes some of these very difficult decisions.\"",
      "After Monarez sidestepped a question from Hassan about whether she disagrees with anything Kennedy has done, the senator got more specific, asking about Kennedy's claim that it's \"very difficult for measles to kill a healthy person.\" This year's measles outbreak, centered in West Texas, killed two children who doctors said did not have previous health conditions.",
      "Monarez replied that measles is an \"important public health threat\" that can be lethal.",
      "Alexander  Tin\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 08:27:00 -0400",
    "summary": "\"It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground,\" an oceanography professor says.",
    "story": [
      "An 8.8-magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, prompting tsunami warnings in coastal towns in multiple countries.",
      "The earthquake was \"on what we call the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is a region around the entire Pacific Rim renowned for significant earthquakes,\" Simon Boxall, lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Earth is made up of these sort of geology plates, these geophysical plates, and the Earth where these plates rub, where they sort of join, we get stresses building up, and then every so often we get a sudden release of pressure and part of the seabed flips up,\" Boxall said. \"And so it's that flip that causes the tsunami. And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",
      "Boxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"",
      "Two magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 in Japan and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake in Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.",
      "Earthquake scientist Grace Sethanant said there was a reason those temblors caused much more devastating tsunamis than Wednesday's quake.",
      "While a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 \u2026 in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.",
      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ... And that's why the tsunamis in those events were much more devastating.\"",
      "National Tsunami Warning Center  Tsunami Warning Coordinator Dave Snider said tsunamis should be thought of more as \"ocean floods\" than waves.",
      "\"The most important thing to understand about a tsunami is this is not a surf wave, it's not a wind wave,\" Snider said. \"A tsunami is the entire ocean column that is being lifted above that high tide level there because of that extreme movement of the Earth's crust with the earthquake there, so this is a significant planetary event that we've just witnessed.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 12:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Crew 11 flight includes three fliers headed for space after reassignments in the wake of problems with Boeing's Starliner capsule.",
    "story": [
      "NASA will wait at least another day to send a fresh crew to the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, including three fliers who were assigned to the flight after NASA ran into problems with Boeing's troubled Starliner capsule last year.",
      "Liftoff from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, originally set for 12:09 p.m. EDT Thursday, was scrubbed minutes before liftoff due to weather conditions. The launch was timed for roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the Falcon 9 rocket into alignment with the space station's orbit \u2014 a requirement for rendezvous missions.",
      "Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman originally expected to fly to the space station last fall, but she and Crew 9 crewmate Stephanie Wilson were bumped from the flight to free up two seats to bring Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams back to Earth after an extended stay in space.",
      "Wilmore and Williams flew to the orbital lab complex last June in the first piloted flight of a Starliner. But their stay in space was extended because of Starliner propulsion system problems. NASA managers eventually opted to bring them down earlier this year aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, using the seats given up by Cardman and Wilson.",
      "\"If I think about it only as an individual, and how it affected me, yes, of course, it was an unexpected change,\" Cardman said. \"But space flight is not about me or about any individual. It's about what we can do together. None of us can do this by ourselves.",
      "\"Now I have the opportunity to train with this wonderful, amazing crew. Life is a journey. It takes many turns, and I'm just grateful to be here.\"",
      "Cardman's co-pilot for the Crew 11 mission is NASA's Michael Fincke, a 58-year-old three-flight veteran who trained to fly aboard Boeing's Starliner as did Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. In the wake of the problems encountered last year during the Starliner test flight, and the expected long delay before it's launched again, both ended up assigned to Crew 11.",
      "The fourth crew member is Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, a space rookie. Like his crewmates, he also expected to fly aboard another spacecraft, in his case, a Russian Soyuz.",
      "But he ended up assigned to Crew 11 as part of a joint U.S.-Russian seat-swap program intended to ensure at least one representative of each country is always on board the ISS even if one crew ferry ship has to depart in an emergency, taking all of its crew members with it. Platonov is the seventh cosmonaut to fly aboard a Crew Dragon under theagreement.",
      "Fincke said the crew is more than ready for launch.",
      "\"Space has been calling my name ever since I returned from my last mission in 2011,\" he posted on the social media platform X. \"Our crew is ready. Let's do this! Go Falcon, Go Dragon, Go Crew-11!\"",
      "Their ride to the station \u2014 the Crew Dragon Endeavour \u2014 is making its sixth flight, a new record for NASA and SpaceX.",
      "Steven Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program, said SpaceX is working to certify Crew Dragons for up to 15 flights. The SpaceX ferry ships currently are certified for five flights, but Stich said a detailed analysis of Endeavour's flight history, performance and test results allowed NASA to clear the ship for a sixth flight.",
      "\"Our focus here is to really get to this particular launch, to make sure that we have everything cleared for six flights, and then down the road, we may have a little bit more work to do depending on the specific vehicle and how many flights it is.",
      "\"The overall goal was 15 flights, and we've gotten there on many components. Now we're just down to a handful that really are there (confirmed good) for only six flights.\"",
      "Catching up with the space station",
      "It will take the Crew Dragon 39 hours to catch up with the station. After passing about 1,200 feet directly below the outpost, Endeavour will loop up, cross in front of the lab and then on up to a point directly above the forward Harmony module's space-facing port. From there, it will move straight down for docking.",
      "The crew will be welcomed aboard by Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese station commander Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, who were launched to the station on March 14. Also on hand will be Soyuz MS-27/73S cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky along with NASA's Jonny Kim, launched from Kazakhstan on April 8.",
      "Also on board: clothing and personal items for Cardman that were launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, turning 38, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",
      "\"My whole history, the people who have brought me to where I am today, I think it's going to feel really special to feel that connection to my dad, to my parents on my birthday in space.\"",
      "Cardman and her crewmates are replacing the Crew 10 fliers, who planned to undock Aug. 6, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast to close out a 145-day mission. Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",
      "Added Ayers, who said she'll miss the opportunity to photograph Earth from the vantage point of space: \"In addition to what Anne and Tak said, I'm actually looking forward to a big, juicy burger on the beach.\"",
      "Planning for months in orbit",
      "It's not yet known how long Crew 11 will be on board the space station.",
      "Up to this point, long-duration crews, U.S. and Russian, have typically spent around six months in orbit. But starting with the Soyuz MS-27/73S mission, the Russians have switched to eight-month stays. NASA may follow suit starting with the Crew 12 mission next year.",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would reduce NASA funding by nearly 25 percent while directing the agency to scale back work aboard the ISS in favor of more aggressive planning for eventual crewed missions to Mars.",
      "NASA managers are now considering lengthening crew stays and possibly reducing Dragon crews from four to three and perhaps just two, one American and one Russian. A reduced crew would need fewer resupply missions, saving additional money. But it would sharply reduce the amount of research that could be carried out.",
      "No final decisions have been made.",
      "\"When we launch ... we have a six-month mission duration that we baseline,\" said Stich. \"We can extend the mission in real time as needed as we better understand the reconciliation bill and the appropriations process and what that means relative to the overall station manifest.\"",
      "For her part, Cardman said she would welcome an additional two months in orbit.",
      "\"I can't wait to be in space, and two extra months would be a gift,\" she said. \"Yes, we're baselined for six months right now, with the ability to extend that pending further analysis. For me, it would be an absolute privilege to stay for even longer.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

      "Indeed and Glassdoor, the job search and employee review firms, are slashing a total of roughly 1,300 jobs as their parent company, Japan's Recruit Holdings, embraces artificial intelligence.",
      "In an email to employees Thursday, Recruit Holdings CEO Hisayuki \"Deko\" Idekoba said that \"AI is changing the world\" and that the company must adapt accordingly. The layoffs represent about 6% of Recruit Holdings' HR technology workforce.",
      "The cuts will target the companies' research and development, as well as \"people & sustainability,\" teams in the U.S., but other areas and regions will also be affected, according to Recruit Holdings. The company will send notices to employees who are losing their jobs on Thursday.",
      "The move reflects Recruit Holdings' focus on using AI to transform how job-seekers look for work and how employers handle recruitment. As part of that effort, the company will fold Glassdoor operations into Indeed, the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong is stepping down.",
      "\"[W]hen we think about HR industry, which is $300 billion-plus industry, but it includes like 60% or 65% of human labor manual cost. It's very difficult to find that big industry with such a high percentage of human labor manual cost,\" Idekoba said in May at a JPMorgan Chase technology conference. \"And so what we believe is, basically, how can we simplify hiring with using AI and technology and data to reduce manual work. That's what we are focusing on.\"",
      "He added that about one-third of the company's new programming code is written by AI, and that he expects that figure to jump to one-half. \"It's going to be 50% pretty soon,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs come as corporate leaders tout AI's capabilities, while some experts warn that the technology could lead to job losses. Speaking in June at the the Aspen Ideas Festival, for example, Ford CEO Jim Farley said AI is likely to replace half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.",

    "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 10:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review a trade court's decision invalidating President Trump's 10% tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Thursday is considering\u00a0President Trump's use of an emergency powers law to impose sweeping tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is hearing arguments in the Trump administration's appeal of a ruling from a trade-focused lower court that found the president did not have the authority to hit foreign nations with 10% tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.",
      "While a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked the sweeping duties that the president assessed on most countries, the Federal Circuit temporarily reinstated the tariffs while it considers the dispute.",
      "The legal fights before the appeals court were brought by a group of 12 states and five small businesses, and their cases are a major test of the centerpiece of Mr. Trump's economic agenda. The Federal Circuit's decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court, though a ruling in favor of Mr. Trump from the conservative court is far from certain.",
      "The president pointed to the hearing on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning, saying, \"To all of my great lawyers who have fought so hard to save our Country, good luck in America's big case today. If our Country was not able to protect itself by using TARIFFS AGAINST TARIFFS, WE WOULD BE \"DEAD,\" WITH NO CHANCE OF SURVIVAL OR SUCCESS. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "The president has relied on tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he said are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Since Mr. Trump announced his sprawling tariff regime on April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" the administration has said it reached trade deals with five Asian countries, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Many economists argue tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth.",
      "The tariffs announced in early April set a 10% baseline tariff on nearly every country, and reciprocal tariffs above the 10% rate on dozens of trading partners. While the reciprocal levies were initially supposed to take effect April 9, Mr. Trump issued a 90-day pause and lowered the rate for countries subject to the higher tariffs to 10%. Some of those higher\u00a0reciprocal duties are set to go back into place Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump has since said that he would increase the blanket tariff rate for nations that don't enter into trade deals with the U.S. to \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range.\"",
      "Only the so-called Liberation Day tariffs, and higher levies on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican imports that the president said were to combat the trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S., are at issue in the cases before the Federal Circuit.",
      "No president before Mr. Trump had invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs, and the Constitution vests the power to assess levies in Congress. IEEPA does not include any references to tariffs or duties, and it has typically been used by presidents to impose economic sanctions on foreign nations.",
      "Under IEEPA, the president can exercise the law's authority in instances involving \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security or the economy for which \"a national emergency has been declared.\"",
      "In rolling out his tariffs, Mr. Trump claimed that trade deficits and the flow of illicit drugs across U.S. borders constituted national emergencies and were threats to national security and the economy.",
      "But the challengers to his tariffs argue that trade deficits have persisted for 50 years, and they warned that if allowed, the president would have limitless power to set tariffs of any amount against any product.",
      "\"By the government's telling, IEEPA empowers the president to impose whatever tariffs he chooses any time he finds (in his assertedly unreviewable discretion) that a trade deficit is creating significant national problems,\" lawyers for the small businesses wrote in a filing.",
      "They also argued that a different law, a provision of the Trade Act of 1974, governs the president's imposition of tariffs in response to trade deficits, but caps the duties at 15% and limits their duration to five months.",
      "In addition to claiming that IEEPA does not authorize Mr. Trump's tariffs, lawyers for the small businesses and states argue that they violate the major questions and nondelegation doctrines, legal principles that have in recent years been raised by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "Under the major questions doctrine, an agency that seeks to decide an issue of major political or economic significance must have clear authorization from Congress. And under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress cannot delegate its legislative power to executive branch agencies unless it sets out an \"intelligible\" and judicially enforceable principle to guide an agency.",
      "\"Congress alone has constitutional authority to impose tariffs,\" lawyers for the states wrote in a filing. \"But under President Trump's reading of IEEPA, Congress gave him the authority to rewrite the tariff schedules at his whim.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended the tariffs and said they were imposed because the president believes they are needed to address \"grave threats\" to U.S. national security and the economy.",
      "\"President Trump has found that America's exploding trade deficit, the implications of that deficit for our economy and national security, and a fentanyl importation crisis that has claimed thousands of American lives constitute national emergencies,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They noted that Mr. Trump's plans for tariffs were a key component of his 2024 presidential campaign and said they've been successful at sparking negotiations on trade deals with U.S. partners.",
      "\"The CIT's injunction would, if affirmed, disrupt the Executive Branch's ongoing, sensitive diplomatic negotiations with virtually every major trading partner. And it would unilaterally deprive the United States of a powerful tool for combating systemic distortions in the global trading system, thus allowing other nations to continue to hold American exporters hostage to their unreasonable, discriminatory, and sometimes retaliatory trade policies,\" Justice Department lawyers argued.",

      "Washington \u2014 Former Vice President Kamala Harris won't run for California governor next year, she announced Wednesday afternoon in a statement.",
      "\"In recent months, I have given serious thought to asking the people of California for the privilege to serve as their governor,\" the 60-year-old Oakland native and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee said. \"I love this state, its people, and its promise. It is my home. But after deep reflection, I've decided that I will not run for governor in this election.\"",
      "\"For now, my leadership\u2014and public service\u2014will not be in elected office,\" she added.",
      "Declining a gubernatorial bid gives Harris a window to run for president in 2028. Since Harris' defeat in her truncated 2024 presidential run, which followed then-President Joe Biden's decision to drop his reelection bid, the Democratic Party has wondered what Harris' next political move will be. In May, sources familiar with Harris' thinking said she was weighing a campaign to be California's chief executive, a third run for the White House or not seeking elected office.",
      "Harris announced on Thursday that she's written a book about her 2024 campaign that will be released in September. It's called \"107 Days,\" highlighting the breakneck pace of her last-minute bid for the presidency.",
      "\"What the world saw on the campaign trail was only part of the story,\" she wrote. \"My new book is a behind-the-scenes look at my experience leading the shortest presidential campaign in modern history. 107 Days is out on September 23. I can't wait for you to read it.\"",
      "A source close to Vice President Kamala Harris told CBS News that while Harris \"seriously considered\" a run for California governor in 2026, she ultimately decided against it \u2014 concluding she can have more impact for her party on a national stage and that her \"heart wasn't into running for governor\".",
      "\"She grappled with it,\" the source said about a possible gubernatorial bid. \"There were a lot of conversations over the last few months. But she's been a public servant for her whole career.\" The source said she wants to take time to experience life as a private citizen.",
      "According to the source, Harris felt tempted by the idea of leading her home state, but instead, she is finding other ways to remain engaged in public life \u2014 including potentially writing a book, launching her nonprofit and traveling the country to campaign for Democratic candidates ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"She genuinely has not decided about a 2028 presidential run,\" the source said, adding the decision not to seek the governorship \"keeps the door open\" for a potential run in 2028.",
      "Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, are back in California. Emhoff returned to private law practice, and he teaches at the University of Southern California.",
      "Below is Harris' full statement:",
      "\"Over the past six months, I have spent time reflecting on this moment in our nation's history, and the best way for me to continue fighting for the American people and advancing the values and ideals I hold dear.",
      "I am a devout public servant, and from the earliest days of my career, I have believed that the best way I could make a difference in people's lives and fight for a better future was to improve the system from within. And it has been a profound honor to do that work and serve the people of California and our nation\u2014as a prosecutor, Attorney General, United States Senator, and Vice President.",
      "In recent months, I have given serious thought to asking the people of California for the privilege to serve as their Governor. I love this state, its people, and its promise. It is my home. But after deep reflection, I've decided that I will not run for Governor in this election.",
      "I have extraordinary admiration and respect for those who dedicate their lives to public service\u2014service to their communities and to our nation. At the same time, we must recognize that our politics, our government, and our institutions have too often failed the American people, culminating in this moment of crisis. As we look ahead, we must be willing to pursue change through new methods and fresh thinking\u2014committed to our same values and principles, but not bound by the same playbook.",
      "For now, my leadership\u2014and public service\u2014will not be in elected office. I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans.",
      "In the United States of America, power must lie with the people. And We, the People must use our power to fight for freedom, opportunity, fairness, and the dignity of all. I will remain in that fight.\"",

      "State Police arrested Andrew James McGann at a barbershop in Springdale, said Col. Stacie Rhoads, commander of the department's criminal investigation division. He was charged with two counts of capital murder and was being held Thursday in the state's Washington County jail.",
      "Police announced the arrest at a Wednesday night news conference but wouldn't discuss a motive. McGann had been hired at Springdale Public Schools as a teacher candidate for the upcoming year but hadn't yet come into contact with any of its families or students, the district said in a statement.",

      "\"Our entire team extends our deepest condolences to the Brink family. Their children are especially in our thoughts and prayers,\" Cleveland said.",
      "Sierra Marcum said three years ago, her son was a student in McGann's fourth grade classroom in Donald Elementary School in Flower Mound, Texas, and described him as the \"most standoff teacher\" she had ever met. Her son's yearbook includes a photo of McGann.",
      "\"Pretty cold. You could ask him a question and he would give you a one word response,\" she said. \"Overall just pretty disinterested in his students.\"",
      "Marcum told CBS News that, over the course of the school year, her son reported inappropriate behavior by McGann toward the girls in his class. It included being \"very touchy with the girls and having them on his lap and making comments to them and keeping them back from recess.\"",
      "In an email sent to parents in 2023 and shared with CBS News, a school administrator said McGann was placed on leave pending the results of an investigation into \"complaints of poor classroom management and poor professional judgment.\"",
      "\"While our investigation did not find any evidence of inappropriate behavior with a student, we did find his classroom management and professional judgment to be below our district's expectations,\" the email said.",

    "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 06:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Statistics indicate Texas saw nearly a quarter of all ICE arrests during President Trump's first 5 months in office. About 11% of arrests occurred in Florida and 7% in California.",
    "story": [
      "Most of the more than 109,000 arrests carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first five months of President Trump's second term took place in border and Southern states, according to a CBS News analysis of government data.",
      "States in the southern U.S., as well as those along the border with Mexico, saw the highest levels of ICE arrests between the start of Mr. Trump's second term on Jan. 20 and June 27, the figures show.",
      "That continued a trend that predates the current administration, though ICE arrests have increased sharply across the country since last year. During the same time period in 2024, under the Biden administration, ICE made over 49,000 arrests, meaning that arrests by the agency have increased by 120% under the Trump administration.",
      "The statistics indicate that Texas saw nearly a quarter of all ICE arrests during that time period. About 11% of ICE arrests occurred in Florida and 7% in California, followed by 4% in Georgia and 3% in Arizona. ICE made the fewest arrests in Vermont, Alaska and Montana, about 100 total apprehensions combined.",
      "The locations of a small percentage of the arrests could not be discerned from the dataset, which was obtained by a group known as the Deportation Data Project through litigation.",
      "Overall, the individuals arrested by ICE between Jan. 20 and June 27 came from nearly 180 countries, but most were from Latin America or the Caribbean, according to the data.",
      "Mexico was the most common country of citizenship, with nearly 40,000 of those taken into ICE custody listed as Mexican citizens. Nationals of Guatemala and Honduras followed with around 15,000 and 12,000, respectively. Nearly 8,000 were citizens of Venezuela and over 5,000 of El Salvador.",
      "Immigration experts said the concentration of arrests in Southern and border states is not necessarily surprising and can largely be attributed to geography, demographics and the extent to which local law enforcement agencies cooperate with ICE.",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, explained that ICE tends to focus its resources in areas where local policies permit law enforcement interaction with federal immigration authorities, such as Texas and Florida. Other places, like California, may also see high levels of ICE arrests because they have large communities of immigrants, including those in the U.S. illegally, even though state and local policies limit collaboration with ICE.",
      "\"It's easier for ICE to be picking people up from state and local jails where there's cooperation,\" Bush-Joseph said. In cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies, \"ICE has to spend more resources picking up people for at-large arrests,\" she added.",
      "Bush-Joseph also noted the countries of origin for those arrested by ICE align with broader immigration trends. \"Generally, we're talking about countries that are geographically close\" to the U.S., she said.",
      "Latin American and Caribbean immigrants accounted for 84% of all unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2023, according to a recent report from the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "ICE is responsible for arresting, detaining and deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, as well as other noncitizens who lose their legal status, including because of criminal activity. The agency has been given a sweeping mandate by Mr. Trump, tasked with carrying out his campaign promise of overseeing the largest mass deportation effort in American history.",
      "Under the Trump administration, ICE has reversed Biden-era limits on arrests in the interior of the country and allowed deportation agents to arrest a broader group of individuals, including those who are in the U.S. illegally but who lack a criminal record.",
      "Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director, told CBS News recently that while his agents are still prioritizing the arrest of violent offenders who are in the U.S. illegally, anyone found to be in the country in violation of federal immigration law will be taken into custody.",
      "Halfway into Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, ICE recorded 150,000 deportations, putting the agency on track to carry out the most removals since the Obama administration, over a decade ago, CBS News reported. The tally is still far short of the 1 million annual deportations Trump officials have said they're targeting.",

A 10th execution is scheduled for Aug. 19 and an 11th on Aug. 28.",
      "A death warrant signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis directs that 60-year-old Edward Zakrzewski be executed by lethal injection at 6 p.m. Thursday at Florida State Prison near Starke. Zakrzewski's final appeal for a stay was rejected Wednesday by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The highest previous annual total of recent Florida executions is eight in 2014, since the death penalty was restored in 1976 by the U.S. Supreme Court. Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, while Texas and South Carolina are tied for second place with four each.",
      "Zakrzewski, an Air Force veteran, was sentenced to die for the 1994 slayings of his 34-year-old wife, Sylvia, and their children Edward, 7, and 5-year-old Anna, at their home in Okaloosa County in the Panhandle. Trial testimony showed he committed the killings after his wife sought a divorce and he had told others he would kill his family rather than allow that.",
      "Sylvia was attacked first with a crowbar and strangled with a rope, testimony shows. Both children were killed with the machete, and Sylvia was also struck with the blade when Zakrzewski thought she had survived the previous assault.",
      "Opponents of the execution point to Zakrzewski's military service and the fact that a jury voted 7-5 to recommend his execution, barely a majority of the panel. He couldn't be executed with such a split jury vote under current state law. The trial judge imposed three death sentences on Zakrzewski.",
      "The Action Network, which organized an anti-execution petition, asked people to call DeSantis' office and read a prepared script urging a stay of execution for Zakrzewski.",

      "Twenty-six men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and 11 other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025.",
      "Florida was also the last state to execute someone, when Michael Bernard Bell died by lethal injection on July 15. DeSantis also signed a warrant for the 10th execution this year for Kayle Bates, who abducted a woman from an insurance office and killed her more than four decades ago.",
      "Wednesday night, DeSantis issued a death warrant for Curtis Windom, 59, convicted of killing three people in the Orlando area in 1992. His execution is scheduled for Aug. 28.",

      "The decision to hold rates steady marks a continuation of the Fed's \"wait-and-see\" strategy this year, as it monitors the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices. But Wednesday's policy statement also underscored that the growth remains steady despite concerns about slowing economic activity.",
      "\"Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"",
      "Two voting FOMC members, Fed Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, voted in favor of lowering the central bank's short-term rate \u2014 a rare show of dissent at the Fed, where monetary policy is generally set by consensus. It is the first time since 1993 that two member of the Fed's Board of Governors have voted against the chair, according to Capital Economics.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has faced pressure in recent months from President Trump to lower rates, with the president arguing that inflation remains relatively tame.",
      "In a press conference on Wednesday, Powell said most FOMC members voted in favor of maintaining the current rate because inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual target, while also describing the economy as remaining in good shape.",
      "\"The economy is not performing as though restrictive policy were holding it back inappropriately,\" he said.",
      "Powell added, \"The economy is in good shape, but it's an unusual situation in that you have risks to both sides of the mandate,\" referring to the Fed's dual goal of keeping both prices and unemployment low.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The central bank on Wednesday said it would maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank cut interest rates was in December 2024, when it trimmed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "Wall Street had anticipated the Fed's decision, with economists pegging the probability the central bank would hold rates steady at 96%, according to financial data firm FactSet.",

      "Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, thinks the dissents by Bowman and Waller represent a minority opinion on the FOMC, with most of the rate-setting panel's voting members preferring to hold rates steady amid amid concern about inflation.",
      "Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, with the Consumer Price Index rising\u00a0in June to an annualized rate of 2.7%. At the same time, the economy remains solid. The economy grew at a stronger-than-expected 3% rate between April and June, according to data released Wednesday, with economists saying the rebound in growth from earlier this year supports the Fed's argument for keeping rates steady.",
      "\"This [GDP] report is unlikely to shift the Federal Reserve's stance,\" said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email prior to the Fed's decision. The central bank will \"wait for more consistent signals before considering rate cuts.\"",
      "When could the Fed cut rates?",
      "Economists currently predict a 63% likelihood the Fed will cut rates at its two-day meeting on Sept. 16-17, according to FactSet. The FOMC, the central bank's rate-setting panel, doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Although the economy has proved resilient despite concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs, some economists expect growth to lag and inflation to accelerate over the next few months. Following the latest Fed statement, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs forecast that the Fed will ease its benchmark rate by a total of 0.75 percentage points by year-end, starting in September.",
      "Asked whether the Fed could cut rates at the September meeting, Powell demurred, saying that the decision will be based on economic data that is released between now and the central bank's next meeting on Sept. 16-17. In the lead-up to that decision, the Fed will assess two monthly job reports from the Department of Labor and two additional months' of CPI data.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced a 25% tariff rate on imports from India ahead of his administration's Aug. 1 deadline to strike trade deals with dozens of other countries. American importers such as Walmart are on the hook for paying the tariffs, although many companies stocked up on goods earlier this year to try to avoid hiking prices for inflation-weary customers.",
      "\"We know from surveys that companies have every intention of putting [the tariff costs] through to consumers,\" Powell said. \"A reasonable base case is these are one-time price effects.\"",

    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",

Clinton and Cristen died heroes, protecting their little girls and they deserve justice. They will forever live on in all of our hearts.\"",

He was believed to be wearing a long-sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up instead of a dark tank top that was originally reported. He was seen driving toward a park exit in a black, four-door sedan with a license plate partly covered by tape.",

    "summary": "France and the United Kingdom also made statements this month about recognizing a Palestinian state in September at the U.N. General Assembly meeting.",
    "story": [
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada will recognize Palestine as a state in September at the United Nations General Assembly, following similar announcements from the United Kingdom and France.",
      "\"The deepening suffering of civilians leaves no room for delay in co-ordinated international action to support peace, security, and the dignity of all human life,\" Carney said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Canada has had a long-standing position supporting the idea of an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel, but has said recognition should come as part of a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict. Carney said Wednesday that prospects of a two-state solution \"have been steadily and gravely eroded.\"",
      "\"Preserving a two-state solution means standing with all people who choose peace over violence or terrorism, and honouring their innate desire for the peaceful co-existence of Israeli and Palestinian states as the only roadmap for a secure and prosperous future,\" Carney said.",
      "Canada said its recognition is \"predicated on the Palestinian Authority's commitment to much-needed reforms, including the commitments by Palestinian Authority President [Mahmoud] Abbas to fundamentally reform its governance, to hold general elections in 2026 in which Hamas can play no part, and to demilitarize the Palestinian state.\"",
      "Hamas must also immediately release all hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks on Israel, disarm and \"play no role in the future governance of Palestine,\" Carney reiterated.",
      "\"Canada will always steadfastly support Israel's existence as an independent state in the Middle East living in peace and security. Any path to lasting peace for Israel also requires a viable and stable Palestinian state, and one that recognizes Israel's inalienable right to security and peace,\" the prime minister said.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry denounced Canada's decision on Wednesday, calling it \"a reward for Hamas.\"",
      "\"Israel rejects the statement by the Prime Minister of Canada,\" the Israeli Foreign Ministry said on social media. \"The change in the position of the Canadian government at this time is a reward for Hamas and harms the efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of the hostages.\"",
      "President Trump reacted to the announcement with a post on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\"Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine. That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them. Oh' Canada!!!\" Mr. Trump said.",

      "The United Kingdom\u00a0and\u00a0France\u00a0each decided this month to recognize a Palestinian state as pressure has mounted on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza.",
      "Starmer said the U.K. will recognize Palestine as a state unless Israel takes \"substantive steps\" to end the \"appalling situation in Gaza,\" including the establishment of a ceasefire in Gaza, a commitment to halting the annexation of territory in the West Bank and a pledge to work toward a peace process involving a two-state solution. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the decision, saying in a statement posted on X that \"Starmer rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism & punishes its victims.\"",
      "\"Consistent with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said. \"The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population.\" Netanyahu said Israel \"strongly\" condemned France's decision and that it \"rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became.\"",
      "In response to \"growing European initiatives to recognize a Palestinian state,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of those taken hostage in Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack, on Wednesday said, \"Recognizing a Palestinian state while 50 hostages remain trapped in Hamas tunnels amounts to rewarding terrorism. Such recognition is not a step toward peace, but rather a clear violation of international law and a dangerous moral and political failure that legitimizes horrific war crimes.\"",
      "Some 1,200 people were killed in Hamas' 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, mostly civilians. Israel says 251 people were taken hostage, with 50 still being held in Gaza, including one abducted before the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "Since then, more than 60,000 people have been killed in Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, most of whom are women and children, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths.",
      "Food security experts warn that the entire population of Gaza is facing famine unless unfettered humanitarian aid is immediately allowed into the territory.",
      "\"If the international community truly desires peace, it must join U.S. efforts by demanding first the release of all hostages, followed by an end to the fighting. Recognition of a Palestinian state before the hostages are returned will be remembered throughout history as validating terrorism as a legitimate pathway to political goals,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.",

      "\"A tsunami is not just one wave,\" said Dan Snider, the tsunami warning coordinator with the National Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska. \"It's a series of powerful waves over a long period of time. Tsunamis cross the ocean at hundreds of miles an hour \u2014 as fast as a jet airplane \u2014 in deep water. But when they get close to the shore, they slow down and start to pile up. And that's where that inundation problem becomes a little bit more possible there.\"",

      "The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, which lifted the Hawaii warning, had forecast that the estimated arrival time of the first tsunami waves there would be 7:17 p.m. Tuesday local time (1:17 a.m. Wednesday ET). Officials urged people to move inland and shelters were opened in many parts of Hawaii. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said that Black Hawk helicopters had been activated and high-water vehicles were on standby in case authorities needed to conduct rescue operations.",

    "summary": "The United States has repatriated an American child from a large camp in northeastern Syria.",
    "story": [
      "The United States has repatriated an American child separated from their family from a sprawling camp in northeastern Syria that houses tens of thousands of people with alleged ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, the State Department said Tuesday.",
      "The department estimates that some 30,000 people from 70 countries remain in al-Hol Camp and one other similar camp, most of them wives and children of ISIS fighters as well as supporters of the extremist group. They include Iraqis as well as nationals of Western countries who traveled to join the U.S.-designated foreign terrorist group.",
      "Human rights groups for years have cited poor living conditions and pervasive violence in the al-Hol camp, which the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have administered for years. The SDF are Washington's key ally in combating ISIS in Syria and its sleeper cells, and for years have run large swaths of northeastern Syria.",
      "CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams visited the al-Hol camp in 2019 and spoke with the camp's residents. Many of them expressed remorse for their prior ties to ISIS and said they wanted to return to their home countries \u2014 often in Western Europe \u2014 but some others defended the group's terror attacks.",
      "The State Department did not give any details about the repatriation, except to say in a statement that the child \"has known nothing of life outside of the camps\" and will be reunified with their family.",
      "The U.S. military for years has been pushing for countries to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol and the smaller, separate Roj Camp. Iraq has taken back an increasing number in recent years, but many other countries have remained reluctant.",
      "\"The only durable solution to the humanitarian and security crisis in these displaced persons camps in northeast Syria is for countries of origin to repatriate, rehabilitate, reintegrate, and where appropriate, ensure accountability for their nationals,\" the State Department statement read. \"The same goes for former ISIS fighters held in detention centers in northeast Syria,\" it said, using a different abbreviation for IS.",
      "Despite difficult talks to formally merge with the country's new rulers under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, Damascus and the SDF in May reached an agreement to repatriate Syrians in the camp. Since the ouster of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December, Washington has been pushing for the two sides to implement their deal and unify Syrian territory, which would ultimately put the camp under the control of the government.",
      "Last year, shortly after Assad's government fell, CBS News was taken inside the al-Hol camp. Guards said the security situation had deteriorated since word had spread about Assad's ouster, raising optimism that they could leave the camp.",
      "The SDF did not immediately comment to the Associated Press on the repatriation.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Treasury Department on Wednesday sanctioned a Brazilian Supreme Court justice who is overseeing the case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, claiming the judge is responsible for human rights violations and politicized prosecutions.",
      "The sanctions announced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent target Alexandre de Moraes, who has served on the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court since 2017. The Trump administration accused de Moraes of abusing his authority to target political opponents, including Bolsonaro, an ally of Mr. Trump's.",
      "The justice also ordered a shutdown of X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, in Brazil last year. Access to the site was restored last October.",
      "\"Alexandre de Moraes has taken it upon himself to be judge and jury in an unlawful witch hunt against U.S. and Brazilian citizens and companies,\" Bessent said in a statement. \"De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions \u2014 including against former President Jair Bolsonaro. Today's action makes clear that Treasury will continue to hold accountable those who threaten U.S. interests and the freedoms of our citizens.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. is sanctioning de Moraes for \"serious\" human rights abuses, including detaining people without bringing charges and for infringing on freedom of expression.",
      "Rubio said de Moraes also \"abused his authority by engaging in a targeted and politically motivated effort designed to silence political critics through the issuance of secret orders compelling online platforms, including U.S. social media companies, to ban the accounts of individuals for posting protected speech.\"",
      "\"The United States will use all appropriate and effective diplomatic, political, and legal instruments to protect the speech of Americans from foreign malign actors who would seek to undermine it,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Bolsonaro is on trial for allegedly orchestrating a scheme to remain in office after Brazil's 2022 election. He was indicted in November, and prosecutors accused Brazil's former leader and seven others of seeking to \"violently overthrow the democratic order.\" Bolsonaro lost the 2022 race to his left-wing opponent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. He has denied the allegations and called the prosecution a \"witch hunt.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has publicly defended Bolsonaro and called the treatment of him an \"international disgrace.\" In a July 9 letter to Lula posted to social media, the president said the trial involving Bolsonaro is a \"witch hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\"",
      "Mr. Trump also slapped 50% tariffs on Brazilian products imported into the U.S. on Wednesday. In an executive order imposing the levies, the president said the actions of Brazil's government are \"repugnant to the moral and political values of democratic and free societies and conflict with the policy of the United States to promote democratic governments throughout the world, the principle of free expression and free and fair elections, the rule of law, and respect for human rights.\"",
      "The directive mentioned de Moraes by name and said his actions \"chill and limit expression in the United States, violate human rights, and undermine the interest that the United States has in protecting its citizens and companies at home and abroad.\"",
      "The president had said in a letter to Lula earlier this month warning of the tariffs that his administration concluded that the U.S. \"must move away from the longstanding, and very unfair trade relationship engendered by Brazil's tariff, and non-tariff, policies and trade barriers.\"",
      "The U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil and exported roughly $49 billion worth of goods to the country last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Brazil exported roughly $42 billion in products to the U.S. in 2024.",

    "story": [
      "An underwater voyage has revealed a network of creatures thriving at the bottom of deep-sea ocean trenches, researchers said in a newly published paper.",
      "The deep-sea trenches, also called Hadal trenches, are \"some of the Earth's least explored and understood environments,\" the researchers wrote. In these extreme environments, the crushing pressure, scant food and lack of sunlight can make it hard to survive. Scientists know that tiny microbes prosper there, but less is known about evidence of larger marine life.",
      "Researchers traveling along the Kuril\u2013Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches in the northwest Pacific Ocean used a manned submersible to find tubeworms and mollusks flourishing at over 31,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean goes down to about 36,000 feet.",
      "Scientists had surveyed this area before and had hints that larger creatures might live at such depths. The new discovery confirms those suspicions and shows just how extensive the communities are, said Julie Huber, a deep sea microbiologist with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.",
      "\"Look how many there are, look how deep they are,\" said Huber, who was not involved with the research. \"They don't all look the same and they're in a place that we haven't had good access to before.\"",
      "In the absence of light to make their own food, many trench-dwellers big and small survive on key elements like carbon that trickle down from higher in the ocean.",
      "Scientists think microbes in this new network may instead be capitalizing on carbon that's accumulated in the trench over time, processing it to create chemicals that seep through cracks in the ocean floor. The tubeworms and mollusks may survive by eating those tiny creatures or living with them and snacking on the products of their labor, scientists said.",
      "\"These findings challenge current models of life at extreme limits and carbon cycling in the deep ocean,\" the study's authors wrote. The researchers said that trench-dwelling life forms \"may be more widespread than previously anticipated.\"",
      "With this discovery, future studies will focus on how these deep-sea creatures adapted to survive in such extreme conditions and how exactly they harness chemical reactions for food, study authors Mengran Du with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Vladimir Mordukhovich with the Russian Academy of Sciences said in a statement.",

      "An emotional Sharon Osbourne, who was married to the musician for 43 years, stopped at the site and laid flowers at the growing memorial around the bench as fans watched from behind barriers. She was accompanied by the couple's three children, Aimee, Kelly and Jack. The latter two starred with their parents in the reality show \"The Osbournes,\" which aired in the early 2000s.",

      "After Osbourne's death, \"Crazy Train\" was streamed and played on the radio so much that the song made it onto the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the first time, ranking at No. 46 on its most recent edition.",
      "Mark Savage, a music reporter at CBS News' partner BBC News, noted that some fans have left bottles of Jack Daniel's at the memorial, reflecting Osbourne's embodiment of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle. Savage reported toy bats have also been placed at the memorial, recalling memories of Osbourne famously biting the head off of a real bat during a performance in the 1980s \u2014 he had said he thought it was a toy.",
      "Fans who couldn't make it to Birmingham to honor Osbourne were invited to watch a livestream of the bench and bridge.",

Five Eyes is an intelligence-sharing partnership that includes Australia, the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.",
      "Barrett declined to say who the offshore suspects were or identify the countries they were operating in.",
      "\"This crime was despicable as it was dangerous, and it is important to acknowledge that this was not just an arson on a synagogue,\" she added in a statement. \"The effect of this crime has rippled through a community that continues to be targeted by criminals. We will not stand for this.\"",
      "A wave of antisemitic attacks has roiled Australia since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas assault on Israel triggered the war in Gaza.

    "story": [
      "An 8.8-magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, prompting tsunami warnings in coastal towns in multiple countries.",
      "The earthquake was \"on what we call the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is a region around the entire Pacific Rim renowned for significant earthquakes,\" Simon Boxall, lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Earth is made up of these sort of geology plates, these geophysical plates, and the Earth where these plates rub, where they sort of join, we get stresses building up, and then every so often we get a sudden release of pressure and part of the seabed flips up,\" Boxall said. \"And so it's that flip that causes the tsunami. And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",
      "Boxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"",
      "Two magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 in Japan and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake in Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.",
      "Earthquake scientist Grace Sethanant said there was a reason those temblors caused much more devastating tsunamis than Wednesday's quake.",
      "While a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 \u2026 in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.",
      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ... And that's why the tsunamis in those events were much more devastating.\"",
      "National Tsunami Warning Center  Tsunami Warning Coordinator Dave Snider said tsunamis should be thought of more as \"ocean floods\" than waves.",
      "\"The most important thing to understand about a tsunami is this is not a surf wave, it's not a wind wave,\" Snider said. \"A tsunami is the entire ocean column that is being lifted above that high tide level there because of that extreme movement of the Earth's crust with the earthquake there, so this is a significant planetary event that we've just witnessed.\"",

A tsunami of that size would be akin to a three foot Wave riding on top of surf, he said.",
      "He told a new conference that a wave that size could move cars and throw fences around. \"It can dislodge trees, that's why you can't just be out there. The impact is at great speed,\" Green said. \"Any any structure that gets loose and strikes the individual could take them out. And people can drown quite easily with the force of that kind of wave.\"",

Tsunami waves efficiently wrap around islands. All shores are at risk no matter which direction they face.\"",
      "In response to the tsunami warnings, President Trump wrote in a social media post Tuesday night to \"STAY STRONG AND STAY SAFE!\"",

Cabinets toppled inside homes, mirrors were broken, cars swayed in the street and balconies on buildings shook noticeably.",
      "TASS reported power outages and mobile phone service failures in the capital of the Kamchatka region. The news agency also quoted a local Russian official as saying residents on Sakhalin Island were being evacuated and emergency services were working at full capacity.",
      "The earthquake appeared to be the strongest anywhere in the world since the March 2011 earthquake off northeast Japan that measured 9.0 magnitude and caused a massive tsunami that set off meltdowns at a Fukushima nuclear power plant. Only a few stronger earthquakes have ever been measured around the world.",
      "New Zealand authorities issued warnings of \"strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges\" along coastlines throughout the country. The alert by the government emergency management agency said people should move out of the water, off beaches and shore areas, and away from harbors, marinas, rivers and estuaries.

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 19:40:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The leading international authority on food crises predicted \"widespread death\" in Gaza without immediate action.",
    "story": [
      "The \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,\" the leading international authority on food crises said in a new alert Tuesday, predicting \"widespread death\" without immediate action.",
      "The alert, still short of a formal famine declaration, follows an outcry over images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of dozens of hunger-related deaths after nearly 22 months of war.",
      "The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. The United Nations and Palestinians on the ground say little has changed, and desperate crowds continue to overwhelm and unload delivery trucks before they can reach their destinations.",
      "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said Gaza has teetered on the brink of famine for two years, but recent developments have \"dramatically worsened\" the situation, including \"increasingly stringent blockades\" by Israel.",
      "\"Mounting evidence shows that widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease are driving a rise in hunger-related deaths. Latest data indicates that Famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of the Gaza Strip and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City,\" the IPC said. \"Immediate action must be taken to end the hostilities and allow for unimpeded, large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response. This is the only path to stopping further deaths and catastrophic human suffering.\"",
      "A formal famine declaration, which is rare, requires the kind of data that the lack of access to Gaza and mobility within it have largely denied. The IPC has only declared famine a few times \u2014 in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan's western Darfur region last year.",
      "\"Deadly turning point\" reached",
      "But independent experts say they don't need a formal declaration to know what they're seeing in Gaza.",
      "\"Just as a family physician can often diagnose a patient she's familiar with based on visible symptoms without having to send samples to the lab and wait for results, so too we can interpret Gaza's symptoms. This is famine,\" Alex de Waal, author of \"Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine\" and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, told The Associated Press.",
      "An area is classified as in famine when all three of the following conditions are confirmed:",
      "At least 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30% of children six months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height. And at least two people or four children under 5 per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.",
      "The report is based on available information through July 25 and says the crisis has reached \"an alarming and deadly turning point.\" It says data indicates that famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of Gaza \u2014 at its lowest level since the war began \u2014 and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City. The report says nearly 17 out of every 100 children under the age of 5 in Gaza City are acutely malnourished.",
      "Mounting evidence shows \"widespread starvation,\" the IPC says. Essential health and other services have collapsed. One in three people in Gaza is going without food for days at a time, according to the World Food Program. Hospitals report a rapid increase in hunger-related deaths in children under 5. Gaza's population of over 2 million has been squeezed into increasingly tiny areas of the devastated territory.",
      "The IPC's latest analysis in May warned that Gaza will likely fall into famine if Israel doesn't lift its blockade and stop its military campaign. Its new alert calls for immediate and large-scale action and warns: \"Failure to act now will result in widespread death in much of the strip.\"",
      "Israel has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. In March, it cut off the entry of all goods, including fuel, food and medicine, to pressure Hamas to free hostages.",
      "Israel eased those restrictions in May but also pushed ahead with a new U.S.-backed aid delivery system that has been wracked by chaos and violence. The traditional, U.N.-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds swarm entering convoys.",
      "While Israel says there's no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza, U.N. agencies and aid groups say even the latest humanitarian measures are not enough to counter the worsening starvation. In a statement Monday, Doctors Without Borders called the new airdrops ineffective and dangerous, saying they deliver less aid than trucks.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said no one is starving in Gaza and that Israel has supplied enough aid throughout the war, \"otherwise, there would be no Gazans.\" Israel's military on Monday criticized what it calls \"false claims of deliberate starvation in Gaza.\"",
      "Israel's closest ally now appears to disagree. \"Those children look very hungry,\" President Trump said Monday of the images from Gaza in recent days.",

      "The suspects from northern Germany were arrested months after a Nov. 22, 2022, break-in at the Celtic and Roman Museum in the Bavarian town of Manching, in which 483 Celtic coins discovered during a 1999 archaeological dig were stolen. The coins dated to around 100 B.C.",
      "The coins and a lump of unworked gold were originally discovered during excavations of an ancient settlement in Manching, and authorities have said they are considered the biggest trove of Celtic gold found in the 20th century.",
      "The heist took place in just nine minutes, investigators said. At 1:17 a.m., cables were cut at a telecoms hub nearby, leaving the region without communications networks. The museum's door was pried open at 1:26 a.m. The thieves left the building at 1:35 a.m., officials said, leaving them just a few minutes to smash open a display case and take the treasure. No alarms were triggered during the incident. The museum did not have an overnight guard.",
      "Most of the stolen treasure is still missing, but investigators found lumps of gold on one of the suspects when he was arrested that appear to have resulted from part of the treasure being melted down. Rupert Gebhard, the head of the Bavarian State Archaeological Collection in Munich, said in 2022 that seeing the coins melted down would be \"the worst option.\"",
      "The four defendants were accused of a total of 20 break-ins or attempted robberies in Germany and neighboring Austria, starting in 2014. Other cases involved safes or cash machines being broken into.",
      "The defendants didn't address the charges during the roughly six-month trial, but their lawyers called for their acquittal.",

      "The Los Angeles wildfires and severe spring thunderstorms are just a few of the natural disasters that have contributed to more than $131 billion in global losses for the first half of 2025, according to a new report from the insurance company Munich Re.",
      "Overall losses so far in 2025 were slightly lower than the same time period in 2024, but still above long-term averages.",
      "By this time last year, overall losses were slightly higher at $155 billion, adjusted for inflation. The first half of 2024 included an earthquake in Japan on New Year's Day, coupled with severe thunderstorms in the United States that spawned more than 1,250 tornadoes.",
      "Of the $131 billion in overall losses for 2025, $80 billion was insured, which is the second-highest amount for the first half of any year since recordkeeping began in 1980. The first half of 2011 is the only year where insured losses have been higher, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami in Japan.",
      "The L.A. wildfires have been the costliest natural disaster this year and are estimated to have caused $53 billion in overall losses, with $40 billion insured.",
      "Climate change played a role in the wildfires by increasing the fire weather index conditions, making them more intense and destructive, according to scientists.",
      "\"We need to face it that the losses have been on the rise and make it clear that climate change plays an ever increasing role,\" said Tobias Grimm, chief climate scientist at Munich Re.",
      "As more people move into high-risk climate areas and weather events grow more extreme due to climate change, the damages will likely keep climbing, Grimm said.",
      "Another major global disaster in 2025 was the March 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar that killed an estimated 4,500 people and caused $12 billion in losses, very little of which was insured.",

      "The infection can lead to severe muscle and joint pain, Lyme arthritis, cardiac complications and neurological conditions, experts told Fox News Digital.",
      "How to know if you have Lyme disease",
      "A telltale sign of Lyme disease is a red circular bull\u2019s-eye rash or multiple rashes on the skin, especially in tick-endemic regions.",
      "Between 60% and 80% of patients will develop a rash, according to experts.",
      "Lyme disease is prevalent this time of year, especially in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and upper-Midwest regions of the U.S.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"We're looking for specific findings, like the classic bull's-eye rash, a swollen joint or a facial droop called Bell's palsy, which can be seen with Lyme disease,\" Dr.\u00a0Andrew Handel, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Stony Brook Children's Hospital on Long Island, New York, said in an interview with Fox News Digital.",
      "Symptoms typically emerge two weeks after the bite, becoming more severe if they go untreated.",
      "AS LYME DISEASE TESTS MISS MANY ACUTE INFECTIONS, POTENTIAL AT-HOME TEST OFFERS HOPE FOR EARLIER DIAGNOSIS",
      "If the infection isn\u2019t treated at the time of the rash, patients will typically seek medical attention for later manifestations of the infection, Handel noted.",
      "Those can include Bell\u2019s palsy (facial nerve paralysis), Lyme meningitis (often marked by severe headache, neck stiffness and fever) and carditis (inflammation of heart tissues).",
      "The infection can lead to severe muscle and joint pain, Lyme arthritis, cardiac complications and neurological conditions, experts told Fox News Digital.\u00a0\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "One of the earliest signs of Lyme disease is overwhelming fatigue and joint aches, according to Dr. Daniel Cameron, an epidemiologist in Mount Kisco, New York, who specializes in tick-borne illnesses.",
      "Other symptoms may include fever, brain fog, dizziness, palpitations and nerve pain, among others.",
      "Testing, treatment and prevention",
      "A blood test can help diagnose Lyme disease, but timing matters.",
      "\"The way we diagnose Lyme disease in the blood is by looking for antibodies, for the immune system's response to the infection, as opposed to other infectious testing, where you find the bacteria itself,\" Handel told Fox News Digital.",
      "TICK BITES AND LYME DISEASE: WHAT TO DO IF A TICK BITES YOU OR YOUR PET",
      "Testing too early can result in a false negative, as antibody tests often don't turn positive until three or four weeks after the tick bite occurred.",
      "After sustaining a tick bite, experts recommend immediately removing the tick and seeing a healthcare provider.",
      "Doctors will typically prescribe a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with a 200-milligram dose of the antibiotic doxycycline to be taken within 72\u2005hours of a high-risk tick bite, epidemiologists told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"It's the immune system\u2019s lingering response to the infection that you had in the past.\"",
      "Although studies have found this dose to be effective in the majority of cases, some physicians prefer a longer course of treatment for tick bites.",
      "\"I'm not a big fan of a single dose of doxycycline [200 mg] for a tick bite, even though it's pretty popular,\" Cameron told Fox News Digital. \"I don\u2019t feel comfortable with a single dose if I really\u00a0want to avoid Lyme.\"",
      "Instead, Cameron prefers a four-week course of antibiotics for suspected Lyme disease cases. For patients who don\u2019t want to take antibiotics right away, he said he will \"watch and wait\" to see if symptoms emerge and then treat accordingly.",
      "Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterial infection that causes Lyme disease, is transmitted to humans through the bite of a black-legged (deer) tick. (iStock)",
      "The doctor recommends that patients follow up in a month to be assessed and undergo screenings for other infections if necessary.",
      "In the event that a patient develops Lyme, the disease typically responds well to a course of antibiotics, which may include doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime, according to experts.",
      "Treatment duration can vary from 10 days up to four to six weeks.",
      "Chronic Lyme vs. babesiosis",

      "Later manifestations of Lyme disease can include Bell\u2019s palsy (facial nerve paralysis) and Lyme meningitis (often marked by severe headache, neck stiffness and fever). (iStock)",

      "\"However, the current data do not support providing additional antibiotic therapy for this condition.\"",
      "The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites in the first place, experts agree.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "If someone suspects they have PTLDS, they should discuss with their physician the possibility of other diseases, such as babesiosis, which is widely regarded as the second-most common tick-borne illness in the Northeastern U.S.",
      "While babesiosis is spread by the same tick as Lyme disease, it is caused by a parasite called Babesia microti rather than a bacterium, per the CDC.",

      "A federal appeals court on Thursday will hear arguments over the legality of President\u00a0Donald Trump's sweeping tariff plan, a high-stakes court fight that comes just hours before Trump's import duties and so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs are slated to take force.",
      "At issue before the Washington-based Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is Trump\u2019s attempt to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) \u2014 a 1977 emergency law \u2014 to enact the steep import fees, and impose additional tariffs on certain trading partners.",
      "Thursday's hearing comes less than 24 hours before Trump's tariffs are slated to take force. Both sides have signaled they plan to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, if necessary.",
      "On April 2, Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, along with higher, reciprocal tariffs targeting select nations \u2014 including China. He said the measures would address trade imbalances, reduce deficits with key trading partners and boost domestic manufacturing and production.",

      "However, whether emergency tariffs are the appropriate vehicle to accomplish this is an open question and one central to Thursday's oral arguments before the appeals court.",
      "Plaintiffs in V.O.S. Selections Inc. v. Trump will argue on Thursday that the looming tariffs have already introduced confusion and volatility into markets, threatening the bottom lines of small U.S. businesses and making it extremely difficult for owners to operate under shifting guidance that seems to change on a whim.",
      "Small businesses in the U.S. have been hit with months of \"complete uncertainty,\" Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation of the Liberty Justice Center, one of the groups representing small businesses in court, said in an interview Wednesday.",

      "\"So there's no certainty on what the rate is going to be from one week to the next, and that's very difficult to do business with, when things are constantly changing.\"",
      "Judges on a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of International Trade voted unanimously to block Trump's tariffs from taking force earlier this year, ruling that, as commander in chief, Trump does not have \"unbounded authority\" to impose tariffs under the emergency law.",
      "That ruling was later paused by the appeals court in Washington, D.C., which agreed to consider the administration's request for relief.",

      "The agreements announced by the U.S. include deals with the European Union's 27-member bloc, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan and others.",
      "The U.S. and China, which threatened each other with escalating reciprocal tariffs that climbed as high as 145%, agreed at a meeting in Geneva in May to lower tariffs through at least mid-August. Talks for a longer-term deal are ongoing.",
      "Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on March 28, 2025, in New York City. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",
      "Some Trump supporters have argued the tariffs are merely a negotiating tactic to get foreign governments to the table \u2014 though the administration has repeatedly vowed to use \"all tools\" at their disposal to advance",
      "They argued in a court filing that the IEEPA is the law that Congress passed in 1977 to allow the president to respond to \"unusual and extraordinary threats\" and in cases where a national emergency has already been declared.",
      "However, plaintiffs argue that Trump\u2019s use of IEEPA to address the trade deficit is unlawful, pointing out that, by the administration\u2019s own admission, the deficit has persisted for nearly 50 years, undermining the claim of an \"unusual and extraordinary\" emergency.",
      "The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will likely move on the case quickly, with a decision expected in August. No matter the outcome, both sides have vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court, if necessary.",

      "Why lithium-ion batteries need a second life",
      "From your phone to electric vehicles and even power grids, lithium-ion batteries are everywhere. They offer unmatched energy density and can scale to meet large infrastructure demands. However, there's a catch. Even with optimal use, these batteries wear out after a few thousand charge cycles. When they die, they leave behind components such as nickel, cobalt, and manganese, materials that are expensive and environmentally damaging to mine. Without a solid plan for recycling, the clean energy revolution could create a very dirty problem.",
      "The problem with traditional battery recycling",
      "Standard recycling methods aren't quite up to the task. They're energy-intensive, generate significant emissions, and often fail to recover materials in usable form. This means many recycled batteries can't be turned into new, high-performing ones. As a result, manufacturers continue to mine for raw materials, causing further environmental harm. That's why scientists have been searching for a better way to close the loop.",

      "This reduces our dependence on destructive mining operations, lowers emissions, and makes battery manufacturing more resilient to global supply shocks. Even better? These recycled batteries perform just as well as new ones. Unlike traditional methods that recover raw metals but degrade performance, this upcycling process regenerates high-value cathodes with next-gen chemistry, turning old batteries into components even better aligned with today's EV and storage systems.",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you rely on a smartphone, drive an EV, or use a laptop daily, this research affects you. The push toward clean energy is not just about wind turbines and solar panels. It's about making the entire system, including batteries, more sustainable. Right now, most of us toss old devices without thinking about where the battery ends up. But that battery contains valuable metals, metals that are expensive to mine and harmful to extract.",
      "This new method from WPI means future batteries in your devices could be made from sustainably recycled materials, without sacrificing performance. That helps keep costs down, reduces toxic waste, and shrinks your personal carbon footprint. These high-performance recycled batteries could soon power electric vehicles, solar-powered homes, and even the devices in your pocket, bringing sustainability directly into your life. Plus, as governments and companies invest in battery-powered everything, innovations like this help ensure there are enough materials to go around, without ripping more resources out of the ground.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This innovation could become a cornerstone of the circular battery economy, where old batteries fuel new technology without harming the planet. WPI's approach doesn't just tackle waste. It redefines how we think about energy storage in a world that urgently needs sustainable solutions.",

    "summary": "Long-haul trucks are now being upgraded with a surprising twist, thanks to California-based startup Revoy. Their electric boost doesn&apos;t replace diesel but works alongside it to cut emissions and fuel costs without major disruption.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "If you think electric trucking means buying a brand-new semi, think again. Long-haul trucks are now being upgraded with a surprising twist, thanks to California-based startup Revoy. Their electric boost doesn't replace diesel but works alongside it to cut emissions and fuel costs without major disruption.",
      "In 2025, transportation was the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. And for the first time, heavy-duty trucks edged out passenger vehicles in how much pollution they produce. That makes freight the low-hanging fruit in the fight to reduce emissions. But electrifying it? That's where things get tricky.",
      "Electric semis are pricey. They're also heavy, have limited range, and take too long to charge. Trucking companies, many of them small operators, run on razor-thin margins and can't afford long downtimes. Public fast-charging for trucks barely exists. And without more demand, investors aren't building new stations. That's the bottleneck.",
      "Revoy's solution flips the equation. Instead of replacing the truck, they simply electrify the space between the cab and trailer.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER.",
      "A big rig using a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a battery pack. (Revoy)",
      "How an electric dolly converts diesel trucks instantly",
      "Imagine your standard diesel rig pulling onto the highway. Nothing looks unusual until you notice something new sandwiched between the truck and trailer. Revoy's innovation is a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a massive battery pack.",
      "The dolly carries a 575-kilowatt-hour battery, putting it in the same class as fully electric semis. But here's the clever part: it doesn't just trail along. It pushes the truck forward using its own powered axle, giving the diesel engine a break and saving fuel. All of this happens without modifying the truck or trailer.",
      "It connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch using a smart kingpin. It also plugs into the existing air and electrical lines between the cab and trailer. No hardwiring. No overhaul. Revoy designed it for fast installation, just minutes, no tools required.",
      "Illustration of how the Revoy dolly connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch. (Revoy)",
      "Electric truck conversion adds smart driving features",
      "This isn't just about range. Revoy's dolly also turns any diesel rig into a smarter, safer machine. Using embedded sensors and cameras, the dolly monitors blind spots and feeds real-time data to a driver's smartphone app. It enhances lane stability, helps correct steering in crosswinds, and delivers regenerative braking that recharges the battery. It also enables automated reversing, especially useful for tight yards and docks.",
      "The best part? Drivers don't need to learn anything new. There's no extra dashboard. The truck drives as it always has, just with extra power, extra control, and extra safety.",
      "EV battery swapping makes truck charging fast and easy",
      "Charging has always been a weak point in electric freight. Even the fastest chargers take 30 minutes or more to top off a truck battery. Revoy dodges that altogether. Instead of plugging in, truckers pull into a Revoy swap station and exchange their depleted dolly for a freshly charged one. The process takes about five minutes, which is faster than refueling a diesel tank.",
      "The first swap stations are already live in Texas and Arkansas, with more coming soon. As the network grows, so does the vision of truly hybrid diesel-electric freight. And if the route doesn't include a Revoy station? No problem. The truck simply runs on diesel alone and drops off the dolly at the last location passed.",
      "Illustration of a Revoy swap station. (Revoy)",
      "Electric conversion for trucks without upfront costs",
      "Worried about capital expense? Revoy's business model removes the barrier entirely. Truckers and fleet operators don't purchase the dolly; they lease it per mile. That means zero capital investment and no maintenance headaches.",
      "The system is designed to pay for itself. Revoy estimates savings of over $5,000 per truck annually, mostly through reduced fuel consumption. In some cases, fleets have reported 3 to 5 times better fuel efficiency.",
      "And weight isn't an issue for most operators. While the dolly adds mass, most truckloads fill trailers by volume, not weight. Revoy says over 60% of loads qualify, making this a practical fit for the majority of long-haul routes.",
      "Can this electric truck add-on work worldwide?",
      "Revoy built its dolly system for U.S.-style single-trailer rigs, but the idea could scale globally. Countries like Australia, with vast, sun-drenched highways, could easily support dolly-swap stations powered by solar energy. Imagine swapping a charged dolly in the Outback instead of waiting an hour for a charger.",
      "Canada and other countries with twin-trailer B-Doubles would require a modified version, but the core concept remains powerful: electrify trucks without replacing them. The technology is modular. The logistics are scalable. The potential is massive.",
      "A big rig on the road using a high-tech electric dolly. (Revoy)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Electric trucks\u00a0are still years away from becoming mainstream. But this electric add-on is already solving the biggest problems today. It's fast. It's smart. It works with the trucks that are already on the road. Instead of overhauling the entire trucking industry, this system works with what exists right now. You don't need a brand-new truck. You just need a smarter way to power it.",

      "This new agent feature is available to Pro, Plus, and Team users through ChatGPT's tools dropdown by selecting 'agent mode' at any point in a conversation. It signals a shift from chat-based assistants to fully capable AI helpers.",
      "ChatGPT agent powers itself with a unified agentic system that combines multiple strengths behind the scenes. It integrates\u00a0Operator's\u00a0ability to interact visually with websites, clicking, filling forms, and navigating pages, with deep research's capacity for synthesizing complex information. Added to this are new tools, including a text-based browser for efficient reasoning, a terminal to run code, and direct API access. The agent also uses\u00a0connectors to apps like Gmail and GitHub to pull relevant data while maintaining security.",
      "When you assign it a task, ChatGPT agent spins up a secure virtual workspace, effectively giving your assistant its own computer. From there, it intelligently decides which tools to use, such as browsing, document editing, or command line interaction, and remembers the task context. This makes workflows smoother and more consistent, letting the agent complete multi-step assignments autonomously yet under your supervision.",

It feels more like a true assistant than a chatbot, capable of following multi-step instructions and updating you as it works.",
      "Agent won't spy on you or go rogue",
      "OpenAI stresses that you remain fully in control. ChatGPT agent explicitly asks for your permission before sending emails, making bookings, or changing files. It actively refuses high-risk requests like bank transfers or actions with serious consequences without your consent.",
      "The agent stops when you open sensitive websites, avoids following harmful web instructions, and lets you clear browsing histories and revoke permissions at any time. Sensitive data like passwords are never stored or exposed because the model does not need to see them.",

      "Now, imagine delegating your most tedious tasks, such as replying to emails, booking dinners, or researching vacations, to an assistant who truly acts on your behalf. ChatGPT agent equips ChatGPT with both intelligence and action; it goes beyond suggesting ideas by actually getting things done.",
      "You retain full control while avoiding the need to micromanage every click or keystroke. Whether your schedule fills quickly or you simply dislike digital grunt work, ChatGPT agent is built to manage these demands efficiently.",
      "Looking ahead, OpenAI intends for the agent to work even more independently, completing your to-do list as you focus on what matters most. The key question remains: how much will you be willing to hand off?",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "With ChatGPT agent, we're moving from AI chatbots that merely react to those that are proactive and decision-makers. As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, their capabilities will continue to expand. However, the biggest challenge for OpenAI will be striking the right balance between convenience, safety, and privacy.",

      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why dogs see TV differently than we do",
      "In the past, older TVs didn't do much for dogs. Their lower refresh rates caused flickering that was hard for canine eyes to process. Dogs see flicker more sensitively than humans do. So while you were watching your favorite sitcom, your dog was probably just seeing a strobe light. Today's high-definition, high-frame-rate TVs are a different story. The improved visuals and sound mean dogs can now recognize what's happening onscreen and respond to it.",
      "What the study found about how dogs respond to different kinds of tv content",
      "Researchers developed something called the Dog Television Viewing Scale (DTVS). It's a 16-question tool that helps measure how dogs respond to different kinds of TV content, like barking, tail-wagging, or even following something off-screen. They surveyed over 650 dog owners. More than 450 respondents reported that their dogs actually watch TV. From there, three main behavior patterns emerged:",
      "Dogs responded most strongly to other animals, especially dogs and wildlife.",
      "Some dogs physically tracked an object as it moved off the screen. This suggests they think the image might exist beyond the TV, like in real life.",
      "Dogs also reacted to people and inanimate objects, such as cars or doorbells.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Personality plays a big role in how dogs react to TV",
      "The researchers found that personality, not breed or age, influenced how dogs reacted. Excitable dogs were more likely to exhibit \"follow\" behavior, actively watching and expecting movement off-screen. Fearful or reactive dogs were more sensitive to non-animal stimuli, like human voices or doorbells. Interestingly, dogs' sex, breed, or even whether they were neutered didn't seem to affect their TV habits. Exposure to TV also wasn't a strong factor, meaning dogs aren't necessarily \"trained\" to watch.",
      "What this means for dog owners",
      "If you leave the TV on for your dog while you're out, you're not alone, and it might even help them feel more at ease. But not all dogs benefit the same way. The content matters. Animal-heavy programming could excite or soothe a curious pup. But shows with loud sounds or human conflict could stress out a fearful dog. Some streaming services, like DOGTV, are now designing content tailored for dogs. This research gives that idea more scientific credibility.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can TV help shelter dogs?",
      "The findings suggest a new tool for improving dog welfare, especially in shelters. Tailored TV programming could help reduce stress and provide mental enrichment for dogs waiting to be adopted. Still, more research is needed. Most of the data came from owners whose dogs already engage with TV. Behavior reports were based on what owners observed, rather than direct measurement.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "TV might not just be background noise for your dog. For some, it could be entertainment. For others, it might even be stress relief or stimulation. And thanks to modern screen tech, they're seeing it clearer than ever before. So next time you catch your dog watching with you, take a moment. They may really be following the action.",

But he knew it was dangerous. So, he had his men tie him to the mast and block their ears with beeswax. Then, they sailed toward the Island of the Sirens. Why?

      "How scammers trick your parents even when they know better",
      "What does this have to do with protecting your parents from scammers? None of us is invulnerable, not even a hero like Odysseus. The trick is knowing what you can't resist and, one way or another, avoiding it. You can teach your parents all there is to know about modern-day fraud and the dangers of sharing personal information, but there's still this Siren song out there that will have them throwing all that knowledge out the window in a heartbeat.",
      "What this Siren song is varies from person to person and day to day. It might be a near-perfect clone of a grandchild's voice, calling in a panic and asking for an urgent transfer to bail them out of trouble, if not jail. Alternatively, a financial adviser could be deftly playing on your parents' anxieties around money since retiring. Another common scam involves a suspiciously foreign-sounding Microsoft customer-support worker calling to inform your parents that the computer they don't have or never use has been infected with a virus.",
      "Emotional triggers are the scammer's best tool",
      "The point is that all of us, no matter how well-informed, careful, or clever, can be exploited by a fast-talking scammer. All it takes is the right hook at exactly the wrong moment, and we're along for the ride. All the more so as we get older and technology advances rapidly, leaving us behind. Scammers rely on emotional reactions as much as, if not more than, ignorance. Letting your parents know about the dangers of engaging with strangers (even if they claim to be from Visa or\u00a0the IRS) is crucial, but it's not enough. Scammers exploit fear, greed, and the desire to please others or simply be a good citizen. They're experts at raising the emotional toll of interrupting, interrogating, or ignoring them. In short, getting drawn into discussions with scammers is playing with fire.",
      "(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "The best solution: Cut off scammers at the source",
      "So, what's the solution? Stop the scammers from making contact in the first place. They're getting your parents' contact information and much more personal data besides, from somewhere. Stop them from getting their hands on it, and they won't have the chance to manipulate your parents into doing something they'll regret.",
      "People-search sites are a great source of information for scammers. Fast, easy, and inexpensive, they fuel smaller operations and individual scammers. People-search sites are a kind of data broker; the other major kind, sometimes called private-database data brokers, are even worse. These data brokers sell personal data in bulk to other businesses.",
      "They've been caught selling the personal data of vulnerable adults before, offering data packs that focused on people who needed in-home care or were suffering from cognitive impairment or decline, for example. This is worse than posting your parents' details publicly. This is packaging up those details and marketing them directly to scammers.",
      "An elderly parent and his daughter \u00a0looking at a laptop screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "Use a data removal service to protect your parents",
      "The good news is that a\u00a0data removal service can scrub both people-search sites and the databases of those other, more shadowy data brokers clean of your parents' information. Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, property values, health information, shopping habits, political preferences, and more. You can take all this down in one fell swoop with a personal data removal service.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you and your parents.",

      "The Walker S2 humanoid robot switches out its own battery\u00a0 (UBTech)",
      "How the Walker S2 robot swaps its own battery",
      "Instead of shutting down to recharge, the Walker S2 walks to a nearby swap station. When one battery starts to run low, the robot turns its torso, uses built-in tools on its arms and removes the drained battery. It then picks up a fresh one, plugs it in and gets back to work immediately. The entire process takes about three minutes. This system is similar to battery-swapping tech used in electric vehicles. But this time, it\u2019s for humanoid robots.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What the Walker S2 robot can do",
      "The Walker S2 is the size of a small adult. It\u2019s 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs 95 pounds. It has two 48-volt lithium batteries. When one runs out, it switches to the other. Each battery lasts approximately two hours while walking or four hours when the robot is standing still. Swap stations also monitor battery health. If a battery starts to degrade, a technician can replace it.",
      "The Walker S2 humanoid robot switches out its own battery\u00a0 (UBTech)",
      "The Walker S2 robot is designed for factory floors",
      "UBTech claims the Walker S2 is designed for real-world use. It has been tested in car factories operated by BYD, Nio and Zeekr. These robots are not just for show. They have vision systems to detect battery levels. A green light indicates that a battery is ready to use. The robot reads that, picks it up and plugs it in using a USB-style connector. The robot also features a display face to communicate its status to human workers. And, yes, there\u2019s an emergency stop button, just in case.",

      "China is investing heavily in robotics. More than 1,600 robotics companies operate in Shenzhen, UBTech\u2019s home base. Projects range from humanoids like the Walker S2 to delivery robots that ride the subway and restock convenience stores. This move toward automation is about global competition. China is betting on AI and robotics to lead the next era of manufacturing.",
      "The Walker S2 humanoid robot switches out its own battery\u00a0 (UBTech)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Robots like the Walker S2 are built to work nonstop. That changes what the workplace looks like, not just in factories, but everywhere. You could start seeing machines like this in airports, warehouses or even hospitals. They handle the physical tasks. You focus on the thinking, planning or managing.",
      "For businesses, 24/7 automation means more output without adding more staff. It keeps operations moving, day and night. This tech is no longer a preview of what's next. It's starting to show up on real job sites.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "UBTech\u2019s Walker S2 is an example of how automation is moving beyond the lab and into the workplace. With battery swapping, humanoid robots may soon be able to work longer hours than any human could ever do. They don\u2019t take coffee breaks. They don\u2019t sleep. They just keep going.",

      "What is AI-powered ticket pricing?",
      "Traditional ticket pricing relies on fare \"buckets,\" where customers are grouped into categories based on when and how they book their tickets. Delta's AI-powered system replaces static pricing with a dynamic model that evaluates real-time market data, like demand surges or route-specific trends, to recommend pricing tiers.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein describes this as a reengineering of pricing, calling AI a\u00a0\"super analyst\" that works 24/7, seeking the optimal price for every traveler, every time.

      "If you've ever wondered why airfare fluctuates every time you check, get ready for even more volatility. Delta's system could theoretically offer you a different price than someone else for the exact same seat, calculated in real time by AI.",
      "Pros: You might get special offers or early discounts if the AI needs to fill seats.",
      "Cons: It becomes much harder to know if you're getting a \"fair\" deal because the price shown is purely based on what AI thinks you'll pay, not what everyone else pays.",

A variety of market forces drive the dynamic pricing model that\u2019s been used in the global industry for decades, with new tech simply streamlining this process. Delta always complies with regulations around pricing and disclosures.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Industry impact and growing criticism over AI ticket pricing",

Yet, privacy advocates and some lawmakers are voicing strong concerns. Critics argue that letting AI determine pricing behind the scenes is, in the words of Consumer Watchdog, like airlines\u00a0\"hacking our brains\" to find the maximum price we'll accept.",
      "The legal risks are still emerging. While price variation based on demand or timing is not new, using AI for ultra-personalized pricing raises uncomfortable questions about discrimination and fairness, especially since prior research suggests that poorer customers often receive the worst deals.",
      "Passengers sitting on a plane\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Delta says it does not tailor prices based on your digital footprint. You won't be charged more because you searched twice or booked from a certain device. Instead, prices respond to broader factors like how many seats are left, the time of day, and demand on that route.",
      "That said, airfares will likely feel even more unpredictable. Shopping around is now a must. Quick decisions might save you money, but waiting could result in a price increase.",
      "A VPN may still help you hide your location, but Delta states that its pricing does not vary by personal data like IP or browser history. Still, comparing prices across platforms and booking early remain smart moves.",
      "Privacy matters more than ever, not because Delta is watching you, but because digital tools are transforming how industries think about pricing. In short, you still have power as a consumer. Be smart, be flexible, and always compare before making a purchase.",

      "The Velvet Sundown reportedly earned more than $34,000 in a single month from streaming platforms. And it's not alone. Other acts, such as Aventhis, a \"dark country\" musician with over 600,000 monthly listeners, are also believed to be powered by AI-generated content.",
      "This isn't happening in a studio with a team of producers. It's often just one person inputting text and outputting tracks. The barrier to entry is nearly gone. With a laptop and internet connection, anyone can create and distribute AI-generated songs on a massive scale.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",

      "2. Only approve 2FA requests you initiate: Even if a scammer gets your password, 2FA can stop them from getting into your account. Just ensure that you only approve login requests that you\u2019ve personally initiated. If you get a random prompt on your phone or authentication app, do not approve it.",
      "3. Report phishing emails: Use Outlook\u2019s built-in tools to report suspicious messages as phishing. You can also forward them to Microsoft at reportphishing@microsoft.com.",
      "4. Use strong antivirus software: Consider using strong antivirus software with built-in phishing and link protection to catch threats before they reach you. Stay vigilant when it comes to emails, phone calls, or messages from unknown sources asking for personal information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive details unless you can verify the legitimacy of the request. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "For the best antivirus protection in 2025, visit\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "5. Never share sensitive info: Microsoft will never ask for your password, 2FA code, or payment details via email. If you\u2019re unsure, log in directly from a browser to check.",
      "6. Consider personal data removal services: After phishing attempts, your data may end up circulating among data brokers, increasing your risk of future scams and identity theft. Data removal services can help reduce the visibility of your personal information by submitting removal requests to dozens of people-search and broker sites. This limits how easily scammers and spammers can find and target you.",

      "When a gunman opened fire at 345 Park Avenue, panic spilled out of the Manhattan skyscraper, reaching many Americans working far from the glass towers of corporate New York.",
      "Patrick Timlin, CEO of SilverSEAL Corporation and a veteran of both law enforcement and private security, told Fox News Digital that security \"is not just for skyscrapers, but for the town hall in a small county, a school, or a mom-and-pop grocery store.\"",
      "Timlin wants everyday professionals, from software engineers in suburban office parks to receptionists in distribution centers, to realize that the most effective defense starts with simplicity, consistency, and awareness.",
      "\"Stress-free, not fear-based,\" he said. \"You empower people when you train them.\"",

      "\"It\u2019s not about paranoia,\" he says. \"It\u2019s about awareness.\"",
      "He points to one of the most overlooked safety gaps: employees not knowing their own office layout.",
      "\"You\u2019d be surprised how many people take the elevator to the third floor every day, grab coffee, and don\u2019t have any clue where the emergency exits are,\" Timlin explains. \"That\u2019s a problem.\"",

      "\"You might not get to choose the order,\" he adds, \"but you should know the principles.\"",
      "\"Training doesn\u2019t need to frighten people. It just needs to stick,\" Timlin says. \"Done right, it\u2019s stress-free, not fear-based. That\u2019s how you empower people.\"",

      "The NTSB kicked off the first day of hearings in Washington on Wednesday to discuss the Jan. 29 crash between an American Airlines plane from Wichita, Kansas, and a Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan National Airport that left 67 people dead.",
      "Air traffic controllers reportedly warned about the hazards of helicopter traffic near the airport for years leading up to the crash, but concerns raised about the Black Hawk helicopter's route were not addressed. The Federal Aviation Administration also allegedly did not make route changes or warn pilots, despite 85 near misses in the past three years at the airport.",
      "\"It\u2019s so bureaucratic,\" NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said during the hearing, adding, in part, that \"people are so critical of the federal government because you can\u2019t ensure safety.\"",
      "NTSB LAUNCHES 3-DAY INVESTIGATIVE HEARING ON DEADLY DC PLANE CRASH",
      "The NTSB on Wednesday kicked off the first day of hearings in Washington, in which investigators pointed to several factors that contributed to the crash. (AP)",
      "Army and FAA representatives attempted to point blame toward air traffic controllers and the lack of separation between planes landing at the airport and helicopters flying on approved routes, but later implied that the routes weren't supposed to ensure separation.",
      "The Army did acknowledge that Black Hawk altimeters may be more than 100 feet off before adding that their pilots aim to maintain altitude within 100 feet of a limit.",
      "Lawyer Bob Clifford, who is representing several victims\u2019 families, said the hearing had a lot of \"finger-pointing\" and \"no acceptance of responsibility and accountability.\"",
      "Though the final report will not be released until next year, the hearing on Wednesday revealed how small the margin of error was for helicopters flying the route that the Black Hawk took that night.",
      "The flight data recorder showed the helicopter was 80 to 100 feet higher than the barometric altimeter the pilots relied upon showed they were flying, investigators said on Wednesday. The NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters.",
      "The bigger concern, Army officials said, is that there are some FAA-approved routes around the airport with separation distances as small as 75 feet when planes are landing on a certain runway.",
      "\"The fact that we have less than 500 feet separation is a concern for me,\" Scott Rosengren, chief engineer in the office that manages the Army\u2019s utility helicopters, said during the hearing.",
      "Rosengren said that \"if he was king for a day\" he would immediately retire all the older Black Hawk models like the one involved in the crash and replace them with newer versions.",
      "The incident in January was the first in a string of crashes and near-misses this year that have sparked concern among officials and travelers. (AP)",
      "During the two minutes before the crash, an air traffic controller was directing airport traffic and helicopters in the area, which included communications with several different aircraft on two different frequencies, according to the NTSB's History of Flight Performance Study released on Wednesday.",
      "The air traffic controller had communicated with the Black Hawk helicopter, an airplane that was taking off, an Air Force helicopter, an airplane on the ground, a medical helicopter and an inbound airplane that was not the one involved in the crash.",
      "\"All aircraft could hear the controller, but helicopters could only hear other helicopters on their frequency and airplanes only other airplanes,\" the report said. \"This resulted in a number of stepped-on transmissions as helicopters and airplanes were not aware when the other was communicating.\"",
      "Stepped on transmissions refers to those that are unheard or blocked because of other transmissions. The NTSB report includes a list of 29 separate communications between the airport tower and other aircraft during the two minutes before the crash.",
      "Previously disclosed air traffic control audio featured the helicopter pilot telling the air traffic controller twice that they had noticed the plane and would avoid it.",
      "Officials on Wednesday also raised concerns about the use of night vision goggles on the helicopter as a factor in the crash, as the goggles limit the field of view.",
      "Investigations have previously shown that the FAA failed to recognize a history of 85 near-misses around the airport in the three years before the collision and that the Army's helicopters routinely flew around Washington with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off.",
      "Even if they had been turned on, the ADS-B Out systems on most of the helicopters in the same unit as the one that crashed would not work because they had been installed incorrectly, officials said on Wednesday. When the NTSB learned of that problem, the Army sent out an alert about it and worked to quickly reprogram the units to ensure they would work.",
      "Homendy said \"every sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that,\" but after the incident, the FAA transferred managers out of the tower instead of admitting they had been warned.",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, introduced legislation on Tuesday to require all aircraft operators to use both forms of ADS-B, the technology to broadcast aircraft location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B Out equipment, but airlines would need to add the more comprehensive ADS-B In technology to their planes.",

      "Homendy said her agency has been recommending a move like that for decades after several other crashes.",

      "A suspect who worked as a teacher in public schools has been arrested in the killings of a couple who were attacked on an Arkansas hiking trail Saturday, state police said Wednesday.",
      "James Andrew McGann, 28, of Springdale, was arrested at 4:57 p.m. Wednesday at a business in Springdale and is charged with two counts of capital murder, Arkansas State Police said in a statement.",
      "He is accused of killing Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, who were attacked Saturday afternoon in front of their daughters while they were hiking at Devil\u2019s Den State Park, police have said.",
      "He was arrested at a barber shop after a dayslong manhunt, police said.",
      "Col. Mike Hagar, the state police director, thanked state police for working long hours in the search for a suspect, as well as federal agencies for their assistance.",
      "\"Because of their hard work and investigative skill, we were able to take a monster off the streets and bring relief to those two precious girls and the rest of our citizens,\" Hagar said.",
      "Authorities did not mention a suspected motive Wednesday or how the killings occurred.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still exploring and determining exactly what that motive was,\u201d Arkansas State Police Maj. Stacie Rhoads told reporters Wednesday night.",
      "McGann had recently moved to Arkansas from Oklahoma and had gotten a job to work at a local school, she said.",
      "He was a teacher candidate hired for the upcoming school year at Springdale Public Schools, but had not yet begun official employment, district superintendent Jared Cleveland said in a statement. The district said McGann \u201chas not at any time come into contact with Springdale students or the families we serve.\u201d",

      "He had also worked as a teacher for Broken Arrow Public Schools in Oklahoma during the 2023-2024 school year as a 5th grade teacher at Spring Creek Elementary. At the end of the school year he left \u201cof his own accord to work out of state,\u201d the district said, noting he also passed legally required background checks prior to his hiring.",
      "The victims' daughters are 7 and 9 years old. They were not injured and are safe with family members, officials said.",
      "Katrina Hutchins, Clinton Brink\u2019s sister, said they moved to the state about three weeks ago.",
      "State police were notified about the killings at Devil's Den shortly before 3 p.m. Saturday. Officials released a sketch of a suspect and asked the public for help. They said witnesses saw a black, four-door sedan with tape partly covering its license plate.",
      "\"Clinton and Cristen died heroes, protecting their little girls and they deserve justice. They will forever live on in all of our hearts,\u201d the family said in an earlier statement.",

    "summary": "App store age verification",
    "story": [
      "Age verification is coming for app stores.",
      "Laws requiring Google and Apple to check people\u2019s ages before they can download apps are gaining momentum in the United States and around the globe in what could be a radical shift for how people access content on their phones.",
      "While age checks have become increasingly common across the internet, the focus of attention has usually been on individual websites and app makers, not app stores. That\u2019s shifting as some politicians and tech companies argue it would be more efficient and uniform for app stores to check people\u2019s ages in the name of child safety.",
      "Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University, said there\u2019s a battle raging within the tech industry over who\u2019s going to be accountable for children\u2019s lives during the hours they spend on phones and tablets.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got this food fight,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s pointing the finger at each other.\u201d",
      "Three states \u2014 Texas, Louisiana and Utah \u2014 have passed laws this year compelling app marketplaces to check the ages of everyone when they create accounts. They were joined by Singapore, an Asian tech hub that passed a similar law. All four laws are scheduled to take effect next year, and similar proposals are under consideration in other states and in Congress.",
      "But some argue the laws have potential costs in reducing privacy and burdening free speech. Some people in the United Kingdom, which has a new mandate for age checks, are verifying their ages through selfies that are run through facial age verification software.",
      "And it\u2019s not clear how much the new laws would limit access to adult content, especially if they don\u2019t affect web browsers. Online age checks are often followed by surges in workarounds, such as virtual private networks, or VPNs, which mask users\u2019 locations to sidestep local regulations.",
      "Lobbying for the new laws is coming partly from within the tech industry. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta and some other app makers are eager to shift the burden of online kid safety to the app stores rather than take on more of the responsibility themselves.",
      "But the trend is getting pushback from Apple and Google, which run the biggest app marketplaces, as well as from civil liberties advocates who see age verification mandates as a death knell for the internet\u2019s privacy and anonymity.",
      "Goldman, who opposes age verification mandates on privacy and free speech grounds, said the laws are popular now for several reasons: the broader backlash against tech companies; the number of hours kids spend online, especially since Covid-19; and the lack of unity in the tech industry.",
      "\u201cCensorship is in style today,\u201d he said. \u201cRegulators are full-throated in embracing censorship as a good thing, and they\u2019re more than willing to exert their will on other sources of power in our society.\u201d",
      "State lawmakers who are pushing the measures say the status quo isn\u2019t working.",
      "\u201cParents are constantly fighting to protect their children, especially from dangerous content on their phones, tablets, and other devices,\u201d Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton, a Republican who sponsored the new law there, said in a statement. The law says an app store \u201cshall use a commercially reasonable method of verification to verify the individual\u2019s age.\u201d",
      "Google and Apple object to the laws on various grounds, including that they are too sweeping and that they require collecting too much data about users.",
      "\u201cThis level of data sharing isn\u2019t necessary \u2014 a weather app doesn\u2019t need to know if a user is a kid,\u201d Kareem Ghanem, a director of public policy at Google, said in a blog post about the state laws.",
      "He argued that app makers are best positioned to think about age. \u201cBy contrast, a social media app does need to make significant decisions about age-appropriate content and features,\u201d he said.",
      "More broadly, age verification has built up considerable momentum. Twelve states have passed laws restricting children\u2019s access to social media or requiring parental consent, though the courts have blocked three of those laws, according to the Age Verification Providers Association, a trade group for tech companies that handle age checks. And 24 states have passed laws requiring age verification to view pornography online, the association says.",
      "To some app developers, a state-by-state patchwork seems like a regulatory nightmare to deal with. But to the app stores, it\u2019s evidence that there\u2019s already a clear standard in the United States for who\u2019s responsible for dodgy content. Age checks online are already so complicated that the sector has its own trade group \u2014 the Age Verification Providers Association lists more than 30 members on its website. In a blog post in May, when Texas was debating its law, the group argued that app store age verification wasn\u2019t by itself enough. It cited many reasons, among them that app stores have little or no authority when it comes to the open web.",
      "Both Apple and Google say they\u2019re willing to take on some additional responsibility for children\u2019s safety. They say they support a framework whereby makers of the riskiest apps would get an industry-standard \u201cage signal\u201d from app stores about a user\u2019s general age range, which the user or a parent would provide. Apple says it plans to roll out a version of the system, known as \u201cage assurance,\u201d on its operating systems soon.",
      "Apple said in a statement that it wants to \u201cempower parents to share their child\u2019s age range with apps without disclosing sensitive information.\u201d",
      "\u201cImportantly, this solution does not require app marketplaces to collect and keep sensitive personal identifying information for every person who wants to download an app, even if it\u2019s an app that simply provides weather updates or sports scores,\u201d it said. Apple has had \u201cchild accounts\u201d for years and recently updated how parents can manage them.",
      "In a policy paper this year, Apple compared itself to a mall owner and compared the riskiest apps to liquor stores or bars.",
      "\u201cWe ask merchants who sell alcohol in a mall to verify a buyer\u2019s age by checking IDs \u2014 we don\u2019t ask everyone to turn their date of birth over to the mall if they just want to go to the food court,\u201d it said.",
      "In May, Apple CEO Tim Cook waded into the debate with a phone call to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, asking for changes to the app store bill or a veto, according to The Wall Street Journal. Abbott, though, signed the bill into law.",
      "Some legal experts argue that the laws could violate the First Amendment because they place a burden on adults\u2019 right to see protected speech. But neither Apple or Google nor their representatives have sued to block the laws. The Supreme Court in 1997 struck down a set of internet rules that included age verification, but this year, the Supreme Court on a 6-3 vote upheld a narrower age verification law out of Texas that was aimed at pornographic content.",
      "Congress has meanwhile struggled to come up with nationwide legislation on the topic of child safety online. The proposed Kids Online Safety Act, which would create a legal \u201cduty of care\u201d for internet platforms to limit harm to users, passed the Senate last year but not the House. Legislation from Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Rep. John James, R-Mich., would try to tackle problems like violent or sexual material through the app stores.",
      "One attraction of putting app stores in charge of age verification \u2014 if tech companies are going to do it at all \u2014 is the idea of creating a uniform system of age checks, said Peter Chandler, executive director of Internet Works, a lobbying and trade group for more than 20 medium-sized tech companies such as Reddit and Roblox.",
      "\u201cImagine an age verification compliance regime that required every single platform or website to come up or create its own age verification system,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019d end up with is this very siloed age verification system. How can we possibly ask parents to understand and navigate that?\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes simplest is best.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "An enormous, 515-mile-long flash of lightning that crossed at least three states has been named the longest in recorded history in the world.",
      "The 2017 \u201cmegaflash\u201d stretched from eastern Texas to near Kansas City \u2014 a distance that would take at least eight hours by car or 90 minutes by commercial plane, according to the World Meteorological Organization. In comparison, the average bolt of lightning usually measures less than 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "The WMO, an agency within the United Nations, announced Thursday that it certified the megaflash as the longest lightning flash on record. It struck Oct. 22, 2017, during a severe storm that hit much of the Great Plains.",
      "A megaflash is a giant bolt of lightning that travels huge distances from its origin point, said Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University and a member of the WMO committee that confirmed the new record.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly strange phenomenon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only discovered them 10 years ago, when we could use a particular set of technologies to detect the start and end locations of the of lightning events.\u201d",
      "Megaflashes are not altogether uncommon, but they typically only occur in parts of the world where specific geographical and atmospheric conditions can produce the most severe thunderstorms, Cerveny said. In the Great Plains and across the Midwest, for instance, warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with drier, colder air from the north, creating strong atmospheric instability.",
      "When these conditions mix and produce severe storms, megaflashes of lightning can occur. These extra-long bolts of lightning have been observed before in the United States, Argentina and southern France, and scientists think they can also occur in parts of China and Australia, according to Cerveny.",
      "The 2017 megaflash was produced by an immense storm that blanketed a huge swath of the U.S., from Texas up into Iowa and Missouri. Though megaflashes can extend across multiple states, they form high up in the atmosphere and so rarely cause damage on the ground, Cerveny said.",
      "\u201cThey are upwards of 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, in the upper to middle layers of a thunderstorm,\u201d he said.",
      "The 515-mile-long lightning bolt was described in a study published Thursday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.",
      "\u201cThese new findings highlight important public safety concerns about electrified clouds which can produce flashes which travel extremely large distances and have a major impact on the aviation sector and can spark wildfires,\u201d WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an accompanying statement.",
      "The extreme conditions that spawn them are a reminder of how powerful and dangerous lightning storms can be. In the U.S., lightning kills roughly 20 people each year and injures hundreds more, according to the weather service.",
      "With the classification Thursday, the 2017 lightning flash now surpasses the previous world record set five years ago by about 38 miles, according to the WMO. That bolt of lightning was unleashed April 29, 2020, and spanned 477.2 miles across parts of the southern U.S.",
      "The 2017 megaflash was identified after scientists re-examined archival measurements taken when the storm occurred.",
      "\u201cWhen the original studies were done, we didn\u2019t have the technology that we have today,\u201d Cerveny said. \u201cNow we have this instrument on a weather satellite that very accurately detects lightning and can precisely pinpoint where, how far and how long a lightning flash event takes place.\u201d",
      "Experts said it\u2019s likely there will be even longer megaflashes found in the coming years, particularly as satellite technologies improve the ability to detect them.",
      "\u201cOver time, as the data record continues to expand, we will be able to observe even the rarest types of extreme lightning on Earth and investigate the broad impacts of lightning on society,\u201d study lead author Michael Peterson, an atmospheric scientist in the Severe Storms Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said in a statement.",
      "The WMO's Committee on Weather and Climate Extremes keeps official records of global, hemispheric and regional extremes, including for temperature, rainfall, wind, hail, lightning, tornadoes and tropical cyclones."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Justice Department issued a memo on Wednesday that asked recipients of federal funds to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which President Donald Trump has aimed to dismantle since taking office in January.",
      "Trump has passed executive orders aimed at restricting DEI but Wednesday\u2019s memo laid out specific examples of actions that it said federal fund recipients should restrict \u2014 such as some training sessions and policies aimed at protected groups. It also said federal funds should not be used to support third parties that engage in DEI.",
      "Recipients of federal funds range from schools, colleges and universities to nonprofit organizations and private firms that are government contractors. The memo was released publicly by the Justice Department.",
      "In an example to support one of its recommendations, the memo said that \u201ca scholarship program must not target \u2018underserved geographic areas\u2019 or \u2018first-generation students\u2019 if the criteria are chosen to increase participation by specific racial or sex-based groups.\u201d",

    "summary": "Brands are already raising prices, so experts recommend buying tech, household basics, clothing and baby gear before costs go up even more.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s almost impossible to avoid tariff-related price hikes while shopping. A universal 10% tariff on all countries has been in effect since April, and over 100 countries could soon face higher reciprocal tariffs if they don\u2019t reach a trade agreement with the U.S. before Aug. 1.",
      "Since the trade war is expected to heat up even more in the coming weeks, don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re suddenly paying more for clothes, tech, household basics and groceries. That said, there\u2019s still time to save \u2014 tariffs only apply to imported goods, so prices on products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t currently shooting up. Once that supply runs out, however, many brands will have no choice but to raise prices, including those that already did a first round of hikes earlier this year.",
      "Below, I spoke with experts about what they recommend buying before tariffs have a significant impact on your shopping cart. They also responded to frequently asked questions about tariffs and shared tips for saving money.",

      "What to buy as tariff-related price hikes roll out",
      "We don\u2019t know what the exact impacts of tariffs will be, but one thing is for sure: almost everything you buy is getting more expensive, says Dr. Ross Steinman, a professor of consumer psychology at Widener University. That doesn\u2019t mean you should panic buy \u2014 it does, however, mean that now is the best time to purchase anything on your wishlist or that you\u2019ve been saving up for. It\u2019s crucial to focus on higher-cost items produced abroad, like tech, appliances, furniture and cars, as well as clothing, shoes and household basics like groceries and cleaning supplies, says Vipin Porwal, the CEO and a consumer savings expert at Smarty.",
      "A few things to keep in mind: First, as I said above, tariffs only apply to imported goods, so the price of products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t shooting up.  But it\u2019s only a matter of time before that stock runs low and companies have to import more goods, which will be subject to the new tariff rates. We\u2019re also already seeing brands across industries raise prices or warn customers about impending hikes, including big names like Nike, Black+Decker and Fabletics. And with the threat of higher duties looming, companies that already raised prices could do so again.",
      "Also, remember that even if a product is manufactured in the U.S., tariffs are causing companies to face higher production costs. They often import materials like fabric, batteries and microchips from foreign countries, so expect increased prices on American-made goods, too.",
      "Below, I rounded up examples of products you should consider buying before more tariff-related price hikes roll out. They\u2019re all manufactured in places subject to universal tariffs or higher country-specific duties.",
      "Basics and groceries",
      "Tide Pods Liquid Laundry Detergent (76-Count)",
      "During a recent earnings call, Procter & Gamble\u2019s CEO said shoppers will start seeing price hikes from its brands this summer, including Tide, which has manufacturing plants in the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These laundry detergent pods have a color protector, odor fighter and stain remover inside. They dissolve quickly in cool or warm water, according to Tide.",
      "Bounty Paper Towels",
      "Procter & Gamble also owns the paper goods brand Bounty, which, similar to Tide, makes its products across the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These paper towels are absorbent so you can quickly soak up messes. Rolls come pre-measured, letting you tear off small or large sheets along the perforated lines.",
      "Kosterina Original Extra Virgin Olive Oil",
      "Kosterina harvests Koroneiki olives in Greece to make this extra-virgin olive oil. Before the price of this pantry staple increases due to the 15% tariff imposed on countries part of the European Union, consider buying a couple of bottles. The EVOO, which I use for sauteing, roasting and making dressings, has a buttery, peppery flavor.",
      "Technology",
      "Apple AirPods 4 with ANC",
      "Apple makes most of its hardware in China and produces devices like iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and AirPods in India and Vietnam. NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz, who tested Apple\u2019s AirPods 4 for two months, says they\u2019re a small, comfortable pair you can rely on daily. \u201cThese are the best earbuds for anyone who hates the feeling of rubber eartips clogging their eardrums,\u201d he says. \u201cThey also have new features like dust and water resistance, and adaptive audio, which automatically switches between noise cancellation modes.\u201d",
      "JBL Clip 5",
      "The JBL Clip 5, which is made in China, is our team\u2019s go-to Bluetooth speaker \u2014 the audio quality is impressive for the device\u2019s size, and its built-in carabiner clip lets you attach it to bags, bikes, beach umbrellas, bathroom towel rods and more. You can use the speaker for up to 12 hours before needing to recharge it, according to the brand. The Clip 5 is also dust- and water-resistant.",
      "Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy-Con",
      "While Nintendo didn\u2019t raise the price of the Switch 2 prior to its launch in June, the company, which makes most of its products in Asia, marked up related accessories. It also said \u201cother adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are possible in the future, depending on market conditions.\u201d",
      "The original Switch is beloved among the NBC Select staff, and if it\u2019s on your wishlist, we recommend buying it soon \u2014 its price could increase at any point, and it\u2019s more readily available compared to the frequently out-of-stock Switch 2. This handheld gaming console has two detachable Joy-Con controllers and three play modes: TV, handheld and tabletop. It\u2019s also designed with built-in motion controls that immerse you in games.",
      "Google Pixel Watch 3",
      "Most Google Pixel products are made in China and Vietnam, like the Pixel Watch 3, which won an NBC Select Wellness Award. Rabinowitz says it\u2019s Google\u2019s best smartwatch yet, although it\u2019s only compatible with Android phones (which are also likely to increase in price soon). It has fitness tracking features, including the ability to automatically log workouts and build custom runs. The water-resistant watch has a 24-hour battery life, according to the brand, and collects data about your sleep.",
      "Clothes and shoes",
      "Gap Organic Cotton VintageSoft T-Shirt",
      "I buy basics from Gap every time they\u2019re on sale, including this 100% cotton T-shirt, which is made in India. The shirt has a soft, loose feel, short sleeves and a crewneck. It runs true-to-size, in my experience. I typically wear it tucked into a pair of jeans, and in the colder months, I throw a cardigan over it.",
      "501\u00ae Original Fit Men's Jeans",
      "These Levi\u2019s jeans, available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes, are produced in China, but the brand makes and sources apparel from across the world. \u201cI\u2019ve been wearing a pair of Levi\u2019s 501\u2019s for over 6 years now,\u201d says NBC Select editor Jordan Bowman. \u201cI love the classic, straight fit because it works for almost every outfit, and the cut is honestly timeless. There\u2019s a reason these are one of most iconic pairs of denim of all time.\u201d",
      "Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings",
      "Lululemon, which makes and sources products from across the world, raised prices on a small portion of its merchandise this summer. According to an earnings call, the hikes were \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201cstrategic.\u201d The brand didn\u2019t specify exactly what products increased in price, or whether customers should expect additional increases in the future. Lululemon\u2019s Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings are my all-time favorite pair for high-intensity workouts like running, as well as strength training. They have two side pockets, a hidden pocket in the waistband and a waistband drawcord.",
      "Adidas Samba OG Sneaker",
      "Adidas, which primarily makes its shoes in Asia and Germany, will eventually raise prices on its U.S. products, according to the brand, which did not disclose how much increases will be or what items will be affected. These are some of Adidas\u2019 most classic sneakers for men and women. The Samba has a leather upper, synthetic fabric lining and grippy rubber outsole.",
      "Birkenstock Arizona",
      "Birkenstock, which makes products at its factories in Germany, plans to raise prices globally to offset tariffs at some point before September. The brand\u2019s Arizona slip-on sandal for men and women has two adjustable straps and a cork footbed. There\u2019s also a deep heel cup to keep your foot secure, as well as a raised toe bar to encourage the natural gripping motion of your feet, according to the brand.",
      "Under Armour Charged Surge 4 Sneaker",
      "During a recent earnings call, Under Armour, which sources products from countries like Vietnam, Jordan and Indonesia, shared that it\u2019s increasing prices on its apparel, shoes and accessories. We\u2019ve tested lots of Under Armour\u2019s activewear and sneakers over the years. The Charged Surge 4, available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes, is a basic shoe that\u2019s great for walkers, runners and gym goers. It has a cushioned midsole to support feet and a grippy rubber outsole to stabilize you on various surfaces. The sneaker is also made with mesh to keep feet cool.",
      "Home and kitchen",
      "Ninja AF101 Air Fryer",
      "SharkNinja already raised prices on a handful of products in response to tariffs, and will continue to, according to a statement from the company\u2019s CEO during a recent earnings call. Almost every NBC Select staff member has a Ninja appliance in their kitchen, most of which are manufactured in China and Southeast Asia. While we love using the Creami to make frozen treats, we rely most on Ninja\u2019s basic kitchen gadgets, like blenders, air fryers and coffee machines. This air fryer is recommended by NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who appreciates that it\u2019s big enough to feed a few people,  yet compact enough to keep in her small kitchen. The appliance is easy to operate, and you can use it to air fry, roast, reheat and dehydrate ingredients. Its detachable parts are dishwasher-safe, according to the brand.",
      "Dyson Ball Animal 3 Extra Upright Vacuum",
      "We recommend Dyson\u2019s vacuums, which are made in countries like China and Malaysia, because they have superior suction and make cleaning all types of floors a breeze. If you have one on your wishlist, now is the time to buy \u2014 Dyson\u2019s vacuums are hundreds of dollars, so potential price increases could put them out of your budget. The Ball Animal 3 Extra upright vacuum is designed to clean large homes with pets. It has a detangling brushhead, three cleaning modes and a built-in filtration system, plus it comes with multiple accessories, including a pet grooming tool.",
      "Sproos! Handheld Showerhead with Filter Set",
      "In the spring, Sproos notified customers that it planned on holding prices steady for the time being. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on increases, which we haven\u2019t seen yet \u2014 that means now is the best time to invest in one of the brand\u2019s filtered showerheads. This set comes with a handheld fixture that has a replaceable filter and three spray modes. Everything you need for installation is included, including steel pliers and step-by-step instructions.",
      "Ikea Kallax Shelf Unit",
      "Ikea\u2019s furniture and home goods are centered around Swedish and Scandinavian designs, but they\u2019re manufactured worldwide. Rabinowitz\u2019s favorite Ikea piece is this shelf, which he has a larger version of. \u201cThis storage shelf has moved with me across three apartments in New York City \u2014 it\u2019s outlasted couches, mattresses, bed frames and TV stands,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to wow anyone aesthetically, but it is extremely practical.\u201d",
      "Casper Original Hybrid Mattress",
      "Many brands, including Casper, assemble their mattresses in the U.S.. Still, they import materials like fabrics, foam and springs from overseas \u2014 that could lead to increased production costs for companies, and, in turn, increased prices for shoppers.",
      "NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio recommends Casper\u2019s Original Hybrid Mattress if you need to upgrade soon. \u201cI bought this mattress in 2021 and it still feels brand new years later,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s semi-firm, which is perfect for my husband and I since we tend to have different preferences. I\u2019m really picky about my mattresses because I\u2019m a very hot sleeper, but this one manages to feel fairly cool and doesn\u2019t trap heat, in my experience.\u201d",
      "Baby gear",
      "Uppababy Aria Infant Car Seat",
      "The cost of baby gear like strollers and car seats, much of which is produced overseas, is up 20% on average since January, according to BabyCenter, a digital parenting resource. Uppababy raised prices across most of its products a few months ago, so if you\u2019re in the market for one of the brand\u2019s strollers, car seats, high chairs, changing backpacks or bouncers, buy it before another round of hikes happen. Rabinowitz used the brand\u2019s Aria car seat to travel with his newborn, and he still uses the brand\u2019s Vista V2 stroller with his now 1-year-old. He recommends buying from Uppababy if you\u2019re looking for high quality pieces and peace of mind as a parent.",
      "Coterie Monthly Diaper Box",
      "Coterie already increased the price of its monthly diaper box by $5, and the price of its 4-pack of wipes by $3, per auto-review shipment. In an email to customers, the brand cited \u201cglobal economic factors and rising material costs\u201d as the reason for the hike.",
      "Rabinowitz started buying the brand\u2019s diapers when his baby was born last year. \u201cUsing Coterie\u2019s diapers make me feel good as a parent because they work really well and don\u2019t have ingredients that I\u2019m skeptical of, like a lot of plastic and perfumes,\u201d says Rabinowitz. \u201cThe subscription is easy to use and very flexible \u2014 if I\u2019m scheduled to get diapers in five weeks but I need them in two, I can move up my shipment date.\u201d",
      "Bugaboo Butterfly 2 Travel Stroller",
      "Similar to Uppababy, Bugaboo raised prices across its baby gear earlier this year. Select products were impacted, but the brand didn\u2019t specify which ones \u2014 if you have your eye on something, buy it before its price goes up. NBC senior photo editor Becca Delman, a soon-to-be mom of three, highly recommends Bugaboo\u2019s compact travel stroller. \u201cThe Butterfly 2 works so well for my 10-month old and 3.5-year old,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s lightweight, I can fold it with one hand and it\u2019s easy to clean. The lay-flat feature is also great for my new baby when he arrives in November.\u201d",
      "Will retailers raise prices due to tariffs?",
      "Yes, in addition to individual brands, some retailers plan to start pricing their merchandise higher due to tariffs. Here are a few we know about right now:",
      "Walmart: Walmart started rolling out price hikes this summer, although the retailer didn\u2019t share details about what types of products will be impacted or what the rollout will look like.Target: Target has recently reported lower earnings and ended its price matching policy, signs that it will likely raise prices due to tariffs in the future.

      "Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. If a company brings foreign goods into the U.S., it must pay the U.S. government a percentage of those goods.",
      "Tariff rates are constantly changing as the U.S. government negotiates deals with its trading partners globally. In addition to the tariffs below, all of which are currently in effect, numerous countries, including Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Africa, could soon be subject to high reciprocal tariffs once a pause expires on Aug. 1. China is also in ongoing talks with the U.S, about tariffs \u2014 the current 90-pause on duties between the countries expires on Aug. 12.",

      "15% tariff on imports from Japan",
      "Tariffs will eventually raise prices for U.S. consumers, but so far, the impact is muted, says Ales. Generally speaking, prices haven\u2019t changed much across industries since duties first went into effect in April \u2014 that won\u2019t be the case forever though. \u201cCompanies did a lot of stocking up in advance of tariffs, creating an inventory that\u2019s almost like a shock absorber to prevent some of the price changes,\u201d says Ales. \u201cBut eventually, that inventory runs out, and as companies get used to this new landscape, they\u2019ll begin to sit down and figure out how to adjust to it.\u201d",
      "Since tariffs are higher under the current Trump administration, brands need to find ways to pay increased duties while continuing to make a profit. Raising prices on their products, or adding an additional fee at checkout, is a route many will take. \u201cThe tariff needs to be absorbed by someone \u2014 is it the business or the consumer?,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly, but most likely, there will be some absorption occurring at the consumer level.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn terms of prices and costs going up, it appears that it\u2019s going to be almost universal,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cRight now, it seems like it\u2019s not going to be specific to any one category or industry.\u201d That said, price hikes will likely be the most noticeable among categories like groceries, vehicles and auto parts, clothing, shoes, electronics, appliances, furniture and home goods, says Porwal.",
      "There\u2019s no standard amount by which tariffs will raise prices on consumer goods, says Tala Akhavan, the COO of Pietra, an AI-powered sourcing platform that works with e-commerce brands. Companies large and small are approaching price hikes individually and using different strategies to adjust to their new reality. For example, some are splitting the burden of increased duties between customers and themselves, others are fully eating costs and finding new manufacturers, and a select few are putting all tariff fees onto customers, says Akhavan. The strategy a brand takes plays a large part in how much it increases its prices by.",
      "Long story short: consumers should expect to pay more for goods right now, says Akhavan. \u201cSo far, brands that are raising prices seem to be keeping them that way. There\u2019s so much opacity around how the tariff situation is going to play out, and as a bit of insurance, brands are keeping their prices elevated, especially since they\u2019re accepting the volatility around tariffs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say where tariffs are going to land in the long term, but for the most part, I don\u2019t see a world where we go back to exactly where we were.\u201d",
      "Yes, tariffs are likely to increase prices on products manufactured in the U.S. as well as overseas, says Ales. Many domestically-made goods rely on imported materials, packing and machinery, all of which cost more now.",

    "story": [
      "When people think of wearables, a few names usually come up: Apple Watch, Oura Ring, Fitbit, Garmin. Whoop is usually not on that list: it\u2019s a smaller brand that appeals to a specific crowd as opposed to the Apple Watch and Fitbit users of the world.",
      "And yet, most people, myself included, will inevitably compare it to an Apple Watch. After all, most people will wear one, not both. That\u2019s why I wore the latest Whoop MG and the Apple Watch Series 10 at the same time for over a month: to see how they compare, and which one is right for you.",

      "Whoop One and Whoop Peak use the same physical Whoop band, but Whoop Peak users have more software features in the app. Whoop Life uses the Whoop MG (Medical Grade) band, which has a more advanced sensor with ECG and AFib detection.",
      "Apple sells the Apple Watch SE ($249), Apple Watch Series 10 ($399) and Apple Watch Ultra 2 ($799). I wore the Apple Watch Series 10 for this comparison, as it is the closest direct competitor to the Whoop, in my view.",
      "Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.",
      "My experience using Whoop and Apple Watch",
      "Whoop and Apple Watch are very different devices for very different people. Both are comfortable to wear and give interesting and mostly accurate health, sleep and fitness insights. But the experience of using them is wildly different, and highlights how they are meant for different kinds of people. Below are some of the key differences between the two.",
      "Whoop is essentially a screenless watch band. The included band is made of a flexible, comfortable yarn, and the sensor itself attaches to the band with a titanium clasp. It\u2019s comfortable, subtle and easy to forget when you are wearing it, plus it looks relatively normal in more formal settings (unlike some smartwatches). The clasp can be a little finicky when taking the Whoop on and off your wrist. Unlike most other wearables, you can wear the Whoop MG (or 5.0) on your bicep using the Whoop Bicep Band, but it hasn\u2019t been released at the time of writing this comparison.",
      "The Whoop MG gets up to 14 days of battery life, which is excellent. This made it easy to forget I was wearing it most of the time.",
      "You charge the Whoop MG using the wireless charging puck, which slides and clicks into place on top of the clasp. It takes about two hours to fully charge, which is pretty slow. You can, however, keep wearing the Whoop MG while it\u2019s charging, though this makes it much heavier and bulkier. I think you\u2019ll either love the wireless charging puck or hate it. One the one hand: it means you never have to take off your Whoop, even to charge. On the other hand, it\u2019s slow, feels  bulky on your wrist and is easier to lose compared to a more standard wireless charging station.",
      "You\u2019re probably familiar with the Apple Watch, and the Series 10 is similar to models before it. It\u2019s thinner and lighter than the Apple Watch Series 9, but ekes out more screen space by reaching further into the edges of the case. It\u2019s very comfortable to wear daily, and you can choose from dozens of bands to maximize comfort or better fit the occasion.",
      "Improvements over the Series 9 include a brighter screen that is easier to see at off-angles and faster charging \u2014 up to 80% charge in 30 minutes (or 100% in an hour). Total battery life is still about 18 hours, though.",
      "My take: This is mostly about battery life and whether you want a screen or not. I barely need to think about battery life with the Whoop MG, and charging is relatively flexible. The Apple Watch needs to be charged almost daily, but it\u2019s a fully-featured smartwatch, with all the features that entails.",
      "Day-to-day",
      "Whoop",
      "Using the Whoop MG feels like a middle ground between the mostly passive Oura Ring ($349) and the arguably over-active Ultrahuman Ring ($349). It offers some notifications, like reminders about tonight\u2019s optimal bedtime for ideal recovery, but it leaves most control in your hands to open the app and explore your data when you want to, not when the app tells you to. Like the Oura Ring, the Whoop MG has automatic workout detection, though you can also open up the app to manually start and stop workouts as they happen.",
      "Apple",
      "An Apple Watch can be as active or as passive as you want it to be. You can have all your smartphone notifications synced, and get pings every time you get a text, emails or app notification. You can also turn everything off, and treat it as a watch that\u2019s also a fitness and sleep tracker \u2014 it\u2019s up to you.",
      "It\u2019s easy to start and stop workouts on the Apple Watch because it has a screen \u2014 you don\u2019t need to pull out your phone. It also automatically detects some workouts, but will prompt you on screen when it does, which makes it easier to know when to start a workout yourself.",
      "My take: I think the Apple Watch is more flexible here. With a couple of minutes in its setting menu, you can make it as hands on or as hands off as you want. Whoop is a more focused product than the Apple Watch, so its day-to-day experience is more one-size-fits-all.",
      "Whoop",
      "My Whoop MG tracked health, sleep and fitness data relatively accurately, and provided a lot more information to dig into than the Apple Watch in most cases, for better or worse.",
      "Sleep data between the Whoop MG and the Apple Watch Series 10 was similar, but the Whoop showed my sleep on a more granular level than the Apple Watch, with exact timings on wake windows and sleep stages.",
      "The Whoop MG does have automatic workout detection, but like the Oura Ring, I found myself starting and stopping workouts manually through the app. After my month of testing, I realized that while the automatic tracking is okay, I didn\u2019t trust it enough to risk not logging a workout or having inaccurate data about my runs or gym time.",
      "Apple",
      "The Apple Watch similarly tracks sleep, health and fitness data, but has more convenient exercise tracking than Whoop, especially outdoors. It has its own GPS built-in, so its outdoor walk, run and cycling workouts tend to be slightly (or significantly) more accurate than the Whoop, depending on the environment. It also has more detailed stats for runners like cadence, stride length and more.",
      "Again, because it has a screen, it\u2019s easier to start and stop workouts on the Apple Watch. That screen is also useful for confirming or denying its automatic workout detection.",
      "My take: Both wearables track similar things. Whoop has the edge when it comes to sleep and health tracking, while Apple is easier and more accurate for exercise tracking.",
      "Metrics and analysis",
      "This is where things get interesting, and where the big differences between the Apple Watch and the Whoop MG reveal themselves.",
      "Whoop",
      "Whoop has three key metrics placed front and center on the Home tab: sleep, recovery and strain. Sleep is pretty self-explanatory, but recovery and strain are impressive but can be a bit confusing. Whoop assigns a strain score to all of your activities, and charts your strain across days, weeks and months. Strain is scored between zero and 21, which is very specific but can take some mental gymnastics when every other brand is using scales of zero to 10 or zero to 100. The specificity around strain and recovery was interesting to look at, but didn\u2019t feel too different from easy to understand features like Training Readiness and Training Status on some Garmin watches.",
      "The Health tab is where you will find most of the new features compared to the previous Whoop 4.0, and this is where I have the most mixed feelings.",
      "Clicking on the Health tab pulls up a slew of other metrics. You can track your respiratory rate, blood oxygen, resting heart rate, heart rate variability and skin temperature. You can see trends in each overtime, from weeks to months, similar to my experience using the Oura Ring 4.",
      "But the biggest new feature is Healthspan. In the essay-length description of the feature on the Whoop app, Whoop calls Healthspan \u201cthe number of years you live in good health.\u201d It gives two measurements: your Whoop Age and your Pace of Aging. Both, but mostly Pace of Aging, fills me with dread and anxiety in a way no other wearable I\u2019ve tested has. I could argue this says more about my relationship with mortality than Whoop, but hear me out.",
      "Pace of Aging \u201creflects how quickly your Whoop Age is changing,\u201d says Whoop in its app. It charts it on a scale from -1.0x to 3.0x, \u201clike a speedometer.\u201d Over 1.0x? Your Whoop Age is increasing faster than your chronological age.",
      "Your Pace of Aging changes weekly, and Whoop would notify me every week that it changed. During my entire test period, my Whoop Age was younger than my actual age (likely a reflection of my fitness activity), but my Pace of Aging was consistently fast, usually at 1.4x. Whoop eventually explained that my Whoop Age and Pace of Aging are increasing because of my sleep consistency, and to \u201ckeep an eye on this trend to stay on track\u201d or else my Whoop Age may increase if \u201cyou keep up with your current behaviors.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the thing: I know why I get between five and 6.5 hours of interrupted sleep every night: it\u2019s because I live in a one bedroom and have a wonderful one year old. I would love to sleep eight hours uninterrupted every night, but most new parents know that that is a pipe dream. So Whoop telling me that my interrupted sleep is speeding up my aging was just frustrating.",
      "It\u2019s important to remember that Whoop Age and Whoop Pace of Aging ultimately cannot truly tell you how fast you are aging. It\u2019s far too complex a topic for Whoop, or any wearable, to track. Aging is affected by a myriad of factors Whoop either isn\u2019t including or can\u2019t track, including diet, lifestyle, genetics, mental health and underlying medical conditions, to name a few.",
      "Healthspan is a buzzy feature that made me open the Whoop app more than usual. But I don\u2019t think a feature that fills me with dread and anxiety is a win, especially one that is more of a suggestion than objective truth.",
      "Apple",
      "By comparison, metrics and analysis on the Apple Watch are much more grounded and reserved \u2014 it doesn\u2019t go anywhere near fitness age or aging with its data. It\u2019s solely focused on giving you your sleep, health and fitness data, without much suggestion or analysis.",
      "Metrics are spread across two apps: Apple Health and Apple Fitness. Apple Fitness shows you all your workouts, and has features like Training Load and Trends that chart things like exercise frequency, move goals, steps, pace and cardio fitness over time. Apple Health has the Vitals feature, which tracks your overnight heart rate, respiratory rate, wrist temperature and sleep duration, and can tell you when your stats are out of normal range, indicating potential illness. Whoop does this too, but unfortunately for my testing (and fortunately for my health), I did not get sick during this comparison, so I couldn\u2019t test this feature.",
      "My take: Whoop MG gives you more metrics and analysis to look at than the Apple Watch. That\u2019s arguably the whole point of getting the Whoop: detailed strain, recovery and health data. My problem is that I either didn\u2019t find the analysis all that useful or it stressed me out (Healthspan). Apple Watch takes a \u201cjust the facts\u201d approach, with little to no analysis (outside of Vitals), just detailed metrics you can interpret on your own.",
      "Value",
      "My take: Normally I wouldn\u2019t harp on value too much: everyone has their own budget, and knows what they can and can\u2019t afford. But the Whoop subscription model is expensive, even compared to a premium product like the Apple Watch Series 10.",
      "A full-priced Series 10 is $399 (though it\u2019s often on sale for less). The lowest priced Whoop subscription is $199 a year. That means after just two years of use, the Whoop starts becoming more expensive than the Series 10.",
      "Everyone I know uses their wearables for four or five years. Four years of Whoop Life, the version I tested, is $1436. That\u2019s more than basically every wearable on the market.",
      "Whoop vs Apple Watch: The final verdict",
      "Whoop is a much more specific product than the Apple Watch \u2014 it\u2019s for a niche crowd who want a tracker with no screen, in-depth analysis and excellent battery life. If that sounds like you, give the Whoop a try \u2014 the brand has a one month free trial (though the trial does not include Healthspan features).",
      "Whoop is not for me, though. If I am wearing something on my wrist, I want it to have a screen so I can use my phone less. The Apple Watch Series 10 is one of the best wearables for anyone with an iPhone, as long as you don\u2019t mind charging it daily. In the long run, it\u2019s also much cheaper than any Whoop subscription.",

      "Size: Wheeled duffels come in a range of sizes, including smaller carry-ons and larger, checked bags. For shorter, weekend trips, Nguyen recommends bags that are around 22-26 inches, while she says 30-32 inch bags work better for longer, extended travel. Below, I included bags of various sizes to suit different types and lengths of travel.Materials: Durable, weather-resistant fabrics are key to getting longtime use out of your bag and protecting your belongings while on the move. Materials like ballistic nylon and coated polyester are ideal for overall durability, says Nguyen; each duffel on the list is made from materials that are designed to last long and hold up through challenging weather.Wheels and handles: Smooth-rolling wheels and a sturdy handle are essential in a good bag, says Nguyen. Every option below includes wheels and a handle, with some including telescoping handles, extra handle padding or top handles for easier lifting.Extra features: Certain features can make it easier to stay organized while traveling. The wheeled duffel bags on the list have a range of features, including exterior pockets and interior dividers, which Nguyen says can be useful for separating shoes or dirty clothes, and straps for expansion and compression to help you pack more.",

      "How to shop for wheeled duffels",
      "When shopping for wheeled duffels, you should primarily consider your use case and the overall design and durability of the bag. Below, Nguyen and I compiled some tips on what to keep in mind while browsing before your next trip.",
      "Use: Consider how you like to travel, and what kind of wheeled luggage will best fit those needs; do you need something that\u2019s lighter and more portable for short trips, or a bag that\u2019s larger and more rugged for outdoor adventure travel? If you tend to travel by plane, you\u2019ll also want to check that your bag adheres to airline carry-on and checked luggage sizes, she says.Features: Not all wheeled duffels are created equal. For example, if you\u2019re a long-distance walker, you may need one with more durable wheels, or a bag with reinforced, comfortable straps for carrying on your back. If you\u2019re anything like me and can\u2019t help but overpack, you\u2019ll want a wheeled duffel bag with plenty of organizational compartments and compression straps (which are perfect for last-minute bag-stuffing).",

      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Since duffel bags are so versatile and you could use them for a variety of weekend travel plans, Nguyen says they\u2019re best  for packing casual wear and outdoor gear. \u201cThey\u2019re especially useful for road trips, active vacations, or destinations where you need more flexible storage, like safaris or beach holidays.\u201d",
      "According to Nguyen, a wheeled duffel \u201ccombines the best of both worlds\u201d; you get the flexibility and spaciousness of a duffel bag, and the convenience of portable, rolling luggage. It also alleviates the shoulder strains that come with carrying travel backpacks, which can be really helpful when you\u2019re spending long periods of time in airports or on the streets with a heavier load. Duffels are also great for squeezing into tight spaces, like overhead bins, since their soft-sided adaptability makes them easier to manipulate.",

    "story": [
      "An enormous, 515-mile-long flash of lightning that crossed at least three states has been named the longest in recorded history in the world.",
      "The 2017 \u201cmegaflash\u201d stretched from eastern Texas to near Kansas City \u2014 a distance that would take at least eight hours by car or 90 minutes by commercial plane, according to the World Meteorological Organization. In comparison, the average bolt of lightning usually measures less than 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "The WMO, an agency within the United Nations, announced Thursday that it certified the megaflash as the longest lightning flash on record. It struck Oct. 22, 2017, during a severe storm that hit much of the Great Plains.",
      "A megaflash is a giant bolt of lightning that travels huge distances from its origin point, said Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University and a member of the WMO committee that confirmed the new record.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly strange phenomenon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only discovered them 10 years ago, when we could use a particular set of technologies to detect the start and end locations of the of lightning events.\u201d",
      "Megaflashes are not altogether uncommon, but they typically only occur in parts of the world where specific geographical and atmospheric conditions can produce the most severe thunderstorms, Cerveny said. In the Great Plains and across the Midwest, for instance, warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with drier, colder air from the north, creating strong atmospheric instability.",
      "When these conditions mix and produce severe storms, megaflashes of lightning can occur. These extra-long bolts of lightning have been observed before in the United States, Argentina and southern France, and scientists think they can also occur in parts of China and Australia, according to Cerveny.",
      "The 2017 megaflash was produced by an immense storm that blanketed a huge swath of the U.S., from Texas up into Iowa and Missouri. Though megaflashes can extend across multiple states, they form high up in the atmosphere and so rarely cause damage on the ground, Cerveny said.",
      "\u201cThey are upwards of 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, in the upper to middle layers of a thunderstorm,\u201d he said.",
      "The 515-mile-long lightning bolt was described in a study published Thursday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.",
      "\u201cThese new findings highlight important public safety concerns about electrified clouds which can produce flashes which travel extremely large distances and have a major impact on the aviation sector and can spark wildfires,\u201d WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in an accompanying statement.",
      "The extreme conditions that spawn them are a reminder of how powerful and dangerous lightning storms can be. In the U.S., lightning kills roughly 20 people each year and injures hundreds more, according to the weather service.",
      "With the classification Thursday, the 2017 lightning flash now surpasses the previous world record set five years ago by about 38 miles, according to the WMO. That bolt of lightning was unleashed April 29, 2020, and spanned 477.2 miles across parts of the southern U.S.",
      "The 2017 megaflash was identified after scientists re-examined archival measurements taken when the storm occurred.",
      "\u201cWhen the original studies were done, we didn\u2019t have the technology that we have today,\u201d Cerveny said. \u201cNow we have this instrument on a weather satellite that very accurately detects lightning and can precisely pinpoint where, how far and how long a lightning flash event takes place.\u201d",
      "Experts said it\u2019s likely there will be even longer megaflashes found in the coming years, particularly as satellite technologies improve the ability to detect them.",
      "\u201cOver time, as the data record continues to expand, we will be able to observe even the rarest types of extreme lightning on Earth and investigate the broad impacts of lightning on society,\u201d study lead author Michael Peterson, an atmospheric scientist in the Severe Storms Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said in a statement.",
      "The WMO's Committee on Weather and Climate Extremes keeps official records of global, hemispheric and regional extremes, including for temperature, rainfall, wind, hail, lightning, tornadoes and tropical cyclones."

      "Recipients of federal funds range from schools, colleges and universities to nonprofit organizations and private firms that are government contractors. The memo was released publicly by the Justice Department.",

      "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \u201cThe Hunting Wives.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d is the definition of a binge watch. Sultry yet thought-provoking, the series has stayed near the top of the Netflix Top 10 charts since its debut on the streamer on July 21.",
      "Brittany Snow plays Sophie, who arrives in East Texas from Boston along with her husband Graham (Evan Jonigkeit) and their son. She's a fish out of water, adjusting to new cultural norms and a few traumatic events in her past that cast a long shadow.",
      "The Maple Brook neighborhood clearly has a charged history. Luckily for Sophie, Margo (Malin Akerman) takes her under her wing \u2014 a good friend to have, considering Margo is married to a wealthy oil tycoon named Jed (Dermot Mulroney) who is running for governor.",
      "But there's a darkness lurking in this friend group. Local teenage Abby (Madison Wolfe) is found dead, and anyone could be the killer. Signs are pointing to it being Sophie, since Abby was shot with Sophie\u2019s new gun. Yep, that\u2019s right: It only took a few weeks and Sophie was already getting arms to match her new neighbors\u2019.",
      "Sophie can hardly remember the night of Abby's murder \u2014 she and Margo were having a bit of a rager at Margo's lake house. But she's sure she's innocent. Still, she's not innocent when it comes to letting Margo convince her to start drinking, start driving after a tragic accident, and have affairs with younger men (and each other).",
      "Read on to find out what happens in \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d and how the ending compares to the book by May Cobb.",

      "Do you really want to know? OK: It's Margo, Sophie's new lover and the queen bee of the friend group.",
      "Two scenes from the first episode foreshadow Margo's crime.",
      "First, Abby hooks up with her then-boyfriend, high schooler Brad (George Ferrier), but stops because it conflicts with her faith. In the middle of all this, Margo opens the door and makes eye contact with Brad. Yep, they\u2019re a secret item.",
      "Aside from the age gap, and aside from the fact that Margo is married, there's another complication. Brad's mom Jill (Katie Lowes) is married to a prominent pastor and is Margo's friend.",
      "Second, there's the question of the tampons.",
      "Sophie meets Margo for the first time in the bathroom of her palatial house. There, Margo lets it slip that she can't use tampons. But that's not quite the case. In the finale, when Sophie and Margo have rekindled their romance, Sophie goes to the bathroom and sees tampons. Margo says she can use tampons.",
      "Why would this matter? Well, Pastor Pete (Paul Teal), the town's youth pastor (more on that dude later), had told Sophie that Abby had gotten an abortion \u2014 but he interpreted Brad's confession wrong. In fact, it was Margo who had the abortion. When's a time that women can't use tampons? After abortions.",
      "Margo had gone to her estranged biological dad, a doctor, to perform the procedure. (At the same time as all this, Margo is campaigning for her husband's anti-abortion stance).",
      "As for why Margo killed Abby? Her motive was simple. After a lifetime of manipulating her way to the top, Margo couldn't let her status be threatened, and Abby was about to do just that.",
      "Abby figured out that Margo had the abortion and was planning to reveal it \u2014 a disaster for Margo, her husband's campaign and her political career.",
      "Margo kills her. With the help of her father and brother Kyle (Michael Aaron Milligan), they conspire to help Margo cover it up, creating an alibi for her.",
      "Who Else Dies in  'The Hunting Wives'?",

    "summary": "Harrison Ford opened up about the stipulation needed for him and wife Calista Flockhart to work together.",
    "story": [
      "Harrison Ford is open to the idea of mixing business with pleasure.",
      "In a recent interview with Variety, the Oscar-nominated star, 83, said he and wife Calista Flockhart have one rule in place for them to team up on a project.",
      "\u201cIf we get to work together, we\u2019d want it to be someone else\u2019s idea,\u201d he told the outlet.",
      "\u201cThat kind of casting might not be the best way to bring people into an imagined situation, because (audiences) may say, \u2018Oh, I know they\u2019re married; now I\u2019m not even thinking about the movie anymore.\u2019\u201d",
      "While at the Los Angeles premiere of \"Shrinking\" in 2023, Ford talked about how he would \u201clove\u201d to work with Flockhart, who he married in 2010.",
      "\"We\u2019d love to find one we could do together,\" he told People, adding that they \"haven't found\" the right project at the time.",
      "Although Ford has yet to appear on screen with Flockhart, he will collaborate with another acting icon when Michael J. Fox guest stars on the upcoming third season of \u201cShrinking.\u201d",
      "In the series, Ford\u2019s character, Dr. Paul Rhoades, has been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease, a condition Fox has had for over three decades. Ford says Fox is a welcome addition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been essential. Michael\u2019s courage, his fortitude and his grace, more than anything else, is on full display,\u201d he told Variety. \u201cHe\u2019s very smart, very brave, noble, generous, passionate guy, and an example to all of us, whether we\u2019re facing Parkinson\u2019s or not. You cannot help but recognize how amazing it is to have such grace.\u201d",
      "Ford said Fox offers him a blueprint for how to approach playing someone who has Parkinson\u2019s.",
      "\u201cSo he gives me both a physical representation of the disease to inform myself with, but more than that, he allows me to believe that Paul could believe that he could be adequate to the challenge,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe truth is that we can\u2019t be f------ around with this just to make a joke or anything. Parkinson\u2019s is not funny. And I want to get it right. It\u2019s necessary to be correct with what we do in respect of the challenge that Parkinson\u2019s represents, and that we don\u2019t use it for its entertainment value.\"",
      "Ford has been lauded for his work in \u201cShrinking,\u201d even scoring his first Emmy nomination, a feat he\u2019s taking in stride.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything competitive about creativity, and I don\u2019t understand the need to compare and contrast one person\u2019s work to another\u2019s,\u201d he said. If you like it, you like it; if you don\u2019t like it, look at something else.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m grateful, but I would have done what I did \u2014 and I\u2019ll do what I\u2019m doing \u2014 regardless of whether it\u2019s deemed worthy of mention or not. Because it\u2019s what I do. It\u2019s what I love doing. I love telling stories. I love pretending to be somebody else.\u201d",
      "Ford, of course, has played everything from the president to Indiana Jones to police officers, but he soared to fame playing Han Solo in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise. His character famously said, \u201cI know\u201d when Carrie Fisher\u2019s Leia told him she loved him. He said that\u2019s not how the line was meant to go.",
      "\u201cI was supposed to say, \u2018I love you too,\u2019 and I thought that was a little un-Han Solo-ish,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was a little banal. So I said no, and (director) Irvin Kershner agreed with me. George (Lucas), when he saw it, was not so sure, and made me sit next to him at the screening of the film the first time we ran it for an audience. They laughed, but it was a good laugh, so we kept it in. Thank you, George.\u201d",
      "Ford has been acting on screen since he made his film debut in 1966\u2019s \u201cDead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round.\u201d He\u2019s closing in on 60 years in front of the camera, and when asked if he plans to retire, the actor shared he has no plans to stop.",
      "\u201cNo. That\u2019s one of the things I thought was attractive about the job of an actor, was that they need old people, too, to play old people\u2019s parts,\u201d Ford said."

    "summary": "Why is Sydney Sweeney's new ad campaign with American Eagle sparking controversy? Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Sydney Sweeney's recent partnership with American Eagle Outfitters has generated substantial online criticism.",
      "The ad campaign, which focuses on the company\u2019s new line of denim products, is centered around the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans\" \u2014 and people have a lot to say about the slogan's messaging.",
      "Chatter surrounding the collaboration has added the brand to a growing list of companies experiencing \u201cmeme stock\u201d booms, CNBC reported, or a stock that gains popularity through social media. After the initiative debuted, shares of the company\u2019s stock jumped more than 4%.",
      "So, why are people talking about the ad? Here is everything you need to know.",
      "What do the Sydney Sweeney ads for American Eagle depict?",
      "In American Eagle\u2019s fall campaign, Sydney Sweeney shows off the company\u2019s latest collection of denim.",
      "Videos from the promotion focus on the \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cAnyone But You\u201d star's denim-clad body as she lounges with a puppy, fixes a car and buttons up a pair of over-sized jeans.",
      "\u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign\u2019s slogan booms at the end of each clip as a play on the words \u201cgenes\u201d and \u201cjeans.\u201d",
      "The ads play up the homophone \"good jeans\" and \"good genes.\"",
      "\u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My genes are blue,\u201d Sweeney says in one ad as the camera pans her body while she buttons a pair of jeans.",
      "Another print ad spells out, \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes,\u201d but crosses out the \u201cgenes\u201d and writes in \u201cjeans.\u201d",
      "The collection features over 200 fits of jeans and over 50 new styles. In the campaign announcement, President and Executive Creative Director at American Eagle explains Sweeney\u2019s role in the ad.",
      "\u201cWith Sydney Sweeney front and center, she brings the allure, and we add the flawless wardrobe for the winning combo of ease, attitude and a little mischief,\u201d the announcement reads.",
      "Why is the ad campaign causing controversy?",
      "The campaign has stirred up mixed opinions on the internet, raising questions about its intent and implications.",
      "For some, the campaign\u2019s central messaging about genes uphold outdated and harmful standards of beauty, and even promote eugenic ideals.",
      "Eugenics is an evolutionary theory aimed to select \u201cdesired heritable characteristics in order to improve future generations,\u201d according to Encyclopedia Britannica. The movement has a long history, but in the U.S., it historically used \"genetic superiority\" as justification for white supremacy.",
      "The ad\u2019s messaging surrounding \u201cgood genes\u201d feels like a wink to eugenic ideals.",
      "\u201cThem choosing \u2018Sydney Sweeney has great genes\u2019 was not an accident,\u201d one user said in a TikTok video that received over one million views. \u201cIt\u2019s a dog whistle towards the rise of people who are wanting to see more people who look like them everywhere.\u201d",
      "A representative for Sweeney declined to comment to NBC News. American Eagle did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Cheryl Overton, Chief Experience Officer at integrated marketing communications firm Cheryl Overton Communications, says context is important. The promotion \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum,\u201d she says. Instead, it occurs in \u201ca country actively grappling with social standards rooted in whiteness.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe subtext isn\u2019t imagined; it\u2019s rooted in centuries-old narrative about one archetype of beauty that is seen as genetically superior or \u2018aspirational,\u201d Overton tells TODAY.com.",
      "While the ad never references race, Hillary Herskowitz, CEO and Founder of H2 Marketing Group, tells TODAY.com there is \u201cno denying\u201d that the phrase \u201ccarries historical baggage.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you pair that kind of wordplay with a blond, blue-eyed actress, it can unintentionally reinforce narrow, Eurocentric beauty standards,\u201d she adds.",
      "Whether this implication is purposeful is up for debate.",
      "Overton says the messaging could be the result of a \u201cblind spot of a team lacking cultural fluency\u201d or a \u201cbrand looking actively to cull consumers who value diversity from its base.\u201d",
      "Herskowitz sees the ad as being designed to provoke a reaction.",
      "\u201cIntentional,\u201d Herskowitz says. \u201cThat line \u2014 \u2018good jeans\u2019 \u2014 is too perfectly constructed not to be. It was designed to be cheeky, playful and buzzworthy. The creative team knew exactly what they were doing.\"",
      "Adrienne Alexander, owner of the PR firm IPY Agency, points out the extensive process campaigns like this go through, and says multiple teams likely signed off on the language.",
      "\u201cCampaigns like this go through many hands, including creative, legal, PR, and brand strategy, so it\u2019s unlikely that no one flagged the potential issue. More likely, the team underestimated the reaction or saw it as a playful pun rather than a loaded phrase. Either way, the responsibility remains the same: if you spark a conversation, be prepared to own it and respond accordingly,\u201d she says.",
      "The ad has also garnered criticism for sexualizing Sweeney. Some say the ad\u2019s close-up shots of the actor seem to objectify her and cater to the male gaze.",
      "\u201cAre we selling jeans to women or selling women in jeans to men?\u201d one user commented on American Eagle\u2019s Instagram.",
      "The limited edition Sydney Jean, produced with Sweeney, has a butterfly motif on the back pocket representing domestic violence awareness, per a press release from the company, and the entirety of the purchase price will be donated to the Crisis Text Line.",
      "Marketing professor Melissa Murphy calls the juxtaposition of the sexual nature of the ads, plus the domestic violence tie-in, \"mismatched\" tonally.",
      "Some viewers have also pointed out that the ad feels reminiscent of a controversial Calvin Klein campaign from 1980 featuring a teenage Brooke Shields.",
      "\u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing,\u201d the then 15-year-old model said in the ad as the camera panned her entire body.",
      "The moment caused an uproar for holding sexual implications and taking advantage of the young star. Shields later spoke out about the moment, saying she was unaware of the ad\u2019s meaning.",
      "Like the Calvin Klein ad, which Klein once said put the company on the map, American Eagle has seen increased chatter following the campaign\u2019s debut.",
      "According to Herskowitz, controversy can \u201cdrive brand momentum.\u201d But was the controversy intentional?",
      "Murphy, doubts it, and so calls the ad campaign, and its lack of diversity, a \u201cmiss.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey should have done (the ad) with multiple people \u2014 that would definitely resonate better,\u201d she says. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t more, and this is just it, then that\u2019s not a good sign.\u201d"

    "summary": "The magnitude-8.8 earthquake off Russia\u2019s Kamchatka peninsula sent a wave of water racing at the speed of a jetliner toward Hawaii, California and Washington state, spurring warnings and alarm overnight Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "The magnitude-8.8 earthquake off Russia\u2019s Kamchatka peninsula sent a wave of water racing at the speed of a jetliner toward Hawaii, California and Washington state, spurring warnings and alarm overnight Wednesday.",
      "But when the tsunami waves arrived, they didn\u2019t cause devastation or deaths in the United States, and the inundation might not have appeared threatening in some locations where warnings were issued.",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean the tsunami was a \"bust,\" that it was poorly forecast or that it didn\u2019t pose a risk, earthquake and tsunami researchers said.",
      "\u201cYou start to hear \u2018tsunami warning,\u2019 and everyone immediately thinks of the last Hollywood movie they saw, and then it comes in at 3 feet and people are like, 'What\u2019s that?\u2019\u201d said Harold Tobin, the director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and a professor at the University of Washington. \u201cWe should count it as a win that a tsunami occurred, we got a warning and it wasn\u2019t the worst-case scenario.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "How strong was the Kamchatka earthquake? And why did it change so much?",
      "Initial reports from the U.S. Geological Survey pegged the Kamchatka earthquake at magnitude 8.0. Later, it was upgraded to 8.8.",
      "\u201cThat is not uncommon for very, very large earthquakes in those initial minutes,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cOur standard algorithms for determining the size of an earthquake quickly saturate. It\u2019s like turning up an amp and getting a lot of distortion.\"",
      "One of the first signs the earthquake was stronger than the initial seismic reports said was an initial measurement from a buoy about 275 miles southeast of the Kamchatka peninsula.",
      "The buoy, which is part of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) system, is connected to a seafloor pressure sensor about 4 miles below the surface.",
      "The sensor registered a 90-centimeter wave \u2014 more than 35 inches \u2014 which is eye-popping to tsunami researchers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the second-largest recording we ever saw in the tsunami world,\u201d said Vasily Titov, a senior tsunami modeler at NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, adding that it indicated there was \u201ca catastrophic tsunami propagating in the ocean.\u201d",
      "Titov said the only higher reading was from the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people in Japan.",
      "Seismic models later confirmed that Wednesday's earthquake was magnitude 8.8, which means it released nearly 16 times as much energy as a magnitude-8.0 earthquake, according to a USGS calculation tool.",
      "T\u014dhoku was much bigger.",
      "Tobin estimated that earthquake released two to three times as much energy as was observed in Kamchatka. Titov said the tsunami in Japan was also about three times larger.",
      "In addition, he said the T\u014dhoku earthquake \u201cproduced an anomalously large seafloor displacement,\u201d lurching and moving more water than expected, even for an earthquake of its magnitude.",
      "At Kamchatka, \u201cit\u2019s likely that there was less seafloor displacement than could have happened in a worst-case or more dire scenario for a magnitude-8.8,\u201d Tobin said, though more research will be needed to confirm that theory.",
      "How did researchers make a forecast? How good was the forecast?",
      "In two hours, researchers produced a tsunami forecast for \u201cpretty much the whole Pacific and for warning points along the U.S. coastlines,\u201d Titov said, with predictions of water levels at coastal tide gauges and for flood inundation.",
      "The tsunami took about eight hours to reach Hawaii and 12 hours to reach the California coast.",
      "Titov, who helped build the models used by forecasters who issue warnings from the National Tsunami Warning Centers in Hawaii and Alaska, said the models rely on seismic data and the network of more than 70 DART buoys along the Pacific Rim, which sense pressure changes. The United States owns and operates more than half of the DART buoys.",
      "Titov said the models indicated that north shore areas of Hawaii would get tsunami waves of about 2 meters or less.",
      "\u201cHilo was predicted at about 2 meters [6.5 feet], and it materialized at about 150 centimeters,\u201d or 1.5 meters (5 feet), Titov said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly how we want it \u2014 a little bit on the conservative side.\u201d",
      "The same trend played out in parts of California, Titov said.",
      "It will take some time to assess how well the models predicted inundation because reports about the extent of flooding are still coming in.",
      "\u201cWe know that the flooding occurred at Hawaii. We don\u2019t know exactly the extent, but from the reports that I saw on TV, it looks like exactly what we predicted,\u201d Titov said.",
      "Why were people in Hawaii evacuated for a 5-foot wave?",
      "Yong Wei, a tsunami modeler and senior research scientist at the University of Washington and the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research, said a 1.5-meter (5-foot) tsunami wave can be very dangerous, particularly in shallow waters off Hawaii.",
      "Tsunami waves contain far more energy than wind waves, which are far shorter in wavelength and period (time between waves) and slower in speed.",
      "Wei said tsunami waves of the size that struck Hawaii can surge inland \u201ctens of meters,\u201d produce dangerous currents and damage boats and other moveable objects.",
      "\u201cPeople die. If they stay there and they don\u2019t get any warning, 2 meters can definitely kill people,\u201d Wei said. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the beach, strong currents can definitely pull you out into the ocean and people will get drowned.\u201d",
      "Tobin said the initial warnings were conservative but appropriate, in his view.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want people to think, oh, we had a warning and nothing much happened and pooh-pooh it \u2014 'I can ignore it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWarnings by nature have to err a bit on the side of caution.\u201d",
      "Was this a historic event?",
      "No. The Kamchatka peninsula has a long history of earthquakes.",
      "\u201cThis was an area that was ready for another earthquake, and there had been a lot of earthquakes in that region over the last few weeks,\u201d which indicates increased risk, said Breanyn MacInnes, a professor in the geological sciences department at Central Washington University.",
      "In 1952, before scientists had a strong understanding of plate tectonics, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the Kamchatka peninsula in much the same region, sending a tsunami into the town of Severo-Kurilsk.",
      "\u201cPeople in Russia were not really prepared for it. It was very big earthquake, a big tsunami, and they were caught off guard,\u201d MacInnes said.",
      "MacInnes said the tsunami was 30 to 60 feet in height in southern parts of the peninsula.",
      "\u201cThousands of people were killed, and basically the town was destroyed,\u201d said Joanne Bourgeois, an emeritus professor of sedimentology at the University of Washington, who has been studying the region\u2019s earthquake history for about three decades.",
      "How would the tsunami warning system perform if the earthquake struck closer to home?",
      "The Kamchatka tsunami is a megathrust earthquake produced along a large subduction zone fault, when one tectonic plate is forced beneath another. The U.S. West Coast features a similar fault, called the Cascadia subduction zone, which runs offshore from Northern California to northern Vancouver Island.",
      "\u201cThis is kind of a mirror image across the Pacific,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cAn 8.8 at a relatively shallow depth in Cascadia is definitely in the realm of scenarios. We could have a similar event here.\u201d",
      "In fact, Cascadia has the potential to produce much larger quakes, Tobin said. Modeling suggests Cascadia could produce tsunami waves as tall as 100 feet.",
      "Subduction zone earthquakes typically produce tsunamis that reach shore in about 30 minutes to an hour, Titov said, which would strain forecasters\u2019 capabilities to predict tsunami effects precisely along the U.S. West Coast before inundation happened.",
      "Titov said more seafloor sensors, more computer processing and innovation with artificial intelligence algorithms are needed to speed forecasting.",
      "Tobin said the successful tsunami warning Tuesday should spur investment in seafloor sensors and seismic monitoring stations offshore along the subduction zone.",
      "\u201cThis shows the value and importance of NOAA and the USGS in these times where some of these government agencies have come into question,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have had a tsunami warning if it weren\u2019t for NOAA, and the next one could be a closer event. They showed their value.\u201d"

      "A year later, the airline said it had begun a $400 million retrofit of its legacy fleet, accelerating the upgrade by leasing jets from other airlines, including Delta.",
      "That momentum came to a grinding halt last month when a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed seconds after takeoff in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad, killing all but one of the 242 people aboard plus 19 others on the ground in one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "Air India has since been under immense pressure to answer for the crash, but bereaved families were left with more questions after investigators released a preliminary report this month that said the plane\u2019s fuel switches had been wrongly cut off, leading to speculation that one of the pilots might have done it accidentally or even intentionally.",
      "Indian investigators and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which is involved in the crash investigation as the aircraft is U.S.-made, said such conclusions were irresponsible.",
      "\u201cInvestigations of this magnitude take time,\u201d NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said, while India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau urged the public and the media to \u201crefrain from spreading premature narratives.\u201d",
      "But Indian commentators were already irate.",
      "\u201cWhy do this rumor mill mongering about possible problems with the pilot?\u201d Arnab Goswami, a firebrand anchor, said on his conservative Republic Media Network. \u201cSo that across the world the impression goes that Indian pilots cannot fly?\u201d",
      "Capt. C.S. Randhawa, a former pilot for Air India and the Indian air force, said the suggestion that one of the pilots may have crashed the plane deliberately has \u201cdemoralized the pilots in the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll pilots are up in arms, and it\u2019s not a good thing. The pilots have to fly with that mental attitude,\u201d Randhawa, who is currently the president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, told NBC News.",
      "The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that the crash did not appear to have been caused by a mechanical issue with the Boeing fuel control unit. The final report is due next year.",
      "On top of the lack of clarity, some British families hoping to bury their loved ones said they had received the remains of the wrong people, according to the Daily Mail, which cited a lawyer representing them. The Indian foreign ministry said Wednesday that all remains were being handled with \u201cutmost professionalism\u201d and that it was working closely with the British side to address concerns.",
      "Air India was also warned last week by India\u2019s aviation regulator that it could face enforcement action over more than two dozen safety violations from this year and last year, Reuters reported, citing government notices. They include pilots not being given mandatory rest and poor compliance with simulator training requirements.",
      "The airline, which voluntarily disclosed the problems last month, said Friday that it would respond to the regulator and that it \u201cremains fully committed to ensuring the safety of its passengers and staff.\u201d",
      "Air India was already under enormous pressure to clean up its reputation after falling into disrepair during its nearly 70 years of government ownership. Its reform nevertheless aligned perfectly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s nationalist narrative of turning India into a global superpower.",
      "\u201cGiven its legacy, the brand remains synonymous with India,\u201d said Shelley Vishwajeet, a New Delhi-based aviation journalist and  author of \u201cThe IndiGo Story,\u201d a book about the Indian airline. He added that the cultural transformation within Air India \u201chas been a challenge\u201d for its new owners.",
      "Things moved quickly after the takeover by the Tata Group, which consolidated several airlines it controlled, including Vistara and Air Asia India, into two entities: the full-cost carrier Air India and its budget arm, Air India Express.",
      "Vistara, which was partly owned by Singapore Airlines, was particularly beloved by Indians, known for its modern planes and best-in-class customer experience. When it merged with Air India, travelers and crew hoped that Air India would be the true Vistara successor.",
      "But Air India has struggled to deliver change as fast as some had hoped.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re struggling with maintenance issues, disrepair issues, and all these things are taking time,\u201d Randhawa said."

      "The case dates back to 2012, when Uribe filed a libel suit against Cepeda, with the Supreme Court. But in a surprise twist the high court dismissed charges against Cepeda and launched an investigation against Uribe in 2018.",

    "story": [
      "At least 60% of liver cancers could be preventable, according to an analysis published Monday in The Lancet.",
      "Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world, with around 870,000 cases in 2022. That\u2019s projected to increase to 1.52 million cases in 2050, the new report found, if no changes are made.",
      "The leading cause of liver cancer is viral infections, including the hepatitis B and C viruses. Hepatitis B infections \u2014 which are preventable with a vaccine \u2014 accounted for 39% of liver cancers in 2022. That\u2019s expected to fall slightly, to 36.9%, by 2025. Hepatitis C accounted for 29.1% of liver cancers in 2022 and is also projected to fall, to 25.9%, by 2050.",
      "The proportions of alcohol- and obesity-related liver cancers, however, are projected to rise in the next 25 years. Alcohol accounted for 18.8% of liver cancers in 2022, and that is expected to increase to 21.1% in 2050. The share of liver cancers caused by obesity-related disease is projected to increase from 8% to 10.8% by 2050 due to increasing rates of obesity, diabetes and high cholesterol and other metabolic risk factors.",
      "Dr. Hashem El-Serag, one of the report\u2019s co-authors and chair of the department of medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said the public usually thinks of alcohol as the biggest risk factor for liver cancer.",
      "\u201cI think for most people, if you say cirrhosis, they immediately think of a relative, of someone who was a heavy drinker,\u201d El-Serag said. \u201cI think the vast majority do not make the tie between MASLD, or fatty liver, and cirrhosis and liver cancer.\u201d",
      "MASLD, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, affects about 25% of adults in the U.S. It\u2019s caused by a buildup of fat in the liver. About 5% of U.S. adults have a more severe form, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can lead to scarring, or cirrhosis, of the liver, significantly increasing the risk of cancer.",
      "Excess alcohol consumption can also lead to cirrhosis.",
      "Liver cancer is still relatively rare in the United States, representing 2.1% of all new cancer diagnoses in 2025. The report estimated that by 2040, U.S. rates of MASLD could more than double, affecting more than 55% of adults.",
      "Detecting liver cancer risk factors",
      "Earlier detection and effective treatment plans for MASLD can reduce the risk of obesity-related liver cancer, El-Serag said. The most common treatment is weight loss. GLP-1 weight loss drugs, which include Ozempic and Wegovy, are promising, he said. (A clinical trial published in April found that Wegovy treated MASH in about two-thirds of patients.)",
      "However, people aren\u2019t screened for MASLD like they are for viral hepatitis, El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Arun Jesudian, a hepatologist and the director of liver quality and inpatient liver services at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, said patients are tested for MASLD and/or MASH if they have elevated liver enzymes in their blood.",
      "Raising awareness about MASLD among both patients and doctors can lead to more effective testing and diagnosis, Jesudian said.",
      "\u201cI think then we need to make sure that providers who are interacting with these patients are looking at the liver disease component of metabolic syndrome,\u201d he said, referring to patients with a cluster of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure and excess weight. \u201cSo checking liver enzymes, that they know how to assess for fibrosis, even based on these blood test scores.\u201d",
      "MASLD and MASH can often be asymptomatic, making self-detection more challenging.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s haphazard. Some people get tested. Others get suspected. Third, who knows?\u201d El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Neehar Parikh, a hepatologist at the University of Michigan who specializes in liver cancer, said he is seeing more patients with MASLD as a driving factor for liver cancer.",
      "Patients with MASLD can develop liver cancer without developing cirrhosis, making it even more challenging to detect those cases, Parikh said. Up to 40% of those with liver cancers linked to MASLD don\u2019t develop cirrhosis, according to the report.",
      "Figuring out who those patients are is the \u201cmillion-dollar question,\u201d he said. \u201cThose patients that develop MASLD that develop liver cancer, you know, how do you screen that population? We don\u2019t really know what to do.\u201d",
      "Still, Parikh said these types of cases are rare.",
      "Ultimately, Jesudian said, \u201ctreating these liver diseases early is the best way to prevent liver cancer, because liver cancer almost always occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease.\u201d"
