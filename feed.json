    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 00:26:25 -0500",

      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized",
      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized. Now the question is: Can they still put on a good show?",
      "The 82nd Golden Globes, beginning Sunday night at 8 p.m. EST, will hope to rekindle some of the frothy comic energy of the days when Ricky Gervais or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted. Last year's comeback edition, hosted by Jo Koy, was widely panned, but it delivered where it counted: Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS signed up for five more years.",
      "This time, comedian Nikki Glaser will be emceeing the ceremony from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The Globes, now owned by Todd Boehly's Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, will be broadcast live by CBS and available to stream live for subscribers to Paramount+ with Showtime beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern.",
      "While Glaser doesn't have as widely seen contenders as last year, when \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie\u201d were the headliners, the show does promise about as much star power as Hollywood can muster. Nominees including Zendaya, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Selena Gomez.",
      "Jacques Audiard's Netflix musical \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d comes in as the lead nominee, with 10 nods, followed by Brady Corbet's postwar epic \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d with seven, and Edward Berger's papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d with six. Among the top-nominated series are \u201cThe Bear,\u201d \u201cShogun\" and \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d",
      "Here are a few things to look for heading into Sunday's Globes:",
      "The best actor in a drama category is a bruiser, with a field of Ralph Fiennes (\"Conclave\"), Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\"), Daniel Craig (\"Queer\"), Colman Domingo (\"Sing Sing\"), Sebastian Stan (\"The Apprentice\") and Chalamet, for the Bob Dylan film \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d While Fiennes or Brody might take it, a win for Chalamet would be the first major award for the 29-year-old star \u2014 and surely would get the Oscar talk going.",
      "Just days before the Globes, Blake Lively sued \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set. Baldoni, who has denied it, joined in a suit accusing The New York Times for libel in its story on her allegations.",
      "Whether or not any of this gets mentioned on the Beverly Hilton Ballroom stage, it will surely be on the minds of many attendees. Among the nominees for box-office achievement is \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d which star and was co-produced by Ryan Reynolds, Lively's husband. Glaser, whose sharply barbed jokes at a roast of Tom Brady helped catapult her to this moment, isn't known for biting her tongue.",
      "\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d may have be favored over \u201cWicked\u201d for the best comedy or musical award, but Jon M. Chu\u2019s theatrical hit is also in the mix for the Globes\u2019 nascent cinematic box office achievement award. Either, or both, of the leading ladies of \u201dWicked\u201d could also win: Erivo in the leading actress category, and Grande in supporting.",
      "The Globes, taking place about two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, could get very political if presenters and winners are so inclined to continue what's been a mutually antagonistic relationship between Hollywood and Trump. That may be unlikely, though; so far in Hollywood's awards season, most nominees have tried to stay out of the fray.",
      "That's with a major exception, though, in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the young Trump drama starring Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. Both were nominated by the Globes. Stan was also nominated a second time for his performance in \u201cA Different Man.\u201d",
      "It's been an unusually uncertain awards season so far in many respects. No one movie has really stepped forward as the leading best picture contender, though several films \u2014 including \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cWicked,\" \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d \u2014 can all make a decent case. The Globes don't typically do much to sort out the field, but a strong showing from any of the above could add fuel to their Oscar campaign.",

      "\u201cI was always drawn to left-of-center things,\u201d he told Jim Alexander two years ago in an interview for the Reel Talker YouTube channel.",
      "Baena said in the same interview that it was \u201camazing\u201d to work with Plaza, who appeared in four of his five films. The 40-year-old actor and producer rose to fame playing April Ludgate on the television series \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and was nominated for an Emmy for her role on \u201cThe White Lotus.\u201d The couple married in 2021.",
      "\u201cThe opportunities to create together, to do something creative where we're both fulfilled, it's like how rare is that? She's down and she's so talented, so I'm really lucky,\" Baena said.",
      "A representative for Plaza said that in addition to Plaza, Baena is survived by his mother, Barbara Stern, stepfather Roger Stern, father Scott Baena, stepmother Michele Baena, brother Brad Baena and stepsiblings Bianca Gabay and Jed Fluxman."

Past recipients include Norman Lear, Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres. The first was Burnett herself.",

      "The show\u2019s title is a homage to \u201cThey Call It Pro Football,\u201d which was NFL Films\u2019 first full-length film in 1967. NFL Films originated in Philadelphia and founders Ed and Steve Sabol are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It also featured the voice of John Facenda, whose tone was imitated on the show by Kelce and his panel as they narrated modern NFL highlights.",
      "\u201cI knew I wanted NFL Films because I felt like we wanted to make a show that celebrated the NFL landscape,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cNot just from current players and current games, but of past games and past players. Past announcers. NFL fans and the subculture of the NFL. We wanted to create a show that really embraced all of that.\u201d",
      "The Philadelphia-based band Snacktime provided the music. Kylie Kelce, fresh off dethroning Joe Rogan as the No. 1 podcast on the Spotify charts, served as the foul-mouthed sidekick from her perch in \u201cKylie\u2019s Korner.\u201d",
      "Kelce's expletives in the monologue were no momentary brain cramp as he transitioned from locker room talk to cable television. Kelce and his wife peppered their conversations with profanity \u2014 this is late night, after all \u2014 and tried to make the relationship seem as real in the studio as it is at home, where the couple raise three daughters, with a fourth expected this year.",
      "\u201cWe really wanted the language to be real and authentic to me,\u201d Kelce said after the show. \u201cWe overdid it a little bit today to kind of prep the audience on what to expect. I think the F-bombs was the one thing where I was told, we might want to be a little bit cautious there but, listen, we want to give you range to be who you are.\"",
      "The debut one-hour \u201cLate Night\u201d episode was taped Friday in front of a live audience from Philly concert venue Union Transfer. The show aired at 1 a.m. EST on ESPN and will tape the next four Friday nights. The schedule coincides with the last week of the NFL\u2019s regular season and the playoffs.",
      "Comedian Seth Herzog warmed up the crowd and joked the event had a no-phones policy so Kelce wouldn\u2019t smash them like he did in a viral moment at Penn State.",
      "The Philly slant couldn\u2019t be missed \u2014 they filmed a bit where a female fan spewed bites of a hoagie into the mouth of, well, Jason Kelce from the future, and Barkley played to the crowd when he picked the Eagles to win the Super Bowl \u2014 but the real Kelce said he wanted a show that would appeal to fans nationwide.",
      "Smash hit or not, there are no promises from ESPN of anything beyond the limited run.",
      "\u201cWe really just wanted to try something fun to do and I think everybody was on board to experiment and see what happens,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI do think there's room for this, especially within the football season.\u201d",
      "After Kelce participated in a skit with parents Ed and Donna, celebrated with a fastest beer-chugging winner and shared a cold one at the bar with Eagles great Harold Carmichael, he broke down the show the same way he would as an Eagles player in the postgame locker room.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s game day,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cPlenty of errors, just like a game. Plenty of things to clean up. But just so happy with how it went.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s vastly different to work as an Asian actor in North American hubs such as Toronto, Los Angeles and New York \u2014 than in those in Asia, including Hong Kong and Taipei",
      "Twenty years after he was a young, struggling actor in Toronto, Thomas Lo is now the one giving young Asian actors their big breaks. He just had to go to Hong Kong to do it.",
      "The Chinese Canadian has been the creative director of one of the island city's biggest TV broadcasting companies for only a few years, but is already making original English-language content to reach viewers around the world.",
      "\u201cIt was a bit of a full-circle moment for me,\u201d Lo told The Associated Press. \u201cYou see more Asians but you\u2019re still seeing the same Asians on screen, right? We\u2019re looking for more opportunities on a grander scale and it\u2019s not just in front of the camera. It\u2019s behind the camera as well.\u201d",
      "It's vastly different to work as an Asian actor in North American hubs \u2014 Toronto, Los Angeles, New York \u2014 than in those in Asia \u2014 such as Hong Kong or Taipei. Actors in Asia don't as often have to deal with auditioning for stereotypical characters, being the only Asian on a set or getting tokenized. Historically, many Asian American and Canadian actors have even relocated from the West to countries in Asia to find better opportunities in entertainment.",
      "A few film and TV producers on both sides of the Pacific, however, are looking to shake up those dynamics by crisscrossing their show biz ecosystems. The hope is a win-win with fledgling talent in the Asian diaspora gaining global exposure \u2014 and Asia-based productions getting wider audiences. For example the Hulu series \u201cShogun,\u201d which won 18 Emmys, demonstrated a successful collaboration between Japanese and Western cast and crew \u2014 which included Japanese Americans.",
      "At the helm of Hong Kong's Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB), Lo led its first collaboration with an American company \u2014 on an original TV drama with scenes in both English and Cantonese. Two crews on two different continents filmed \u201cCross My Mind,\u201d a series about a Chinese American aspiring music producer in Los Angeles (Nathan Ing) who becomes telepathically connected to a Hong Kong advertising executive (Cantopop singer Jocelyn Chan).",
      "Chan, 30, was born in Hong Kong but spent ages 3-11 in Vancouver, British Columbia. She returned to Hong Kong for her music career partly because of concern about succeeding in North America.",
      "\u201cA lot of people probably had similar sentiments to me where it's more possible if we came back to this home,\u201d Chan said of finding success in the entertainment industry in Asia. \u201cWe all feel like we have two homes.\u201d",
      "Her role in \u201cCross My Mind\u201d is powerful, assertive and far from Western stereotypes of Asian women as meek.",
      "The partnership between Los Angeles-based Wong Fu Productions and TVB started with one side sliding into the other's DMs on Instagram.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be cool if we can kind of tap into their audience of what they built because that\u2019s who we\u2019re trying to speak with,\u201d Lo said, about reaching Asian American viewers.",
      "Wong Fu, which started in 2003, is now a thriving YouTube channel of Asian American-centered skits and other content. Simu Liu was among its then-emerging actors.",
      "\u201cNow we have actors that want to work with us for free and are just like \u2018Put us in whatever,\u2019 knowing that it\u2019s a way to connect with Asian Americans first,\u201d said Wesley Chan, Wong Fu co-founder and creative director. \u201cThen that can also be a way to propel them.\u201d",
      "Wesley Chan, no relation to Jocelyn, was intrigued by the challenge of shepherding a story that incorporates Asian and Asian American protagonists. He and his team wrote six episodes of \u201cCross My Mind\u201d in six months to film in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe knew that they wanted to make a story that could kind of show the cultural differences between an American and someone in Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that was really cool because to even know that there is a difference \u2014 or to share that there\u2019s a difference \u2014 I think is a nuance that is not seen very often.\u201d",
      "Meshing work styles was no small feat. Wesley Chan noticed crews in Los Angeles and Hong Kong \u2014 where there are no unions \u2014 worked differently. It in some ways paralleled the bicultural nature of the show itself.",
      "The show premiered in April 2023 on myTV Super, TVB's streaming platform that has 9 million subscribers. It debuted the following December in the U.S. on two new streaming platforms that have since merged into GoldenTV, which focuses on English language content for Asian American viewers.",
      "\u201cThere's two different audiences on both sides of the world, but it\u2019s still content that I think has eyeballs,\u201d said Takashi Cheng, GoldenTV's founder. \u201cThe fact that they need English-language programming tells you that American or English content is not dead. It\u2019s in fact very much attractive in foreign countries.\u201d",
      "GoldenTV has gained thousands of subscribers since launching nearly two years ago, Cheng said. The platform plans to grow with unscripted shows. In September, it premiered entertainment news show \"The Takeaway,\u201d hosted by influencer Michelle Park. Actor Daniel Wu (\"American Born Chinese\") is developing a docuseries on his love of racing.",
      "Wu, 50, rose to fame after moving to Hong Kong. Someone like Wu \u2014 who was born in the San Francisco Bay Area, became a Hong Kong cinema star and then pivoted to Hollywood \u2014 is a \u201crarity,\" Lo said. Before digital audiences, it was difficult to alternate between Asian and American screens, he continued.",
      "\u201cI think we were a breath of fresh air for those actors and talents and artists, when we said that we\u2019re going to be producing English content,\u201d Lo said. \u201cThere is an audience that\u2019s untapped here.\u201d",
      "Wesley Chan said Wong Fu is not ruling out being \u201ca conduit\u201d for more crossover collaborations.",
      "Jocelyn Chan is still maintaining her singing career with hit singles and a solo Hong Kong concert this year. But she says the success of \u201cCross My Mind,\u201d has given her the courage to think about acting beyond Hong Kong. She\u2019s now looking for an agent in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt kind of pushed me to not wait,\u201d said Chan, who is also a sound healer and practitioner. She also thinks there's more space for talent who grew up bicultural. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an even more niche representation within the wider Asian representation.\u201d"

      "Movie ticket sales are taking a bit of a hit in 2024",
      "Movie ticket sales took a bit of a hit in 2024. The annual domestic box office is expected to end up at around $8.75 billion, down more than 3% from 2023, according to estimates from Comscore.",
      "It\u2019s not as dire as it was in the pandemic years, but it\u2019s also not even close to the pre-pandemic norm when the annual box office regularly surpassed $11 billion.",
      "This is the year the business felt the effects of the Hollywood strikes of 2023, the labor standoff that delayed productions and releases and led to a depleted calendar for exhibitors and moviegoers. And yet it\u2019s not as bad as it could have been, or at least as bad as analysts projected at the start of the year.",
      "\u201cThis has been a really incredible comeback story for the industry,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cJust a couple of months ago it was a question of whether we would even hit $8 billion for the year.\u201d",
      "Hollywood continues to learn lessons about what moviegoers really want, what works and what doesn\u2019t. Here are the biggest takeaways from 2024.",
      "The Hollywood strikes might have ended in 2023, putting productions back into full swing and sending stars out on the promotional circuit again \u2014 but the ripple effect of the work stoppages and contract standoffs showed their real effects on the 2024 release calendar.",
      "The first two quarters were hit hardest, with tentpoles pushed later in the year (\u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d for one) or even into 2025 (like \u201cMission: Impossible 8\u201d). With no Marvel movie kicking off the summer moviegoing season, the box office was down a devastating 27.5% from 2023 right before \u201cInside Out 2\u201d opened in June.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an unpredictable business but it thrives on stability,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cWhen the release calendar is thrown off, the momentum stops.\u201d",
      "Sequels and franchises dominated the top 10 movies of the year, as has often been the case in the past 15 years. But this year, films carrying a PG rating did especially well, starting with the biggest movie of 2024: \u201cInside Out 2,\" which also became the biggest animated movie of all time, not accounting for inflation.",
      "Family films with a PG rating \u2014 including \u201cDespicable Me 4,\u201d\u201cMoana 2,\u201d\u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cKung Fu Panda 4,\u201d \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3,\u201d \u201cMufasa\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d \u2014 grossed over $2.9 billion this year, accounting for around 33% of the annual box office, according to Comscore. Movies rated PG-13, by contrast, made up about 30% of ticket sales.",
      "After a quieter 2023 and several years without a film at the very top of the charts, the Walt Disney Co. came back roaring in 2024 with three of the top five movies of the year: \"Inside Out 2,\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d In mid-December, it crossed the $2 billion domestic mark, the second time any studio has done so since 2019 (that was also Disney, in 2022). Its 20th Century division also played an important part with \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d and \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a different industry when Disney commits to theatrical releases,\u201d said Daniel Loria, an executive at the movie data and analytics trade The Boxoffice Company.",
      "Every year has high-profile flops and disappointments, and this was no exception. Sony had a rough go with its \u201cSpider-Man\u201d adjacent titles like \u201cMadame Web\u201d and \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d (but this also seems to be the fate lately for anyone not named \u201cDeadpool\u201d). Universal had higher hopes for \u201cThe Fall Guy,\u201d as did Warner Bros. for \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d and \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\u201d",
      "Then there were the filmmaker-driven (and financed) passion projects that failed to take off like Kevin Costner\u2019s \u201cHorizon: An American Saga \u2014 Chapter 1\u201d and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cMegalopolis.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reductive way of thinking about those passion projects,\u201d Loria said. \u201cThose movies didn\u2019t come out with huge expectations, meaning theaters didn\u2019t clear out the house and give them three auditoriums per site in hopes for money to come in.\u201d",
      "This was, however, part of the problem with \u201cJoker 2,\u201d which was expected to be more in line with the first which made over $1 billion. But even that has a caveat, Loria thinks.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that \u2018Joker\u2019 didn\u2019t perform, it\u2019s that there was nothing coming in behind it to make up that momentum,\u201d Loria said. \u201cThat\u2019s more the fault of a release schedule where one movie is supposed to carry a month. That model doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d",
      "What does work, Loria said, is a diverse lineup, with the Thanksgiving and Christmas successes being the perfect example. At Thanksgiving, there was \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d Christmas had \u201cMufasa,\u201d \u201cSonic 3,\u201d and a lot of adult offerings too, including \u201cNosferatu,\u201d \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and \u201cBabygirl.\u201d",
      "Horror is often the safest bet for theatrical, but this year had even veterans pleasantly surprised by just how enthusiastic that audience can be, with hits like \u201cLonglegs,\u201d \u201cNosferatu,\u201d \u201cTerrifier 3\u201d and \u201cSmile 2\u201d getting people out of the house.",
      "The Blake Lively drama \u201cIt Ends With Us,\" which had its share of ongoing off-screen drama as well, also became an event. Audiences turned out for smart thrillers, like \u201cConclave\u201d as well as unexpected originals including \u201cAnora,\" \u201cThe Substance\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "Re-releases of movies in theaters that are also widely available in the home thrived this year. Some of the biggest successes included Christopher Nolan's \u201cInterstellar,\"\u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Phantom Menace.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt just shows our industry once again that audiences truly understand the difference between a communal, big screen theatrical experience that they crave even on films that they\u2019ve had the opportunities to see in the home,\u201d Nolan said in December. \u201cThat theatrical experience that we all know and love is so powerful and so exciting. It\u2019s a very clear demonstration of it.\"",
      "As silly as it sounds, this is the year the novelty popcorn bucket became a star. It started with the accidentally suggestive \u201cDune: Part 2\u201d creation, which \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d latched onto in a less accidental way. More recently, the \u201cNosferatu\u201d coffin buckets have been fetching high resale prices.",
      "For Loria, it\u2019s all part of a trend that theaters have been noticing since reopening during the pandemic: Moviegoers aren\u2019t back in pre-pandemic numbers, but those who did come back were spending more on concessions and premium tickets (like IMAX and other large format screens) than ever before.",
      "Everyone is optimistic for the film business in 2025, and the offerings for moviegoers \u2014 which include at least 110 films projected to open on over 2,000 screens \u2014 according to the National Association of Theatre Owners. And the momentum is there.",
      "\u201cThere's been a huge amount of box office generated in the last six weeks of the year,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThis is the best opening act 2025 could have.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Actor Blake Lively has sued the director of the film \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d alleging harassment on the set and a coordinated campaign to smear her reputation",
      "Actor Blake Lively sued \"It Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama on Tuesday, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set.",
      "The federal lawsuit was filed in New York just hours after Baldoni and many of the other defendants in Lively's suit sued The New York Times for libel for its story on her allegations, saying the newspaper and the star were the ones conducting a coordinated smear campaign.",
      "The lawsuits are major developments in a story emerging from the surprise hit film that has already made major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "Lively's suit said that Baldoni, the film's production company Wayfarer Studios and others engaged in \u201ca carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others, from speaking out.\u201d",
      "She accuses Baldoni and the studio of embarking on a \u201cmulti-tiered plan\u201d to damage her reputation following a meeting in which she and her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, addressed \u201crepeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\u201d by Baldoni and a producer Jamey Heath, who is also named in both lawsuits.",
      "The plan, the suit said, included a proposal to plant theories on online message boards, engineer a social media campaign and place news stories critical of Lively.",
      "The alleged mistreatment on set included comments from Baldoni on the bodies of Lively and other women on the set. And the suit says Baldoni and Heath \u201cdiscussed their personal sexual experiences and previous porn addiction, and tried to pressure Ms. Lively to reveal details about her intimate life.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's attorney Bryan Freedman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lively's lawsuit. But he previously called the same allegations \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively's lawsuit comes the same day as the libel lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Baldoni and others against the Times seeking at least $250 million. The Times stood by its reporting and said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the lawsuit.",
      "Others who are defendants in Lively's suit and plaintiffs in the libel suit include Wayfarer and crisis communications expert Melissa Nathan, whose text message was quoted in the headline of the Dec. 21 Times story: \u201c\u2018We Can Bury Anyone\u2019: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.\u201d",
      "Written by Megan Twohey, Mike McIntire and Julie Tate, the story was published just after Lively filed a legal complaint with the California Civil Rights Department, a predecessor to her new lawsuit.",
      "The libel lawsuit says the newspaper \u201crelied almost entirely on Lively\u2019s unverified and self-serving narrative, lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives. But the Times did not care.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Times, Danielle Rhoades, said in a statement that \u201cour story was meticulously and responsibly reported.\"",
      "\u201cIt was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article. To date, Wayfarer Studios, Mr. Baldoni, the other subjects of the article and their representatives have not pointed to a single error,\" the statement said.",
      "But Baldoni's lawsuit says that \u201cIf the Times truly reviewed the thousands of private communications it claimed to have obtained, its reporters would have seen incontrovertible evidence that it was Lively, not Plaintiffs, who engaged in a calculated smear campaign.\u201d",
      "Lively is not a defendant in the libel lawsuit. Her lawyers said in a statement that \u201cNothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively\u2019s California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint, filed earlier today.\"",
      "The romantic drama \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni. Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took centerstage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity. He responded to concerns that \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d romanticized domestic violence, telling the AP at the time that critics were \u201cabsolutely entitled to that opinion.\u201d",
      "He was dropped by his agency, WME, immediately after Lively filed her complaint and the Times published its story. The agency represents both Lively and Reynolds.",
      "Baldoni's attorney, Freedman, said in a statement on the libel suit that \u201cthe New York Times cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful \u2018untouchable\u2019 Hollywood elites.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn doing so, they pre-determined the outcome of their story, and aided and abetted their own devastating PR smear campaign designed to revitalize Lively\u2019s self-induced floundering public image and counter the organic groundswell of criticism amongst the online public,\" he added. \"The irony is rich.\u201d",

      "The cheese-loving English inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit are coming back to the small screen",
      "The cheese-loving English inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit have been stars since the beginning.",
      "In the 35 years since Nick Park introduced the world to his stop-motion creations and their eccentric, unapologetically British existence, they\u2019ve won Oscars, appeared in commercials, video games, animated series and even the occasional bit of (unofficial) protest art. Feature films, however, have been few and far between. Part of the reason is the difficulty: Even a 30-minute short can take upward of two years. Besides, why mess with a formula that\u2019s produced only classics?",
      "After working on the pair\u2019s first feature, \u201cWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\u201d which was released in 2005 and won an Oscar, and \u201cEarly Man,\u201d Park even doubted that he\u2019d dabble in the form again. But sometimes inspiration requires a little more breathing room: That's how the second \u201cWallace & Gromit\u201d feature film, \u201cVengeance Most Fowl,\u201d came to be. It debuts on Netflix worldwide, except in the U.K., on Friday.",
      "Gnomes have always been part of Wallace and Gromit\u2019s world. After \u201cThe Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\u201d Park started kicking around an idea about a smart gnome, Norbot, built to help Gromit in the garden.",
      "\u201cThere was something a bit missing,\u201d Park said. \u201cWe tinkered around with the story on and off for years and it seemed to be lacking the more sinister element that\u2019s often in \u2018Wallace & Gromit.\u2019 Why do the gnomes go wrong? Who was the motivated villain?\u201d",
      "Five years ago, the solution came to them: Feathers McGraw, the conniving penguin with a penchant for heists and simple disguises, who turned their lives to chaos in \u201cThe Wrong Trousers.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was the answer to everything,\u201d Park said. \u201cThe story got bigger and more exciting. Suddenly it became a feature-length film.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Park and his co-director Merlin Crossingham often heard fan requests to bring Feathers back.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d been very noncommittal about it because characters haven\u2019t in the past come back,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cBut when we did drop a little teaser trailer, we were completely bowled over by the response. At that point, we were still making the film and it kind of gave us a boost and that confidence that it was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "They needed it too since Feathers McGraw, like a true diva, was by far the most difficult puppet to animate, direct and light \u2014 this in a movie that has chase sequences, special effects and an army of evil gnomes. The simplicity of his design, and the fact that he doesn\u2019t speak, gave them no room to hide. In fact, in their world-class group of animators at Aardman, Park said only five volunteered to work on Feathers.",
      "\u201cAll the filmmaking tricks have to come together very well to make Feathers have that screen presence that we needed from him,\u201d Crossingham said.",
      "Part of the charm of the \u201cWallace & Gromit\u201d films is their unabashed Britishness, which the filmmakers have had to fight (politely) to preserve as their audience has become more and more global. While Netflix was largely supportive, they did have a bit of a back and forth over the turn of phrase \u201cFlippin\u2019 Nora!\u201d (They ultimately kept it.)",
      "\u201cA lot of the stuff in the films is inspired by stuff we grew up with, the design of things, little products,\u201d Park said.",
      "He was particularly happy to include a \u201chigh-speed\u201d barge chase on the canals and a joke about police at the Yorkshire border \u2014 melding uniquely British references with big Hollywood movie tropes.",
      "\u201cI think all of it is a sort of a lovely homage to Britishness and not in a patriotic way, just kind of laughing at ourselves culturally,\u201d Crossingham said.",
      "The starting point for all scenes was always the traditional: In camera, stop-motion animation like they\u2019ve been using since 1989. It is, Crossingham said, fundamentally vital to the films to see the thumbprints on the characters and know that they're handmade.",
      "There have always been limitations, and the option to use more digital assistance, but it\u2019s only been in recent years that computer graphics have caught up enough to blend in. Effects like fog and steam are possible in stop-motion, but, they explained, they never look quite right.",
      "\u201cThe main thing we required was that if we were going to use a digital technique, could we force it to look right for our film rather than it just being bolted on and feeling like an accessory that was a bit of an unwelcome guest,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cThe visual effects department at Aardman worked very hard to get that stylizing so that it felt right in \u2018Wallace and Gromit,\u2019 in which and the sets and the props are characters in themselves.\u201d",
      "The tension between embracing technological innovation like artificial intelligence and preserving the old ways that still work was not just something they were thinking about off-camera. It\u2019s at the heart of the film too, as Wallace\u2019s well-intentioned invention turns against him (and wreaks havoc on the town).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit meta,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that resonates with audiences with stop-motion that they can tell it\u2019s handcrafted, they can tell that\u2019s the human touch.\u201d",
      "Park said he used to worry about the future of stop-motion, wondering how much time they had left. Recently, though, he\u2019s seen a resurgence.",
      "\u201cAs long as we\u2019re telling good stories, entertaining and compelling stories with compelling characters, we\u2019ll keep going,\u201d he said.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, her lawyer said Monday, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.",
      "Jolie's attorney James Simon confirmed to The Associated Press that the couple had come to a deal. News of the settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "\u201cMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt,\u201d Simon said in a statement. \u201cShe and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\u201d",
      "No court documents have been filed yet, and a judge will need to sign off on the agreement. An email late Monday night to Pitt's attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood\u2019s most prominent couples for 12 years. The two Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A judge in 2019 declared them divorced and single, but the splitting of assets and child custody needed to be separately settled.",
      "A private judge that the two had hired to handle the case reached a decision soon after that included equal custody of their children, but Jolie filed to have him removed from the case over an unreported conflict of interest. An appeals court agreed, the judge was removed, and the couple had to start over.",
      "No details of the agreement were immediately revealed, and the couple's use of the private judge \u2014 an increasingly common move among splitting celebrities in recent years \u2014 has kept the proceedings largely under wraps. Some details, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt, in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect that lawsuit."

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia's new government started an ambitious project on Monday to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable.",
      "The Free Nutritious Meal program delivers on a campaign promise by President Prabowo Subianto, who was elected last year to lead the nation, which has more than 282 million people and Southeast Asia's largest economy. He said the program aims to fight the stunting of growth that afflicts 21.5% of Indonesian children younger than 5 and would raise the income of farmers.",
      "Subianto has pledged to accelerate GDP growth to 8% from 5% now.",
      "In his inauguration speech in October, Subianto said many children are malnourished. His promise to provide free school lunches and milk to 83 million students at more than 400,000 schools is part of a longer-term strategy to develop the nation\u2019s human resources to achieve a \u201cGolden Indonesia\u201d generation by 2045.",
      "\u201cToo many of our brothers and sisters are below the poverty line, too many of our children go to school without breakfast and do not have clothes for school,\u201d Subianto said.",
      "Subianto\u2019s signature program could cost upward of 450 trillion rupiah ($28 billion) by the end of his term in 2029. He said his team has made the calculations to run such a program, and \u201cWe are capable.\u201d",
      "The government's target is to reach an initial 19.5 million schoolchildren and pregnant women in 2025 with a budget of 71 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion) so as to keep the annual deficit under a legislated ceiling of 3% of GDP, said Dadan Hindayana, the head of the newly formed National Nutrition Agency.",
      "Hindayana said the money would buy an estimated 6.7 million tons of rice, 1.2 million tons of chicken, 500,000 tons of beef, 1 million tons of fish, vegetable and fruit, and 4 million kiloliters of milk.",
      "Nearly 2,000 cooperatives will be involved in the free meals program by providing eggs, vegetables, rice, fish, meat, milk and other food, Cooperative Minister Budi Arie Setiadi said.",
      "On Monday, a truck carrying food arrived at SD Cilangkap 08, a primary school in the Jakarta satellite city of Depok. The 740 students were provided rice, stir-fried vegetables, tempeh, stir-fried chicken and oranges.",
      "\u201cWe will send a team to each school to facilitate the meal distribution to students every day,\u201d Hindayana said, adding that the program will provide one meal per day for each student from early childhood education to senior high school, covering a third of the daily caloric needs for children, with the government providing the meals at no cost to recipients.",
      "But the program has drawn criticism from investors and analysts over the scale of its logistics, the burden on state finances and the economy, and its relation to the interests of industrial lobby groups.",
      "Nailul Huda, a researcher at the Center of Economic and Law Studies, said Indonesia\u2019s state finances are not strong enough to support the program and this will lead to additional national debt.",
      "\u201cThe burden on our state budget is too heavy if it is forced to reach 100% of the target recipients, and it will be difficult for Prabowo\u2019s government to achieve the economic growth target of 8%,\u201d Huda said.",
      "He warned it could also worsen the external balance of payments for the country, which is already a major importer of rice, wheat, soybeans, beef and dairy products.",
      "Reni Suwarso, the director of Institute for Democracy, Security and Strategic Studies, said the decline in the stunting rate in Indonesia was far from the target of a 14% reduction in 2024.",
      "According to the 2023 Indonesian Health Survey, the national stunting prevalence was 21.5%, down around 0.8% from the previous year. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund estimated that one in 12 Indonesian children younger than 5 suffers from low weight while one in five is shorter than normal. Both conditions are caused by malnourishment.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so bad and must be solved,\u201d Suwarso said. \u201cChild malnourishment has severe consequences, threatening the health and long-term development of infants and young children throughout this nation.\u201d",

      "Winter weather brings various hazards that people have to contend with to keep warm and safe",
      "HOUSTON -- HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Winter weather brings various hazards that people have to contend with to keep warm and safe.",
      "These dangers can include carbon monoxide poisoning, hypothermia and frozen pipes that can burst and make homes unlivable.",
      "Public safety officials and experts say there are multiple ways people can prepare themselves to avoid these winter weather hazards and keep themselves safe.",
      "The hazards are on the radar this week because millions of people in the United States are set to be hit with moderate to heavy snow from Kansas City to Washington. Cold conditions are also gripping the East Coast.",
      "Officials say that during a winter storm, people should stay indoors. But home heating systems running for hours can increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning as the deadly fumes can be produced by furnaces, stoves and heaters, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Carbon monoxide can also be created when people use portable generators or run cars in their garages to stay warm or charge their phones.",
      "Dr. Alex Harding, assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that because carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, people won\u2019t necessarily be aware of it.",
      "\u201cThe symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can be really insidious. They can sneak up on patients and can range from just developing a headache or maybe a little bit of nausea to all the way to losing consciousness and seizures,\u201d he said.",
      "The cold weather hitting much of the East Coast has the ability to be dangerous or deadly because of unsafe exposure to elements. This week's winter storms are tracking to the south, and cold air will likely be present as far south as Georgia, said Jon Palmer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine.",
      "The cold temperatures could sneak up on people in parts of the country that have largely experienced a mild winter so far.",
      "\u201cReally cold temperatures and winds can make temperatures feel a lot colder, and the result of that could be cold air that could eventually lead to frostbite at a much faster rate or hypothermia at a much faster rate than normal,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Prolonged exposure to frigid temperatures can put people at risk to hypothermia, a condition that happens when one\u2019s body loses heat faster than it can produce it.",
      "\u201cHypothermia is definitely one of the bigger concerns, especially if we do have any kind of certainty in like power grids or electricity failing,\u201d Harding said.",
      "The danger of hypothermia is greater for someone who is outside, exposed to wind gusts and isn\u2019t wearing appropriate clothing or has clothing that gets wet.",
      "\u201cIf they have a safe place that\u2019s warm, where they can hunker down, where they have water and food and all those kind of necessities \u2026 then that\u2019s going to limit their exposure to those risks,\u201d Harding said.",
      "But vulnerable populations like people with disabilities or homeless individuals can have problems finding a warm and safe place to stay.",
      "Frozen pipes in a home during severe winter weather is a particular problem in parts of the South because such equipment is often located outside structures. But other parts of the country also have to deal with this problem.",
      "Jose Parra, a master plumber with Abacus Plumbing, Air Conditioning & Electrical in Houston, advises people to insulate any pipes that are exposed to the outside, turn off and drain sprinkler systems and let faucets inside a home drip during freezing temperatures so water can run through the pipes and protect them.",
      "\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re fixing, I would say 80% to 90%, could have been prevented with just a little bit of work ahead of time,\u201d Parra said.",
      "Experts acknowledge that cold weather can be hard for electric vehicles, but they say with some planning and a little adjustment, owners should be able to travel pretty much as normal.",
      "Inside EV batteries, lithium ions flow through a liquid electrolyte, producing electricity. But they travel more slowly through the electrolyte when it gets cold and don\u2019t release as much energy. That cuts into the range and can deplete a battery faster.",
      "In the short run, automakers are likely to come up with better ways to protect battery life and warm them for charging, Neil Dasgupta, associate professor of mechanical and materials science engineering at the University of Michigan, told The Associated Press earlier this year. And there are new battery chemistries in development that are more resilient in cold weather.",

She spent the final week of her pregnancy there, too far from home to risk leaving, before giving birth to her daughter.",
      "",
      "Six months later, she said it seems clear to her that the healthcare needs of rural young women like her are largely ignored.",
      "",
      "For McCoy and others, figuring out how to obtain adequate care to safely have a baby in Baker City has quickly eclipsed concerns about another medical service lacking in the area: abortion. But in Oregon and elsewhere in the country, progressive lawmakers' attempts to expand abortion access sometimes clash with rural constituencies.",
      "",
      "Oregon is considered one of the most protective states in the country when it comes to abortion. There are no legal limits on when someone can receive an abortion in the state, and the service is covered by its Medicaid system. Still, efforts to expand access in the rural, largely conservative areas that cover most of the state have encountered resistance and incredulity.",
      "",
      "It's a divide that has played out in elections in such states as Nevada, where voters passed a ballot measure in November that seeks to codify abortion protections in the state constitution. Residents in several rural counties opposed the measure.",
      "",
      "In Oregon, during the months just before the Baker City closure was announced, Democratic state lawmakers were focused on a proposed pilot program that would launch two mobile reproductive healthcare clinics in rural areas. The bill specified that the van-based clinics would include abortion services.",
      "",
      "State Rep. Christine Goodwin, a Republican from a southwestern Oregon district, called the proposal the \"latest example\" of urban legislators telling rural leaders what their communities need.",
      "",
      "The mobile health clinic pilot was eventually removed from the bill that was under discussion. That means no new abortion options in Oregon's Baker County  --  and no new state-funded maternity care either.",
      "",
      "\"I think if you expanded rural access in this community to abortions before you extended access to maternal healthcare, you would have an uprising on your hands,\" said Paige Witham, 27, a member of the Baker County healthcare steering committee and the mother of two children, including an infant born in October.",
      "",
      "A study published in JAMA in early December that examined nearly 5,000 acute care hospitals found that by 2022, 52% of rural hospitals lacked obstetrics care after more than a decade of unit closures. The health implications of those closures for young women, the population most likely to need pregnancy care, and their babies can be significant. Research has shown that added distance between a patient and obstetric care increases the likelihood the baby will be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.",
      "",
      "Witham said that while she does not support abortion, she believes the government should not \"legislate it away completely.\" She said that unless the government provides far more support for young families, like free child care and better mental healthcare, abortion should remain legal.",

      "Conversations with a liberal school board member, a moderate owner of a timber company, members of Baker City's Republican Party chapter, a local doula, several pregnant women, and the director of the Baker County Health Department  --  many of whom were not rigidly opposed to abortion  --  all turned up the same answer: No mobile clinics offering abortions here, please.",
      "",
      "Kelle Osborn, RN, a nurse supervisor for the Baker County Health Department, loved the idea of a mobile clinic that would provide education and birth control services to people in outlying areas. She was less thrilled about including abortion services in a clinic on wheels.",

      "Nationally, reproductive healthcare services of all types tend to be limited for people in rural areas, even within states that protect abortion access. More than two-thirds of people in \"maternity care deserts\"  --  all of which are in rural counties  --  must drive more than a half-hour to get obstetric care, according to a 2024 March of Dimes report. For people in the Southern states where lawmakers installed abortion bans, abortion care can be up to 700 miles away, according to a data analysis by Axios.",

      "He also pointed to the small number of patients requesting the service locally. Just six people living in Baker County had an abortion in 2023, according to data from the Oregon Department of Public Health. Meanwhile, 125 residents had a baby that year.",
      "",
      "A doctor with obstetric training living in another rural part of the state has chosen to quietly provide early-stage abortions when asked. The doctor, concerned for their family's safety in the small, conservative town where they live, asked not to be identified.",
      "",
      "The idea that better access to abortion is not needed in rural areas seems naive, the doctor said. People most in need of abortion often don't have access to any medical service not already available in town, the doctor pointed out. The first patient the doctor provided an abortion for at the clinic was a meth user with no resources to travel or to manage an at-home medication abortion.",
      "",
      "\"It seemed entirely inappropriate for me to turn her away for care I had the training and the tools to do,\" the doctor said.",

      "Flu is taking off in the U.S., with 40 states reporting high or very high levels of flu-like illness last week",
      "The holidays came with a side of flu for many Americans, with 40 states reporting high or very high levels of illness last week, according to the latest government health data.",
      "\u201cA lot of flu out there,\u201d said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Carrie Reed.",
      "Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly.",
      "The most recent CDC hospitalization data and other indicators show that the flu virus is trending higher than the other germs, Reed said. Several seasonal flu strains are driving cases, with no dominant one, she added.",
      "Pediatric hospitals have been busy since November with RSV, but \u201cinfluenza has now joined the party,\u201d said Dr. Jason Newland, an infectious diseases specialist at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.",
      "\u201cNow we\u2019re really starting to roll,\u201d he added. \u201dOur hospitals are busy.\u201d",
      "One indicator of flu activity is the percentage of doctor\u2019s office visits driven by flu-like symptoms. That level last week was about equal to the peak of last winter\u2019s respiratory virus season \u2014 which occurred at the same time of year. Reed noted that most people avoid medical appointments over the holidays if they can help it, so the data in late December might be skewed by people who came down with sudden illnesses.",
      "Last week's flu activity was particularly intense in the South, Southwest and western U.S. The states reporting lesser amounts of suffering were mostly in the northern Great Plains and in New England.",
      "So far this season, the CDC estimates, there have been at least 5.3 million flu illnesses, 63,000 hospitalizations, and 2,700 deaths \u2014 including at least 11 children.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if this winter respiratory virus season will be any worse than others. So far it seems relatively typical, at least for kids, Newland said.",
      "U.S. health officials recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccination, and they say it\u2019s not too late to get a shot.",
      "You should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth because germs can spread that way, health officials say. You should also wash your hands with soap and water, clean frequently touched surfaces and avoid close contact with people who are sick.",
      "The CDC also has been keeping its eye on a rise of illnesses from norovirus, a nasty stomach bug, with 91 outbreaks reported early in December.",
      "Investigators also have been closely watching another kind of influenza virus, the Type A H5N1 version of bird flu. The CDC says 66 human U.S. cases of that were reported last year, but none of them in the last week.",
      "The cases are \u201cfairly sporadic\u201d and the overall risk to the public remains low, Reed said. Almost all have been traced to direct contact with infected animals, with no proof of spread between people.",

    "summary": "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

      "Colorado becomes the second state to allow psychedelic therapy this week after two years of rulemaking",
      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- As Colorado becomes the second state to legalize psychedelic therapy this week, a clash is playing out in Colorado Springs, where conservative leaders are restricting the treatment over objections from some of the city's 90,000 veterans, who've become flagbearers for psychedelic therapy to treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Colorado residents voted to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the chemical compound found in psychedelic mushrooms, in a 2022 ballot measure, launching two years of rulemaking before it could be used to treat conditions such as depression and PTSD.",
      "This week, companies and people will be able to apply for licenses to administer the mind-altering drug, though treatment will likely not be available for some months as applications are processed.",
      "Colorado joined Oregon in legalizing psilocybin therapy, though the drug remains illegal in most other states and federally. Over the last year, a growing number of Oregon cities have voted to ban psilocybin. While Colorado metros cannot ban the treatment under state law, several conservative cities have worked to preemptively restrict what are known as \u201chealing centers.\u201d",
      "At a City Council meeting in Colorado Springs this month, members were set to vote on extending the state prohibition on healing centers from 1,000 feet (305 meters) to 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from certain locations, such as schools. From the lectern, veterans implored them not to.",
      "\u201cWe have an opportunity to support veterans, and it\u2019s a really easy one to say \u2018Yes\u2019 to,\u201d said Lane Belone, a special forces veteran who said he's benefited from his own psychedelic experiences. Belone argued that the restrictions effectively limit the number of centers and would mean longer waiting lists for the treatment.",
      "Veterans have pulled in some conservative support for psychedelic therapy \u2014 managing to set it apart from other politically charged drug policies such as legalizing marijuana.",
      "That distinction was made clear by Councilmember David Leinweber, who said at the council meeting both that marijuana is \u201cliterally killing our kids\u201d and that he supported greater access to psilocybin therapy.",
      "Psilocybin is far more restricted in Colorado than marijuana, which the state legalized in 2014. Psilocybin is decriminalized but there won\u2019t be recreational dispensaries for the substance, which will be largely confined to licensed businesses and therapy sessions with licensed facilitators.",
      "Patients will have to go through a risk assessment, preliminary meetings, then follow-up sessions and remain with a facilitator while under the drug's influence. The psilocybin will also be tested, and the companies that grow them regulated by a state agency.",
      "Still, allowing broader access to the treatment hasn't been easy for most of the city councilmembers, including three who are veterans. Colorado Springs is home to two Air Force bases and the U.S. Air Force Academy, and local leaders frequently tout it as an ideal community for retired service members.",
      "\u201cI will never sit up here and criticize a veteran for wanting to find a medical treatment to fix or to help with the issues that they carry,\u201d said Council President Randy Helms, a veteran himself.",
      "Still, he continued, \u201cDo I think that it\u2019s helpful to not just veterans but to individuals? Probably so. Do I think it still needs to be tested under strict requirements? Yes.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Springs City Council passed the proposed restrictions.",
      "While research has shown promise for psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin and MDMA, also known as molly, in helping people with conditions such as alcoholism, depression and PTSD, the scientific field remains in its relatively early stages.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very positive about the potential value, but I\u2019m very concerned that we\u2019ve gotten too far ahead of our skis,\u201d said Jeffrey Lieberman, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, who's been involved in studies of psychedelic drugs' therapeutic efficacy.",
      "The risks, said Lieberman, include customers being misled and paying out of pocket for expensive treatments. He also said there are cases where the drugs can exacerbate some extreme mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia.",
      "In Oregon, where the treatments started in June 2023, costs can reach $2,000 for one session. Of the over 16,000 doses administered in the state, staff have only called 911 or taken a patient to the hospital five times.",
      "Other Colorado Springs city councilmembers raised concerns that the Food and Drug Administration has not approved psilocybin to treat mental health conditions and, in August, rejected the psychedelic MDMA to treat PTSD. A number of clinical trials are still underway for both drugs.",
      "Some researchers, advocacy groups and veterans worry that waiting on slow-moving bureaucracy \u2014 namely the FDA \u2014 carries its own risks as people continue to struggle with mental illnesses. Advocates argue that psychedelic therapy offers an option to those for whom talk therapy alone and antidepressants have not helped.",
      "\u201cThis is a crisis that we are in, and this is a tool that we can add to our toolbox,\u201d said Taylor West, executive director of the Healing Advocacy Fund, which advocates for psychedelic therapy.",
      "Belone said he's carried his military experience long after leaving the special forces. It started when he first heard artillery sirens wailing in a U.S. base in Iraq, his breath catching with fear for a few thudding moments.",
      "That fear kept him on edge when he returned stateside and found himself always keeping his back to the wall, looking for exits to the room he was in, never quite able to give himself fully to the music at a concert.",
      "A psychedelic experience with psilocybin, said Belone, helped him connect the fear that attached to him in the war zone to the ceaseless anxiety at home. It didn\u2019t solve everything overnight, he said, but it allowed him to better identify when that humming fear was getting in the way of a joyful life.",

      "A new year brings new goals",
      "New York -- A new year is the time to set new goals. Yet studies have shown that most people don\u2019t tend to uphold their New Year\u2019s resolutions much past the first month.",
      "In an attempt to reframe the thinking around new year goal-setting, a new wellness trend has popped up online. It\u2019s called the \u2019Winter Arc.\u2019",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "The goal-setting challenge was created online by fitness and wellness influencers, so there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all approach or standard definition. There are over 400,000 posts on Instagram with the caption #winterarc, and almost 600,000 on TikTok.",
      "For many of those trying the trend, the Winter Arc involves utilizing the cold, dark earlier months of winter to turn inward and get a jump start on their goals, with the intent of having them in place by the time Jan. 1 rolls around.",
      "It\u2019s also meant to encourage participants to be extremely disciplined and rigid with their goals since it\u2019s a shorter period to get them done rather than an entire year, or indefinitely.",
      "Laura Galebe, an influencer and the self-proclaimed \u201cCEO of Glowup Series,\u201d posts videos to her social media accounts talking about her Winter Arc experience. She used the time to commit to \u201cwalking every day, journaling, and sticking to (her) skincare and wellness routines.\u201d",
      "\u201cI found it very transformative both mentally and physically,\u201d Galebe says. \u201cThe consistent movement helped me stay energized and the structure made the season feel a lot less heavy.\u201d",
      "Although some say the Winter Arc challenge can begin in October, it\u2019s never too late to start. According to Alex Rothstein, an exercise psychologist with the New York Institute of Technology, the best way to dive in is to carve out time each day to work on your goals.",
      "\u201cIf you make sure to actively plan and schedule each commitment,\" Rothstein says, \u201cyou will have an easier time adhering to the program.\u201d",
      "He also recommends setting reasonable, realistic goals that are achievable from day to day. \u201cRecognize that if unforeseen circumstances cause you to miss a day or miss a specific goal in a day, it does not mean you failed the entire process,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should be willing to pick up where you started the next day.\u201d",
      "Galebe recommends finding ways to make fitness \u201ccozy and convenient\u201d in the cold winter months.",
      "\u201cIf the thought of heading to the gym in freezing weather is demotivating, consider at-home workouts or joining a heated indoor Pilates or yoga studio,\u201d she says. \u201cAnother tip is to reframe movement as self-care. Winter is tough on your body and mind so I treat my walks or workouts as part of keeping my overall mental and physical health in check.\u201d",
      "To recap:",
      "\u2014Set realistic, attainable goals.",
      "\u2014Plan out your routine and find the time in your schedule in advance.",
      "\u2014Be okay with missing a day, giving yourself the space to pick up where you left off.",
      "\u2014Find cozy and convenient ways to stay active in the colder months.",
      "Elliot Berkman, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, says that goal progress, rather than simply goal attainment, is psychologically beneficial. He says it can provide \u201cpositive emotion, a sense of purpose and meaning as well as agency and autonomy.\u201d",
      "When it comes to goal-setting in a short, specific period of time, like the Winter Arc, he says those parameters can be helpful. \u201cPutting a time bound on a goal can improve the chances the goal is achieved. It\u2019s easier to maintain motivation if you know that you get to stop at some point as opposed to feeling like you need to keep up the hard work indefinitely, which can be demotivating.\u201d",
      "Some on social media have made comparisons between short-term fitness challenges and crash diets, with the idea being that once the challenge stops, one could return to unhealthy habits. But experts say that\u2019s not necessarily true.",
      "\u201cIf the challenge is used to help establish new and healthier habits for long term health and wellness, than the challenges are exceptionally useful to help guide and motivate to create these changes,\u201d Rothstein says. He recommends making a plan toward the end of the challenge to continue keeping up with your goals in an attainable and realistic way."

      "",
      "Baxter's North Cove, North Carolina, facility provided about 60% of the IV solutions used across the U.S. as well as several other fluids vital to patient care, noted Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and safety policy at the American Hospital Association (AHA). \"While remarkable progress has been made in reactivating Baxter's plant operations, hospitals are still receiving less than their normal required amounts of these fluids.\"",
      "",
      "While the impact of the supply shortage varies across the country, \"and the significance of the impact on a particular hospital depends on the methods they have been using to conserve fluids, whether Baxter was their sole supplier, the patient population they serve, and other factors,\" Foster said, \"we know some hospitals are still restricting access to elective surgeries, and most are using alternative strategies for hydrating patients when possible and utilizing smaller bags of fluids when appropriate.\"",
      "",
      "Though hospitals have long endured shortages of a variety of medical supplies and drugs, the shortage of IV fluids has been different, Foster told MedPage Today.",
      "",
      "\"These fluids are widely used as part of treatment for a multitude of illnesses or injuries,\" Foster said in an email. \"A majority of hospitalized patients receive drugs through IV infusions at least at some point during their hospital stay.\"",
      "",
      "The shortage was also unique because both the FDA and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response \"acted almost immediately after the hurricane damage to help expedite Baxter's ability to get its plant operational again,\" she said. \"Restoration of the flow of these fluids is faster than it would have been, even if it is not as fast as we would like given that hospitals are adamant about providing the best possible care for patients, and that requires that we have the fluids our patients need.\"",
      "",
      "Baxter pointed MedPage Today to updates it has continued to issue on its progress at the North Cove manufacturing site.",
      "",
      "In a Dec. 19 update, the company noted that it has restarted eight of the 10 manufacturing lines at the site, representing approximately 85% of total pre-hurricane capacity.",
      "",
      "\"While the recently restarted lines will require time to ramp up, some of the earlier lines to restart are operating near pre-hurricane levels,\" the company noted. \"We currently expect to be producing at pre-hurricane levels across the plant early in the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "",
      "While it will \"take some time for product to flow through the distribution channels,\" Baxter said that \"we currently expect that North Cove's recovery to full production will translate to removal of allocations for the related product groups during the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "",
      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines. Baxter also previously detailed that the IV solutions manufacturing lines restarted in November produce much of the site's pre-hurricane capacity of 1-liter IV solutions, \"the most commonly used size by hospitals and clinics.\"",
      "",
      "\"We anticipate [the shortage] will continue well into January,\" Foster added, \"but are hopeful that we will continue to see improvement along the way such that the magnitude of the problem will diminish week by week as more of Baxter's production lines are operational and the FDA verifies that the fluids they produce are safe for use.\""

      "This comes after his conviction in a corruption case was made definitive by France\u2019s highest court last month.",
      "Sarkozy, 69, was France\u2019s president from 2007 to 2012. He retired from active politics in 2017.",
      "The former president has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the legal proceedings.",
      "Sarkozy, along with 11 others, is accused of having received millions for his 2007 presidential campaign in illegal financing from the government of then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.",
      "Sarkozy has been under investigation in the case since 2013. He is charged with passive corruption, illegal campaign financing, embezzlement of Libyan public funds and criminal association. The trial is scheduled to run until April 10.",
      "Investigators examined claims that Gadhafi\u2019s government secretly agreed to give Sarkozy up to 50 million euros ($51.6 million) for his 2007 campaign. The sum was more than double the legal campaign funding limit at the time, violating French rules.",
      "The investigation gained traction when French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told news site Mediapart in 2016 that he had delivered suitcases from Libya containing 5 million euros (about $5.1 million) in cash to Sarkozy and his former chief of staff. Takieddine later withdrew the allegation and Sarkozy sought to have the inquiry closed.",
      "After becoming president in 2007, Sarkozy welcomed Gadhafi to France with high honors later that year. Sarkozy then put France at the forefront of NATO-led airstrikes that helped rebel fighters topple Gadhafi\u2019s government in 2011.",
      "French investigative judges filed preliminary charges in 2023 against Sarkozy for his alleged involvement in an attempt to mislead magistrates in order to clear him in the Libya financing case.",
      "Financial prosecutors said Sarkozy is suspected of \u201cbenefitting from corruptly influencing a witness,\u201d in reference to Takieddine.",
      "Sarkozy\u2019s wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was given preliminary charges in July last year for alleged involvement in efforts to pressure Takieddine. Bruni-Sarkozy was placed under judicial supervision, which includes a ban on contact with all those involved in the proceedings except for her husband.",
      "France\u2019s Court of Cassation on Dec. 18 upheld an appeal court decision that had found Sarkozy guilty of corruption and influence peddling while he was the country\u2019s head of state.",
      "Sarkozy has been sentenced to a year in prison but is entitled to be detained at home with an electronic bracelet as provided by French law.",
      "He said he would bring the case to the European Court of Human Rights.",
      "Sarkozy was first found guilty in 2021 by a Paris court, a verdict confirmed in 2023 by an appeals court, for trying to bribe a magistrate in exchange for information about a legal case in which he was implicated. The case was revealed through wiretapped phone conversations during the Libya financing investigation.",
      "In February last year, an appeals court in Paris upheld a guilty verdict against Sarkozy for illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 reelection bid. He was sentenced to a year in prison, of which six months were suspended.",
      "The former president is accused of having spent almost twice the maximum legal amount of 22.5 million euros on the reelection bid that he lost to Socialist Francois Hollande.",
      "Sarkozy has denied all allegations and appealed to the highest Court of Cassation in that case."

      "A standoff between rival government forces outside the presidential compound in South Korea is a startling development, even for observers used to the country\u2019s famously rough and tumble politics",
      "TOKYO -- A standoff between rival government forces outside the presidential compound in South Korea has been a startling development, even for observers used to the country's famously rough and tumble politics.",
      "For weeks, impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol has remained in his compound and refused to respond to detention and search warrants. Scuffles broke out late last week as dozens of investigators were stopped from entering the compound by hundreds of presidential security guards and a barricade.",
      "The spectacle followed Yoon's astonishing decision last month to impose martial law during a seemingly routine impasse with the opposition, which dominates parliament.",
      "Here's a closer view of recent events as well as South Korea's tempestuous political history, which has seen presidents toppled, arrested, jailed and shamed as millions have taken to the streets in protest.",
      "A government agency dedicated to fighting corruption is asking police to take the lead in efforts to detain Yoon. Agency investigators failed last week to bring Yoon into custody following a standoff with his security service.",
      "The thinking is that the police are better suited to get Yoon out of his compound than the anti-corruption agency, which has faced claims of incompetence after its failure Friday.",
      "Court warrants have been issued to detain Yoon and to search his residence.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal team says the agency\u2019s move to get police to execute the detainment warrant is illegal. Yoon has been refusing to appear for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3.",
      "He has described his power grab as a necessary act of governance against a liberal opposition that has bogged down his agenda with its legislative majority. He has vowed to \u201cfight to the end\u201d against efforts to oust him.",
      "Martial law lasted only a few hours, but the country\u2019s politics, diplomacy and financial markets have been shaken for weeks. The decree also exposed South Korea\u2019s deeply polarized society.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers on Monday filed complaints with public prosecutors against the anti-corruption agency\u2019s chief prosecutor, Oh Dong-woon, and six other anti-corruption and police officers for orchestrating Friday\u2019s detainment attempt, which they say was illegal.",
      "Yoon's declaration of martial law unleashed a string of political aftershocks.",
      "The anti-corruption agency, which is leading a joint investigation with police and the military, has been weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon declared martial law and dispatched troops to surround parliament. Lawmakers who managed to get past the blockade voted to lift martial law hours later.",
      "Yoon\u2019s presidential powers were suspended after parliament voted to impeach him on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion. The Constitutional Court has begun deliberations on whether to formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him.",
      "The agency trying to get Yoon out of his house, the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, will likely seek a new court warrant to extend the window for Yoon\u2019s detention. Police say they are reviewing the agency\u2019s request. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether the anti-corruption agency would make another attempt to detain Yoon on Monday before the deadline expires at midnight.",
      "About 150 investigators tried to get Yoon on Friday in a tense standoff with the presidential security service that lasted more than five hours.",
      "After getting around a military unit guarding the residence\u2019s grounds, the agency\u2019s investigators and police were able to approach within 200 meters (220 yards) of Yoon\u2019s residential building but were stopped by a barricade of around 10 vehicles and approximately 200 members of the presidential security forces and troops.",
      "In a statement, Park Jong-joon, chief of the presidential security service, hit back against criticism that his organization has become Yoon\u2019s private army, saying it has a legal obligation to protect the incumbent president.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers said they plan to file complaints against about 150 anti-corruption and police investigators who were involved in Friday\u2019s detention attempt.",
      "The why is incredibly tricky.",
      "But a mix of history and geography have something to do with it.",
      "The Koreas have been sandwiched between big powers for millennia, with China, Russia, Japan and the United States all playing parts of a great global game on the peninsula that extends from the east coast of Asia.",
      "South Korea is deeply split, with the divisions reaching into many parts of life, from culture to class to gender to politics.",
      "Much of the deep political divide can be traced to what happened at the end of World War II, when U.S. and Soviet forces met in the middle of the Korean Peninsula and agreed to divide the land into Washington and Moscow-backed spheres of influence. This solidified into independent rival Koreas in 1948 and then exploded into war and permanent division in 1950. After that, South Korea was run by a string of dictators until democracy came in the late 1980s.",
      "Some of the passion evident in South Korean politics can be seen in the turmoil faced by recent presidents, many of whom have been jailed for corruption after leaving office.",
      "A particularly sensational moment came in 2016 when millions protested against conservative President Park Geun-hye, who later became the first democratically elected leader to be forced from office since South Korea turned democratic.",
      "Park, who was pardoned in late 2021 by her liberal rival and successor, had been serving a lengthy prison term for bribery and other crimes.",

      "The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed across the border in a massive surprise attack nearly 15 months ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead.",

      "Malaysia's imprisoned former Prime Minister Najib Razak has won an appeal to pursue his bid to serve his remaining corruption sentence under house arrest",
      "PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia -- Malaysia's imprisoned former Prime Minister Najib Razak on Monday won an appeal to pursue his bid to serve his remaining corruption sentence under house arrest.",
      "In an application in April last year, Najib said he had clear information that then-King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah issued an addendum order allowing him to finish his sentence under house arrest. Najib claimed the addendum was issued during a pardons board meeting on Jan. 29 last year chaired by Sultan Abdullah that also cut his 12-year jail sentence by half and sharply reduced a fine. But the High Court tossed out his bid three months later.",
      "The Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 ruling on Monday, ordered the High Court to hear the merits of the case. The decision came after Najib's lawyer produced a letter from a Pahang state palace official confirming that then-Sultan Abdullah had issued the addendum order.",
      "\u201cWe are happy that finally Najib has got a win,\u201d his lawyer Mohamad Shafee Abdullah said. \u201cHe is very happy and very relieved that finally they recognized some element of injustice that has been placed against him.\u201d",
      "The lawyer said Najib gave a thumbs-up in court when the ruling was read.",
      "He said it was \u201ccriminal\u201d for the government to conceal the addendum order. Shafee noted that a new High Court judge will now hear the case.",
      "In his application, Najib accused the pardons board, home minister, attorney-general and four others of concealing the sultan\u2019s order \u201cin bad faith.\u201d Sultan Abdullah hails from Najib\u2019s hometown in Pahang. He ended his five-year reign on Jan. 30 last year under Malaysia\u2019s unique rotating monarchy system. A new king took office a day later.",
      "Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail has said he had no knowledge of such an order since he wasn't a member of the pardons board. The others named in Najib\u2019s application have not made any public comments.",
      "Najib, 71, served less than two years of his sentence before it was commuted by the pardons board. His sentence is now due to end on Aug. 23, 2028. He was charged and found guilty in a corruption case linked to the multibillion-dollar looting of state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad.",
      "The pardons board didn\u2019t give any reason for its decision and wasn\u2019t required to explain. But the move has prompted a public outcry over the appearance that Najib was being given special privileges compared to other prisoners.",
      "Najib set up the 1MDB development fund shortly after he took office in 2009. Investigators allege at least $4.5 billion was stolen from the fund and laundered by Najib\u2019s associates through layers of bank accounts in the United States and other countries, financed Hollywood films and extravagant purchases that included hotels, a luxury yacht, art and jewelry. More than $700 million landed in Najib\u2019s bank accounts.",

    "summary": "The next presidential term in Venezuela is set to begin Friday, when the ruling party-controlled congress will host a swearing-in ceremony for President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro",
    "story": [
      "The next presidential term in Venezuela is set to begin Friday, when the ruling party-controlled congress will host a swearing-in ceremony for President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- The next presidential term in Venezuela is set to begin Friday, when the ruling party-controlled congress hosts a swearing-in ceremony for President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, despite serious doubts about the validity of last year\u2019s official election results.",
      "Maduro is expected to begin a third six-year term amid demonstrations by his supporters, but it is unclear if anyone among the millions who voted for his main challenger, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, will also protest. Gonz\u00e1lez, who claimed to have won the July 28 election, left Venezuela for exile in Spain in September after a judge issued a warrant for his arrest.",
      "Taking the oath of office will allow Maduro to cement a mishmash of policies that allowed the government to end the scarcities and runaway inflation that dominated most of his 11 years in office. Those measures, however, no longer fulfill his and his predecessor\u2019s self-proclaimed socialist promises and continue to strip Venezuela of its democracy.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez has said he intends to be in Caracas on Friday, but he has not explained how he intends to do so or what his plans are upon arrival.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Venezuela\u2019s next presidential term:",
      "The doubts stem from the government\u2019s lack of transparency in handling and announcing the results of the presidential election.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, stacked with ruling-party loyalists, declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed. However, unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts, alleging that a website hack prevented them from doing so.",
      "Yet, the opposition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation\u2019s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said the detailed vote records showed Gonz\u00e1lez won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro.",
      "Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask the country\u2019s high court, also filled with allies of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela, to audit the election results. The court, without showing thorough evidence, subsequently reaffirmed Maduro\u2019s victory and encouraged the electoral council to release the vote counts. But electoral authorities never did and neither did the ruling party, whose voting center representatives \u2014 just like the opposition\u2019s \u2014 were entitled to tally sheets from every voting machine.",
      "The U.S.-based Carter Center, which Maduro\u2019s government invited to observe the presidential election, has said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate.",
      "The government frequently schedules demonstrations, particularly when it wants to show strength in numbers, such as on Friday. Maduro has called on Venezuelans to head to the streets that day, but not everyone marching with a pro-ruling-party shirt supports him. The government often coerces public employees and state-benefits recipients into participating in demonstrations.",
      "Whether people will protest against Maduro on Friday remains to be seen since the government\u2019s post-election repression campaign, including the arrests of more than 2,000 people, has had a chilling effect. And even if opposition supporters decide to demonstrate, it is unclear who would lead them.",
      "On Sunday, opposition stalwart Maria Corina Machado urged supporters to demonstrate on Thursday across the country to push Maduro out of office.",
      "\u201cMaduro is not going to leave on his own, we must make him leave with the strength of a population that never gives up,\u201d Machado said in a social media video. \u201cGo outside, shout, fight. It is time to stand firm, and make them understand that this is as far as they go. That this is over.\u201d",
      "Machado, who has been hiding for months at an undisclosed location to avoid arrest, told supporters she \u201cwill be with\u201d them Thursday.",
      "Meanwhile, Gonz\u00e1lez remains away from Venezuela and opposition leaders who often accompanied him and Machado to campaign rallies were jailed after the election.",
      "Members of the National Assembly, ministers and Maduro\u2019s close allies within Venezuela are expected to attend.",
      "The government\u2019s centralized public information office did not immediately respond to a request from The Associated Press for a list of the heads of state who have confirmed their attendance.",
      "But the list could be in the single digits since the country\u2019s post-election crisis has further isolated Maduro.",
      "Maduro has faced criticism for the election\u2019s lack of transparency from dozens of countries, including neighboring Colombia and Brazil, whose leaders had been friendly toward him in practically all other matters. They even attempted to broker a peacemaking deal between his government and the opposition after the July vote. Neither country\u2019s president will attend Friday\u2019s ceremony and will instead send representatives.",
      "Maduro\u2019s last inauguration, in 2019, was attended by Cuba\u2019s President Miguel Diaz-Canel and then-Bolivian President Evo Morales.",
      "The food shortages and four-digit inflation that characterized most of Maduro\u2019s 11-year presidency are gone, but the country\u2019s protracted crisis has no end in sight.",
      "These days, the average Venezuelan must cope with a monthly minimum wage of less than $2, soaring food prices, irregular fuel supply and a substandard public education system. But at the same time, a lucky few with ties to Maduro and his allies benefit from jobs and contracts that allow them to afford imported toilet paper that costs $70, import and sell vehicles, open made-for-Instagram restaurants, and offer luxury tourism experiences.",
      "That inequality is precisely the kind that was supposed to disappear under the policies that Maduro\u2019s mentor and predecessor, the late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, described as socialism for the 21st century. It is expected to widen as the government continues to wrestle with an oil-dependent economy crippled by limited crude production, corruption, mismanagement, economic sanctions, firmly restricted credit access and a lack of private investment.",
      "Ahead of the election, voters across the country repeatedly said they or their loved ones would emigrate if Maduro remained in power. Under his watch, more than 7.7 million Venezuelans have already left their homeland in search of better living conditions."

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s former President Nicolas Sarkozy goes on trial Monday over alleged illegal financing of his 2007 presidential campaign by the government of late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.",
      "The so-called \u201cLibyan case,\u201d the biggest and possibly most shocking of several scandals involving Sarkozy, is scheduled to run until April 10, with a verdict expected at a later date.",
      "Sarkozy, 69, faces charges of passive corruption, illegal campaign financing, concealment of embezzlement of public funds and criminal association, punished by up to 10 years in prison. Sarkozy, who served as president from 2007 to 2012, has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "The trial involves 11 other defendants, including three former ministers. Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine, accused of having played the role of intermediary, has fled in Lebanon and is not expected to appear at the Paris court.",
      "Sarkozy is looking forward to the hearings \u201cwith determination,\u201d his lawyer Christophe Ingrain said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThere is no Libyan financing of the campaign,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe want to believe the court will have the courage to examine the facts objectively, without being guided by the nebulous theory that poisoned the investigation.\u201d",
      "The case emerged in March 2011, when a Libyan news agency reported that the Gadhafi government had financed Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 campaign. In an interview, Gadhafi himself said \u201cit\u2019s thanks to us that he reached the presidency. We provided him with the funds that allowed him to win,\u201d without providing any amount or other details.",
      "Sarkozy, who had welcomed Gadhafi to Paris with great honors in 2007, became one of the first Western leaders to push for a military intervention in Libya in March 2011, when Arab Spring pro-democracy protests swept the Arab world. Gadhafi was killed by opposition fighters in October that same year, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country.",
      "The next year, French online news site Mediapart published a document said to be a note from the Libyan secret services, mentioning Gadhafi\u2019s agreement to provide Sarkozy\u2019s campaign 50 million euros in financing.",
      "Sarkozy strongly rejected the accusations, calling the document a \u201cblatant fake\u201d and filing complaints for forgery, concealment and spreading false news.",
      "However, French investigative magistrates eventually said in 2016 the document has all the characteristics of an authentic one, although there is no definitive evidence that such a transaction took place.",
      "The official cost for Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 campaign was 20 million euros.",
      "French investigators scrutinized numerous trips to Libya made by people close to Sarkozy, then the interior minister, between 2005 and 2007, including his chief of staff Claude Gu\u00e9ant. They also noted dozens of meetings between Gu\u00e9ant and Takieddine, a key player in major French military contracts abroad.",
      "The investigation gained traction when Takieddine told news site Mediapart in 2016 that he had delivered three suitcases from Libya containing millions in cash to the French Interior Ministry.",
      "However, Takieddinne reversed his statement four years later.",
      "Since then, a separate investigation has been launched into alleged witness tampering as magistrates suspect an attempt to pressure Takieddine in order to clear Sarkozy. Sarkozy and his wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, were given preliminary charges as financial prosecutors said the former president is suspected of \u201cbenefitting from corruptly influencing\u201d Takieddine.",
      "The other accused are three former French ministers, including Gu\u00e9ant, and a former adviser close to Sarkozy.",
      "Like Takieddine, Franco-Algerian businessman Alexandre Djouhri is accused of having been an intermediary.",
      "The case also involves Gadhafi\u2019s former chief of staff and treasurer Bashir Saleh, who sought refuge in France during the Libyan civil war then moved to South Africa, where he survived a shooting in 2018, before settling in the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Other defendants include two Saudi billionaires, a former Airbus executive and a former banker accused of having played a role in the alleged money transfers.",
      "Shukri Ghanem, Gadhafi\u2019s former oil minister who was also suspected, was found dead in the Danube River in Vienna in 2012 in unclear circumstances. French investigators were able to find Ghanem\u2019s notebook, which is believed to document payments made by Libya.",
      "Gadhafi's spy chief and brother-in-law Abdullah al-Senoussi told investigative judges millions have indeed been provided to support Sarkozy\u2019s campaign. Accused of war crimes, he is now imprisoned in Libya.",
      "Sarkozy has been convicted in two other scandals \u2014 yet the Libyan case appears as the one most likely to significantly affect his legacy.",
      "France\u2019s highest court, the Court of Cassation, last month upheld a conviction against Sarkozy of corruption and influence peddling while he was the head of state. He was sentenced to one year in house arrest with an electronic bracelet. The case was revealed as investigative judges were listening to wiretapped phone conversations during the Libya inquiry.",
      "In February last year, an appeals court in Paris found Sarkozy guilty of illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 reelection bid."

      "102 men were executed by the Congolese government in the past week, and 70 are set to be executed today, according to the Congolese Minister of Justice",
      "KINSHASA, Congo -- Some 102 men were executed by the Congolese government in the past week, and 70 more are set to be executed, the country's minister of justice said Sunday in a statement to the Associated Press.",
      "It said the men, aged 18 to 35, were armed robbers and \u201curban bandits,\u201d locally known as Kulunas, who were executed in northwest Congo at Angenga prison. Forty-five were killed in late December, and the remaining 57 were executed within the last 48 hours.",
      "A flight of 70 more people from Kinshasa has arrived at Angenga, but the government hasn't commented on the status of the prisoners. Minister of Justice Mutamba, who is overseeing the executions, said late Sunday the \u201cthird batch will be executed, so the first two have already undergone the measure of execution by the death penalty.\u201d",
      "The government\u2019s decision to apply the death penalty has proved divisive. Some have welcomed the measure as a means of restoring order and security in the cities, while others are concerned about the risks of abuse and human rights violations.",
      "\u201cWe welcome this decision by the minister because it will help put an end to urban crime. From 8 p.m. onwards, you can\u2019t move around freely because you\u2019re afraid of running into a Kuluna,\u201d said Fiston Kakule, a resident of the eastern city of Goma.",
      "Espoir Muhinuka, a human rights activist, warned of the possibility of extrajudicial executions and called for a strict respect for judicial procedures and fundamental guarantees. He fears that political pressure could lead to unjust convictions and arbitrary executions.",
      "\u201cThe situation in the DRC is complex and requires a multidimensional approach. The fight against urban gangs must go hand in hand with efforts to combat poverty, unemployment and social exclusion, which are often contributing factors to crime,\u201d he said.",
      "The death penalty in Congo is a sensitive issue. The country abolished it in 1981, but it was reinstated in 2006. The last execution took place in 2003 but in March 2024, the Congolese government announced the resumption of capital executions, however, the reinstated death penalty was intended to apply to military personnel accused of treason.",
      "In May, eight soldiers were sentenced to death for fleeing the battlefield, and in July, 25 soldiers were convicted of similar offences. None of them is known to have been executed."

      "Hours earlier, hundreds of people held 12 minutes of silence for the 12 victims at a rally in Cetinje, Montenegro's historic capital where the shooting took place on Wednesday. It was the second such massacre in the town in less than three years.",
      "Many residents of Cetinje and other Montenegrins believe that police mishandled the situation and haven't done enough to boost security since the first massacre, which happened in August 2022.",
      "Wednesday's shooting resulted from a bar brawl. A 45-year-old local man went home to get his gun before returning to the bar and opening fire. He killed four people there and eight more at various other locations before killing himself.",
      "The massacre fueled concerns about the level of violence in Montenegrin society, which is politically divided. It also raised questions about the readiness of state institutions to tackle the problems, including gun ownership.",

      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela's government Sunday doubled down on its intention to arrest the opposition leader who claims he defeated President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in last year's election in the form of a threat from the ruling party-controlled congress.",
      "Without mentioning Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez's name, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodriguez said the unicameral body would order the immediate arrest of the retired diplomat should he step on Venezuelan soil. The threat follows the government's recent announcement of a $100,000 reward for information on Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s whereabouts and comes less than a week before Venezuela's next presidential term is set to begin.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez left Venezuela for exile in Spain in September after a judge issued a warrant for his arrest in connection with an election-related investigation. In recent weeks, he has vowed to travel to Venezuela to be sworn in for the presidential term which, by law, must begin Jan. 10, but he has not explained how he plans to return or wrest power from Maduro, whose party controls all institutions and the military.",
      "\u201cThat unworthy being ... has been saying that he is going to return to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,\u201d Rodriguez said shortly after he was re-elected as the National Assembly's president. \u201cEach and every deputy who defends peace will request, if he touches a bit of land of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, his immediate arrest.\u201d",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez began a tour of the Americas with stops in Argentina and Uruguay on Saturday, when he told reporters he would travel to the United States next and hoped to speak with President Joe Biden. He said he also planned to visit Panama and the Dominican Republic.",
      "Meanwhile, Maduro already received an invitation from the National Assembly to be sworn in for a third term Friday, more than five months after the country's National Electoral Council, stacked with ruling-party loyalists, declared him winner of the July 28 election.",
      "Unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. Yet, the opposition collected tally sheets from more than 80% of the nation\u2019s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said they showed Gonz\u00e1lez had won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro.",
      "Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask Venezuela\u2019s high court, also controlled by ruling-party supporters, to audit the results. The court subsequently reaffirmed his victory.",
      "The U.S. and most European governments have rejected the election\u2019s official results and consider Gonz\u00e1lez the legitimate winner.",
      "Rodriguez on Sunday told National Assembly members that their potential request to have Gonz\u00e1lez arrested would be based on a recently approved measure that allows for the prosecution of anyone who expresses support for economic sanctions like those imposed by the United States against Venezuela."

      "Russian shelling, meanwhile, killed at least one person and wounded another in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, local officials said.",

      "Zelenskyy said last month that 3,000 North Korean troops had been killed or wounded in Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched an incursion in August, dealing a blow to Russia\u2019s prestige and forcing it to deploy some of its troops from eastern Ukraine.",
      "The incursion didn\u2019t significantly change the dynamic of the war, and military analysts say Ukraine has lost around 40% of the land it initially captured.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said Sunday that Ukraine launched a fresh offensive in the Kursk region. It claimed its forces pushed back Ukrainian troops, but some reports from Russian military bloggers indicated that Moscow's forces faced significant pressure.",
      "A ministry statement said Ukrainian forces attacked about 9 a.m. local time (0600 GMT, 1 a.m. EST) near the village of Berdin with two tanks, a mine-clearing vehicle and 12 armored combat vehicles with paratroopers. Two Ukrainian attacks were repelled, it said.",

      "The sanctions did not appear to be related to an incident in which the Treasury Department reported that Chinese hackers had remotely accessed several of its workstations and unclassified documents in a major breach of cybersecurity.",

      "Integrity Technology said the sanctions would not adversely affect its business since it does not operate in the U.S. and has no assets there. It added that it abides by all laws and regulations and that it \u201chas always adhered to the corporate vision and mission of bringing a sense of security to the world.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Incoming first lady Melania Trump will be the subject of a new documentary directed by Brett Ratner and distributed by Amazon Prime Video. The streaming arm of the tech giant got exclusive licensing rights for a streaming and theatrical release later this year, the company said Sunday.",
      "Filming is already underway on the documentary. The company said in a statement that the film will give viewers an \u201cunprecedented behind-the-scenes look\u201d at Melania Trump and also promised a \u201ctruly unique story.\u201d",
      "The former and now future first lady also released a self-titled memoir late last year. Her husband takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "The film is the latest connection between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Donald Trump.

      "The two men had been at odds in the past. During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. But he\u2019s struck a more conciliatory tone recently as Amazon and other tech companies seek to improve their relationship with the incoming president.",
      "In December, Bezos expressed some excitement about potential regulatory cutbacks in the coming years and said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Bezos in October did not allow the Post to endorse a presidential candidate, a move that led to tens of thousands of people canceling their subscriptions and to protests from journalists with a deep history at the newspaper. This weekend, a cartoonist quit her job after an editor rejected her sketch of the newspaper\u2019s owner and other media executives bowing before the president-elect.",
      "The film also marks the first project that Ratner has directed since he was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women, including actor Olivia Munn, in the early days of the #MeToo reckoning in November 2017. Ratner, whose lawyer denied the allegations, directed the \u201cRush Hour\u201d film series, \u201cRed Dragon\u201d and \u2019\u2019X-Men: The Last Stand.\u201d",

      "Melania Trump, Donald Trump\u2019s third wife, has been an enigmatic figure since her husband announced he was running in the 2016 election.

      "While she appeared at her husband\u2019s campaign launch event for 2024 and attended the closing night of the Republican National Convention this summer, she has otherwise stayed off the campaign trail, though the demands of again being first lady may dictate a higher public profile after Inauguration Day."

      "President Joe Biden is set to sign into law a measure that boosts Social Security payments for current and former public employees",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Sunday plans to sign into law a measure that boosts Social Security payments for current and former public employees, affecting nearly 3 million people who receive pensions from their time as teachers, firefighters, police officers and in other public service jobs.",
      "Advocates say the Social Security Fairness Act rights a decades-old disparity, though it will also put strain on Social Security Trust Funds, which face a looming insolvency crisis.",
      "The bill rescinds two provisions \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset \u2014 that limit Social Security benefits for recipients if they get retirement payments from other sources, including public retirement programs from a state or local government.",
      "The Congressional Research Service estimated that in December 2023, there were 745,679 people, about 1% of all Social Security beneficiaries, who had their benefits reduced by the Government Pension Offset. About 2.1 million people, or about 3% of all beneficiaries, were affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated in September that eliminating the Windfall Elimination Provision would boost monthly payments to the affected beneficiaries by an average of $360 by December 2025. Ending the Government Pension Offset would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses, according to the CBO. The increase would be an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.",
      "Those amounts would increase over time with Social Security\u2019s regular cost-of-living adjustments.",
      "The change is to payments from January 2024 and beyond, meaning the Social Security Administration would owe back-dated payments. The measure as passed by Congress says the Social Security commissioner \"shall adjust primary insurance amounts to the extent necessary to take into account\u201d changes in the law. It's not immediately clear how this will happen or whether people affected will have to take any action.",
      "Edward Kelly, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, said firefighters across the country are \u201cexcited to see the change \u2014 we've righted a 40-year wrong.\u201d Kelly said the policy was \u201cfar more egregious for surviving spouses of firefighters who paid their own quotas into Social Security but were victimized by the government pension system.\u201d",
      "The IAFF has roughly 320,000 members, which does not include hundreds of thousands of retirees who will benefit from the change.",
      "\u201cNow firefighters who get paid very little can now afford to actually retire,\" Kelly said.",
      "Sherrod Brown, who as an Ohio senator pushed for the proposal for years, lost his reelection bid in November. Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees labor union, thanked Brown for his advocacy.",
      "\u201cOver two million public service workers will finally be able to access the Social Security benefits they spent their careers paying into,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"Many will finally be able to enjoy retirement after a lifetime of service.\u201d",
      "National Education Association President Becky Pringle said the law is \u201ca historic victory that will improve the lives of educators, first responders, postal workers and others who dedicate their lives to public service in their communities.\u201d",
      "And while some Republicans such as Maine Sen. Susan Collins supported the legislation, others, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, voted against it. \u201cWe caved to the pressure of the moment instead of doing this on a sustainable basis,\u201d Tillis told The Associated Press last month.",
      "Still, Republican supporters of the bill said there was a rare opportunity to address what they described as an unfair section of federal law that hurts public service retirees.",
      "The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, receive Social Security benefits.",
      "The policy changes from the new law will heap more administrative work on the Social Security Administration, which is already at its lowest staffing level in decades. The agency, currently under a hiring freeze, has a staff of about 56,645 \u2014 the lowest level in over 50 years even as it serves more people than ever.",
      "The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released last May said the program\u2019s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. The new law will hasten the program\u2019s insolvency date by about half a year. ___",

      "The Venezuelan opposition leader who the United States recognized as the winner of last year's presidential election has kicked off a tour of Latin America",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, who the United States recognized as the winner of last year's presidential election, kicked off a tour of Latin America on Saturday, just days before President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is set to be sworn in for a third term in defiance of international pressure.",
      "A crowd of a few hundred Venezuelan migrants broke into shouts of \u201cEdmundo, Presidente\u201d as Gonz\u00e1lez emerged from a meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei to wave to supporters from the balcony of the iconic Casa Rosada, or Pink House, in Buenos Aires.",
      "\u201cWe are doing whatever the cause of freedom requires,\u201d Milei, an effusive far-right supporter of the Venezuelan opposition, said as he welcomed Gonz\u00e1lez to the presidential palace with honors normally reserved for a head of state.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, a retired diplomat, fled into exile in Spain in September after a judge issued an arrest warrant following the July 28 presidential election, in which Maduro was declared the winner by the National Electoral Council, which is stacked with governing party loyalists.",
      "In recent weeks, he has been vowing to travel to Venezuela to be sworn in for the presidential term, which according to law must begin on Jan. 10. But he hasn't said how he plans to return or wrest power from Maduro, whose party controls all institutions and the military.",
      "On Thursday, Maduro\u2019s government raised the stakes even further, announcing a $100,000 reward for information on Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s whereabouts and plastering the wanted-like bulletin with the retired diplomat's photo on social media and the arrivals board at the country's main airport.",
      "Upon arrival to the Argentine capital, where he twice served as Venezuela\u2019s ambassador more than two decades ago, Gonz\u00e1lez posted on social media a short video message expressing solidarity with those imprisoned in Venezuela as part of a crackdown by Maduro.",
      "He said that he would raise with Milei concerns about the well-being of five Maduro opponents who have been sheltering in the Argentine ambassador\u2019s residence in Caracas for nearly 10 months \u2014 a diplomatic standoff that has embittered relations between Venezuela and Argentina.",
      "The Biden administration and most European governments have rejected the election's official results, pointing out that authorities didn't provide detailed results as they have in past elections. Meanwhile, copies of tally sheets collected by the opposition from 85% of the nation\u2019s electronic voting machines show that Gonz\u00e1lez prevailed by a more than two-to-one margin.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, 75, was a previously unknown career diplomat when he was thrust into rallying the anti-Maduro coalition as a last-minute stand-in for opposition stalwart Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, whom the government banned from running for office.",
      "After speaking with Milei on Saturday, Gonz\u00e1lez is scheduled to cross the Rio de la Plata for a meeting with Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle Pou."

      "The 1,650th episode of \u201cMonday Night Raw\u201d from the Intuit Dome outside of Los Angeles officially kicks off WWE's 10-year partnership with Netflix. The agreement, reached last January, is worth in excess of $5 billion with an option for Netflix to extend for an additional 10 years or opt out after five.",
      "\u201cWe try to appeal the WWE to all 50 states and to countries globally. We think Netflix does the same thing,\" said Khan, who is WWE\u2019s president.",
      "Netflix \u2014 which has 282.3 million subscribers in more than 190 countries \u2014 becomes the exclusive home of \u201cRaw\u201d in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Latin America, with additional countries to be added over time. The bigger component for Netflix though, is that the streaming platform will carry all of the company\u2019s shows overseas \u2014 including \u201cSmackdown\u201d and \u201cNXT\u201d \u2014 as well as premium live events like WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble.",
      "In the U.S., \u201cSmackdown\u201d moved to USA Network from Fox and \u201cNXT\u201d from USA to the CW three months ago. Peacock has a contract to carry WWE's premium live events through March 2026.",
      "\u201cRaw\u201d began airing on Jan. 11, 1993, and is the longest running weekly episodic series on television. Most of that time had been on USA Network with a run on Spike TV, now known as Paramount Network.",
      "\u201cIt has great storytelling, characters along with memorable and surprising stories. And the idea of combining this kind of intense fandom with these characters and our reach globally just seemed like such a great opportunity,\u201d said Bela Bajaria, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer. \u201cWhat we also love is the multigenerational fan base. At the end of the day, we have great things that our members love and this totally delivers on all of the things that we want. And to do it 52 weeks a year is super exciting.\"",
      "WWE's global reach has expanded during the past year, with nearly half of its premium live events taking place overseas. The company will also embark on an extended tour of Europe in March to build momentum for WrestleMania 41, which takes place in Las Vegas April 19 and 20.",
      "Khan said WWE first approached Netflix about its rights in 2018, but Netflix wasn't ready to begin carrying live events. The streaming service has ramped up its efforts during the past year, not only with sports events, but with Chris Rock's comedy special and the roast of Tom Brady.",
      "Brandon Riegg, Netflix\u2019s vice president of nonfiction series and sports, said the social media buzz around \u201cRaw\u201d each week as well as the stable audience WWE provides made it a natural fit this time when the company approached Netflix last year.",
      "In turn, Riegg thinks Netflix can help expand WWE's audience the way it did with Formula 1 and the \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d series.",
      "\u201cIt really was just fitting in to the whole picture of we\u2019re going to do these big events like the Tyson-Paul fight and the NFL on Christmas,\" he said. \"But then throughout the year, if we can have a steady drumbeat of those amazing live moments and live action and spectacle, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to get with WWE.\u201d",
      "According to Nielsen, \u201cRaw's\u201d final episode on USA Network averaged 1.6 million viewers despite going against the \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d matchup between the Detroit Lions and San Francisco 49ers.",
      "Khan and WWE chief content officer Paul \u201cTriple H\u201d Levesque have also stressed that the three-hour weekly show will not hurt its rating due to being on a streaming platform. \u201cRaw\u201d was known for toeing the line on risky content during the late 1990s in what WWE called the \u201cAttitude Era,\u201d but that has changed over the years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not pushing anybody away of what they want. It\u2019s a safe place for families and everybody to be able to view. That will not change, but you don\u2019t have to change that to expand and improve what you do,\u201d Levesque said.",
      "WWE's storytelling and character development continues to excel even during external challenges. Former chairman Vince McMahon resigned last January after a lawsuit claiming sexual misconduct. In 2023, WWE was bought by Endeavor and merged with Ultimate Fighting Championship to create TKO Group Holdings.",
      "According to WWE, there were 44 sellouts for TV shows and 66 overall, including house shows and premium live events, in 2024.",
      "WWE champion Cody Rhodes credited Khan and Levesque for keeping the company on track, along with scaling back on some of the non-televised live events to make sure top talent does not get burned out during the year.",
      "Levesque said Monday's show will be on the level of a premium live event. John Cena, who is retiring from WWE at the end of the year, begins his farewell tour with three main event matches on tap. It also wouldn't be a shock if Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson makes an appearance.",
      "Roman Reigns, who will take part in one of the main event matches, said he is always trying to put his best foot forward, but he also knows how big Monday night is for the company.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no hiding that this is Netflix and this is huge and this is going to be on a global platform with a lot of people watching. I\u2019m not sure exactly what that audience is going to look like. It\u2019s going to be crazy, I know that.\"",

      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a top oil and gas industry trade group are suing Vermont over its new law requiring that fossil fuel companies pay a share of the damage caused over several decades by climate change.",
      "The federal lawsuit filed Monday asks a state court to prevent Vermont from enforcing the law, which was passed last year. Vermont became the first state in the country to enact the law after it suffered catastrophic summer flooding and damage from other extreme weather. The state is working to estimate the cost of climate change dating back to Jan. 1, 1995.",
      "The lawsuit argues the U.S. Constitution precludes the act and that the state law is preempted by the federal Clean Air Act. It also argues that the law violates domestic and foreign commerce clauses by discriminating \u201cagainst the important interest of other states by targeting large energy companies located outside of Vermont.\u201d",
      "The Chamber and the other plaintiff in the lawsuit, the American Petroleum Institute, argue that the federal government is already addressing climate change. And because greenhouse gases come from billions of individual sources, they argue it is impossible to measure \u201caccurately and fairly\u201d the impact of emissions from a particular entity in a particular location over decades.",
      "\u201cVermont wants to impose massive retroactive penalties going back 30 years for lawful, out-of-state conduct that was regulated by Congress under the Clean Air Act,\" said Tara Morrissey, senior vice president and deputy chief counsel of the Chamber\u2019s litigation center. \u201cThat is unlawful and violates the structure of the U.S. Constitution \u2014 one state can\u2019t try to regulate a global issue best left to the federal government. Vermont\u2019s penalties will ultimately raise costs for consumers in Vermont and across the country.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the state's Agency of Natural Resources said it had not been formally served with this lawsuit.",
      "Anthony Iarrapino, a Vermont-based lobbyist with the Conservation Law Foundation, said the lawsuit was the fossil fuel industry's way of \u201ctrying to avoid accountability for the damage their products have caused in Vermont and beyond.\u201d",
      "\u201cMore states are following Vermont\u2019s lead holding Big Oil accountable for the disaster recovery and cleanup costs from severe storms fueled by climate change, ensuring that families and businesses no longer have to foot the entire bill time and time again,\" Iarrapino added.",
      "Under the law, the Vermont state treasurer, in consultation with the Agency of Natural Resources, is to issue a report by Jan. 15, 2026, on the total cost to Vermonters and the state from the emission of greenhouse gases from Jan. 1, 1995, to Dec. 31, 2024. The assessment would look at the effects on public health, natural resources, agriculture, economic development, housing and other areas. The state would use federal data to determine the amount of covered greenhouse gas emissions attributed to a fossil fuel company.",
      "It\u2019s a polluter-pays model affecting companies engaged in the trade or business of extracting fossil fuel or refining crude oil attributable to more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions during the time period. The funds could be used by the state for such things as improving stormwater drainage systems; upgrading roads, bridges and railroads; relocating, elevating or retrofitting sewage treatment plants; and making energy efficient weatherization upgrades to public and private buildings. It\u2019s modeled after the federal Superfund pollution cleanup program.",
      "The approach taken by Vermont has drawn interest from other states, including New York, where Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law a similar bill in December.",
      "The New York law requires companies responsible for substantial greenhouse gas emissions to pay into a state fund for infrastructure projects meant to repair or avoid future damage from climate change. The biggest emitters of greenhouse gases between 2000 and 2018 would be subjected to the fines."

      "MLB\u2019s Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee awarded the team approximately $320.5 million from the Baltimore Orioles\u2019 controlled MASN for 2022-26 in a decision issued Monday. The rights fee was set at about $72.8 million each for 2022 and \u201923 \u2014 matching 2021 \u2014 and dropped to approximately $58.3 million annually from 2024-26.",
      "The committee of Milwaukee Brewers chairman Mark Attanasio, Colorado Rockies chairman Richard Montfort and Boston Red Sox chairman Tom Werner attributed the decision to an expected drop in revenue due to subscriber loss and an inability to increase per-subscriber fees.",
      "\u201cIt was foreseeable that, to minimize the risk of bankruptcy, MASN would have sought, and the Nationals would have agreed to, a reduction in rights fees for 2024-2026; and a 20% cut in rights fees is consistent with what the market expected in 2021,\u201d the RSDC wrote in a 56-page decision.",

      "\u201cThe parties agree that industry conditions were deteriorating, and that MASN would continue to experience subscriber declines in the 2022-2026 period (though they disagree as to the rate of such losses ...),\u201d the panel wrote in a decision that redacted many of the the figures each team argued for.",
      "This marked the third straight five-year period the teams took their dispute to the RSDC. The decision became public when the Nationals filed a petition asking for the New York Supreme Court to confirm the award. The filing of the petition was first reported by The Sun in Baltimore.",
      "Jonathan Schiller, a lawyer representing the Orioles, and Patrick Curran, a lawyer representing the Nationals, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Litigation over 2012-16 rights fees resulted in a 2019 RSDC decision by Attanasio, Seattle Mariners president Kevin Mather and Toronto Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro valuing them at $296.8 million. After arguments that went to the New York Court of Appeals, the sides agreed to a settlement in June 2023.",
      "A RSDC decision on Nov. 8, 2023, by Attanasio, Montfort and Werner said Washington was owed about $304.1 million by MASN for 2017-21, after an adjustment downward of almost $45.5 million for the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. That decision was confirmed by New York Supreme Court Justice Andrew Borrok the following month.",
      "MASN was established in March 2005 after the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington and became the Nationals, moving into what had been Baltimore\u2019s exclusive broadcast territory since 1972.",
      "The Orioles were given a supermajority partnership interest in MASN, starting at 90%, and Washington made a $75 million payment to the network for an initial 10% stake.",
      "The agreement between the clubs set network\u2019s rights payments to each team at $20 million apiece in 2005 and 2006, rising to $25 million in 2007, with $1 million annual increases through 2011. The deal called for the Nationals\u2019 equity to increase 1% annually, starting after the 2009 season, with a cap of 33%.",

      "JetBlue is getting hit with a $2 million penalty for chronically late flights",
      "The Transportation Department said Friday it will hit JetBlue Airways with a $2 million penalty for chronically late flights along the East Coast, and half the money will go to passengers who were delayed.",
      "The agency said it\u2019s the first time it has fined an airline for chronic delays on specific routes, which it blamed on \u201cunrealistic scheduling\u201d by JetBlue.",
      "\u201cIllegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today\u2019s action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said. His department has led the Biden administration in criticizing airlines for poor service and an increase in fees on travelers.",
      "JetBlue said the government, which operates the air traffic control system, shares the blame for late flights.",
      "Airline spokesperson Derek Dombrowski said JetBlue has invested \u201ctens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays, particularly related to ongoing air traffic control challenges in our largest markets in the Northeast and Florida,\u201d resulting in better on-time performance in 2024, including during the peak summer travel season.",
      "\u201cWhile we\u2019ve reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four (routes) in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the U.S. government, which operates our nation\u2019s air traffic control system,\u201d Dombrowski said. He said the incoming Trump administration should prioritize modernizing \u201coutdated\u201d air traffic control technology and understaffing of controllers, who are hired by the Federal Aviation Administration.",

      "The department cited JetBlue flights between June 2022 and November 2023. It said it warned JetBlue about frequent delays on flights between New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport and Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina. Frequent delays also occurred on flights between JFK and Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, Florida, and between Windsor Locks, Connecticut and Fort Lauderdale.",

      "New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has already taken several actions to help the short- and long-term recovery from Hurricane Helene",
      "ASHEVILLE, N.C. -- New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein took several actions on Thursday to help the short- and long-term recovery from Hurricane Helene, with an immediate focus on more temporary housing and repairs to private bridges and roads.",
      "Stein, who took his oath of office on Wednesday to succeed fellow Democrat Roy Cooper, traveled to Asheville and \u2014 with legislators and officials from both parties behind him \u2014 announced he had signed five executive orders related to the historic flooding in late September in western North Carolina.",
      "\u201cThe needs facing this region are vast and require immediate attention,\u201d Stein said at a news conference. \u201cI pledge to do everything in my power as governor to accelerate recovery of the rebuilding of a more resilient region for the long haul.\u201d",
      "Over 100 people died in North Carolina because of Helene, which state officials estimate caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Billions of dollars from the federal and state government already have been spent or earmarked for the recovery, and Congress last month committed at least another $9 billion in aid. But more must be done this winter to put more people in warm and safe housing on their own property, and to restore vital transportation links between small communities as well as first responders and school buses, Stein said.",
      "One executive order allows the state Department of Public Safety to purchase up to 1,000 temporary housing units through the end of next month without going through the usual state procurement and bidding processes. Stein said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is covering the costs of these units. FEMA is already following another regulatory process as it installs similar trailers on its own, he added.",
      "Stein also delegated to the Division of Emergency Management the ability to hire repair contractors for private bridges and roads without procurement requirements. It also lets environmental regulators waive rules to speed up permitting and inspections.",
      "More than 12,000 western North Carolinians are displaced from their homes due to Helene, which also caused significant damage to more than 8,000 private roads and bridges, Stein's orders said.",
      "\u201cWhen I have met with affected folks here in the mountains, the need for housing assistance and the repairing of private bridges and roads has come up in nearly every conversation,\" he said. \u201cWestern North Carolina \u2014 I want you to know that I hear you.\u201d",
      "Another Stein order creates a new Governor\u2019s Recovery Office for Western North Carolina and establishes within the Commerce Department a Division of Community Revitalization that in part will oversee the rebuilding of homes destroyed or damaged by Helene.",
      "The North Carolina Office of Recovery and Resiliency, which was created during Cooper's administration, will stick to rebuilding homes in eastern North Carolina harmed by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018, Stein said. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly have been angry with the pace of the agency's work and a fiscal shortfall for ongoing housing projects.",
      "Stein also issued an order giving many state employees more paid leave this year to volunteer for Helene-related recovery efforts, and he agreed to continue a Helene recovery advisory committee that he created after his November election victory. GOP state Sen. Kevin Corbin, who has co-chaired the panel with Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, said Thursday that Stein's actions were \u201cbipartisan commonsense solutions.\"",
      "New State Auditor Dave Boliek, also a Republican, released a statement later Thursday telling Stein that his department would hold Stein's office accountable on how money stemming from the orders gets spent.",
      "\u201cGiven past failures to effectively provide hurricane relief to Eastern North Carolina, it is in the best interest of Hurricane Helene victims that our office takes such action,\" Boliek said."

      "Saudia, the flagship carrier of Saudi Arabia, ranked second worldwide, with an on-time performance rate of just over 86%, according to Cirium.",
      "Cirium has rated airlines for timeliness for 16 years. CEO Jeremy Bowen said 2024 was a difficult year for airlines due to severe weather patterns and the summer technology outage. The winning airlines therefore deserved credit for getting most passengers to their destinations on time, Bowen said.",

      "Experts warn the island will keep struggling to attract investors until the debt is restructured and the power grid strengthened.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez also will have to work alongside a federal control board that U.S. Congress created in 2016 to oversee Puerto Rico\u2019s finances and supervise the ongoing reconstruction after Hurricane Mar\u00eda slammed into the island in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid.",
      "She also faces pressure to create affordable housing, lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crime, boost Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, with the island locked out of capital markets since 2015, and improve a limping health care system as thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland.",
      "Like other governors of the pro-statehood party, Gonz\u00e1lez has said she would push for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state, but such a change would require approval from U.S. Congress and the U.S. president.",
      "A nonbinding referendum held during the Nov. 5 election, the seventh of its kind, asked voters to choose one of three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated.",
      "With 63% of voters participating, statehood earned more than 615,000 votes, or 59%, with independence coming in second for the first time with more than 309,000 votes, or 29%. Independence with free association garnered more than 128,000 votes, or 12%.",
      "While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, they are not allowed to vote in presidential elections, and officials with the New Progressive Party have noted the island receives unequal treatment when it comes to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal programs.",

      "Opponents of a huge lithium mine under construction in Nevada want U.S. officials to investigate whether the project already has caused a drop in groundwater levels that could lead to extinction of a tiny snail",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Opponents of the nation's largest lithium mine under construction want U.S. officials to investigate whether the project in Nevada already has caused a drop in groundwater levels that could lead to extinction of a tiny snail being considered for endangered species protection.",
      "Environmentalists and Native American activists are demanding that the U.S. Interior Department address what they say is new evidence that bolsters their concerns about Lithium Americas\u2019 planned open pit mine at Thacker Pass. The footprint of mine operations will span about 9 square miles (23 square kilometers).",
      "The fate of the snail takes center stage after a federal judge and an appeals court dismissed a previous attempt by Native American tribes to get federal agencies to recognize the sacred nature of the area. The tribes argued that the mine would infringe on lands where U.S. troops massacred dozens of their ancestors in 1865.",
      "Now, Western Watersheds Project and the group known as People of Red Mountain argue in a notice of intent to sue that the government and Canada-based Lithium Americas are failing to live up to promises to adequately monitor groundwater impacts.",
      "They say it\u2019s alarming that an analysis of groundwater data from a nearby well that was conducted by Payton Gardner, an assistant professor of hydrogeology at the University of Montana, shows a drop in the water table of nearly 5 feet (1.5 meters) since 2018. Nevada regulators say they have no information so far that would confirm declining levels but have vowed to monitor the situation during the mine's lifespan.",
      "Not much bigger than a grain of rice, the Kings River pyrg has managed to survive in 13 isolated springs within the basin surrounding the mine site. It\u2019s the only place in the world where the snail lives.",
      "In some cases, the tiny creatures require only a few centimeters of water. But the margin for survival becomes more narrow if the groundwater system that feeds the springs begins to drop, said Paul Ruprecht, Nevada Director for Western Watersheds Project.",
      "\u201cEven slight disruptions to its habitat could cause springs to run dry, driving it to extinction,\u201d he said.",
      "Western Watersheds Project and the other opponents say the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to rule in a timely fashion on a 2022 petition to list the snail as threatened or endangered. The allegations outlined in the opponents' notice follow requests for federal biologists to investigate whether groundwater drawdowns are being caused by exploratory drilling and other activities and whether there have been impacts to the springs.",
      "Without protection, Ruprecht fears the snail \u201cwill become another casualty of the lithium boom.\u201d",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service is conducting a review of the snail's status, but the agency declined to comment on the requests for an investigation into the groundwater concerns.",
      "Efforts to mine gold and other minerals in Nevada and other parts of the West over the decades have spurred plenty of legal skirmishes over potential threats to wildlife and water supplies. Lithium is no exception, as demand for the metal critical to making batteries for electric vehicles is expected to continue to climb exponentially over the next decade.",
      "President Joe Biden made increased production of electric vehicles central to his energy agenda, and the U.S. Energy Department last year agreed to loan Lithium Americas more than $2 billion to help finance construction at Thacker Pass. On Dec. 23, Lithium Americas announced it had concluded a joint venture with General Motors Holdings LLC to develop and operate the mine.",
      "The mine 200 miles (322 kilometers) north of Reno is the biggest in the works and closest to fruition in the U.S., followed by Ioneer\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge project near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "And the Bureau of Land Management announced in late December that it was seeking comments on another proposed project in northeastern Nevada. Surge Battery Metals USA wants to explore for lithium in Elko County.",
      "Ruprecht said reports filed by Lithium Americas\u2019 environmental consultant with state regulators show the company no longer has permission to access private lands where several monitoring wells are located. That makes it harder to tell if flows have been impacted by past drilling, he said.",
      "Nevada regulators say they approved changes in 2024 to the monitoring plan to account for the loss of access to wells on private land.",
      "Prior data showed groundwater levels had remained stable from the 1960s to 2018. Construction started at the site in 2023.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management\u2019s approval of the mine acknowledged some reduction in groundwater levels were possible but not for decades, and most likely would occur only if state regulators granted the company permission to dig below the water table.",
      "Lithium Americas spokesman Tim Crowley said it appears the mine\u2019s opponents are \u201cworking to re-spin issues that have previously been addressed and resolved in court.\u201d He pointed to 10 years of data collection by the company indicating the snail would not be affected by the project."

      "The S&P 500 was down 0.6% in afternoon trading after rising as much as 0.9% earlier. It's coming off a four-day losing streak, its longest since early September, which dimmed the end of its stellar 2024.",

      "Some Big Tech stocks, which have been leading Wall Street for most of the last few years, bucked the downward trend. Nvidia, whose chips are powering the world\u2019s move into artificial-intelligence technology, rose 1.6% after following up its nearly 240% surge in 2023 with a better than 170% jump last year.",
      "Some investors and analysts are counting on the AI rush to continue, even though critics say it\u2019s sent prices for some stocks too high too quickly. As the calendar flips to a new year, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says it\u2019s the \u201dsame tech playbook in year 3 of this tech AI driven bull market,\u201d for example.",
      "Such optimism, of course, can also make contrarians feel nervous.",
      "A measure of how heavily Wall Street analysts are recommending stocks is at its highest level since early 2022, according to Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian. She says the measure has been a reliable contrarian indicator in the past, and it\u2019s just a bit shy of triggering a signal to sell for those who are leery when much of Wall Street rushes in the same direction.",
      "In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.56% from 4.57% late Tuesday.",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine has halted Russian gas supplies to European customers through its pipeline network, almost three years into Moscow\u2019s all-out invasion of its neighbor",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine on Wednesday halted Russian gas supplies to European customers through its pipeline network after a prewar transit deal expired at the end of 2024 and almost three years into Moscow's all-out invasion of its neighbor.",
      "Even as Russian troops and tanks moved into Ukraine in February 2022, Russian natural gas kept flowing through the country\u2019s pipeline network \u2014 set up when Ukraine and Russia were both part of the Soviet Union \u2014 to Europe, under a five-year agreement.",
      "Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom earned money from the gas and Ukraine collected transit fees.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, confirmed Kyiv had stopped the transit \u201cin the interest of national security.\"",
      "\u201cThis is a historic event. Russia is losing markets and will incur financial losses,\" Halushchenko said Wednesday on the Telegram messaging app. \"Europe has already decided to phase out Russian gas, and (this) aligns with what Ukraine has done today.\u201d",
      "At a summit in Brussels last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed that Kyiv would not allow Moscow to use the transits to earn \u201cadditional billions ... on our blood, on the lives of our citizens.\u201d However, he briefly held open the possibility of the gas flows continuing if payments to Russia were withheld until the war ends.",
      "Gazprom said in a statement Wednesday it \u201chas no technical and legal possibility\u201d of sending gas through Ukraine, due to Kyiv's refusal to extend the deal.",
      "Before the war, Russia supplied nearly 40% of the European Union's pipeline natural gas. Gas flowed through four pipeline systems, one under the Baltic Sea, one through Belarus and Poland, one through Ukraine and one under the Black Sea through Turkey to Bulgaria.",
      "After the war started, Russia cut off most supplies through the Baltic and Belarus-Poland pipelines, citing disputes over a demand for payment in rubles. The Baltic pipeline was blown up in an act of sabotage, but details of the attack remain murky.",
      "The Russian cutoff caused an energy crisis in Europe. Germany had to shell out billions of euros to set up floating terminals to import liquefied natural gas that comes by ship, not by pipeline. Users cut back as prices soared. Norway and the United States filled the gap, becoming the two largest suppliers.",
      "Europe viewed the Russian cutoff as energy blackmail and has outlined plans to completely eliminate Russian gas imports by 2027.",
      "Zelenskyy said Wednesday that halting the transits would see Moscow lose \u201cone of the most profitable and geographically accessible markets\u201d for its gas. In a post on X, he said Russia was \u201cresorting to cynical blackmail of partners.\u201d",
      "Russia's share of the EU pipeline natural gas market dropped sharply to about 8% in 2023, according to data from the EU Commission. The Ukrainian transit route served EU members Austria and Slovakia, which long got the bulk of their natural gas from Russia but have recently scrambled to diversify supplies.",
      "Gazprom halted supplies to Austria\u2019s OMV in mid-November over a contractual dispute, but gas flows through Ukraine\u2019s pipelines continued as other customers stepped in. Slovakia this year inked deals to begin buying natural gas from Azerbaijan, and also to import U.S. liquefied natural gas through a pipeline from Poland.",
      "Among the hardest-hit will be EU candidate country Moldova, which was receiving Russian gas via Ukraine and has brought in emergency measures as residents brace for a harsh winter and looming power cuts.",
      "Separately from Kyiv's decision to let the transit deal expire, Gazprom said last month it will halt gas supplies to Moldova starting on Jan. 1, citing unpaid debt. Gazprom has said Moldova owes close to $709 million for past gas supplies, a figure the country has fiercely disputed.",
      "Heating and hot water supplies were abruptly cut off Wednesday to households in Transnistria, Moldova\u2019s breakaway region that has for decades hosted Russian troops, as Russian natural gas stopped flowing to the territory, local transit operator Tiraspoltransgaz-Transnistria said.",
      "In an online statement, the company urged residents to gather household members together in a single room, hang blankets over windows and balcony doors, and use electric heaters. It said some key facilities, including hospitals, were exempt from the cuts.",
      "On Dec. 13, Moldova\u2019s parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector, as fears mounted that the gas shortages could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, for decades dependent on Russian energy supplies.",
      "Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force people in the separatist territory to travel to Moldova proper, seeking basic amenities to get through the harsh winter and placing further strain on resources.",
      "Moldova, Ukraine and EU politicians have repeatedly accused Moscow of weaponizing energy supplies.",
      "On Wednesday, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski called Ukraine's move to halt supplies a win for those opposed to the Kremlin's policies. In a post on X, Sikorski accused Moscow of systematic attempts to \u201cblackmail Eastern Europe with the threat of cutting off gas supplies,\" including through a Baltic pipeline bypassing Ukraine and Poland and running directly to Germany.",
      "Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico claimed Wednesday the end of gas flows via Ukraine \u201cwill drastically affect us all in the EU but not Russia.\u201d",
      "Fico, whose views on Russia have sharply differed from the European mainstream, has previously criticized Kyiv's refusal to extend the transit deal, and threatened to end electricity supplies to Ukraine in response.",
      "Moscow can still send gas to Hungary, as well as non-EU states Turkey and Serbia, through the TurkStream pipeline across the Black Sea.",
      "The steady reduction of Russian gas supplies to European countries has also spurred them to hasten the integration of Ukraine\u2019s energy grids with its neighbors to the west.",
      "Last week, private Ukrainian energy utility DTEK said it had received its first shipment of liquefied natural gas from the U.S., delivered through a newly expanded network spanning six countries from Greece to Ukraine \u2014 a significant step in reducing regional dependence on Russian energy.",
      "Separately, overnight into New Year's Day, Russia launched a drone strike on Kyiv that left two people dead under the rubble of a damaged building, according to the city administration. At least six people were wounded across the Ukrainian capital, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko.",

    "story": [
      "A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing have examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing on Tuesday examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea while authorities were conducting safety inspections on all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country\u2019s airlines.",
      "All but two of the 181 people aboard the Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air died in Sunday's crash. Video showed the aircraft, without its landing gear deployed, crash-landed on its belly and overshoot a runaway at South Korea\u2019s southern Muan International Airport before it slammed into concrete fence and burst into a flame.",
      "The plane was seen having an engine trouble, and preliminary examinations also say the pilots received a bird strike warning from the ground control center and issued a distress signal as well. But many experts say the landing gear issue was likely the main cause of the crash.",
      "The South Korean government has launched safety inspections on all the 101 Boeing 737-800s in the country. The Transport Ministry said authorities are looking at maintenance and operation records during five days of safety checks that are to run until Friday.",
      "The ministry said that a delegation of eight U.S. investigators \u2014 one from the Federal Aviation Administration, three from National Transportation Safety Board and four from Boeing \u2014 made an on-site visit to the crash site on Tuesday. The results of their examination weren\u2019t immediately available.",
      "Kim E-bae, Jeju Air\u2019s president, told reporters Tuesday that his company will add more maintenance workers and reduce flight operations by 10-15% until March as part of efforts to enhance the safety of aircraft operations.",
      "John Hansman, an aviation expert at MIT, said the crash was most likely the result of a problem with the plane\u2019s hydraulic control systems. He said that would be consistent with the landing gear and wing flaps not being deployed \u201cand might indicate a control issue which would explain the rush to get on the ground.\u201d",
      "The Boeing 737-800 -- an earlier version of 737 than the Max -- is a widely used plane with a good safety record, according to Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who has studied aviation safety.",
      "He said the failure of the plane\u2019s system for broadcasting location, operating its landing gear and extending the wing flaps to slow down indicate a widespread problem that affected electrical and hydraulic systems. He is confident that investigators will learn what went wrong by analyzing information from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders.",
      "\u201cThese are really the two pillars for accident analysis and accident reconstruction,\u201d Meshkati said. Like other aviation experts, Meshkati also questioned the location of a solid wall just a few hundred feet (meters) past the end of the runway, given that planes occasionally do overshoot runways. \u201cHaving such a big concrete barrier over there was really very bad luck for this particular airplane,\u201d he said.",
      "South Korean officials have said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "The crash was the deadliest disaster in South Korea\u2019s aviation history in decades. A seven-day national mourning has been declared until Jan. 4.",
      "The Transport Ministry said Tuesday that authorities have identified 175 bodies and are conducting DNA tests to identify the remaining five. Bereaved families said that officials told them that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to relatives.",
      "On Tuesday, Park Han Shin, a representative of the families, accused the government of failing to provide freezers on time as promised and said there are worries that the bodies could decompose. \u201cThe last dignities of the victims are seriously hurt. We strongly criticize authorities for failing to keep its promise,\u201d Park said.",

      "BALTIMORE -- Baltimore's division-clinching victory over Cleveland was about as routine as expected.",
      "Except for one second-quarter play that could be a major problem for the Ravens' dynamic offense.",
      "Zay Flowers, the team's top receiver, went down with a knee injury and didn't return to the game Saturday. Coach John Harbaugh sounded somewhat optimistic afterward but said there would be an MRI.",
      "Baltimore finished the regular season 12-5 despite dropping its first two games. It's just one game worse than the record that gave the Ravens the league's best mark in 2023, but this time there will be no first-round bye. Baltimore will be the No. 3 seed in the AFC playoffs.",
      "So Flowers doesn't have much time to recover. The Pro Bowl receiver caught 74 passes for 1,059 yards and four touchdowns in the regular season.",
      "Baltimore trailed Pittsburgh by two games in the AFC North with four to play. Then the Ravens went 4-0 and the Steelers went 0-4 the rest of the way.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a week-to-week league, and you really just have to take it one week at a time, one day at a time, one play at time, and our guys have done a really good job of holding onto that,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThat 1-0 T-shirt that we all wear around is real, and so, four wins later, we\u2019re the AFC North champions.\u201d",
      "You wouldn't think there'd be enough plays or enough footballs or enough yards on the field for both Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry to put up these numbers, but here are the final totals for the regular season. For Jackson: 4,172 yards passing and 915 rushing. For Henry: 1,921 yards rushing.",
      "The Ravens became the first team in NFL history with 4,000 yards passing and 3,000 rushing in one season. Obviously, the regular season is a bit longer now than it used to be \u2014 but Jackson and Henry both seem to have made each other better, and they've taken the offense to another level.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve won four in a row. I feel like everybody\u2019s been doing a great job of doing their jobs so we can execute on offense, and it\u2019s been fun,\" Henry said. \"We\u2019ve got to keep it going, stay locked in (and) hold each other accountable so we keep that same momentum in the playoffs.\u201d",
      "The wide receiver group could be thin if Flowers is limited. Rashod Bateman had a good game against Cleveland, and so did the tight end tandem of Mark Andrews and Isaiah Likely, but receiver Tylan Wallace played 51 offensive snaps and finished with one target and no catches.",
      "Michael Pierce's first career interception was a late highlight in this game, and it also underscored how healthy he looks after four games back from an injured reserve stint.",
      "Pierce, listed at 355 pounds, had some running room on his interception but was about 80 yards from the end zone and gave himself up with a slide.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a long history of turning big-guy interceptions and fumbles into memes, so at the risk of turning myself into one of those, I decided it was just time to go home,\u201d he said. \"Plus, I was out of gas, so it was good.\u201d",
      "Defensive back Brandon Stephens was targeted with some success by the Browns, and he can expect similar treatment in the playoffs after all the big defensive plays teammates Marlon Humphrey and Nate Wiggins have made.",
      "Bateman and safety Kyle Hamilton were both shaken up but returned to the field, so Flowers is the lone significant injury concern coming out of the game for the Ravens.",
      "Baltimore's last two games of the regular season were its best in terms of total yards allowed. The Ravens allowed just 211 in a 31-2 win at Houston, then 230 against the Browns.",
      "Baltimore's first-round playoff opponent depended on the result of the Chargers-Raiders game Sunday. The Ravens will host either the Chargers or the Steelers.",

      "BRISTOL, England -- U.S. rugby star Ilona Maher made her debut for the Bristol Bears women's team in front of a record home crowd of 9,240 fans on Sunday.",
      "But Maher, \u201c the most followed rugby player on the planet,\u201d could not prevent Bristol from losing 40-17 to defending champion Gloucester-Hartpury in a Premiership Women\u2019s Rugby match.",
      "She came on as a substitute in the 61st minute at Ashton Gate with Bristol trailing 28-10. Maher made her presence felt in a couple of rucks and looked for work off the wing but could make little impact to the overall picture in her 20 minutes on the field.",
      "The previous attendance record for a Bristol women\u2019s home match was 4,101 against Harlequins in May 2022. Such was the anticipation surrounding Maher's debut that Bristol relocated the match from a smaller venue to Ashton Gate to satisfy demand for seats.",
      "The 28-year-old Maher, who helped lead the U.S. to the bronze medal in rugby sevens at the Paris Games, has signed a three-month contract with Bristol in southwestern England. She had begun training with Bristol in December when the team announced the signing before going back to the United States for the holidays.",
      "Maher has more than 8 million followers combined on Instagram and TikTok. She was a runner-up on the \u201cDancing With The Stars\" TV show.",

League-leading Harlequins said they set a women\u2019s club rugby record for attendance on Dec. 28 when 18,055 fans watched the team beat Leicester Tigers 42-17 at Twickenham Stadium.

There\u2019s a that lot we need to look into and get fixed. This is never going to be about one person, I want to make that clear. This is something we all own. We all share in it. We\u2019re going to have to look at all of it.\u201d",
      "Dorsey and Dickerson were informed of the moves in the aftermath of the team's 35-10 loss in Baltimore on Saturday.",

      "Dickerson had replaced Bill Callahan when he joined his son Brian's staff in Tennessee.",

      "The FBI says the New Orleans truck attacker who killed 14 people had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses",
      "NEW YORK -- The man who drove a truck into a crowd of people in New Orleans on New Year's Day, killing 14, had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses, the FBI said.",
      "On Oct. 31, Shamsud-Din Jabbar recorded video with the glasses as he cycled through the French Quarter and plotted the attack, said Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans field office. Jabbar also wore the glasses, which are capable of livestreaming, during the attack, but did not activate them.",
      "A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of Facebook, declined to comment.",
      "Here's what the glasses are capable of:",
      "Meta glasses, made in partnership with Ray-Ban, are frames with a built-in camera, speakers and artificial intelligence that can be controlled with your voice, buttons and some simple gestures. Some functions, such as listening to music or interacting with Meta's AI assistant, require the device to be either paired with a phone or able to access the internet.",
      "The wearable does not have a display built into the lens, unlike some past industry attempts at building augmented-reality smart glasses. However, Meta has said it is working on a pair of glasses that will give users a fully holographic experience.",
      "One of the glasses' main selling points is the ability to capture images and video using the onboard camera, then upload those files to Instagram or Facebook. You can also livestream, but only to Meta's compatible social platforms.",
      "You can also use the glasses to make audio and video calls, message people or listen to music.",
      "The camera also allows Meta's AI assistant to see what you\u2019re seeing, allowing it to translate text into multiple languages (spoken back to you, or shown on a paired phone app), and answer simple questions, such as searching the nearest landmark to your location. The glasses are largely a hands-free experience so you will be talking to your device \u2014 and it will reply.",
      "The glasses currently cannot perform complex tasks that other digital assistants might be able to, like booking you a reservation at a restaurant or giving you turn-by-turn directions while you're on the move. And there's no display in the lens, so there isn't a viewfinder for framing photos or video.",
      "There are also visual indicators built into the system that allow bystanders to know when you're shooting video or taking photos. This LED privacy indicator stays on while you use the camera functions. According to Meta, you can't disable this light to be more discreet in your actions."

    "summary": "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
    "story": [
      "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
      "Will TikTok be banned this month?",
      "That\u2019s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.",
      "At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.",
      "For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.",
      "If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.",
      "\u201cA lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,\u201d said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok\u2019s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cAwaken! My Neighbor.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is \u201chard to accept.\u201d",
      "Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they\u2019ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.",
      "For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.",
      "\u201cI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.",
      "Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief \u2014 written by his pick for solicitor general \u2014 Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban \u201csweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a \u201cnegotiated resolution\u201d to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.",
      "While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.",
      "Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn\u2019t found a place quite like TikTok, she\u2019s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.",
      "According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform \u2014 and its algorithm \u2014 with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.",
      "Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.",
      "A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he\u2019d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.",
      "\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said.",
      "Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency\u2019s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.",
      "But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions \u2014 which will prevent them from updating the app \u2014 will eventually make the app \"unworkable,\u201d the Justice Department has said.",
      "TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.",

      "Data collected by Tesla on the driver and vehicle in the Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion and then shared with law enforcement has shined a spotlight on a difficult ethical question for the auto industry: Are companies violating your privacy rights",
      "NEW YORK -- Your car is spying on you.",
      "That is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las Vegas earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive by Elon Musk\u2019s company was impressive, but also shines a spotlight on a difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like computers on wheels.",
      "Is your car company violating your privacy rights?",
      "\u201cYou might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on criminals, but can anyone have access to it?\u201d said Jodi Daniels, CEO of privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors. \u201cWhere is the line?\u201d",
      "Many of the latest cars not only know where you\u2019ve been and where you are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs, your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone syncing.",
      "The data collected by Musk\u2019s electric car company after the Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track the driver\u2019s movements.",
      "Within hours of the New Year\u2019s Day explosion that burned the driver beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew Livelsberger\u2019s movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas, and also confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from onboard software -- and to great acclaim.",
      "\u201cI have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,\u201d said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters. \u201cHe gave us quite a bit of additional information.\u201c",
      "Some privacy experts were less enthusiastic.",
      "\u201cIt reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,\u201d said David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cWhen something bad happens, it\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s a double edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it.\u201d",
      "General Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to insurance companies without their consent.",
      "Cars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers\u2019 sensitive videos and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents and, in one case, nudity.",
      "Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its privacy policy. On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and information private.",
      "\u201cNo one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or a history of where you\u2019ve been,\u201d according to a statement. \"Your information is kept private and secure.\u201d",
      "Auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn't think Tesla is \u201cespecially worse\u201d than other auto companies in handling customer data, but he is still concerned.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern vehicles. They're connected,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers need to have control over their data.\u201d",
      "Tensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of Trump\u2019s hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New Orleans in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist attack.",
      "Shortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were investigating a second incident.",
      "\u201cThe fire is out,\u201d the police announced on the social media platform X, one of Musk\u2019s other companies. \u201cPlease avoid the area.\u201d",
      "Tesla shortly thereafter swung into action.",
      "\u201cThe whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,\u201d Musk wrote on X. \u201cWill post more information as soon as we learn anything.\u201d",
      "Over the next few hours, Tesla was able to piece together Livelsberger\u2019s journey over five days and four states by tracking, among other things, his recharging stops in various locations, including Monument, Colorado, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona.",
      "There are no federal laws regulating car data similar to those that restrict information collection and sharing by banks and health care providers. And state laws are a grab-bag of various rules, mostly focused on data privacy in general.",
      "Daniels, the privacy consultant, thinks that new national laws are needed because rules have not kept up with technology.",
      "\u201cI think law enforcement should have access to data that can help them solve things quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have a right to privacy.\u201d"

      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "WHAT WAS THE LAWSUIT ABOUT?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company\u2019s technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COVERED BY THE SETTLEMENT?",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "HOW MUCH MONEY WILL EACH ELIGIBLE CONSUMER RECEIVE?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors: the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "DID APPLE BREAK ANY LAWS?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial. Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \u201cfundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "DO I NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE MICROPHONES ON OTHER DEVICES SPYING ON ME?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "JUST IN CASE, HOW DO I DISABLE SIRI?",
      "You can turn Apple\u2019s virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for \u2018Hey Siri\u2019 and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone."

      "The proposed settlement filed Tuesday in an Oakland, California, federal court would resolve a 5-year-old lawsuit revolving around allegations that Apple surreptitiously activated Siri to record conversations through iPhones and other devices equipped with the virtual assistant for more than a decade.",
      "The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, \u201cHey, Siri.\" Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted.",
      "The allegations about a snoopy Siri contradicted Apple's long-running commitment to protect the privacy of its customers \u2014 a crusade that CEO Tim Cook has often framed as a fight to preserve \u201ca fundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Apple isn't acknowledging any wrongdoing in the settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.",
      "If the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents.",
      "Eligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.",
      "The settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It's also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.",

      "Early Wednesday, 42-year-old Army veteran Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar rammed a pickup truck into a crowd in New Orleans\u2019 famed French Quarter \u2014 killing 14 people who were celebrating the New Year. And police fatally shot Jabbar in a following firefight.

      "Over the last 12 years of operating history, Turo says it collected data from over 90 million booked days, 27 million trips, 8.6 billion miles (13.8 billion kilometers) driven as of Sept. 30, 2024. Less than 0.1% of those Turo trips ended with a serious incident such as a vehicle theft, the company said Thursday.",
      "Again, investigators have not found any definitive connections between Wednesday's attack in New Orleans attack and following explosion in Las Vegas. But both incidents involved vehicles rented on Turo.",
      "Authorities have said that the Cybertruck involved in the Las Vegas explosion was rented through the Turo app in Colorado. Kevin McMahill, the elected sheriff of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, said Wednesday that authorities knew who rented this truck, but were not releasing the name until investigators determine if it is the same person who died.",
      "On Wednesday, Turo confirmed that both the Cybertruck and the pickup truck used in the New Orleans attack were rented using the platform.",
      "Turo has said it's sharing any information it has with law enforcement as investigations continue. The company has also noted that the individuals involved did not have criminal backgrounds that would have identified them as security threats. It said every Turo renter is screened through a \"multi-layer, data-science-based trust and safety process.\u201d",
      "The men involved in the incidents had valid driver\u2019s licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military, Turo noted Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain,\u201d the company said. \"We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone \u2014 including Big Rental or law enforcement.\u201d"

      "Kwon entered the plea in Manhattan federal court two days after his extradition from Montenegro.",
      "The indictment alleges that the man dubbed by some as \u201cthe cryptocurrency king\u201d lied to investors from 2018 to 2022 to fool them into pouring money into Terraform Labs, the Singapore crypto firm he cofounded.",

    "summary": "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks to bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

      "Tesla\u2019s global annual sales fell for the first time in more than a dozen years, a blow to a stock that has soared since Donald Trump's election and its CEO billionaire became a top policy adviser to the president elect",
      "DETROIT -- Tesla posted its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years Thursday, sinking a stock that has soared since Donald Trump\u2019s victory on optimism Elon Musk\u2019s close relationship to the president-elect will help the company.",
      "Tesla\u2019s global vehicle sales rose 2.3% in the final quarter thanks to 0% financing, free charging and low-priced leases. But that was not enough for billionaire Musk's most valuable holding to overcome a sluggish start to 2024.",
      "The Austin, Texas, company sold 495,570 vehicles from October through December, boosting deliveries to 1.79 million for the full year. That was 1.1% below 2023 sales of 1.81 million as overall demand for electric vehicles in the U.S. and elsewhere slowed.",
      "The year-over-year global sales drop is Tesla\u2019s first since 2011, according to figures from analytics firm Global Data. The company sold 1,306 vehicles in 2010, but that dropped slightly to 1,129 the following year.",
      "The fourth-quarter boost came with a cost. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Tesla\u2019s average sales price to fall to just over $41,000 in the quarter, the lowest in at least four years.",
      "That doesn\u2019t bode well for Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 29 and Tesla's stock fell more than 7% Thursday.",
      "Musk donated more than $250 million to Trump\u2019s campaign and is a regular guest at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Tesla investors have pushed the stock up more than 50% since the election on hopes the new administration will streamline electric vehicle regulations and address other Musk policy priorities.",
      "In 2022, Tesla predicted that its sales would grow 50% most years, but the prediction ran into an aging model lineup and increased competition in China, Europe and the U.S. In the U.S., analysts say most early adopters of technology already own electric vehicles, and more mainstream buyers have concerns about range, price and the ability to find charging stations on longer trips.",
      "The fourth-quarter deliveries fell thousands short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet expected sales of 498,000 vehicles.",
      "Falling sales early in the year led to once-unheard of discounts for the automaker, cutting into its industry leading profit margins.",
      "Competition from legacy and startup automakers is also growing as they try to nibble away at the company\u2019s market share.",
      "Daniel Ives, a financial analyst at Wedbush, said he thinks the stock should be valued more on its promise of creating fully self-driving, autonomous vehicles and its AI technology and is still worth buying despite the sales drop.",
      "\u201cWe have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company...instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,\u201d wrote Ives. \u201cAnd the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.\u201d",
      "The fourth-quarter sales, while a record for Tesla, show that the company\u2019s aging model lineup is reaching saturation in the entry level luxury vehicle market, said Morningstar Analyst Seth Goldstein.",
      "Aside from the Cybertruck, which has had limited appeal, Tesla\u2019s newest consumer model is the Y small SUV which first went on sale in 2020.",
      "To meet Tesla management\u2019s guidance of 20% to 30% annual sales growth this year, the company will need to come out with a vehicle priced in the mid $30,000s to appeal to more mainstream buyers who might be considering gas, electric or hybrid vehicles, Goldstein said.",
      "Tesla has floated the possibility of a new version of the Model Y that would cost in the mid $30,000s that may be smaller inside than the current Y with fewer features, Goldstein said.",
      "\u201cAt that point you\u2019re comparable to some Hondas and Fords and GMs,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt takes you out of the luxury market to the more affordable vehicle market.\u201d",
      "Jeff Schuster, vice president of automotive research Global Data, said Tesla faces intense competition worldwide from EV makers in China, the U.S. and elsewhere, many of which are selling EVs to more mainstream buyers. \u201cIf they want to continue to see the growth they had, they need to expand to other sizes and price points,\u201d he said.",
      "Also, Musk\u2019s support of Trump for U.S. president also could be turning off some buyers who may be more environmentally conscious and lean toward Democrats, Schuster said. A broader, less costly lineup would appeal to a larger group of buyers, he said. \u201cI suppose the choices that he\u2019s made on the political front don\u2019t line up with a good portion of his buyers\u2019 profile,\u201d Schuster said.",
      "Industry experts say that Tesla used to be the only automaker with credible electric vehicles, but now others such as China\u2019s BYD now have more to offer.",
      "At present, automakers have 75 electric vehicle models for sale in the U.S. Through the first nine months of last year, electric vehicle sales slowed in the U.S., but they are still growing.",
      "Through September, new EV sales rose 7.2% to about 936,000 in the U.S., according to Motorintelligence.com. That\u2019s slower growth than the 47% increase in 2023. But EV sales this year still are likely to surpass last year\u2019s record of 1.19 million. Most other automakers will report full-year sales on Friday.",
      "Nearly all of Tesla\u2019s sales last quarter came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 23,640 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.",
      "Tesla's global electric vehicle sales edged out Chinese rival BYD, which announced Thursday that total soared 41% last year including 1.77 million EVs. The company is vying with Tesla for the world\u2019s top selling EV maker.",
      "Fourth quarter production of 459,445 vehicles was below total deliveries for the quarter, and full year production of 1.77 million was less than the year\u2019s sales.",

      "\"My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses, and beachgoers have known for a long time:\u00a0that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation's energy needs.

      "According to the White House fact sheet, this move blocks drilling in more than 625 million acres of U.S. oceans.",

      "The action comes as President-elect Donald Trump continually made his \"drill, baby, drill\" promise on the campaign trail, vowing to unlock America's drilling capabilities in an effort to lower energy costs for Americans.",
      "But the law Biden used, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, was written so a presidential action under its authority is permanent, differing from other executive actions. If the Trump administration were to attempt to reverse Biden's actions, Congress would likely have to change the law.",

      "Pope Francis is wrapping up a busy Christmas season",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis wrapped up a busy Christmas season on Monday by calling for the faithful to promote a culture of welcome and integration in their communities and reject discrimination.",
      "Francis presided over Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to mark Epiphany. According to the Bible, the feast marks the day that three wise men guided by a star came to visit the newborn Jesus. Francis said the star, in guiding humanity to God, doesn\u2019t discriminate among ethnic, linguistic or national groups and is there for all.",
      "\u201cWe do well to meditate on this today, in a world in which individuals and nations are equipped with ever more powerful means of communication, and yet seem to have become less willing to understand, accept and encounter others in their diversity!\u201d he said in his homily.",
      "God, he said, calls on Christians to reject anything that discriminates or excludes and discards people. He called instead for promoting \u201ca strong culture of welcome, in which the narrow places of fear and denunciation are replaced by open spaces of encounter, integration and sharing of life; safe spaces where everyone can find warmth and shelter.\u201d",
      "Francis has long preached the Gospel-mandated need to welcome the stranger, applying it to migrants in particular.",
      "The Epiphany Mass marked the end of a particularly busy Christmas season for Francis that also coincided with the start of the 2025 Holy Year. The once-ever-quarter-celebration of Christianity is expected to bring more than 30 million pilgrims to Rome over the next 12 months.",
      "The 88-year-old pope has a daunting schedule ahead greeting and ministering to them, alongside his other papal duties.",
      "And while he is wrapping up the Christmas season with Epiphany, he still has a busy week ahead. He'll deliver his annual foreign policy speech to the Holy See\u2019s diplomatic corps, host a final meeting with President Joe Biden and preside over the baptism of babies in the Sistine Chapel.",

    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden is set to sign into law a measure that boosts Social Security payments for current and former public employees",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Sunday plans to sign into law a measure that boosts Social Security payments for current and former public employees, affecting nearly 3 million people who receive pensions from their time as teachers, firefighters, police officers and in other public service jobs.",
      "Advocates say the Social Security Fairness Act rights a decades-old disparity, though it will also put strain on Social Security Trust Funds, which face a looming insolvency crisis.",
      "The bill rescinds two provisions \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset \u2014 that limit Social Security benefits for recipients if they get retirement payments from other sources, including public retirement programs from a state or local government.",
      "The Congressional Research Service estimated that in December 2023, there were 745,679 people, about 1% of all Social Security beneficiaries, who had their benefits reduced by the Government Pension Offset. About 2.1 million people, or about 3% of all beneficiaries, were affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated in September that eliminating the Windfall Elimination Provision would boost monthly payments to the affected beneficiaries by an average of $360 by December 2025. Ending the Government Pension Offset would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses, according to the CBO. The increase would be an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.",
      "Those amounts would increase over time with Social Security\u2019s regular cost-of-living adjustments.",
      "The change is to payments from January 2024 and beyond, meaning the Social Security Administration would owe back-dated payments. The measure as passed by Congress says the Social Security commissioner \"shall adjust primary insurance amounts to the extent necessary to take into account\u201d changes in the law. It's not immediately clear how this will happen or whether people affected will have to take any action.",
      "Edward Kelly, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, said firefighters across the country are \u201cexcited to see the change \u2014 we've righted a 40-year wrong.\u201d Kelly said the policy was \u201cfar more egregious for surviving spouses of firefighters who paid their own quotas into Social Security but were victimized by the government pension system.\u201d",
      "The IAFF has roughly 320,000 members, which does not include hundreds of thousands of retirees who will benefit from the change.",
      "\u201cNow firefighters who get paid very little can now afford to actually retire,\" Kelly said.",
      "Sherrod Brown, who as an Ohio senator pushed for the proposal for years, lost his reelection bid in November. Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees labor union, thanked Brown for his advocacy.",
      "\u201cOver two million public service workers will finally be able to access the Social Security benefits they spent their careers paying into,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"Many will finally be able to enjoy retirement after a lifetime of service.\u201d",
      "National Education Association President Becky Pringle said the law is \u201ca historic victory that will improve the lives of educators, first responders, postal workers and others who dedicate their lives to public service in their communities.\u201d",
      "And while some Republicans such as Maine Sen. Susan Collins supported the legislation, others, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, voted against it. \u201cWe caved to the pressure of the moment instead of doing this on a sustainable basis,\u201d Tillis told The Associated Press last month.",
      "Still, Republican supporters of the bill said there was a rare opportunity to address what they described as an unfair section of federal law that hurts public service retirees.",
      "The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, receive Social Security benefits.",
      "The policy changes from the new law will heap more administrative work on the Social Security Administration, which is already at its lowest staffing level in decades. The agency, currently under a hiring freeze, has a staff of about 56,645 \u2014 the lowest level in over 50 years even as it serves more people than ever.",
      "The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released last May said the program\u2019s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. The new law will hasten the program\u2019s insolvency date by about half a year. ___",

      "Congress plans to convene amid a snowstorm to certify the 2024 election results for President-elect Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- As Congress convenes amid a winter storm to certify President-elect Donald Trump 's election, the legacy of Jan. 6 hangs over the proceedings with an extraordinary fact: The candidate who tried to overturn the previous election won this time, and is legitimately returning to power.",
      "Lawmakers will gather noontime Monday under the tightest national security level possible. Layers of tall black fencing flank the U.S. Capitol complex in a stark reminder of what happened four years ago, when a defeated Trump sent his mob to \u201cfight like hell\u201d in what became the most gruesome attack on the seat of American democracy in 200 years.",
      "No violence, protests or even procedural objections in Congress are expected this time. Republicans from the highest levels of power who challenged the 2020 election results when Trump lost to President Joe Biden have no qualms this year after he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "And Democrats frustrated by Trump\u2019s 312-226 Electoral College victory nevertheless accept the choice of the American voters. Even the threat of a massive snowstorm barreling down on the region wasn't expected to interfere with Jan. 6, the day set by law to certify the vote.",
      "\u201cWhether we\u2019re in a blizzard or not, we are going to be in that chamber making sure this is done,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican who helped lead Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, said Sunday on Fox News.",
      "The day's return to a U.S. tradition that launches the peaceful transfer of presidential power comes with an asterisk as Trump prepares to take office in two weeks with a revived sense of authority. He denies that he lost four years ago, muses about staying beyond the Constitution's two-term White House limit and promises to pardon some of the more than 1,250 people who have pleaded guilty or were convicted of crimes for the Capitol siege.",
      "What\u2019s unclear is if Jan. 6, 2021 was the anomaly, the year Americans violently attacked their own government, or if this year's expected calm becomes the outlier. The U.S. is struggling to cope with its political and cultural differences at a time when democracy worldwide is threatened. Trump calls Jan. 6, 2021 a \u201cday of love.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe should not be lulled into complacency,\u201d said Ian Bassin, executive director of the cross-ideological nonprofit Protect Democracy.",
      "He and others have warned that it is historically unprecedented for U.S. voters to do what they did in November, reelecting Trump after he publicly refused to step aside last time. Returning to power an emboldened leader who has demonstrated his unwillingness to give it up \u201cis an unprecedentedly dangerous move for a free country to voluntarily take,\u201d Bassin said.",
      "Biden, speaking Sunday at events at the White House, called Jan. 6, 2021 \u201cone of the toughest days in American history.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to the basic, normal transfer of power,\u201d Biden said. What Trump did last time, Biden said, \"was a genuine threat to democracy. I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019re beyond that now.\u201d",
      "Still, American democracy has proven to be resilient, and Congress, the branch of government closest to the people, will come together to affirm the choice of Americans.",
      "With pomp and tradition, the day is expected to unfold as it has countless times before, with the arrival of ceremonial mahogany boxes filled with the electoral certificates from the states \u2014 boxes that staff were frantically grabbing and protecting as Trump's mob stormed the building last time.",
      "Senators will walk across the Capitol \u2014 which four years ago had filled with roaming rioters, some defecating and menacingly calling out for leaders, others engaging in hand-to-hand combat with police \u2014 to the House to begin certifying the vote.",
      "Harris will preside over the counting, as is the requirement for the vice president, and certify her own defeat \u2014 much the way Democrat Al Gore did in 2001 and Republican Richard Nixon in 1961.",
      "She will stand at the dais where then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi was abruptly rushed to safety last time as the mob closed in and lawmakers fumbled to put on gas masks and flee, and shots rang out as police killed Ashli Babbitt, a Trump supporter trying to climb through a broken glass door toward the chamber.",
      "There are new procedural rules in place in the aftermath of what happened four years ago, when Republicans parroting Trump\u2019s lie that the election was fraudulent challenged the results their own states had certified.",
      "Under changes to the Electoral Count Act, it now requires one-fifth of lawmakers, instead of just one in each chamber, to raise any objections to election results. With security as tight as it is for the Super Bowl or the Olympics, law enforcement is on high alert for intruders. No tourists will be allowed.",
      "But none of that is expected to be necessary.",
      "Republicans, who met with Trump behind closed doors at the White House before Jan. 6, 2021 to craft a complex plan to challenge his election defeat, have accepted his win this time.",
      "Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., who led the House floor challenge in 2021, said people at the time were so astonished by the election\u2019s outcome and there were \u201clots of claims and allegations.\u201d",
      "This time, he said, \u201cI think the win was so decisive.... It stifled most of that.\u201d",
      "Democrats, who have raised symbolic objections in the past, including during the disputed 2000 election that Gore lost to George W. Bush and ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, have no intention of objecting. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries has said the Democratic Party is not \u201cinfested\u201d with election denialism.",
      "\u201cThere are no election deniers on our side of the aisle,\u201d Jeffries said on the first day of the new Congress, to applause from Democrats in the chamber.",
      "\u201cYou see, one should love America when you win and when you lose. That's the patriotic thing to do,\u201d Jeffries said.",
      "Last time, far-right militias helped lead the mob to break into the Capitol in a war-zone-like scene. Officers have described being crushed and pepper-sprayed and beaten with Trump flag poles, \u201c slipping in other people's blood.\u201d",
      "Leaders of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys have been convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. Many others faced prison, probation, home confinement or other penalties.",
      "Those Republicans who engineered the legal challenges to Trump\u2019s defeat still stand by their actions, celebrated in Trump circles, despite the grave costs to their personal and professional livelihoods.",
      "Several including disbarred lawyer Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, and indicted-but-pardoned Michael Flynn met over the weekend at Trump\u2019s private club Mar-a-Lago for a film screening about the 2020 election.",
      "Trump was impeached by the House on the charge of inciting an insurrection that day, but acquitted by the Senate. At the time, GOP leader Mitch McConnell blamed Trump for the siege but said his culpability was for the courts to decide.",
      "Federal prosecutors subsequently issued a four-count indictment of Trump for working to overturn the election, including for conspiracy to defraud the United States, but special counsel Jack Smith was forced to pare back the case once the Supreme Court ruled that a president has broad immunity for actions taken in office.",
      "Smith last month withdrew the case after Trump won reelection, adhering to Justice Department guidelines that sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted.",
      "Biden, in one of his outgoing acts, awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal to Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who had been the chair and vice chair of the congressional committee that conducted an investigation into Jan. 6, 2021.",

      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said she has spoken at length with Trump and is lobbying him to pardon everyone who participated in the siege. Few Republicans are going that far, but many believe it\u2019s appropriate for Trump to look at pardons on a case-by-case basis.",
      "\u201cHere we are nearly four years later. Many of these people have been in prison since 2021. Even the ones that fought Capitol Police, caused damage to the Capitol, I think they\u2019ve served their time and I think they should all be pardoned and released from prison,\" Greene said. \"Some of these people have been given prison sentences: 10 years, 18 years and more. I think it\u2019s an injustice. It\u2019s a two-tiered justice system, and it\u2019s time to end it.\u201d",
      "More than 1,250 have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trials in connection with Jan. 6, with more than 650 receiving prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.",
      "Many of those who broke into the Capitol were echoing Trump\u2019s false claims about election fraud. Some rioters menacingly called out the names of prominent politicians \u2014 particularly then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and then-Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to try to object to Biden\u2019s win. Lawmakers who had evacuated both chambers on Jan. 6 returned that night to finish their work.",
      "Police officers who defended the Capitol are particularly incensed about the possible pardons. Many officers were beaten, some with their own weapons, as they tried to hold back the mob. About 140 officers were injured on Jan. 6, making it \u201clikely the largest single day mass assault of law enforcement\u201d in American history, Matthew Graves, the outgoing U.S. attorney in the nation's capital, has said.",
      "\u201cYou cannot be pro-police officer and rule of law if you are pardoning people who betrayed that trust, injured police officers and ransacked the Capitol,\u201d said Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, who retired due to his injuries after fighting rioters.",
      "Some Republicans in Congress, even those closely aligned with Trump, suggested not all Jan. 6 offenders should be treated the same.",
      "Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally who leads the House Judiciary Committee, said he supported some pardons, but also made a distinction.",
      "\u201cFor people who didn\u2019t commit any violence, I think everyone supports that. I think that makes sense,\u201d said Jordan, R-Ohio.",
      "Veteran Republican Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., also wasn't ready to go as far as Greene. \"You've got to look at it individually. Some probably deserve to be pardoned,\u201d he said.",
      "But he was more reticent when asked if those who attacked U.S. Capitol police officers should be among those pardoned.",
      "\u201cMy goodness. Again, I'd have to look at the scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they attacked the U.S. Capitol Police, it's a big problem.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said not every single charge is the same and that people who were trespassing are a different category from those who entered the Capitol and damaged property. He said he believes Trump will look at each individual circumstance and decide what is appropriate.",
      "\u201cPeople who attacked police officers, listen, I don't think that is something we should ever condone,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "House Democrats, who led the drive to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and conducted a wide-ranging investigation into the attack, warned that the pardons could have far-reaching consequences, both for the rule of law and the security of the country. Members of the extremist Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, for instance, were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes in relation to the insurrection.",
      "\u201cThose 140-odd law enforcement people who got hurt defending this institution, I think anyone who loves peace and security would be offended that you would pardon people who attacked those individuals for doing their jobs,\u201d said Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.",
      "Thompson led the House committee that investigated the events surrounding Jan. 6, concluding with a report that said Trump \u201clit the fire\" for the insurrection.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who served as lead impeachment manager during Trump's second impeachment trial in which he was acquitted, said if pardons are going to happen, people should demand contrition and repentance from each of those pardoned and an affirmative statement they pose no further threat to public safety.",
      "\u201cBecause anything that happens by these people, in a political context or some other context, will essentially be laid at the doorstep soon-to-be President Donald Trump,\u201d Raskin said.",
      "Like police officers who protected them, lawmakers who were in the Capitol during the attack have a visceral reaction to the pardon talk, having barely escaped a mob that seemed determined to do them harm.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., who was trapped in the House gallery as rioters tried to break in below, said it would be \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d for him and many others if Trump goes ahead with the pardons.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty controlled and pretty disciplined, but that would be really hard,\u201d Himes said. \u201cToo many of us had very personal experiences with the people who are serving time or were convicted.\u201d",

      "Four years ago, then-President Donald Trump rallied his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol and urged his vice president to stop the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory",
      "This Jan. 6 won't be the same.",
      "Four years ago, then-President Donald Trump urged supporters to head to the Capitol to protest Congress' certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election.",
      "\u201cWill be wild!\u201d Trump promised on Twitter a few weeks before Jan. 6, 2021. And it was.",
      "Trump gave a vitriolic speech to thousands of people gathered at the Ellipse behind the White House, after which many marched to the Capitol and stormed the building in an attempt to stop the previously routine final step in formalizing the winner of the presidential election. Even after the rioters dispersed, eight Republicans in the Senate and 139 in the House voted against ratifying Biden's win in certain swing states, despite no evidence of problems or wrongdoing that could have affected the outcome.",
      "This year, the only turbulence preceding the quadrennial ratification of the presidential election resulted from House Republicans fighting among themselves over who should be speaker.",
      "\u201cThere will be no violence. There will be no attempt to mount an insurrection against the Constitution,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. \u201cIt will be a lot more like what we\u2019ve seen for the rest of American history.\u201d",
      "The last time, Trump urged his vice president, Mike Pence, who was presiding over the certification, to intervene to keep him in the White House. This time, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee against Trump, has acknowledged her loss and isn't expected to try to change long-established procedures for certifying the election. No other prominent Democrat has urged the party to contest Trump's win, either.",
      "Congress also has since updated the law that governs the proceeding, clarifying the process in the states and specifying the vice president's role as merely ministerial.",
      "After the 2020 election, many Republicans contended there were signs of massive voter fraud that made it impossible to confirm Biden's victory, even though there has never been any indication of widespread fraud. After Trump won this November, many of those same Republicans had no such objections, saying they trusted the accuracy of the vote count. It was a change in sentiment shared by Republicans across the country.",
      "\u201cAs citizens, we should all be happy when it goes smoothly,\u201d said Edward Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University. \u201cIt's always better not to have major contestation over elections, especially when there isn't a reasonable position for it.\u201d",
      "Still, the calm may be illusory.",
      "Trump and Republicans had signaled that if had Harris won, they were prepared to contest her victory. Vice President-elect JD Vance, as an Ohio senator, argued that Pence should have acted to overturn Biden's election.",
      "Vance himself is set to be in the position to preside over the next significant Jan. 6 \u2014 in 2029, when Congress will be scheduled to accept the electoral votes for the winner of the 2028 presidential election.",
      "\u201cThe most dangerous January 6 event is not January 6, 2025. It\u2019s January 6, 2029, and beyond,\u201d said David Weinberg of Protect Democracy, which defends against what it terms authoritarian threats to the country. \u201cIt creates an enormous problem when only one side of the aisle stands down when it loses an election.\u201d",
      "The Constitution lays out some basic steps required to choose the next president, and congressional legislation has filled in the procedural blanks. After states choose their winning candidates on Election Day, electors who are pledged to vote for those candidates meet as the Electoral College and formally cast their votes for president.",
      "Congress then tallies the votes on Jan. 6 in a joint session presided over by the vice president to formally determine who's won a majority of the Electoral College.",
      "In 2021, Trump pushed for Pence not to read out the tallies from swing states that Biden won, thereby forcing Congress to vote to accept a list of states where Trump won the majority of the Electoral College. That ploy was something that Pence and numerous legal scholars said was an unconstitutional act.",
      "A year later, Biden signed the bipartisan bill that updated the 1887 law governing the joint session to make clear the vice president needs to read all of the state tallies. The Electoral Count Reform Act also makes it harder to object to the congressional vote.",
      "Still, many House Republicans remain opposed to that law.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was a prime supporter of Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 loss and had not ruled out trying to change the election outcome if Trump lost in November. Republicans spent the final weeks of the election contending Democrats would do the same if Trump won, citing a push by some to disqualify the former president from the ballot under the Constitution's once-obscure \u201cinsurrection clause.\" That effort ultimately was rebuffed by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Republicans say the size of Trump's election victory is why there is no potential unrest. He won the presidency by about 230,000 votes in the swing states and the popular vote by 1.5 percentage points after losing by about 44,000 votes in the swing states and 4.5 percentage points nationwide in 2020.",
      "\u201cThis time, I think the win was so decisive that it just \u2014 for good or ill depending on which side you\u2019re on \u2014 it\u2019s stifled most of that,\" said Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, a Republican who led the objections on Jan. 6, 2021, over groundless allegations of voter fraud.",
      "Foley, author of the book \u201cBallot Battles\u201d about election challenges in U.S. history, advised Congress on changes to the law governing the joint session and its certification of the presidential election. He said he hoped the 2024 election marks the end of groundless challenges to congressional certification, even though the candidate who spearheaded the last challenge won.",
      "That's because Trump has said he won't run again and is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. Foley noted that, in 2022, a number of Republicans tried to mimic Trump's distrust of election results and widely lost in swing states. Election denial, he said, may not be viable if not attached to Trump.",
      "\u201cAs Trump will never be a candidate again,\u201d Foley said, \u201cI hope this is beyond us.\u201d",

    "title": "Jimmy Carter\u2019s enduring diplomatic legacy: ANALYSIS",
    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 20:20:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The impact of his single-term foreign policy is still felt around the globe.",
    "story": [
      "The impact of his single-term foreign policy is still felt around the globe.",
      "A generous description of former President Jimmy Carter's foreign policy track record during his four tumultuous years in the White House would be one defined by peaks and valleys.",
      "There were highlights. Many see Carter's role in brokering the Camp David Accords, a revolutionary set of treaties between Israel and Egypt that would forever change the diplomatic landscape of the Middle East, as the foreign policy apex of his presidency.",
      "But there were also stinging failures, including the Iran hostage crisis -- a 444-day chapter of Carter's term during which 53 American diplomats and private citizens were held captive inside the U.S. embassy in Tehran.",
      "However, historians and analysts say understanding Carter's true impact requires looking far beyond the relatively short time he spent as leader of the free world, and that the former president -- once rejected as a failure -- has wielded an outsize influence on international affairs that will reverberate for years to come.",
      "When Carter left the White House in 1981, it was under a cloud of failure. In the wake of his punishing defeat by Ronald Reagan, Carter told one of his biographers that he was hopelessly distraught and wanted nothing more than to lie low in his native Georgia.",
      "That all changed, he said, when a cataclysmic event sent shockwaves through the Middle East: the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.",
      "Carter had worked alongside Sadat to broker the Camp David Accords, and in the process, the world leaders forged a deep, personal bond.",
      "While Carter was celebrated for his part in the negotiations, Sadat was lambasted by his own countrymen. Carter said he viewed the Egyptian leader's death at the hands of jihadists as Sadat paying the ultimate price for peace they had brokered in the wooded mountains of Maryland.",
      "Carter later credited that sacrifice for pulling him from his despair and eventually leading him to found The Carter Presidential Center -- a multifaceted nonprofit aimed at promoting human rights, with missions as varied as election monitoring and eradicating parasitic diseases.",
      "However, Carter's focus on easing suffering around the world was not a post-presidential pursuit so much as a return to form.",
      "On the campaign trail in the mid-1970s, Carter had vowed to make advancing human rights a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy -- a significant shift for the time.",
      "\"Because we are free, we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere. Our moral sense dictates a clear-cut preference for those societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights,\" he declared in his inaugural address.",
      "That sentiment is what drove Carter in 1979 to conclude negotiations with Panama aimed at giving the Central American nation control of the Panama Canal, administered by the U.S since construction began in 1904 (and now something President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to reassert).",
      "The State Department credits that development for enabling \"the United States to defend itself from charges of imperialism made by Soviet-aligned states\" and boosting cooperating between the U.S. and Panama.",
      "Yet, despite Carter's intentions, he sometimes wavered, and the actions he took in pursuit of his self-described \"fairness not force\" doctrine were prone to backfire, according to Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"Carter was a foreign policy neophyte, idealistic about efforts to achieve Middle East peace and driven by a Christian faith that informed his vocal but inconsistent focus on human rights,\" he said.",
      "Takeyh points to Carter's decision to turn a blind eye towards human rights abuses committed by the Iranian shah's government -- an influential partner in the fight against Soviet influence -- as an example of that inconsistency.",
      "Carter's critics say that blind spot also obscured the looming Iranian revolution and clouded his judgment of the newly installed regime, setting in motion a series of decisions that would foment the hostage crises and irreparably sour relations between Washington and Tehran.",
      "After Carter was once again caught off-guard by the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, he \"responded with increasingly hawkish actions,\" including \"an aggressive national security strategy focused on the Persian Gulf and the wider Middle East\" -- foreshadowing the decades of war in the region to come, according to Takeyh.",
      "However, other analysts argue that Carter's open embrace of human rights was actually a subtle success -- but one that took years to come fully into focus.",
      "Reagan, Carter's successor, is often credited with bringing about the collapse of the Soviet Union, and with it, the end of the Cold War. But Daniel Fried, a former U.S ambassador to Poland and distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council, argues that Carter's contributions are overlooked.",
      "\"Introducing human rights into U.S. bilateral relations meant that the default Cold War policy that a reliably anticommunist government could be embraced,\" Fried said, adding that it meant tolerating authoritarian rule was \"no longer automatic.\"",
      "\"By elevating human rights in the mix of U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-Soviet bloc relations, Carter put the United States on offense in the Cold War and on the side of the people of the region,\" he added.",
      "Leslie Vinjamuri, director of the U.S. and Americans program at Chatham House, describes Carter's elevation of human rights as \"visionary.\"",
      "\"It came at a time when the promotion of human rights was seen to be at odds with the more central priorities of a superpower during the Cold War,\" she said.",
      "Vinjamuri says that approach continued to serve Carter in the four decades following his time in the White House as he pushed to advance peace and democracy around the world, orchestrating missions to Bosnia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Haiti.",
      "Still Carter's willingness to put people and personal relationships at the heart of foreign diplomacy can be seen as either a bug or a feature of his approach.",
      "Both during and after his presidency, Carter's willingness to meet face-to-face with communist leaders and deepen ties with the nations they led repeatedly sparked controversy.",
      "In 1979, Carter severed formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan -- choosing to recognize Beijing as the sole legal government of China, effectively creating Washington's \"One China policy.\"",
      "Congress swiftly retaliated by passing the Taiwan Relations Act, requiring the U.S. to provide defensive arms to Taiwan -- legislation that Carter signed. The two steps, seemingly at odds, set the tone for the complicated and deeply consequential relationship between the powers that exists to this very day.",
      "More than two decades later, Carter became the first president in or out of office to visit Cuba since the country's revolution in 1959. While some heralded the 2002 trip as a groundbreaking step to promote democracy that cemented Carter's status as an accomplished statesman, others slammed the former president -- accusing him of legitimizing Cuba's President Fidel Castro and his regime.",
      "But Carter's willingness to cross boundaries in pursuit of what he saw as global good did not end with world leaders.",
      "The same year Carter traveled to Cuba, he also journeyed to Africa -- visiting several countries where the AIDS/HIV epidemic was still ravaging populations and deeply stigmatizing.",
      "There, alongside former South African President Nelson Mandela, Carter cradled babies infected with the virus, lovingly holding the infants as cameras snapped pictures.",
      "Dr. Helene Gayle, the president of Spelmen College, who accompanied Mandela and Carter on the trip, says it's a scene she will never forget.",
      "\"They wanted to show everyone that these babies were no harm to anyone, including world leaders,\" she said.",

      "\"The American people have called on us to reject business as usual and throw out the status quo,\" he said. \"We must and we will heed their call.\"",
      "Johnson entered the U.S. Capitol on Friday morning facing more than a dozen undecided Republican members. He had spent the day before meeting with the possible detractors in his office, and expressed confidence he would be successful but brushed off the broader implications if he were to lose on the first try.",
      "Moments before the roll call vote began, Johnson publicly released new commitments on spending and fiscal responsibility seemingly aimed at satisfying some of his skeptical colleagues, many of whom were angered over his handling of the government funding fight before Christmas.",
      "The move appeared to bode well for Johnson as the vote kicked off and several previously undecided Republicans cast their vote for him.",
      "But trouble began when some House Freedom Caucus members withheld their votes at first, not answering when their name was called.",
      "Then came three Republican defections, effectively taking away Johnson's narrow path to victory.",

      "Newly reelected Speaker Mike Johnson told House Republicans during a closed-door policy retreat on Saturday that President-elect Donald Trump wants Congress to pass one sweeping bill full of his priorities through the budget reconciliation process, multiple sources told ABC News.",
      "Johnson said Trump wants to pass \u201cone big, beautiful bill,\u201d according to sources.",
      "House Republicans are meeting privately at Fort McNair to map their legislative strategy under Trump\u2019s presidency for taxes, the border and energy, among other policy areas.",
      "Trump\u2019s desire to have one bill instead of two is a break from what Senate Majority Leader John Thune has laid out as his plan, which includes two separate packages, multiple outlets have reported.",
      "With a trifecta in the House, the Senate and the White House, Republicans will have the ability to attempt to implement major policy changes without any Democratic support using a procedural tool called budget reconciliation, which only requires a simple majority of votes to pass the chamber. But the razor-thin GOP majority in the House means a reconciliation package will also be a major challenge to pass.",
      "The House Freedom Caucus has endorsed a two-step plan rather than Trump's single bill, and the group of hard-liners may stand in the way of Trump\u2019s desires. On Friday, several members of the House Freedom Caucus nearly stopped Johnson from getting selected as speaker on the first round, though most of them ultimately voted for Johnson to allow him to obtain the 218 votes needed to be elected. Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie was the only House Republican who didn't vote for Johnson.",
      "Legislation passed via budget reconciliation, which would allow the Senate to avert the 60-vote threshold from the filibuster, would need consensus among House Republicans with their majority of 219 Republicans to 215 Democrats. If they wish to pass legislation without any Democratic support, they can only have one GOP defection if all members of the House are present. The single bill Trump favors through reconciliation would put the GOP caucus to the test.",

      "In this new Senate, Republicans have 53 seats, a three-seat majority that gives them a comfortable edge in confirming President-elect Donald Trump's nominees to his Cabinet and the federal bench since these nominations only require 50 votes for confirmation.",
      "But the Senate rules currently require 60 votes to pass legislation. If Thune holds true to his commitment to uphold this rule, that means the majority of legislative matters will require the buy-in of at least seven Senate Democrats or independents who caucus with Democrats. It keeps compromise front and center in the upper chamber.",
      "Thune's speech Friday afternoon is not the first time that he has made a commitment to uphold the Senate's 60-vote threshold, which Democrats unsuccessfully attempted to sidestep to pass voting rights legislation in 2022. Thune made the protection of the filibuster part of his campaign to become majority leader and has since spoken on the floor to the same.",
      "But the fact that Thune, who will no doubt undergo scrutiny from Trump for any failure to move his legislative agenda across the finish line swiftly, chose to use his first moments on the Senate floor as Republican leader to affirm his commitment to the 60-vote threshold is notable.",
      "Trump attempted to pressure Republicans to put the legislative filibuster rule aside in 2018, when Trump was in office for the first time and Republicans controlled the Senate. It was then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who prevented the Senate from taking that step. Democrats similarly signaled last year that they were interested in exploring a revision of the rule if they managed to keep control of the Senate, which they did not.",
      "Thune's comments on the floor today signal that he won't cave to Trump if the president-elect grows frustrated by the Senate's inability to swiftly move legislation that does not have any Democratic support and once again mounts a pressure campaign to change the rule.",
      "\"Unfortunately, today there are a lot of people out there who would like to see the Senate turn into a copy of the House of Representatives, and that is not what our founders intended or what our country needs,\" Thune said.",
      "Republicans will have the ability to attempt to implement major policy changes without any Democratic support using a procedural tool called budget reconciliation, which only requires a simple majority of votes to pass the chamber. But the razor-thin GOP majority in the House means a reconciliation package will also be a challenge to cobble together.",
      "All other legislation will require 60 votes to pass.",
      "Thune said the Senate will have a laundry list of things it hopes to accomplish during the 119th Congress, including border security, tax reform, defense spending changes and larger government funding discussions.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is now the minority leader in this new Senate, said Democrats will do their part to try to work with Republicans where possible, citing a string of bipartisan wins in previous years.",
      "\"I want to work with the new Republican leader to keep that bipartisan streak going in the new year,\" Schumer said. \"I don't expect we will agree on everything or even many things, but there will still be opportunities to improve the lives of the American people if we are willing to work together.\"",
      "Schumer, who spoke out repeatedly against Trump prior to the 2024 election, said Democrats are ready to move forward from the election.",
      "\"For first time in a long time, the next president will be someone we've seen before: President-elect Trump will return to the Oval Office,\" Schumer said. \"In the first day of the 119th Congress, I'd like to take a moment to talk about how Senate Democrats will approach the next two years. It can be summarized like this: Democrats stand united not because of who we fight against but because of who we are fighting for -- the American people.\"",
      "He also congratulated Thune on his assumption of the role as majority leader.",
      "Thune fills the role of McConnell, who stepped down from leadership after 18 years at the helm of the Senate Republican Conference. Friday was Thune's first day as party leader despite winning an election to the position in November.",
      "Thune said he will \"work every day\" to be worthy of the trust his party members have put in him as their new leader.",

    "story": [
      "He's set to chair the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.",
      "Sixty years after Black Americans gained the right to vote in the United States through the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Sen. Tim Scott on Friday makes history, becoming the longest-serving African American in the 235-year history of the United States Senate. This historic moment will be shared alongside four other African-American senators, making this the largest group of Black senators to ever serve concurrently in the U.S. Capitol, a building constructed with the labor of enslaved Black people.",
      "The previous longest-serving Black senator was the late Republican Sen. Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, who held office from 1967 until 1979. Scott, the first elected Black senator from the South, is the first to serve in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.",
      "In his first speech as a freshman senator, Scott said, \"I believe in the greatness of America because I have experienced the goodness of our people in America. An ordinary guy like me can be blessed with an extraordinary opportunity like this.\"",
      "Born and raised in North Charleston, South Carolina, Scott was raised in a single-parent household after the divorce of his parents. He was a troubled teenager who failed English, Spanish, geography, and civics in his freshman year in High School. He often recalls his close relationship with his grandfather, who was forced to drop out of school in the third grade, picked cotton to survive, and was not allowed to vote for more than half of his life. His grandfather was also unable to learn how to read, only to witness his grandson's career rise from those humble beginnings in South Carolina to become both a member of Congress and a U.S. senator.",
      "\"Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,\" Scott said at the Republican National Convention in 2020.",
      "After serving in the House of Representatives from 2011 until 2013, Scott was appointed by then-South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to the Senate in 2012 after former Senator Jim DeMint left to become president of the Heritage Foundation. Democratic Senator Cory Booker, who was elected in a special election did not join the Senate until months after Scott's appointment.",
      "In 2024, the Senate will see its highest-ever Black senators serving concurrently. This group includes Sens. Raphael Warnock, Booker, Scott, Angela Alsobrooks, and Lisa Blunt Rochester. Rochester and Alsobrooks will also break barriers as the first two women to serve together in the Senate concurrently.",
      "During his early days in the Senate, Scott occasionally would serve as the only Black person in the Senate. In 2016, following the controversial deaths of Eric Garner, Walter Scott, and Philando Castile he delivered a poignant speech about the deep divide between law enforcement and communities in America. He revealed that, as an elected official, he had been stopped and questioned seven times while driving. Even as a senator, Scott was questioned about his identity by Capitol Police despite wearing a pin identifying himenator.",
      "\"While I thank God I have not endured bodily harm, I have, however, felt the pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted. I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself,\" Scott said in 2016.",
      "As his career extends into the 119th Congress, Scott will make history as the first Black chairman of a Senate standing committee. He will lead the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and will also chair the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the only Black Republican to hold such a position.",
      "Marking the milestone achievement, Scott said in a statement, \"My goal is simple: make America work for Americans. As we get to work cleaning up the mess from the previous administration, I look forward to working with President Trump on his priorities, including paving a path for all Americans to have the necessary tools and resources to achieve their version of the American Dream.\"",
      "\"We will unlock opportunity, strengthen our nation, and make America the shining city on the Hill again,\" he added.",

      "The fourth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has a new focus as lawmakers brace for the prospect that Donald Trump may soon pardon many of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes for their actions related to the riot",
      "WASHINGTON -- The fourth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has a new focus as lawmakers brace for the prospect that President-elect Donald Trump may soon pardon many of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes for their actions related to the riot.",
      "Trump said he would issue pardons to rioters on \u201cDay 1\u201d of his presidency, which begins Jan. 20. \u201cMost likely, I\u2019ll do it very quickly,\u201d he said recently on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d He added that \u201cthose people have suffered long and hard. And there may be some exceptions to it. I have to look. But, you know, if somebody was radical, crazy.\u201d",
      "His promise, made throughout his campaign for the White House, is shadowing events Monday as lawmakers gather to certify a presidential election for the first time since 2021, when Trump\u2019s supporters breached the Capitol and temporarily halted the certification of an election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said she has spoken at length with Trump and is lobbying him to pardon everyone who participated in the siege. Few Republicans are going that far, but many believe it\u2019s appropriate for Trump to look at pardons on a case-by-case basis.",
      "\u201cHere we are nearly four years later. Many of these people have been in prison since 2021. Even the ones that fought Capitol Police, caused damage to the Capitol, I think they\u2019ve served their time and I think they should all be pardoned and released from prison,\" Greene said. \"Some of these people have been given prison sentences: 10 years, 18 years and more. I think it\u2019s an injustice. It\u2019s a two-tiered justice system, and it\u2019s time to end it.\u201d",
      "More than 1,250 have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trials in connection with Jan. 6, with more than 650 receiving prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.",
      "Many of those who broke into the Capitol were echoing Trump\u2019s false claims about election fraud. Some rioters menacingly called out the names of prominent politicians \u2014 particularly then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and then-Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to try to object to Biden\u2019s win. Lawmakers who had evacuated both chambers on Jan. 6 returned that night to finish their work.",
      "Police officers who defended the Capitol are particularly incensed about the possible pardons. Many officers were beaten, some with their own weapons, as they tried to hold back the mob. About 140 officers were injured on Jan. 6, making it \u201clikely the largest single day mass assault of law enforcement\u201d in American history, Matthew Graves, the outgoing U.S. attorney in the nation's capital, has said.",
      "\u201cYou cannot be pro-police officer and rule of law if you are pardoning people who betrayed that trust, injured police officers and ransacked the Capitol,\u201d said Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, who retired due to his injuries after fighting rioters.",
      "Some Republicans in Congress, even those closely aligned with Trump, suggested not all Jan. 6 offenders should be treated the same.",
      "Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally who leads the House Judiciary Committee, said he supported some pardons, but also made a distinction.",
      "\u201cFor people who didn\u2019t commit any violence, I think everyone supports that. I think that makes sense,\u201d said Jordan, R-Ohio.",
      "Veteran Republican Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., also wasn't ready to go as far as Greene. \"You've got to look at it individually. Some probably deserve to be pardoned,\u201d he said.",
      "But he was more reticent when asked if those who attacked U.S. Capitol police officers should be among those pardoned.",
      "\u201cMy goodness. Again, I'd have to look at the scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they attacked the U.S. Capitol Police, it's a big problem.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said not every single charge is the same and that people who were trespassing are a different category from those who entered the Capitol and damaged property. He said he believes Trump will look at each individual circumstance and decide what is appropriate.",
      "\u201cPeople who attacked police officers, listen, I don't think that is something we should ever condone,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "House Democrats, who led the drive to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and conducted a wide-ranging investigation into the attack, warned that the pardons could have far-reaching consequences, both for the rule of law and the security of the country. Members of the extremist Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, for instance, were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes in relation to the insurrection.",
      "\u201cThose 140-odd law enforcement people who got hurt defending this institution, I think anyone who loves peace and security would be offended that you would pardon people who attacked those individuals for doing their jobs,\u201d said Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.",
      "Thompson led the House committee that investigated the events surrounding Jan. 6, concluding with a report that said Trump \u201clit the fire\" for the insurrection.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who served as lead impeachment manager during Trump's second impeachment trial in which he was acquitted, said if pardons are going to happen, people should demand contrition and repentance from each of those pardoned and an affirmative statement they pose no further threat to public safety.",
      "\u201cBecause anything that happens by these people, in a political context or some other context, will essentially be laid at the doorstep soon-to-be President Donald Trump,\u201d Raskin said.",
      "Like police officers who protected them, lawmakers who were in the Capitol during the attack have a visceral reaction to the pardon talk, having barely escaped a mob that seemed determined to do them harm.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., who was trapped in the House gallery as rioters tried to break in below, said it would be \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d for him and many others if Trump goes ahead with the pardons.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty controlled and pretty disciplined, but that would be really hard,\u201d Himes said. \u201cToo many of us had very personal experiences with the people who are serving time or were convicted.\u201d",

      "\u201cWill be wild!\u201d Trump promised on Twitter a few weeks before Jan. 6, 2021. And it was.",
      "Trump gave a vitriolic speech to thousands of people gathered at the Ellipse behind the White House, after which many marched to the Capitol and stormed the building in an attempt to stop the previously routine final step in formalizing the winner of the presidential election. Even after the rioters dispersed, eight Republicans in the Senate and 139 in the House voted against ratifying Biden's win in certain swing states, despite no evidence of problems or wrongdoing that could have affected the outcome.",
      "This year, the only turbulence preceding the quadrennial ratification of the presidential election resulted from House Republicans fighting among themselves over who should be speaker.",
      "\u201cThere will be no violence. There will be no attempt to mount an insurrection against the Constitution,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. \u201cIt will be a lot more like what we\u2019ve seen for the rest of American history.\u201d",
      "The last time, Trump urged his vice president, Mike Pence, who was presiding over the certification, to intervene to keep him in the White House. This time, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee against Trump, has acknowledged her loss and isn't expected to try to change long-established procedures for certifying the election. No other prominent Democrat has urged the party to contest Trump's win, either.",
      "Congress also has since updated the law that governs the proceeding, clarifying the process in the states and specifying the vice president's role as merely ministerial.",
      "After the 2020 election, many Republicans contended there were signs of massive voter fraud that made it impossible to confirm Biden's victory, even though there has never been any indication of widespread fraud. After Trump won this November, many of those same Republicans had no such objections, saying they trusted the accuracy of the vote count. It was a change in sentiment shared by Republicans across the country.",
      "\u201cAs citizens, we should all be happy when it goes smoothly,\u201d said Edward Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University. \u201cIt's always better not to have major contestation over elections, especially when there isn't a reasonable position for it.\u201d",
      "Still, the calm may be illusory.",
      "Trump and Republicans had signaled that if had Harris won, they were prepared to contest her victory. Vice President-elect JD Vance, as an Ohio senator, argued that Pence should have acted to overturn Biden's election.",
      "Vance himself is set to be in the position to preside over the next significant Jan. 6 \u2014 in 2029, when Congress will be scheduled to accept the electoral votes for the winner of the 2028 presidential election.",
      "\u201cThe most dangerous January 6 event is not January 6, 2025. It\u2019s January 6, 2029, and beyond,\u201d said David Weinberg of Protect Democracy, which defends against what it terms authoritarian threats to the country. \u201cIt creates an enormous problem when only one side of the aisle stands down when it loses an election.\u201d",
      "The Constitution lays out some basic steps required to choose the next president, and congressional legislation has filled in the procedural blanks. After states choose their winning candidates on Election Day, electors who are pledged to vote for those candidates meet as the Electoral College and formally cast their votes for president.",
      "Congress then tallies the votes on Jan. 6 in a joint session presided over by the vice president to formally determine who's won a majority of the Electoral College.",
      "In 2021, Trump pushed for Pence not to read out the tallies from swing states that Biden won, thereby forcing Congress to vote to accept a list of states where Trump won the majority of the Electoral College. That ploy was something that Pence and numerous legal scholars said was an unconstitutional act.",
      "A year later, Biden signed the bipartisan bill that updated the 1887 law governing the joint session to make clear the vice president needs to read all of the state tallies. The Electoral Count Reform Act also makes it harder to object to the congressional vote.",
      "Still, many House Republicans remain opposed to that law.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was a prime supporter of Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 loss and had not ruled out trying to change the election outcome if Trump lost in November. Republicans spent the final weeks of the election contending Democrats would do the same if Trump won, citing a push by some to disqualify the former president from the ballot under the Constitution's once-obscure \u201cinsurrection clause.\" That effort ultimately was rebuffed by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Republicans say the size of Trump's election victory is why there is no potential unrest. He won the presidency by about 230,000 votes in the swing states and the popular vote by 1.5 percentage points after losing by about 44,000 votes in the swing states and 4.5 percentage points nationwide in 2020.",
      "\u201cThis time, I think the win was so decisive that it just \u2014 for good or ill depending on which side you\u2019re on \u2014 it\u2019s stifled most of that,\" said Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, a Republican who led the objections on Jan. 6, 2021, over groundless allegations of voter fraud.",
      "Foley, author of the book \u201cBallot Battles\u201d about election challenges in U.S. history, advised Congress on changes to the law governing the joint session and its certification of the presidential election. He said he hoped the 2024 election marks the end of groundless challenges to congressional certification, even though the candidate who spearheaded the last challenge won.",
      "That's because Trump has said he won't run again and is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. Foley noted that, in 2022, a number of Republicans tried to mimic Trump's distrust of election results and widely lost in swing states. Election denial, he said, may not be viable if not attached to Trump.",

    "story": [
      "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
      "Will TikTok be banned this month?",
      "That\u2019s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.",
      "At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.",
      "For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.",
      "If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.",
      "\u201cA lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,\u201d said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok\u2019s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cAwaken! My Neighbor.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is \u201chard to accept.\u201d",
      "Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they\u2019ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.",
      "For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.",
      "\u201cI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.",
      "Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief \u2014 written by his pick for solicitor general \u2014 Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban \u201csweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a \u201cnegotiated resolution\u201d to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.",
      "While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.",
      "Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn\u2019t found a place quite like TikTok, she\u2019s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.",
      "According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform \u2014 and its algorithm \u2014 with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.",
      "Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.",
      "A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he\u2019d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.",
      "\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said.",
      "Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency\u2019s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.",
      "But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million month U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions \u2014 which will prevent them from updating the app \u2014 will eventually make the app \"unworkable,\u201d the Justice Department has said.",
      "TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 07:17:04 -0500",

      "New York\u2019s new toll for drivers entering the center of Manhattan is starting up after it withstood years of political wrangling, a last-minute pause and a flurry of legal challenges",
      "NEW YORK -- New York's new toll for drivers entering the center of Manhattan debuted Sunday, meaning many people will pay $9 to access the busiest part of the Big Apple during peak hours.",
      "The toll, known as congestion pricing, is meant to reduce traffic gridlock in the densely packed city while also raising money to help fix its ailing public transit infrastructure.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been studying this issue for five years. And it only takes about five minutes if you\u2019re in midtown Manhattan to see that New York has a real traffic problem,\" Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chair and CEO Janno Lieber told reporters late Friday after a court hearing that cleared the way for the tolls.",
      "\"We need to make it easier for people who choose to drive, or who have to drive, to get around the city.\"",
      "The cost to drivers depends on what time of the day it is and if drivers have an E-ZPass, an electronic toll collection system that's used in many states.",
      "Most drivers with E-ZPasses will get dinged the $9 fee to enter Manhattan south of Central Park on weekdays between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. and on weekends between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. During off hours, the toll will be $2.25.",
      "That's on top of tolls drivers pay for crossing various bridges and tunnels to get to the city in the first place, although there will be a credit of up to $3 for those who have already paid to enter Manhattan via certain tunnels during peak hours.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, has vowed to kill the program when he takes office, but it's unclear if he will follow through. The plan had stalled during his first term while it waited on a federal environmental review.",
      "In November, Trump, whose namesake Trump Tower is in the toll zone, said congestion pricing \u201cwill put New York City at a disadvantage over competing cities and states, and businesses will flee.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot only is this a massive tax to people coming in, it is extremely inconvenient from both driving and personal booking keeping standards,\" he said in a statement. \"It will be virtually impossible for New York City to come back as long as the congestion tax is in effect.\u201d",
      "Other big cities around the world, including London and Stockholm, have similar congestion pricing schemes, but it is the first in the U.S.",
      "The toll was supposed to go into effect last year with a $15 charge, but Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul abruptly paused the program before the 2024 election, when congressional races in suburban areas around the city \u2014 the epicenter of opposition to the program \u2014 were considered to be vital to her party's effort to retake control of Congress.",
      "Not long after the election, Hochul rebooted the plan but at the lower $9 toll. She denies politics were at play and said she thought the original $15 charge was too much, though she had been a vocal supporter of the program before halting it.",
      "Congestion pricing also survived several lawsuits seeking to block the program, including a last-ditch effort from the state of New Jersey to have a judge put up a temporary roadblock against it. A spokesperson for New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Natalie Hamilton, said in an email Saturday, that they would\" continue fighting against this unfair and unpopular scheme.\u201d",

      "By blocking a Japanese company\u2019s takeover of U.S. Steel, President Joe Biden says he is protecting good jobs in the American heartland",
      "WASHINGTON -- By blocking a Japanese company\u2019s takeover of U.S. Steel, President Joe Biden said he was protecting good jobs in the American heartland. He may be putting them at risk instead.",
      "In making its nearly $15 billion bid for the storied Pittsburgh-based steelmaker, Nippon Steel had promised to invest $2.7 billion in U.S. Steel\u2019s aging blast furnace operations in Gary, Indiana, and Pennsylvania\u2019s Mon Valley. It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United States over the next decade without first getting U.S. government approval.",
      "\u201cThey were going to invest in the Valley,\u2019\u2019 said Jason Zugai, an operating technician and vice president of the United Steelworkers union local at a U.S. Steel plant in the Mon Valley. \u201cThey committed to 10 years of no layoffs. We won\u2019t have those commitments from anybody.\u2019\u2019",
      "Zugai and some other Mon Valley steelworkers supported the Nippon deal in defiance of the union\u2019s national leadership, which pressured the Biden administration to kill it.",
      "Losing the Nippon-U.S. Steel deal \u201cwill be a disaster for Pennsylvania,\u2019\u2019 said Gordon Johnson, who follows U.S. Steel stock on Wall Street as founder of GLJ Research. \u201cI really don\u2019t understand. This is not in the interest of the workers. It\u2019s not in the interest of the shareholders of U.S. Steel.\u2019\u2019",
      "On Friday, Biden said he was stopping the Nippon takeover \u2014 after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it \u2014 because \u201ca strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\u2019\u2019",
      "U.S. Steel stock dropped 6.5% on the news Friday.",
      "The decision, announced less than three weeks before the president leaves the White House, reflects a growing bipartisan shift away from free trade and open investment.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump had already come out against the Nippon takeover. \u201cAs President,\u201d he wrote last month on his Truth Social platform, \u201cI will block this deal from happening. Buyer Beware!!!\u201d",
      "In a joint statement, Nippon and U.S. Steel called Biden\u2019s decision \u201ca clear violation of due process and the law\u2019\u2019 and suggested they would sue to salvage their deal: \u201cWe are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.\u2019\u2019",
      "U.S. Steel was founded in 1901 in a merger that involved American business titans J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie and instantly created the largest company in the world. As the U.S. grew to world dominance in the 20th century, U.S. Steel grew with it. In 1943, at the height of the World War II manufacturing boom, U.S. Steel employed 340,000 people.",
      "But foreign competition \u2014 from Japan in the 1970s and \u201880s and later from China \u2014 gradually eroded U.S. Steel\u2019s position and forced it to close plants and lay off workers. The company now employs fewer than 22,000 in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "The U.S. government has sought over the years to protect U.S. Steel and other American steelmakers by imposing taxes on imported steel. During his first term, Trump slapped 25% tariffs on foreign steel, and Biden kept them or converted them into import quotas. Either way, the trade barriers kept the price of American steel artificially high, giving U.S. Steel and others a financial boost.",
      "U.S. Steel is profitable and is sitting on $1.8 billion in cash, though that is down from $2.9 billion at the end of 2023.",
      "United Steelworkers President David McCall declared Friday that U.S. Steel had the financial resources to go it alone. \u201cIt can easily remain a strong and resilient company,\u2019\u2019 he told reporters.",
      "But U.S. Steel has said it needs the cash from Nippon Steel to keep investing in blast furnaces like the ones in Pennsylvania and Indiana.",
      "\u201cWithout the Nippon Steel transaction, U. S. Steel will largely pivot away from its blast furnace facilities, putting thousands of good-paying union jobs at risk, negatively impacting numerous communities across the locations where its facilities exist,\u2019\u2019 U.S. Steel warned in September. The company also threatened to move its headquarters out of Pittsburgh.",
      "On its own, U.S. Steel seems poised to focus on newer electric arc furnaces, such as its Big River plant in Arkansas, which can make high-quality steel products more efficiently and at lower prices compared to blast furnaces, said Josh Spoores, the Pennsylvania-based head of steel Americas analysis for commodity researcher CRU.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if they don\u2019t have the will, but they seem to have seen that it\u2019s a much better investment, a much better rate of return if they look to invest in an electric arc furnace rather than a blast furnace,\u201d Spoores said. He noted that no steelmaker has built a blast furnace in North America for decades.",
      "One possibility is that another company will step in and make a bid for U.S. Steel.",
      "In 2023, arch-rival Cleveland-Cliffs offered to buy U.S. Steel for $7 billion. U.S. Steel turned the offer down and ended up accepting the nearly $15 billion all-cash offer from Nippon Steel, which is the deal that Biden nixed Friday. Perhaps, analysts say, Cleveland-Cliffs will try again.",
      "In a statement, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro warned U.S. Steel management against \u201cthreatening the jobs and livelihoods of the Pennsylvanians who work at the Mon Valley Works and at U.S. Steel HQ and their families.\u2019\u2019",
      "Shapiro also said companies that put in bids to buy U.S. Steel in the future must make the same commitments to \u201ccapital investment and protecting and growing Pennsylvania jobs that Nippon Steel placed on the table.\u2019\u2019",

    "story": [
      "The night started out ripe for celebrating the new year as the party pulsing down Bourbon Street in New Orleans drew revelers from near and far",
      "The night, like countless others Bourbon Street has welcomed over the decades, started out ripe for celebration. With temperatures hovering in the 50s (10-15 Celsius) hours after the arrival of the new year, the open-air party pulsing down New Orleans\u2019 famed nocturnal artery was still hot, drawing revelers from near and far.",
      "After a 3 a.m. pizza, a Pennsylvania man whose family had driven more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) to check the city off their bucket list headed back into the music-filled street.",
      "A pair of former Princeton University football teammates joined the crowd so one could show the other what the city\u2019s easygoing energy was all about.",
      "With years of waiting tables in the city\u2019s restaurants behind him, a New Orleans native came down to watch Bourbon Street\u2019s nightly parade of humanity as he had done so many times before.",
      "By the wee hours Wednesday, the crowd strolling beneath the historic street\u2019s wrought-iron balconies, many with go-cups of liquor in hand, was filled with carefree promise. Then an enraged Army veteran behind the wheel of a speeding pickup turned their night of joy into a nightmare.",
      "\u201cMy brother just wanted to go show (his friend) the good spirits and the joy that New Orleans brings, especially on a day like New Year's, all the smiles and the fun,\u201d said Jack Bech, a younger sibling of one of the victims of the deadly truck attack, Tiger Bech. \u201cNobody thought it would ever end the way it did.\u201d",
      "In the days since the rampage killed 14 and injured dozens more, families and friends have questioned the fates that conspired to put loved ones in the wrong place at a singularly horrific moment. The victims, though, were just following legions who have flocked to Bourbon Street over the years with nary a care.",
      "Paralleling the Mississippi River and bisecting the original grid laid out by the city\u2019s French colonizers in 1722, the street originally known as Rue Bourbon has been a nightlife hub since shortly after the Civil War. At first mostly for men, the arrival of dinner clubs in the 1920s drew couples to Bourbon, too. Visitors returned home to recount its drinking, dining and dancing.",
      "But in the decades leading up to last week's attack, the number of night-time businesses on Bourbon swelled substantially. And the street's prime attraction became the visitors themselves.",
      "Since its bars and clubs flung open their doors and windows in the late 1960s and began selling drinks to crowds in the street, \u201cthe spectators have become the spectacle,\u201d said Richard Campanella, author of \u201cBourbon Street: A History\u201d and a professor at the city\u2019s Tulane University.",
      "\u201cEveryone realized that what Bourbon Street meant was not so much the saloons and the clubs along the street, but the street itself and the pedestrian parade,\u201d he said.",
      "To research his 2014 book, Campanella stood in the middle of Bourbon\u2019s busiest stretch, the very area where the New Year\u2019s attack unfolded, and counted late-night partiers. On ordinary weekend nights, over 100 thronged past him each minute. On the night before Mardi Gras, the number more than doubled. Quizzing visitors on four different nights, he found about 70% came from another state and another 10% from outside the U.S.",
      "That rich street life is exactly what drew so many of those killed in the attack, and likely what made Bourbon a target.",
      "\u201cBourbon is like a free party,\u201d said Monisha James, whose 63-year-old uncle, retired waiter and handyman Terrence Kennedy, was killed in the attack. She said he went to a favorite spot on the street frequently, often striking up conversations with strangers.",
      "\u201cThat was what he was doing to enjoy his retirement,\u201d James said.",
      "On New Year\u2019s Eve, Kennedy donned a pair of festive 2025 eyeglasses and set out for Bourbon Street on his bike, his sister Jacqueline Kennedy said. He joined thousands of others.",
      "Before heading out, 25-year-old Matthew Tenedorio, who worked as an audiovisual technician at the New Orleans' Superdome, gathered with his mother and brother for New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "\u201cWe had dinner and we did fireworks outside, and just laughing and hugging each other and telling each other we loved each other,\u201d his mother Cathy told NBC News. She unsuccessfully tried to convince him not to go into the city.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t think about the risk,\u201d she said. Tenedorio was killed in the attack.",
      "Jeremi Sensky, 51, had driven with his wife, daughter, son-in-law and two friends from their home in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, to New Orleans, which they had long talked about visiting. Feeling a chill after stopping for pizza around 3 a.m., Sensky decided to turn back to their hotel, daughter Heaven Sensky-Kirsch said. That was when attacker Shamsud-Din Jabbar\u2019s rented truck roared down the street.",
      "Others were able to jump out of the way. But Sensky, who used a wheelchair, was hit, sustaining injuries that included two broken legs. He was able to breathe without a ventilator Thursday after enduring 10 hours of surgery.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was dead,\u201d Sensky-Kirsch said. \u201cWe can\u2019t believe he\u2019s alive.\u201d",
      "Tiger Bech and former Princeton teammate Ryan Quigley also were in the crowd. Bech, a 27-year-old native of Lafayette, Louisiana, who found a job in New York after graduation, had come to New Orleans to show the city to Quigley, a first-time visitor from Pennsylvania. Bech was killed in the attack, and Quigley was seriously injured.",
      "Rushed to a nearby hospital, Bech hung on long enough for his mother and father to reach his bedside and link other family members on a video call.",
      "\u201cHis eyes were closed and he was on a machine, but I know he could hear us,\u201d Bech\u2019s brother said in an interview with Sky News. \u201cGod kept his heart beating for a reason, and I truly believe it was so me and my family could tell him goodbye.\u201d",
      "Zion Parsons had arrived from Gulfport, Mississippi, to celebrate a first visit to Bourbon Street with friend Nikyra Dedaux when the truck plowed into them, killing Dedeaux. The 18-year-old had been set to start college in pursuit of a nursing career.",
      "\u201cBodies, bodies all up and down the street, everybody screaming and hollering,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cIt was just insane, like the closest thing to a war zone that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "As word of the attack spread, Belal Badawi, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, tried frantically to reach his two sons, who had driven down to New Orleans to celebrate the new year.",
      "The older one, staying with friends at a hotel, picked up. But the father had no luck reaching 18-year-old Kareem Badawi, a freshman at the University of Alabama who was home for the holiday break. He checked the location of the teen\u2019s phone and saw it was in the heart of the French Quarter.",
      "Racing to New Orleans, the Badawis waited for hours in a hospital before investigators confirmed what they most dreaded: their son was among the dead, on a street devoted to celebrating life.",

      "Telnaes wrote that the cartoon was intended to criticize \u201cbillionaire tech and media chief executives who have been doing their best to curry favor with incoming President-elect Trump.\" Several executives, Bezos among them, have been spotted at Trump\u2019s Florida club Mar-a-Lago. She accused them of having lucrative government contracts and working to eliminate regulations.",

    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 08:34:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Mike Johnson was reelected as House speaker on a single vote",
    "story": [
      "Mike Johnson was reelected as House speaker on a single vote",
      "WASHINGTON -- This time was supposed to be different.",
      "But while House Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday avoided the dayslong ordeal that his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, endured to become speaker, his relatively swift victory was hardly a unifying moment. The tumult of the day laid bare that Johnson retains only tenuous support from hard-line conservatives who gave him their votes for now, but stand ready to dispatch him just as they did McCarthy if their demands aren't met.",
      "\u201cIs he going to fight?\u201d said Rep. Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican who initially opposed Johnson but ultimate changed his vote.",
      "Republicans are relishing the moment as they take unified control of Washington and rally around President-elect Donald Trump. Yet the elements that made for a turbulent House the past two years remain stubbornly in place, except that the stakes are far higher now as Republicans try to deliver on Trump's agenda.",
      "The scale of the conflict to come was apparent as Congress began its new session Friday. House Republicans took shots at each other on TV and argued on the House floor, the freshly elected speaker looked worried, and even after Johnson's victory, some GOP lawmakers openly discussed what might trigger his removal.",
      "For a time, it seemed things might get even worse.",
      "The House chamber seemed to snap back to a familiar scene from the speakership vote two years ago as archconservatives refused to back Johnson, gesticulating while they openly negotiated on the floor. But after an hour of uncertainty and tense negotiations \u2014 as well as Trump calling in from a golf course to make clear he supported Johnson \u2014 two of the three Republicans who at first denied Johnson the speakership changed their votes to give him the majority he needed.",
      "Norman said it was not so much Trump who changed his mind, but the fact that Johnson, as he huddled with the holdouts in the back of the House chamber, vowed that he would indeed \u201cfight for everything going forward.\u201d",
      "Easier said than done.",
      "Johnson has the difficult task of leading a Republican majority that will be even slimmer than it was in the last Congress \u2014 potentially down to a single vote, once a handful of members join Trump's administration.",
      "Last year, the thin majority, as well as near-constant defiance from his right flank, forced Johnson to rely on Democratic support to pass practically any significant legislation.",
      "Johnson tried to turn the page in his first speech after winning the speaker's gavel, arguing that Republicans are now empowered by a \u201cgroundswell of Americans\u201d who want an end to the status quo in Washington.",
      "\u201cSpeaker Johnson contends that in a environment where we have the White House and the Republican Senate, that he\u2019s going to be able to go get the job done,\u201d said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who has been outspoken in his criticism of Johnson. \u201cSo we\u2019ll give him a chance to see. But we need to deliver. There\u2019s no room for any excuses now.\u201d",
      "Making matters more difficult, even if Johnson manages to unite his conference in the House, most legislation will still need at least some Democratic support in the Senate, where the chamber's filibuster rules prevent most bills from advancing unless they have support from at least 60 senators. Republicans will have a 53-47 majority in the Senate.",
      "\"He\u2019s got a really, really tough job,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said in an interview with NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Republican leadership did ease one threat to Johnson by making it more difficult to oust the speaker through a so-called motion to vacate. Any motion will now need at least nine members from the majority party rather than being triggered by a single lawmaker. Democrats protested that Republicans are shielding the speaker from bipartisan accountability.",
      "Still, within minutes of Johnson gaining the support he needed to take the speakership, the House Freedom Caucus released a letter signed by 11 members demanding that Johnson deliver ambitious policy goals, including enacting permanent border security changes, making aggressive federal spending cuts and banning members of Congress from stock trading.",
      "Caucus members said Johnson now \u201cmust prove he will not fail to enact President Trump's bold agenda.\u201d",
      "At the same time, conservatives are also agitating for guarantees to reduce the federal deficit as well as move power from the speaker's office by allowing rank-and-file members greater control over what's included in legislation. While such promises could prove hard to keep, Johnson committed to working closely with Freedom Caucus members in crafting legislation.",
      "\u201cSpeakers typically don\u2019t last very long,\u201d said Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., a caucus member. \u201cI would say this about Speaker Johnson: As long as this is a member-driven process, I think his speakership will be successful. If it\u2019s not, that's going to be tough.\u201d",
      "Nine conservatives initially withheld support for Johnson during the speakership vote by either staying silent while their names were called or voting for someone else. It was taken by many as a not-so-subtle message that the motion to vacate is still at hand, even with the rules change.",
      "The warning was even raised to Johnson during a huddle over the speaker vote, Norman said.",
      "Norman said Johnson responded: \u201cLook, if I don\u2019t perform like I say I\u2019m going to perform and push the things that you\u2019re saying, put me out. I never thought I would have this job anyway.'\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The truck attack in New Orleans by an Army veteran inspired by the Islamic State group unfolded amid months of warnings by officials about a resurgent terrorism threat",
      "WASHINGTON -- After Hamas launched the deadly assault on Israel that triggered retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he feared the Middle East violence could embolden individuals or groups to carry out attacks inside the United States.",
      "Months later, after extremists with the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate killed more than 140 people at a Russian concert hall, Wray sounded the alarm about the potential for a similar coordinated attack closer to home.",
      "Following these months of warnings about a resurgent terrorism threat, an Army veteran inspired by IS slammed a pickup truck into crowds celebrating New Year's in New Orleans. But the culprit did not coordinate with international operatives, nor was he part of any broader plot. Instead, he embodied a longstanding concern that snapped into focus in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks and never evaporated: the threat from homegrown extremists who radicalize on their own before committing mass violence in the name of foreign groups.",
      "\u201cI have never seen the threat landscape this worrying, not just from a counterterrorism perspective but from state-sponsored threats,\u201d said Christopher Costa, a former career intelligence officer and senior director for counterterrorism at the White House National Security Council in the first Trump administration.",
      "He said the \u201cgrab-bag of grievances\u201d that may have driven 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar to act \u2014 he had multiple divorces and financial pressures and noted in a video posted before the rampage that he thought of killing his family \u2014 was consistent with the profile of other attackers. And it coincided with a climate of global instability that has given extra incentive to troubled people prone to violence, from the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks that launched the war in Gaza to the dramatic overthrow last month of Syrian President Bashar Assad.",
      "\u201cYou pick the grievance, and then you\u2019ll find the ideology to act on it,\u201d Costa said. \u201cNow it includes Oct. 7, it includes IS \u2014 and why IS is so important right now is because it is resurging as a result of what IS could perceive as a victory in Syria.\u201d",
      "The New Orleans attack that killed 14 is thought to be the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil since a 2016 massacre of 49 people inside a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, by a gunman who professed allegiance to the group's then-leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. That shooting occurred at a time when the FBI was racing to disrupt a surge in plots by \u201clone wolves\" who were drawn to act by Islamic State propaganda or even to travel to the group's so-called caliphate in Syria and Iraq.",
      "The threat never abated, as evidenced by the FBI's October arrest of an Afghan man in Oklahoma who authorities say was inspired by the Islamic State group to plot an Election Day attack.",
      "But more brazen and coordinated efforts originating from overseas have drawn greater public attention recently, such as Iranian assassination plots targeting public officials, including President-elect Donald Trump. Add to the mix the turmoil in the Middle East, which has prompted demonstrations in the U.S., the 2021 collapse of the Afghan government that gave rise to Taliban leadership, and concerns about those with Islamic State ties entering the U.S. through the southern border.",
      "The swirl of concerns led Wray to tell The Associated Press in August that he was \u201chard-pressed to think of a time in my career where so many different kinds of threats are all elevated at once.\u201d",
      "That such a deadly assault in New Orleans was carried out by a lone actor without any direction from overseas underscores the volatile and unpredictable nature of the terrorism threat as well as the challenges in stopping violence from such individuals.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very difficult law enforcement challenge, much more difficult than dealing with someone who may have had active communications with overseas actors, for example, or having a distinct online profile in which they were consuming and participating in extremist activity in the online space,\" said Nicholas Rasmussen, the counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that,\u201d he added, \"then you are very much reliant on that bystander phenomenon.\u201d",
      "There's no indication that Jabbar, who was fatally shot in a firefight with police, was ever on law enforcement's radar prior to the attack. FBI investigators, however, have turned up significant signs of planning, including suspected bomb-making materials in his short-term New Orleans rental property and his Houston home, the FBI said in a statement Friday.",
      "Though officials say he wasn't aided by conspirators, Jabbar's method \u2014 ramming a truck into bystanders \u2014 is a favored option for Islamic State followers, and a pro-IS media unit on Dec. 30 encouraged attacks at New Year's Eve celebrations in the U.S. and other countries, according to an intelligence bulletin from the FBI and DHS seen by The Associated Press.",
      "The terrorism threat is set to be inherited in just over two weeks by Trump and an FBI that's bracing for a dramatic leadership change with the nomination of Kash Patel. Patel has long been skeptical of the FBI's use of its national security powers and has spoken of breaking off the bureau's \u201cintel shops\u201d from the rest of its crime-fighting activities. It's unclear how the New Orleans attack might affect any plans he has if confirmed to the post.",
      "There's no question that the turmoil in Syria \u2014 and what it could mean for the Islamic State group's ability to reconstitute and inspire supporters in the West \u2014 is a major national security wild card.",
      "Assad\u2019s ouster and the arrival of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, as Syria\u2019s main power broker have been met with degrees of relief but also alarm. Apart from HTS\u2019 past affiliation with al-Qaida, the collapse of Assad\u2019s military has raised fears of a power vacuum that many believe IS will seek to exploit.",
      "Assad\u2019s departure also has opened a window for Turkey to expand operations against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria that it believes are terrorists. The Syrian Defense Forces have been key U.S. allies in the fight against IS and operate detention camps for thousands of captured foreign fighters.",
      "U.S. and European officials are concerned that intensified Turkish attacks against the SDF may contribute to a potential IS resurgence.",

      "The judge in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hush money case has made a dramatic decision that could nevertheless bring the case to a muted end",
      "NEW YORK -- Faced with the never-before-seen dilemma of how, when or even whether to sentence a former and future U.S. president, the judge in President-elect Donald Trump 's hush money case made a dramatic decision that could nevertheless bring the case to a muted end.",
      "In a ruling Friday, Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan scheduled the sentencing for 10 days before Trump's inauguration \u2014 but the judge indicated that he's leaning toward a sentence that would amount to just closing the case without any real punishment. He said Trump could attend the Jan. 10 proceeding remotely because of his transition duties.",
      "Still, that would leave Trump headed back to the White House with a felony conviction.",
      "Will it come to that? Trump wants the conviction thrown out and the case dismissed, and communications director Steven Cheung said the president-elect will \u201ckeep fighting.\u201d But it's tough to predict just what will unfold in this unprecedented, unpredictable case. Here are some key questions and what we know about the answers:",
      "Trump was convicted in May of 34 felony counts of falsifying his business' records. They pertained to a $130,000 payment, made through his former personal lawyer in 2016, to keep porn actor Stormy Daniels from publicizing her story of having had sex with Trump a decade earlier. He denies her claim and says he's done nothing wrong.",
      "Trump's sentencing was initially set for July 11. But at his lawyers' request, the proceeding was postponed twice, eventually landing on a date in late November, after the presidential election. Then Trump won, and Merchan put everything on hold to consider what to do.",
      "Merchan denied Trump's request to toss out the conviction and the entire case. The judge ordered Trump to appear \u2014 virtually or in person, as he chooses \u2014 for sentencing at 9:30 a.m. Jan. 10.",
      "That won't be final until the judge pronounces it, and he noted that by law, he has to give prosecutors and Trump an opportunity to weigh in. The charges carry potential penalties ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison.",
      "But the judge wrote that \u201cthe most viable option\" appears to be what's called an unconditional discharge. It wraps up a case without imprisonment, a fine or probation. But an unconditional discharge leaves a defendant's conviction on the books.",
      "And by law, every person convicted of a felony in New York must provide a DNA sample for the state\u2019s crime databank, even in cases of an unconditional discharge.",
      "It's murky. Appealing a conviction or sentence is one thing, but the ins and outs of challenging other types of decisions during a case are complicated.",
      "Former Manhattan Judge Diane Kiesel said that under New York law, Friday's ruling can't be appealed, but that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not going to try.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s lawyers have been trying to get a federal court to take control of the case. Prosecutors are due to file a response with the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals by Jan. 13, three days after Trump now is to be sentenced.",
      "The defense also has suggested it would seek the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s intervention if Merchan didn\u2019t throw out the case. In a Nov. 25 letter to the judge, Trump\u2019s attorneys contended that the U.S. Constitution permits an appeal to the high court because the defense is making arguments about presidential immunity.",
      "Much of their argument concerns the Supreme Court's July ruling on that topic, which afforded considerable legal protections to presidents. Trump's attorneys might try to convince the Supreme Court that it needs to follow up by getting involved now in the hush money case.",
      "A Trump spokesperson said no decision had been made on whether to challenge Merchan\u2019s ruling.",
      "They declined to comment on Merchan's ruling. They had previously encouraged him to uphold the verdict and offered options such as delaying sentencing until Trump left office, promising no jail time, or closing the case by noting he was convicted but never sentenced because of presidential immunity. Merchan said he found those ideas untenable.",
      "Yes. But by law, he can't do that until he's sentenced.",
      "Not in this case. Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes. Trump was convicted in a New York state court."

      "The National Weather Service says a major winter storm is forecast to produce heavy snow and significant ice starting in the central U.S. and moving east",
      "A major winter storm forecast to produce heavy snow, significant ice and frigid temperatures was set to begin in the central U.S. on Saturday and move east over the next several days, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Here is what to know about the storm expected to affect millions in the eastern two-thirds of the country:",
      "A large system made landfall along the West Coast on Friday afternoon, bringing rain to the Pacific Northwest with snow expected in the Cascade Mountains, according to meteorologists.",
      "The system will be responsible for the development of a major winter storm from the Central Plains to the Mid-Atlantic this weekend into early next week.",
      "By Saturday evening, widespread heavy snow is likely in areas between central Kansas and Indiana, especially along and north of Interstate 70, where there is a high chance of at least 8 inches (20.3 centimeters).",
      "For places in the region that typically experience the highest snow totals, it may be the heaviest snowfall in at least a decade, meteorologists said.",

      "Wind gusts higher than 35 mph (56 kph) and heavy rates of snowfall could lead to blizzard conditions, particularly in Kansas and nearby portions of the Central Plains by Sunday morning.",
      "Whiteout conditions may make driving dangerous to impossible and heighten the risk of becoming stranded.",
      "Dangerous sleet and freezing rain, particularly detrimental to power lines, also is anticipated to start Saturday from eastern Kansas to Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and much of Kentucky and West Virginia.",
      "Treacherous travel conditions are expected with power outages likely in areas with more than a quarter-inch (a half centimeter) of ice accumulation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a mess, a potential disaster,\u201d private meteorologist Ryan Maue said.",
      "Starting Monday, hundreds of millions of people in the eastern two-thirds of the country will experience dangerous, bone-chilling air and wind chills, forecasters said.",
      "Temperatures could be 12 to 25 degrees Fahrenheit (7 to 14 degrees Celsius) colder than normal as the polar vortex stretches down from the high Arctic.",
      "\u201cThis could lead to the coldest January for the U.S. since 2011,\u201d AccuWeather Director of Forecast Operations Dan DePodwin said Friday, noting there could be up to a week or more of \"temperatures that are well below historical average.\u201d",

      "A hard freeze is even expected in Florida, he added.",

      "The polar vortex \u2014 ultra-cold air spinning like a top \u2014 usually stays above the North Pole, but sometimes stretches down to the U.S., Europe or Asia, causing intense doses of cold.",
      "Cohen and colleagues have published several studies showing an increase in the polar vortex stretching or wandering. Cohen and others lpublished a study last month attributing the cold outbreaks partly to changes from an Arctic that is warming four times faster than the rest of the globe."

      "ATLANTA -- Six days of funeral observances for former President Jimmy Carter begin Saturday in Georgia, where he died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100.",
      "The first events reflect Carter\u2019s climb up the political ladder, from the tiny town of Plains, Georgia, to decades on the global stage as a humanitarian and advocate for democracy.",
      "Here is what to know about the initial ceremonies and what happens next:",
      "The proceedings, streamed on apnews.com and the Associated Press YouTube channel, are schelued to begin at 10:15 a.m. EST Saturday with the Carter family arriving at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus.",
      "Former Secret Service agents who protected Carter will serve as pallbearers, walking alongside the hearse as it exits the campus on its way to Plains.",
      "James Earl Carter Jr. lived more than 80 of his 100 years in and around the town, which still has fewer than 700 people, not much more than when he was born on Oct. 1, 1924. Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton also grew up in rural settings, but Carter stands out for returning and remaining in his birthplace for his long post-presidency.",
      "The motorcade will move through downtown Plains, which spans just a few blocks, passing near the girlhood home of first lady Rosalynn Smith Carter, who died in November 2023 at the age of 96, and near where the couple operated the family peanut warehouses. The route also includes the old train depot that served as Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign headquarters and the gas station once run by Carter's younger brother Billy.",
      "The motorcade will then pass by the Methodist church where the Carters married in 1946, and the home where they lived and died. The former president will be buried there alongside Rosalynn.",
      "The Carters built the one-story house, now surrounded by Secret Service fencing, before his first state Senate campaign in 1962 and lived out their lives there with the exception of four years in the Governor's Mansion and four more in the White House.",
      "The military-run schedule calls for a 10:50 a.m. stop in front of Carter's family farm and boyhood home in Archery, outside Plains, after passing the cemetery where the former president's parents, James Earl Carter Sr. and Lillian Carter, are buried.",
      "The farm now is part of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park. The National Park Service will ring the old farm bell 39 times to honor the 39th president.",
      "Carter was the first president born in a hospital. But the home had no electricity or running water when he was born, and he worked his father's land during the Great Depression. Still, the Carters had relative privilege and status. Earl employed Black tenant farming families. The elder Carter also owned a store in Plains and was a local civic and political leader. Lillian was a nurse and she delivered Rosalynn. The property still includes a tennis court Earl had built for the family.",
      "It was Earl's death in 1953 that set Jimmy on course toward the Oval Office. The younger Carters had left Plains after he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. But Jimmy abandoned a promising career as a submarine officer and early participant in the Pentagon's nuclear program to take over the family's peanut business after his father's death. Within a decade, he was elected to the Georgia state Senate.",
      "From Archery, the motorcade will head north to Atlanta and will stop at 3 p.m. outside at the Georgia Capitol, where he served as a state senator from 1963 to 1967 and governor from 1971 to 1975. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens will lead a moment of silence. While former governors are honored with state-run funerals, presidents \u2014 even if they served as governors \u2014 are memorialized with national rites run by the federal government.",
      "The motorcade then is scheduled to arrive at the Carter Presidential Center at 3:45 p.m., with a private service at 4 p.m. The campus includes Carter\u2019s presidential library and The Carter Center, established by the former president and first lady in 1982.",
      "From 7 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Monday, Carter will lie in repose for the public to pay respects around the clock.",
      "The ceremony is expected to include some of The Carter Center's global staff of 3,000, whose work concentrating on international diplomacy and mediation, election monitoring and fighting disease in the developing world continues to set a standard for what former presidents can accomplish.",
      "Jimmy Carter, who delivered its annual reports until 2019, won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize in part for this post-presidential work. His grandson Jason Carter now chairs the board.",
      "Carter's remains will travel next to Washington, where he will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda until his funeral at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Washington National Cathedral. All the living presidents have been invited, and Joe Biden, a Carter ally, will deliver a eulogy.",
      "The Carter family then will return to bury its patriarch in Plains after a private hometown funeral at 3:45 p.m. at Maranatha Baptist Church, where Carter, a devout evangelical, taught Sunday School for decades.",
      "Carter will be buried afterward in a private graveside service, in a plot visible from the front porch of his home.",

    "summary": "It never got old",
    "story": [
      "It never got old",
      "PLAINS, Ga. -- It never got old.",
      "No matter how many times one crammed into the modest sanctuary at Maranatha Baptist Church, there was always some wisdom to be gleaned from the measured, Bible-inspired words of Jimmy Carter.",
      "This was another side of the 39th president, a down-to-earth man of steadfast faith who somehow found time to teach Sunday school classes when he wasn\u2019t building homes for the needy, or advocating for fair elections, or helping eradicate awful diseases.",
      "For young and old, straight and gay, believers and nonbelievers, Black and white and brown, Maranatha was a far-off-the-beaten path destination in southwest Georgia where Carter, well into his 90s, stayed connected with his fellow citizens of the world.",
      "Anyone willing to make the trek to his hometown of Plains, with its one blinking caution light and residents numbering in the hundreds, was rewarded with access to a white-haired man who once occupied the highest office in the land.",
      "Carter taught his Sunday school class roughly twice a month to accommodate crowds that sometimes swelled to more than 500. (On the other Sundays, no more than a couple dozen regulars and a handful of visitors usually attended services).",
      "Here, the former commander-in-chief and the onetime first lady, his wife of more than seven decades, were simply Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn. And when it came to worshipping with them, all were welcome.",
      "Before the former president entered the sanctuary, with a bomb-sniffing dog outside and Secret Service agents scattered around, a strict set of rules would be laid out by Ms. Jan \u2014 Jan Williams, a longtime church member and friend of the Carters. She would have made quite a drill sergeant.",
      "It felt like a good-cop, bad-cop routine. Ms. Jan barking out rules you knew had come straight from Mr. Jimmy, who studied nuclear physics and approached all things with an engineer\u2019s orderly mind.",
      "Most important for those wanting a photo with the Carters \u2014 and nearly everyone did \u2014 you had to stay for the main 11 a.m. church service. Picture-taking began around noon.",
      "If you left the church grounds before that, there was no coming back. If you stayed, you followed rules. No autographs. No handshakes. No attempts at conversation beyond a brief \u201cgood morning\u201d or \u201cthank you.\u201d",
      "Carter, consistently in sports jacket, slacks and bolo tie, would start his lesson by moving around the sanctuary, asking with a straight face if there were any visitors \u2014 that always got a laugh \u2014 and where they were from. In my many trips to Maranatha, I\u2019m sure I heard all 50 states, not to mention an array of far-flung countries.",
      "If anyone answered Washington, D.C., the answer was predictable. \u201cI used to live there,\u201d the one-term president would say, breaking into that toothy grin.",
      "Carter\u2019s Bible lessons focused on central themes: God gives life, loves unconditionally and provides the freedom to live a completely successful life. But the lesson usually began with an anecdote about what he\u2019d been up to or his perspective on world affairs.",
      "Carter could talk about building homes with Habitat for Humanity or bemoan U.S. conflicts since World War II. He could talk about his work with The Elders, a group of former world leaders, or a trip out West to go trout fishing with Ted Turner. He could talk about The Carter Center\u2019s successes in eliminating the guinea worm, or his long friendships with Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan.",
      "\u201cWillie Nelson is an old friend. He used to come visit me in the White House,\u201d Carter related once, touching ever so gently on Nelson\u2019s affection for weed.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what Willie and my children did after I went to bed. I\u2019ve heard rumors,\u201d the former president said, with a sly grin and a wink that suggested he believed every word.",
      "My favorite: Carter telling of his latest book project and how he had long used encyclopedias for research.",
      "Carter decided the collection was taking up too much space, so he boxed it up and headed out to local schools and libraries, figuring someone would eagerly take a donation from an ex-president. Instead, he got a standard refrain: Sorry, no one uses encyclopedias anymore.",
      "I recall the punchline. \u201cHow do I look up things now?\u201d asked the man born five years after World War I ended. Pause. Then: \u201dGoogle.\u201d",
      "During most of my visits to Maranatha, Carter spoke for 45 minutes without sitting down. His mind remained sharp, with only an occasional glance at the notes tucked inside his Bible, but his body became more and more feeble as he moved deeper into his 90s. He talked openly about the ravages of aging.",
      "He resisted church members\u2019 pleadings to take a seat while teaching. I was there the first time he tried it, in August 2018.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable sitting down,\u201d he said, \u201dbut I guess I\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d",
      "Not that time. Carter sat for less than 10 minutes before rising. He stood at the table for the rest of class.",
      "Returning the following year, Carter had relented to using a white, remote-controlled chair. After climbing aboard \u2014 voil\u00e0 \u2014 a flick of a switch would slowly lift him above the lectern, visible even to those sitting in the back.",
      "If there wasn\u2019t enough room in the sanctuary, rows of folding chairs were set up in the fellowship hall and a handful of tiny classrooms. Carter\u2019s lesson would be shown on TVs linked to a feed from the main room.",
      "A letdown for visitors? Perhaps. But relegation to a back room had its benefits.",
      "Carter, who usually arrived about 15 minutes before the start of his 10 a.m. lesson, would swing by these rooms before heading to the sanctuary. He would even take a few questions, which didn\u2019t happen in front of the big crowd.",
      "After a 2018 profile by The Washington Post told of the Carters having regular Saturday night dinners at friend Jill Stuckey\u2019s house, which included one glass each of \u201cbargain-brand Chardonnay,\u201d I asked Carter how many glasses of wine he\u2019d had the night before.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll say one,\u201d Carter replied with a sly grin. Stuckey, standing behind him, shook her head and held up two fingers.",
      "No matter where you sat \u2014 main sanctuary or back room \u2014 everyone got their picture taken with Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn. For many, this seemed the biggest reward.",
      "When we first started attending, those pictures were taken under a tree just outside the church. After being diagnosed with cancer in 2015, Carter and his wife would pose with visitors inside the sanctuary. Carter liked to joke about what a burden it was to sit for all those pictures, which surely numbered in the hundreds of thousands.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be delighted to have photographs made with all of you,\u201d he quipped after one of his final lessons. \u201cActually, since I\u2019m in church, I better say I\u2019ll be willing to have photographs made with all of you.\u201d",
      "For my family, those pictures show a son growing from boy to man with Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn filling out the frames. What a treasure they are.",
      "Turnout for Carter\u2019s Sunday school lessons dipped during the Great Recession. But the crowds returned after his cancer announcement, with some folks lining up outside the church the night before.",
      "Carter declared himself cancer-free, but other health challenges began to catch up with him. After an October 2019 fall at his home left him with a slightly fractured pelvis, the church announced Carter would not teach his next class on Nov. 3, a lesson we had planned to attend. Disappointed, we canceled our hotel reservation.",
      "But Mr. Jimmy wasn\u2019t done just yet.",
      "The church had canceled without checking with him. He made it clear that he was NOT cancelling. We quickly rebooked. Carter\u2019s lesson that day, based on the Book of Job, was especially poignant in retrospect.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to start by asking you a very profound question,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many of you believe in life after death?\u201d",
      "Carter conceded to having doubts for most of his life, right up to being stricken by cancer, which finally erased any skepticism. When the end on this world came, he would be ready.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to dread after death,\u201d Carter said with a reassuring smile.",
      "At the end of his lesson, he challenged everyone to do one good deed for a stranger. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold you to it,\u201d Carter promised.",
      "He never got the chance.",
      "His health continued to decline, sidelining him through the Christmas season. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world in 2020.",
      "By that summer, it was clear that Mr. Jimmy\u2019s treasured role as spreader of the gospel, which he began at 18 and resumed after his presidency, was over.",
      "___",
      "Paul Newberry, an Atlanta-based national sports writer and columnist for The Associated Press, traveled to Plains, Georgia, with his family and friends about 20 times to attend Carter\u2019s Sunday school classes. He was there for Carter\u2019s final lesson."

      "LOS ANGELES -- The new Los Angeles County District Attorney met with the Menendez brothers' family as he continues to review their bid for freedom 35 years after they were convicted of killing their parents.",
      "Nathan Hochman, who took office in December, said Friday that he had a \u201cproductive session\u201d with the family members, who shared their thoughts with him on whether the brothers should be released. The meeting lasted about three hours.",
      "Brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez were found guilty of murdering Jose and Kitty Menendez in 1989 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Now in their 50s, they began their bid for freedom in recent years after new evidence of their father\u2019s sexual abuse emerged in their case. Their lawyers filed a habeas corpus petition \u2014 a request for a court to examine whether someone is being lawfully detained \u2014 in May 2023, asking a judge to consider the evidence.",
      "The brothers have the support of most of their extended family, who have said they deserve to be free after decades behind bars. Several family members have said that in today\u2019s world \u2014 which is more aware of the impact of sexual abuse \u2014 the brothers would not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life.",
      "In October 2024, then-District Attorney George Gascon recommended the brothers be resentenced to 50 years to life, which would make them immediately eligible for parole. Hochman, who was running against Gascon, called it a \u201cdesperate political move.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy releasing it now, Gascon has cast a cloud over the fairness and impartiality of his decision,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "A judge delayed the brothers' resentencing hearing, originally set for early December, to the end of January. Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic said he needed time to review extensive evidence and give Hochman time to weigh in on the case.",
      "Hochman said Friday he was still reviewing thousands of pages of prison records to \u201canalyze the rehabilitation aspect of resentencing.\u201d Evidence of rehabilitation could include not engaging in illegal activity while in prison, starting organizations that helped other prisoners, and using that time to improve oneself, he said.",
      "At the brothers' original trials, their defense attorneys argued that they had been sexually abused by their father. Prosecutors denied that and accused them of killing their parents for money. In the years that followed, they repeatedly appealed their convictions without success.",
      "The brothers are being held at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.",

      "Aaron Brian Gunches' execution would mark a resumption of Arizona\u2019s use of the death penalty after a two-year pause while it reviewed its procedures.",
      "In a handwritten court filing this week, Gunches asked the state Supreme Court to schedule his execution for mid-February for his murder conviction in the 2002 killing of Ted Price.",
      "Gunches, who isn\u2019t a lawyer but is representing himself, said his death sentence is \u201clong overdue\u201d and that the state was dragging its feet in asking the court for a legal briefing schedule leading up to the execution.",
      "Attorney General Kris Mayes\u2019 office, which is seeking Gunches\u2019 execution, said a briefing schedule is needed to ensure corrections officials can meet execution requirements, such as testing for the pentobarbital that will be used for his lethal injection.",

      "Gunches had been set to be put to death in April 2023. But Gov. Katie Hobbs' office said the state wasn\u2019t prepared to enforce the death penalty because it lacked staff with expertise to carry out executions.",
      "Hobbs, a Democrat, had promised not to carry out any executions until there was confidence the state can do so without violating any laws.

      "\u201cWe have numbers that are nothing short of remarkable,\" Duggan said. \"I was the (Wayne County) prosecutor in 2002 and I remember the Detroit police celebrating that we got under 400 homicides for the first time and they said, \u2018We never thought we\u2019d see that number.' And a few years back I was the mayor and we got under 300 homicides.\u201d",
      "Overall violent crime in the United States declined by an estimated 3% in 2023 from the year before, according to an FBI report released in September. Nationally, murders and non-negligent manslaughter dropped nearly 12%.",
      "Detroit, which has a population of about 633,000 residents, reported 309 homicides in 2022. There also were 308 homicides in 2021. The city had 261 homicides in 2018, the fewest since 1966 when there were 214 homicides.",

      "Decreases have been across the board. Carjackings dipped from 167 in 2023 to 142 last year. Sexual assaults also were down and 184 fewer robberies were reported last year compared to 2023. Burglaries, larcenies and motor vehicle theft also dropped.",
      "Duggan credited the city's partnerships with other local and state law enforcement and federal agencies.",
      "He also credited programs like ShotStoppers which provides federal funds to groups in Detroit working to cut down the numbers of homicides and shootings. Reductions of 83%, 73% and 61% in some of the city\u2019s most violent areas were reported last month.",
      "ShotStoppers kicked off in 2023 and empowers activists and residents to use their own strategies to prevent violence. Those strategies include teaching young people to think critically, improving training opportunities for adults, drug prevention and blight removal.",

      "US President Joe Biden has announced a ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling along most of America's coastline, weeks before Donald Trump takes office.",
      "The ban covers the entire Atlantic coast and eastern Gulf of Mexico, as well as the Pacific coast off California, Oregon and Washington and a section of the Bering Sea off Alaska.",
      "It is the latest in a string of last-minute climate policy actions by the Biden administration ahead of Trump's return to the White House.",
      "During his campaign, Trump pledged to \"unleash\" domestic fossil fuel production in a bid to lower gas costs, despite the US already seeing record high extraction rates.",
      "Biden said in a statement: \"My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses, and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation's energy needs.",

      "Trump has pledged to reverse Biden's conservation and climate change policies when he takes office later this month. However, the new ban does not have an end date and could be difficult for the Republican to overturn.",
      "Biden is taking the action under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, which allows presidents to withdraw areas from mineral leasing and drilling.",
      "The law, however, does not grant them the legal authority to overturn prior bans, according to a 2019 court ruling. It also does not allow presidents to revoke any areas already leased for offshore drilling.",
      "Trump - despite being in favour of more oil and gas exploration and repeatedly deploying his tag line \"Drill, baby, drill\" during campaigning - has used the law himself to protect waters off the coast of Florida in 2020.",
      "At the time, this was seen as an effort to garner votes from the state ahead of the 2020 US election, and the protection was due to expire in 2032. Biden's decision will protect the same area with no expiry date.",
      "The new offshore drilling ban covers more than 625 million acres (253 million hectares) of waters.",
      "After it was reported last week that Biden would introduce the policy, Trump's incoming press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it \"a disgraceful decision\".",

      "Biden cited threats to national security in rejecting the Nippon Steel purchase, saying US ownership was important to keeping the US steel industry and its supply chains strong.",
      "His intervention follows pressure from the United Steelworkers union, which had opposed a transaction that was a sensitive political issue in the 2024 US presidential campaign.",
      "The Japanese government has called Biden's decision \"incomprehensible\".",
      "Nippon Steel and US Steel said Biden's decision showed the review of the deal had been \"corrupted\" for political gain.",
      "The two companies, which had previously threatened to sue the government if the deal did not happen, on Friday said they would take \"appropriate action to protect their legal rights\".",
      "\"We believe that President Biden has sacrificed the future of American steelworkers for his own political agenda,\" the companies said in a statement, adding that the move sent \"a chilling message to any company based in a US allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States\".",
      "Japanese officials also said they were disappointed by the decision.",
      "\"There are strong concerns from the economic circles of both Japan and the US, and especially from Japanese industry regarding future investments between Japan and the US, and the Japanese government has no choice but to take this matter seriously,\" Japanese industry and trade minister Yoji Muto said in a statement to Reuters.",
      "Biden's decision comes a year after Nippon Steel first announced the $14.9bn (\u00a312bn) deal to buy its smaller Pennsylvania-based rival.",
      "It raises significant questions about the path forward for the company, a 124-year-old name that was once a symbol of American industrial might but is now much diminished.",
      "It spent months looking for a buyer before announcing the tie-up with Nippon Steel, the world's fourth largest steelmaker, in December 2023.",
      "US Steel has warned that it might have to close factories without the investment that would come with a new owner, concerns that had been echoed by some workers and local politicians.",

      "The US government panel charged with reviewing the deal for national security risks failed to reach a consensus by late December, leaving the decision to Biden, who was required to act within a 15-day deadline.",
      "In his announcement on Friday he said foreign ownership presented a risk and ordered the companies to abandon the deal within 30 days.",
      "\"A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains,\" he said.",
      "\"That is because steel powers our country: our infrastructure, our auto industry, and our defence industrial base. Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\"",
      "The United Steelworkers union called the decision the \"right move for our members and our national security\", saying its opposition had been driven by concerns about the long-term viability of its industry.",
      "\"We're grateful for President Biden's willingness to take bold action to maintain a strong domestic steel industry and for his lifelong commitment to American workers,\" President David McCall said.",
      "Prof Stephen Nagy, of the Department of Politics International Studies at the International Christian University in Tokyo, called Biden's decision \"political\", noting that the administration from its start promised a foreign policy \"for the middle class\".",
      "\"This was a direct response and continuation of the Trump MAGA agenda of Making America Great Again,\" he said. \"The Biden administration couldn't appear weak on foreign businesses, whether it's an ally or adversary.\"",
      "White House spokesperson John Kirby dismissed suggestions the move could damage American relationships with allies, saying Biden had made clear the decision was not \"about Japan\",",
      "\"This is about US steel-making and keeping one of the largest steel producers in the United States an American-owned company,\" he said at a press conference.",
      "Shares in US Steel fell more than 5% on Friday.",
      "But analysts said the move might not mark the end of the deal. Biden's order says the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States can extend the 30-day deadline to scrap the transaction.",
      "Prof Nagy said he thought the companies could decide to try again under Trump, potentially offering different terms that would allow the new president to claim he had negotiated a better deal.",
      "Political analyst Terry Haines of Pangaea Policy also said Trump, despite his criticism of the deal, might have reason to revisit the decision.",
      "\"One of the things that's difficult about this decision is that Japan is a very close US ally,\" he said. \"The government's got frankly a big evidentiary burden in order to justify what they're doing today - and it hurts bilateral relations with Japan, something Trump will want to avoid.\""

    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 15:34:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Delays and cancellations related to British weather may become more common.",
    "story": [
      "Passengers at British airports have faced travel chaos on multiple occasions over the last few weeks, from heavy winds to fog.",
      "Now, the Met Office has issued an amber warning for snow and ice in the Midlands, north of England and Wales, which says that delays and cancellations to air travel are \"expected\".",
      "It can seem a mystery to many frustrated flyers that a brief spell of bad weather can upend schedules, especially since British weather isn't exactly famed for being the best.",
      "So why, with all the technological advancements of planes and airports in recent years, do flights get affected so badly?",
      "How efficiency can quickly turn to chaos",
      "While planes are designed to deal with the likes of snow and ice, fog and high winds, air traffic control often imposes strict safety limits in these situations.",
      "As a result, \"airports go into a kind of slow motion\" with the spacing between arriving and departing aircraft increased, says travel expert Simon Calder.",
      "If the conditions \"require air-traffic controllers to increase the spacing between aircraft by 50%, capacity is immediately reduced by one third \u2013 and cancellations begin,\" he adds.",
      "There's little slack in the system, as when things are running smoothly, schedules at London Heathrow - Europe's busiest airport - are based on landing aircraft as close as 80 seconds apart. And London Gatwick, the UK's second busiest airport, can facilitate a take-off or landing every 65 seconds.",
      "The spacing between arriving and departing aircraft was increased at London Gatwick last weekend during the fog, which Mr Calder estimates led to about 75,000 passengers being affected.",
      "Among them were James and Madison King, whose flight from Stockholm to London took a lengthy diversion because of the fog-related spacing limits.",
      "They were within touching distance of home when the pilot announced they did not have enough fuel for a 50-minute holding pattern at Gatwick, so the plane diverted to Dublin to refuel. Flight crew shift limits then meant all the passengers had to fly back to where they started in the Swedish capital.",
      "James says he still hasn't been reimbursed for the \u00a3200 he spent on a hotel and dinner during this impromptu additional overnight stay in Stockholm.",
      "Heathrow also saw delays and cancellations during high winds before Christmas.",
      "Despite some airports trialling artificial intelligence to help planes land in low visibility, controllers in on-the-ground towers still need to clearly see an aircraft arriving before issuing a landing clearance, aviation expert Scott Bateman MBE wrote on X.",
      "He says the majority of modern aircraft can automatically land in the worst fog, but that in practice visibility limits are imposed so pilots can see sufficiently to taxi off the runway.",
      "Elif Arjin Celik's flight from London Gatwick to Istanbul was delayed for hours because of poor visibility in the fog on 28 December 2024.",
      "She saw thousands of people waiting in the terminal with nowhere to sit, and says it was \"grim\" having to wait 20 minutes to use the toilet because of the \"extreme overcrowding\".",
      "With upcoming warnings of snow, Mr Calder advises passengers to brace for more disruption to their flights because of spacing limits and runway closures.",
      "\"The UK has seen some shocking snow closures, where big airports have simply not been able to cope,\" he says, citing an incident in 2010 where hundreds of thousands of passengers saw cancellations at Heathrow because of snow.",
      "Snow also caused Manchester Airport to close both its runways in December 2022 and again in January 2023, with flights diverted as far away as Dublin and Paris.",
      "Although the extreme cost of disruption on this scale has led to British airports investing more in hardware and training to clear snow quicker, don't expect us to cope like airports in places such as Iceland and Greenland.",
      "Mr Calder says we might never be as good as other countries at keeping an efficient schedule in unusual weather.",
      "\"Historically the UK has had a benign climate,\" he says. \"Spending millions preparing for an unlikely event has been hard to justify.\"",
      "Disruption could grow",
      "There's not great news on the horizon because in the future, we can expect more disruption from weather related to climate change, says Dr Ella Gilbert, a climate expert from the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"Aviation tends to be most impacted by extreme precipitation and stormy weather that makes flying unsafe - two weather types that are enhanced by higher temperatures,\" she says.",
      "She adds that climate heating increases the frequency and intensity of rain and snowfall events, making storms \"stronger and more frequent\" and increasing the frequency of aircraft turbulence.",
      "Nats, the national air traffic service, is allowed to take action to reduce the amount of planes in the sky and space them apart more during adverse weather under the Transport Act 2000.",
      "Given this is part of Nats' obligation to prioritise safety over all other factors, it doesn't have to compensate airlines for these restrictions - which in turn means airlines don't need to compensate passengers for the resulting delays either.",
      "The organisation told the BBC that it recognises there's a tough balancing act.",
      "\"Flow regulations are only ever employed when absolutely necessary and have to be expertly timed,\" a Nats spokesperson said.",
      "\"Unexpected additional or delayed air traffic can increase the pressure on controllers, particularly when the weather clears.",
      "\"If restrictions are lifted too early, they can risk an overpopulated airspace, while on the flip side, restrictions remaining in place longer than they need to can lead to unnecessary delays, which no one wants.\"",
      "This is brought into sharp focus during storms, Nats explained.",
      "\"Fundamentally, pilots don't want to fly through storms,\" it told the BBC.",
      "\"Although aircraft are robust, storms can still affect aircraft systems and excessive winds within unstable storm clouds make it much more difficult for aircraft to maintain their levels. It also increases turbulence, which negatively impacts passenger comfort.\"",
      "This leads to planes being in unexpected parts of the sky at different times, and all these new routes needing to be recalibrated to avoid any collisions.",
      "Nats says it does have measures to mitigate disruption, including specialist Met Office weather equipment which can help foresee the need for safety limits to be imposed, while pilots also have more tech on board to help them fly around bad weather patches and inform air traffic controllers of potential issues.",
      "What are your rights if a flight is cancelled due to poor weather?",
      "When flights are delayed or cancelled to or from a UK or EU airport, airlines have a duty to look after you, including:",
      "Providing meals and accommodation, if necessary, and getting you to your destination. The airline should organise putting you on an alternative flight, at no extra costYour airline must let you choose between either getting a refund or being booked on to an alternative flightFor short-haul flights, the threshold for compensation kicks in after a three hour delay - but is only payable if the delay is deemed within the airline's control, meaning you won't be entitled to it if your plane is held up by fog, a snow storm or security incident.",

    "title": "Trump's eyeing Greenland - but other Arctic investment is frozen",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 00:06:10 GMT",
    "summary": "While Trump eyes Greenland, Norway and Russia have put the brakes on their polar region investments.",
    "story": [
      "The Arctic recently made headlines after Donald Trump repeated his desire to buy Greenland. Trump cited national security interests, but for many the territory's vast mineral wealth is the main attraction. Yet economic development elsewhere in the vast polar region has ground to a halt.",
      "Working conditions in the Arctic Ocean are extremely challenging at this time of the year for Norwegian fisherman Sondre Alnes-Bonesmo.",
      "The sun last rose at the end of October, and it is not due to appear in the sky again until the middle of February.",
      "In addition to the endless dark, temperatures can plummet below minus 40C, and storms can bring vast waves.",
      "Mr Alnes-Bonesmo, 30, works two six-hour shifts a day, during five-week tours on a ship called Granit. One of the largest factory trawlers fishing in Arctic waters north of Norway, and off the coast of Greenland, it doesn't stop for winter.",
      "Unsurprisingly, he prefers the endless daylight of summer. \"I do like it when the weather is nice, as we're not sent crashing into the walls and such, the way we are during storms, when the waves can be fairly big,\" he grins in understatement.",
      "Mr Alnes-Bonesmo is a participant in the so-called Arctic \"cold rush\".",
      "A play on words with gold rush, it began in earnest around 2008 when a series of reports identified vast mineral and hydrocarbon reserves across the Arctic region. Reserves that, together with large fishing stocks, could continue to become more accessible as climate change reduces ice levels.",
      "This reduction in ice has also increasingly opened up Arctic sea routes, north of the Canadian mainland and Russia.",
      "So much so that, in the decade from 2013 to 2023, the total recorded annual distances sailed by ships in the Arctic Sea more than doubled from 6.1 million to 12.9 million miles.",
      "The hope in the longer term is that cargo ships can travel from Asia to Europe and the east coast of the US, through Arctic waters above Canada and Russia.",
      "But the question Mr Alnes-Bonesmo now asks himself is this \u2013 did he arrive too late?",
      "Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 much of the planned economic development of the Arctic region ground to a halt as relations between Russia and the West deteriorated.",
      "\"Russia had great plans in the Arctic,\" says Morten Mejlaender-Larsen, Arctic operation and technology director from Norwegian firm DNV. His company sets rules and standards for the maritime sector.",
      "\"They began constructing regional rescue centres complete with ships and helicopters to facilitate both destination shipping for gas, oil and coal projects in Siberia, as well as for shipping along the Northeast Passage [north of Russia].",
      "\"[But] since the invasion of Ukraine, international shipping in the Northeast passage has all but stopped, apart from a few Chinese ships,\" observes Mr Mejlaender-Larsen.",
      "He adds that Norway has also halted oil and gas exploration in the region. \"It's completely stopped,\" he says.",
      "\"We don't expect to see any further developments in the Barents Sea north of Bear Island.\" This small Norwegian island is some 400km (250 miles) north of Norway's mainland.",
      "Norway's scaled back ambitions in the Arctic have pleased environmentalists who have consistently warned about the impact of drilling for hydrocarbons on both wildlife and the fragile environment of the polar region.",
      "Last month Greenpeace welcomed the decision of the Norwegian government to stop the first round of licensing for deep sea mining in Arctic waters between Norway's Svalbard and Jan Mayen islands.",
      "Commentators say that while poor relations with Russia is a key reason why Norway is wary of ploughing money into Arctic projects, its interest in the polar region had already cooled.",
      "Helene Tofte, director of international cooperation and climate at the Norwegian Shipowners Association, says that in hindsight the outlook for shipping in the Arctic had been \"exaggerated\".",
      "She points out that despite the impact of climate change, the Arctic remains a difficult place in which to operate. \"Conditions in the Arctic can be extremely challenging, even when the absence of sea ice allows passage,\" she says.",
      "\"Large parts of the route are far from emergency response capacities, such as search and rescue, and environmental clean-up resources.",
      "\"Increased shipping in this area would require substantial investments in ships, emergency preparedness, infrastructure, and weather forecasting systems, for a route that is unpredictable and has a short operational season. At present, we have no indication that our members view this as commercially interesting.\"",
      "Mr Mejlaender-Larsen points to a \"belief that thanks to global warming there'll be summers up there. That'll never happen. If it's minus 40C and it gets 3C warmer, it's still not warm.\"",
      "Moreover, Prof Arild Moe, from Norwegian research group Fridtjof Nansen Institute, says the entire cold rush of the Arctic was based on exaggerated assumptions. \"The exuberance was excessive,\" says the expert on oil and gas exploration in the region.",
      "\"What the reports from 2008 referred to weren't actual reserves, but potential and highly uncertain resources, which would be risky, expensive, and difficult to locate and exploit.\"",
      "Regarding Trump's renewed interest in Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, authorities in Greenland and Denmark were again quick to reply that it was not for sale.",
      "Prof Moe says that Trump's \"crude and undiplomatic statement\" shows that the US under Trump eyes both security and economic interests in the island, including its \"rich mineral resources\".",
      "The Danish government also responded by announcing a huge increase in defence spending for Greenland.",
      "Elsewhere in the Arctic, Trump is expected to allow increased oil and gas exploration in Alaska, specifically in the resource rich Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.",
      "This 19 million acre expanse is the US's largest wildlife refuge, and back in 2020 Trump authorised drilling in one section of it.",
      "Meanwhile, Canada is continuing to build a deep-water port at Grays Bay, on the north coast of Nunavut, its most northern territory. Grays Bay is approximately in the centre of the so-called Northwest Passage, the Arctic sea route north of the Canadian mainland.",
      "Back on the Granit fishing ship, Mr Alnes-Bonesmo says that, while he has earned good money, fishing quotas continue to go down to try to preserve stocks in Norwegian Arctic waters.",
      "Nevertheless, he is philosophical. \"After a few years at sea I've grown more scared of the Arctic Ocean, but I've also come to respect and value it for all its power and beauty.\""

      "Car drivers will pay up to $9 (\u00a37) a day, with varying rates for other vehicles.",
      "\"The system has been in operation since midnight [05:00 GMT Sunday],\" Janno Lieber, CEO of the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), told reporters.",
      "Four hundred lanes of traffic are now covered by more than 1,400 cameras, with more than 110 detection points and more than 800 signs, he said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump is among those resisting the scheme, but Mr Lieber said he was confident agreements with the government would \"stand up to changes of administration\".",
      "The congestion zone covers an area south of Central Park, taking in such well-known sites as the Empire State Building, Times Square and the financial district around Wall Street.",
      "The scheme aims to ease New York's notorious traffic problems and raise billions for the public transport network.",
      "New York state Governor Kathy Hochul made the case for a congestion charge two years ago, but it was delayed and revised following complaints from some commuters and businesses.",
      "The new plan revives one scheme that she paused in June, saying there were \"too many unintended consequences for New Yorkers\".",
      "Most drivers will be charged $9 once per day to enter the congestion zone at peak hours, and $2.25 at other times.",
      "Small trucks and non-commuter buses will pay $14.40 to enter Manhattan at peak times, while larger trucks and tourist buses will pay a $21.60 fee.",
      "Hours after the scheme began traffic was moving briskly along the northern edge of the congestion zone at 60th Street and 2nd Avenue, the Associated Press reports.",
      "Many motorists seemed unaware that the newly activated cameras, set along the arm of a steel gantry above the street, would soon send a new charge to their E-Z Passes, it says.",
      "\"Drivers are going to start to see the toll charges appearing on their E-Z Pass bills in a few days,\" Mr Lieber said later.",
      "The charge has encountered plenty of opposition.",
      "\"Are you kidding me?\" New Jersey estate agent Chris Smith asked, speaking to AP.  \"Whose idea was this? Kathy Hochul? She should be arrested for being ignorant.\"",
      "The most high-profile opposition has come from Trump, a native New Yorker who has vowed to kill the scheme when he returns to office this month.",
      "Local Republicans have already asked him to intervene.",
      "Congressman Mike Lawler, who represents a suburban district just north of New York City, asked Trump in November to commit to \"ending this absurd congestion pricing cash grab once and for all\".",
      "A judge denied an 11th-hour effort on Friday by New Jersey state officials to block the scheme on grounds of its environmental impact on adjoining areas.",
      "Last year, New York City was named the world's most-congested urban area for the second year in a row, according to INRIX, a traffic data analysis firm.",
      "Vehicles in downtown Manhattan drove at a speed of 11mph (17km/h) during peak morning periods in the first quarter of last year, the report said.",
      "Among those welcoming the new scheme was Phil Bauer, a surgeon who lives in midtown Manhattan.",

      "Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%.",
      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",
      "\"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson.",

      "Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer.",
      "Last month she told Swedish television the situation at Northvolt was \"not a Swedish crisis\", rather a reflection of a Europe-wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector.",
      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",
      "The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview.",

      "The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefte\u00e5 will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO.",
      "\"It's 100% almost renewable energy up here\u2026 and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity.\"",
      "Skellefe\u00e5 Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources).",
      "\"The publicity around Northvolt is not helping now, of course. But I hope that that's just something that will be remembered as a little bump in the road, when we look back at this 10 years from now,\" says Mr Nordin.",

      "Women may be at risk of missing out on opportunities at work as they are less likely to go into the office than men, the boss of the world's biggest building society has said.",
      "Speaking to BBC R4's Today programme, Nationwide chief executive Debbie Crosbie said it was important for career growth to have a \"physical presence\" in the workplace.",
      "Ms Crosbie brought an end to the organisation's \"work anywhere\" policy for its 13,000 non-branch staff last December, asking most full-time workers to come in twice a week instead.",

      "Nationwide rebrands and commits to the high street",

      "\"We find, certainly at Nationwide... that men are more likely to come into the office than women\".",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 00:05:18 GMT",
    "summary": "A row has erupted over a long-standing US visa programme, We looked into the figures behind the scheme.",
    "story": [
      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Critics say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "What happened under Trump?",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",
      "The vast majority of those approved come from India.",
      "The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens.",
      "About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",
      "About 70% of those who enter the US on H-1B visas are men, with the average age of those approved being around 33.",

      "\"There's more of that content online now [porn] so you can easily access it at a young age, which might influence how young people feel about condoms,\" said Mason.",
      "The sessions delivered by YMCA for young people include information on the C-Card scheme, which is a supported service across the UK, providing training on sexual health awareness, as well as free condoms, lubrication and dental dams.",
      "\"Condoms are really expensive, so it's a fantastic service to make them accessible, but also acceptable, and not some weird, dark hidden corner of the pub toilets,\" said Ms Peart.",
      "She is aware of fears the scheme could be seen as encouraging under-age sex but said research suggested more information at a younger age was likely to delay that.",
      "\"We try and persuade them to wait until they're at least 16. But if they are going to, then we can make sure they can do it in a safe way.\"",
      "The World Health Organization recently reported that 56% of 15-year-old girls in Wales, and 49% of boys, had not used a condom the last time they had sex.",
      "It comes amid a rise in STIs in the past year: 22% in chlamydia, 127% in gonorrhoea, and 14% in syphilis.",
      "Ellie Whelan and Megan Grimley, both 21, from Cardiff, said the move away from condoms surprised them given more of their peers had turned away from the pill or coil as forms of contraception.",
      "Use of long-acting, reversible contraception - such as an intra-uterine device (IUD) or hormonal implant - has fallen 22% in the last five years, with terminations up by a third.",
      "\"I think it's a lot to do with false information or bad experiences - or people are too scared to get information and talk about it,\" said Megan.",
      "How do I know if I have an STI?",
      "Testing is the best way to find out if you have a sexually transmitted infection.",
      "The Sexual Health Wales service offers a free test kit for over-16s which can be sent and returned by post or collected from community venues.",
      "Sexual health clinics across Wales also provide testing and support.",
      "Infections can take several weeks after contact to show up in a test.",
      "HIV takes seven weeks to be detected, hepatitis C and B can take 12 weeks or more, and chlamydia and gonorrhoea can show up within a fortnight.",
      "But it is not solely an issue for young adults. Ms Peart said the YMCA sessions explain the range of contraception available, but at the back of most classrooms is a teacher also taking notes, as the gap in STI knowledge in particular is on \"a national, societal level\".",
      "It is also reflected in the rise in sexually transmitted infections in the over-40s, according to Public Health Wales's Zoe Couzens, as people enter new relationships after divorce or bereavement.",
      "\"And I'm not putting an upper age on that \u2013 we've had a 72-year-old with chlamydia,\" she said.",
      "\"It's about ensuring the message goes out across all age groups.",
      "\"But the issue for the women especially is that pregnancy is not the concern they have any more, so they're not going to take the precautions. So that's another group that needs to be educated.\"",
      "Arguably the rise in cases is a result of increased testing, as the free \"test and post\" service by Public Health Wales has made that far more accessible.",
      "\"Chlamydia is the most common [STI] in Wales, followed by gonorrhoea - and while it's all treatable with antibiotics, gonorrhoea is a nasty little bug that is developing resistance to antibiotics.",
      "\"Twenty years ago we had two cases of syphilis in Wales - last year it was 507.",
      "\"It tends to be a silent infection, but it can develop into neuro syphilis and cause cardiac problems.\"",
      "Given other STIs can cause infertility, pain and pelvic inflammatory disease, the notion they are easily remedied is one many professionals wish to tackle.",
      "How do you get a sexually transmitted infection?",
      "Chlamydia is passed on through unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex, sharing sex toys, or genital-to-genital contactGonorrhoea can be spread through oral, vaginal or anal sex without a condom, or the sharing of sex toysHIV is passed in infected body fluids such as semen, vaginal or rectal secretions, blood and breast milk, and the most common way to pass it on is through sex without a condom or sharing drug equipmentSyphilis is transmitted during unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex, or through sharing sex toys, and it is also possible to pass on from mother to babyHerpes is highly contagious and is passed by skin-to-skin contact like vaginal, anal or oral sex, sharing sex toys, or oral sex with someone who has a cold soreGenital warts is shared by skin-to-skin contact, including vaginal or anal sex and by sharing sex toys.",

      "Genital warts is shared by skin-to-skin contact, including vaginal or anal sex and by sharing sex toys.",
      "What are the symptoms of an STI?",
      "Chlamydia: often described as a silent infection as most people do not have obvious signs. Symptoms can include pain when urinating, unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or rectum. Women may get pain in the tummy, bleeding during or after sex and in between periods, while men can have pain and swelling in the testicles.",
      "Gonorrhoea: some people have no symptoms, but those who do may have a yellow or green discharge; a burning sensation when they wee and pain or tenderness in the stomach.",
      "Syphilis: many people won't have symptoms. But for those that do, it will start with a small, painless ulcer in the mouth or genitals, followed by a rash. If left untreated, the infection can result in visual impairment, dementia and death. In pregnancy it can also lead to miscarriages, still births and infant mortality.",
      "Herpes: again, some people have no symptoms, but they can include small blisters that burst to leave red, open sores around the genitals, rectum, thighs and buttocks. Blisters and ulcers can also be on the cervix; it can cause vaginal discharge, pain when having a wee, as well as general flu-like symptoms.",
      "Genital warts: in women they start as small, gritty-feeling lumps that become larger. In men the warts will feel firm and raised, with a rough surface. They can be single warts or grow in clusters.",

      "One of the UK's most promising new guitar bands, English Teacher, have kicked off the countdown of the top five on the BBC's annual list of music's rising stars.",
      "The Leeds quartet have been voted in fifth place in BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025 poll \u2013 with a panel of 180 music industry experts choosing them as one of the acts with \"the best chance of mainstream success\" in the next 12 months.",
      "They got well on their way last year. In September, the band beat pop stars like Charli XCX and CMAT to win the Mercury Prize for their debut album, This Could Be Texas.",
      "The record deals in sharp portraits of life in sleepy northern towns, where the background hum of racism, loneliness and deprivation is thrown into sharp relief by sublime scenery and lifelong friendships.",
      "Their music, meanwhile, is constantly surprising \u2013 full of shifting time signatures, needle-point guitar riffs and soaring melodies that are simultaneously odd and captivating.",
      "\"We never really set out with an aim to create something specific,\" says guitarist Lewis Whiting. \"But, that's the fun part, right? Trying to make something new and interesting.\"",
      "Chappell Roan and Ezra Collective on BBC Sound of 2025 list",
      "Find out all about BBC Sound of 2025",
      "Indie band English Teacher win Mercury Prize",
      "They say the acclaim they've received so far still doesn't feel real. \"Where we come from, this just doesn't happen,\" says frontwoman Lily Fontaine.",
      "\"I keep telling people that I feel like I'm living in a simulation.\"",
      "\"It does feel dream-like,\" adds Whiting.",
      "\"Best year of my life, craziest year of my life.\"",
      "Over the last 12 months, the group have played more than 100 gigs in 16 countries, rising steadily up festival bills as they go, and surviving on \"willpower, laughter and Red Bull\".",
      "Along the way, they told journalists their origin story more times than they care to count. Eventually, they got tired of the \"boring\" reality (they met studying music at Leeds Conservatoire) and started inventing less prosaic stories.",
      "\"We said we were distant relatives who met at a wedding 20 years ago in Leeds,\" laughs Fontaine.",
      "\"They put us at the odd table. We were sort of like the outcasts,\" adds Whiting, continuing the story.",
      "\"But we really clicked,\" says Fontaine. \"We started talking about Shakira and how we wanted to be like her, then they played Hips Don't Lie at the disco and we said, 'We should start a band'.\"",
      "English Teacher, it should be noted, sound nothing like Shakira. They started out as a dream-pop outfit called Frank and, after the addition of Whiting on guitar, began to lean into a more angular, post-punk sound.",
      "Key references include Radiohead, Sonic Youth and Pavement. \"But, famously, we don't agree on our favourite bands,\" says Whiting.",
      "One of their first releases was a demo of The World's Biggest Paving Slab, which they put out independently in 2020.",
      "Like many of their songs, it draws inspiration from Fontaine's hometown of Colne in Lancashire, where the titular paving stone resides outside the town hall.",
      "The lyrics reference a host of local heroes \u2013 from Life On Mars actor John Simm to novelist Charlotte Bronte \u2013 juxtaposing the colour and vigour of the town's history against the social problems it faces in the current day.",
      "It's an itch she continues to scratch throughout the band's catalogue, addressing social deprivation and political mismanagement (\"Can the river stop its banks from bursting? / Blame the council, not the rain\") alongside themes of identity, self-doubt and emotional turbulence.",
      "Incredibly, she only started writing relatively recently. As a teenager, she'd been in a wedding band with her friend, playing Amy Winehouse and Adele covers. She didn't consider composing until she applied for university.",
      "\"I wrote my first song for the audition,\" she recalls. \"It was awful, but it worked. I got a place to study singing and performance, but I very quickly switched to composition, because I was suddenly spending all my time writing songs.\"",
      "Defying convention",
      "During that period, English Teacher's members \u2013 completed by drummer Douglas Frost and bassist Nicholas Eden \u2013 circled each other on Leeds' live music scene, playing with various other bands before settling on their current line-up.",
      "Their breakthrough came with 2021's R&B, their official debut single, where Fontaine addresses the challenge of being a woman of colour fronting an indie band: (\"Despite appearances, I haven't got the voice for R&B\").",
      "It's a perception she struggled with herself as a teenager, frustrated that she wasn't capable of \"the kind of the vocal runs that the black singers I looked up to were able to do\".",
      "As a frontwoman, she developed her own style \u2013 a droll mixture of sprechgesang and her fluttering, airy upper register. But she still encountered prejudice.",
      "\"There'd be times where I told people that I made music, and they'd give a certain expression when I said that it was guitar music or it was indie music,\" she says.",
      "\"There were a lot of small comments after gigs. People would come up and say, 'Oh, that's not what I was expecting at all',\" adds Whiting.",
      "Fontaine is careful not to make too big an issue of it. \"I think I've got a lot of privilege, because I'm quite a light skinned woman of colour,\" she says.",
      "\"I think if I was dark skinned it would be even harder - but it did affect me, not seeing people who looked like me in bands.",
      "\"I think it made me start a band later in life. Maybe I would have started when I was a teenager, and not when I was leaving university.\"",
      "English Teacher's early songs gained an audience during the first wave of the Covid pandemic \u2013 which meant they didn't get to play a gig together until the lockdown ended.",
      "Their first show was as part of an all-day mini festival in May 2021, where the audience still had to be seated and socially distanced.",
      "\"Those first gigs were kind of jarring,\" Whiting recalls. \"It was quite strange because everything up 'til then felt very online, which doesn't feel as tangible. And then when you go and play a gig, it's like, 'Yeah, this is actually going somewhere.'\"",
      "\"We were so nervous, too,\" says Fontaine. \"I feel like it was only late into 2023 that we really found our confidence.\"",
      "By that point, they were deep into recording their debut album with Italian producer Marta Salogni (Bjork, Depeche Mode, MIA) \u2013 including new, more polished versions of R&B and The World's Biggest Paving Slab.",
      "The band say they put \"immense pressure\" on themselves to perfect the record, fixating on its push-pull dynamics, adding extra layers of context, and experimenting with new instruments.",
      "\"It was an intense time in our personal lives, trying to get it finished and out. We gave a lot to it,\" says Whiting.",
      "\"Recording your first album is just a huge opportunity,\" continues Fontaine. \"I think we were very aware of that.\"",
      "The hard work paid off.",
      "Record Collector Magazine called This Could Be Texas \"one of the most confident and charismatic debuts in years\". The Mercury Prize judges said the band's \"winning lyrical mix of surrealism and social observation... displays a fresh approach to the traditional guitar band format\".",
      "The quartet are endearingly amazed that anyone paid attention at all.",
      "\"I wasn't sure that it would connect with people, because the lyrics are quite specific to the area I grew up in,\" says Fontaine.",
      "Instead, it was the bigger themes \u2013 of leaving home and finding your place in a world that's \"going up in flames\" \u2013 that helped them find an ever-growing audience.",
      "On The World's Biggest Paving Slab, Fontaine mockingly describes herself as \"the world's smallest celebrity\" \u2013 a lyric that's rapidly becoming obsolete.",
      "\"I'm not the smallest, but certainly not the biggest,\" she laughs.",
      "\"In the alphabet of celebrity, I'm probably on the X-list.\"",
      "One act from the BBC Sound of 2025 top five will be revealed on Radio 1 and BBC News every day this week, culminating with the winner on Friday."

      "Plot twists are happening already in season three of the BBC's The Traitors, as one contestant from London lifted the lid on her charming - but false - Welsh accent.",
      "Charlotte, 33, has lived in London her whole life but has decided to pretend she is from Abergavenny, in Monmouthshire, to maximise her chances of survival.",
      "\"I've been putting on a Welsh accent because my mum's from Wales, it's one of the most trustworthy accents,\" she told the camera on New Year's Day.",
      "But is a Welsh lilt really the key to gaining people's trust as a faithful in the show - and perhaps in life in general?",
      "Winkleman: 'New twists have turned The Traitors on its head'",
      "Banished Traitors star: 'I was out of my depth'",
      "Is commuting changing Welsh accents?",
      "The reality show centres around traitors selected by host Claudia Winkleman, who must deceive and gain the trust of other contestants, who are faithfuls.",
      "Dr Mercedes Durham, a sociolinguistics professor at Cardiff University, led research into the likeability of the Welsh accent and found people associate the accent with being friendly - but not necessarily clever.",
      "\"They genuinely appreciated it, they find it funny, attractive and friendly, but they didn't take it seriously or associate it with intelligence,\" said Dr Durham.",
      "But friendliness and trustworthiness are linked, says Dr Durham, so there could be a method behind the mask.",
      "Inspiration may have come from previous Welsh contestants Andrew Jenkins from Talbot Green, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and Amanda Lovett, from Swansea, who both eliminated faithfuls and narrowly missed out on The Traitors trophy in series one and two.",
      "Amanda sailed through the first series in 2023, with her opponents swearing hand on heart that the humble character could never be a traitor.",
      "\"I think the Welsh accent is very relaxing, it definitely played a role in people trusting me in being a motherly figure,\" said Amanda.",
      "\"Maybe they didn't think I would be sharp enough, or the type capable of murdering, that I was too naive maybe,\" she added.",
      "\"But I don't know if I agree with pinching our Welsh accent,\" Amanda laughed, \"we are very proud of our Welsh heritage\".",
      "Amanda said Traitors fans may even be wary of Welsh contestants this time, as both her and Andrew took their charming accents to the very end.",
      "Andrew agreed the Welsh accent is trustworthy, but said he would have spotted Charlotte's fake effort from a mile off.",
      "\"Oh, I think it's terrible, she keeps dipping in and out of her London accent,\" he said.",
      "\"I just think the Welsh are lovely, friendly, trusting people, I went in and was authentic.",
      "\"I tried to make as many friends as I could and be myself to be honest, I think that helped.\"",
      "Charlotte is not the only Welsh person in the game this year, as Cardiff-based Elen is from north Wales and Leanne is from Holywell in Flintshire.",
      "There is a lot of variation in Welsh accents, and people tend to relate more to certain regions, according to Dr Durham.",
      "\"The main association of people outside of Wales is the south Wales valleys and Barry Island in the Vale of Glamorgan, thanks to Gavin & Stacey,\" she said.",
      "\"Possibly more than the other two contestants, it's an accent outsiders will associate the most with Wales.\"",
      "The Welsh accent has enticed new contact centres to set up or expand in Wales in recent years, including Starling Bank, Capital on Tap, Veezu and TCH Group.",
      "One firm chose Newport, over Middlesbrough, Teesside, to open its funeral planning business, because of the \"consoling\" and \"empathetic\" Welsh accent.",
      "Sandra Busby, chief executive of Cnect Wales, which supports contact centres, said Wales has always been an attractive location for many reasons with accents \"playing their part\".",
      "\"Over the years the Welsh accent always comes in the top three regional accent surveys for friendliness and for being trustworthy,\" she added.",
      "What accents rival the Welsh one?",
      "The Welsh accent took top spot for the most relaxing accent across the UK in 2024, in a study by the University of Sheffield and Spa Seekers.",
      "The public have a soft spot for all Celtic accents, Irish and Scottish included, thanks to their friendly connotations, said Dr Durham.",
      "Received pronunciation, also known as Queen's English, does well to gain people's trust, but mainly because of its social prestige.",
      "But Birmingham, Liverpudlian and Cockney accents are often not favoured and can be found in the lower half of popularity polls.",
      "Trust in accents can change over time depending on our social circles and daily relationships, according to a study by Ilaria Torre from Plymouth University.",
      "Participants heard either a standard southern English accent or a \"lesser trusted\" Liverpudlian accent, and attitudes changed depending on first impressions and judgements.",
      "If a person who spoke in a \"trusted\" accent went on to behave fairly, then this first impression of trustworthiness increased.",
      "Yet if they went on to behave unfairly, they were seen as less trustworthy than those who had both a lesser trusted accent and behaviour.",
      "Participants \"were punishing them, so to speak, for not living up to the participants' expectations\", said Ms Torre.",
      "On the opposite side, those who were seen as sounding \"untrustworthy\" with a Liverpudlian accent but acted nicely were able to reverse negative preconceptions.",
      "So, while a Welsh lilt might start you off in good stead as a trusted contestant, the odds are still all to play for.",
      "With a mixture of different accents from across the UK, how will the Welsh ones do?",
      "You can find out - the first three episodes of The Traitors are now on BBC iPlayer, and the series airs on BBC One at 21:00 GMT on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.",

      "For a while, the siblings generated the same sort of fevered excitement as The Beatles.",
      "When the band flew into Heathrow Airport in 1973, 10,000 teenage fans packed the roof gardens at a nearby office block to see them arrive. Part of the balcony railing and wall collapsed amidst a crowd surge, slightly injuring 18 women.",
      "On their departure, hundreds of fans mobbed their limousine. A reporter for the New York Times said \"they were lucky to escape alive\", while the Guardian said the scenes almost led to a ban on pop groups entering the UK via Heathrow.",

      "At the same time, Donny and Marie Osmond were offered their own TV variety show, which became a massive hit in the US and was screened by BBC One in the UK.",
      "As a result, the band went on hiatus and ultimately dissolved in 1980, although they regularly reformed for county fairs and reunion tours over the coming decades.",

      "Later this month, two multiplex cinemas within 20 miles of each other will close down.",
      "But while one of them will get a new lease of life with a new operator, one will be demolished to be replaced by a storage site.",
      "What is happening in Northampton and Kettering is symptomatic of cinema closures across the UK, but there are also new sites and operators opening.",
      "So what is the state of play within the cinema industry?",
      "What cinemas have been closing?",
      "The Point in Milton Keynes was one of the UK's first multiplex cinemas when it opened in 1985. The site showed its last film in 2015, and last year it was saved from demolition.",
      "The city got two new multiplex cinemas, which was a pattern repeated elsewhere, where older sites have been replaced by more modern venues.",
      "But during the pandemic, cinema chains began to suffer as screens were closed for several months. When they reopened, there were drops in both the number of films and audiences.",
      "In 2023, both Empire Cinemas and Cineworld went into administration.",
      "Irish chain Omniplex bought five of the Empire Cinema sites. It then announced it would close the cinema in Ipswich, but that decision was later reversed.",
      "Cineworld was unable to find a buyer and instead last year announced that a number of sites would close, including in Bedford.",
      "Last month the company announced a further six sites would close \u2013 including in Northampton \u2013 and said it would pull out of a leisure centre in Colchester.",
      "The site in Northampton will be converted into an Odeon. That operator also recently opened a site in Peterborough.",
      "But the Odeon in Kettering is set to be demolished following its closure later this month after the landlord said it was no longer viable.",
      "Why have cinemas been closing?",
      "Despite some huge hits, including Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine, 2024 was not a good year financially for films, says Charles Gant, the awards/box office editor at Screen International.",
      "\"There was a feeling that we would get back to pre-pandemic levels relatively quickly [but] it became apparent it wasn't an instant recovery,\" he says.",
      "\"The recovery has completely stalled and that is to do with the release calendar, which was impacted by the Hollywood strikes.\"",
      "In 2023, both writers and actors in the United States took industrial action, which halted the production of several major films and delayed their release.",
      "\"We haven't had consistent releases of big tentpole films until we got to November,\" says Mr Gant.",
      "Richard Clifford, programmer at the two-screen Northampton Filmhouse, agrees and says 2024 was \"a challenging year in general for the industry\".",
      "He says the November releases of Gladiator II, Wicked, and Paddington in Peru \"certainly helped every cinema around the world\".",
      "Mr Clifford, who has also worked for Cineworld and Vue, adds that audiences \"haven't seen the wider range of films\" with fewer documentaries, British films and foreign films released.",
      "Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, says: \"Some cinemas which would've been economic to run before the pandemic, before recent [financial] challenges, are no longer economic and so they're being closed in many cases.\"",
      "Some of those will be reopened by other operators, he says, \"but inevitably it will mean that some communities lose their local cinema, [which] really does have an impact\".",
      "Is smaller the future?",
      "Mr Gant says cinemas face rising costs as many industries do, in particular with energy and staffing.",
      "\"They are large buildings and some of them are probably not built in the most energy-efficient manner,\" he says.",
      "\"Some of the stuff that got built in the 1990s are these of out-of-town sheds.\"",
      "But new cinemas are opening and Mr Clapp says operators recognise they need to \"offer something more than people would get at home\".",
      "\"The general trend is to more reclining sofas [and] a more upscale experience, and part of that is a move away from the large auditoriums with hundreds of seats,\" he says.",
      "He adds that rather than looking only at capacity, cinemas want to increase occupancy or, \"put simply, bums on seats\".",
      "\"That's the general direction of travel for many in the UK cinema sector and indeed in European and global cinemas,\" he says.",
      "But he adds: \"There is an audience out there still for the big-screen experience.\"",
      "Mr Clifford says a smaller venue such as Northampton Filmhouse \u2013 which has two screens, each with a capacity of about 90 \u2013 can have \"a different kind of audience that comes on a regular basis\".",
      "\"They come here so regularly. They come and see everything we put on,\" he says.",
      "Will 2025 be better for cinemas?",
      "Mr Clapp says 2025 looks \"something like the normal film slate\" for large studio films.",
      "\"What still needs to build back is the next tier and more diverse films \u2013 the films that appeal to a broader audience than [the] mainstream blockbusters,\" he says.",
      "He adds that his members \"from the large multiplexes down to the smaller, independent cinemas\" are confident about both this year and next year.",
      "Mr Clifford agrees, saying that 2025's \"line-up is stellar compared with [2024]\".",

      "As Bradford begins its year as UK City of Culture, it is not just trying to show a different face to the rest of the country - it's also hoping to win over doubters in the city.",
      "One of the first productions is a radio play written by broadcaster Nick Ahad, and its theme is Bradford's battered reputation.",

      "And it's not just the opinions of people outside the city. Dr Paul Sullivan of Bradford University has carried out research into the stigma. His hometown is Ireland's Cork, a place where its comedians make fun of its high opinion of itself. Bradford, he discovered, was rather different.",
      "\"What surprised me was... the almost lack of civic pride.",
      "\"Even reading the local newspaper, some of the headlines can be very upbeat, and beneath it are just loads of comments that, 'This is a disaster, it'll just never work, Bradford is doomed'.\"",
      "But Dr Sullivan is a fan.",
      "\"I love the city. I fell in love with Bradford straight away. I love the city centre, the beautiful countryside.  And it was really quite a surprise to me to see that level of negativity.\"",

      "However, in the face of this antagonism, something is, he feels, developing.",
      "In his recent interviews with residents, \"there was a real sense of pride, in their sense of belonging\".",
      "It was a topic Ahad and Wrightson also raised. Diversity has become utterly unremarkable.",
      "\"I'm Bangladeshi and English. My wife's Pakistani and Indian, and you sort of don't have to explain here,\" says Ahad.",
      "\"Like 100%,\" Wrightson adds. \"I'm mixed heritage, my mum's Indian, my dad's English. And growing up, it wasn't a big deal.\"",

      "\"Emily Bronte, you just take it for granted that she's from Bradford,\" says Wrightson.",
      "For her, City of Culture has been a moment to look at what makes the city special.

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 08:46:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The show has returned to our screens for a third series, but with a few key changes to the format.",
    "story": [
      "This article includes some discussion of the first episode of The Traitors, including format changes, but does not contain major spoilers such as who the new traitors are or who gets murdered or banished.",
      "The Traitors has returned to our screens, with its usual combination of murders, missions and midnight meetings. The number of contestants this year has risen to 25 - ranging from a former British diplomat to even a member of the clergy.",
      "\"I just love a good murder,\" says the priest, Lisa, in the opening episode, revealing that she's \"had a chat\" with the man upstairs about the ethics of taking part. But, she concludes: \"Any self-respecting murder mystery needs to have a priest in it.\"",
      "Wednesday's launch saw her joined by a retired opera singer, beautician, landscaper, swimming teacher, window cleaner, financial investigator and British Army soldier.",
      "But although the players are different, and a few key changes have been made to the format (more on those in a sec), the show's core principles remain.",
      "\"The absolute beauty of the Traitors is the game itself,\" says presenter Claudia Winkleman. \"I get messages all the time from people playing it in theatres, on film sets, in schools, even a Traitors wedding - I agree, too much.\"",
      "The presenter says she feels \"completely terrified\" by the launch of series three - fearful both of accidentally revealing spoilers and also whether audiences will like the show as much as the previous series. \"I don't exhale until January 24th,\" she jokes.",
      "\"It is such an honour to be in that round table and to see how it unfolds, so I feel incredibly lucky and love it, and you just don't want people to be disappointed, because the people who like [the show] are so vocal.\"",
      "The Traitors is one of the BBC's biggest success stories of recent years. The first UK series was watched by a total audience of around five million, the second by more than eight million.",
      "A true watercooler hit, it is one of the few shows in the streaming age which viewers feel they are watching at the same time as everyone else.",
      "Format changes",
      "Several tweaks have been made to the central format this year, although it's not yet clear how big an impact they'll have.",
      "One early twist in this series is somewhat reminiscent of the first, as three contestants are made to leave before they've even entered Ardross Castle in Inverness.",
      "\"When they turn up, they assume they know the way the game is going to go, and it is our job to explain that it isn't,\" Winkleman says of the changes.",
      "\"There are twists throughout, but they have to be different from series one and two. They've come to hopefully walk away with up to \u00a3120,000, but also to play a game, and I like the fact that they don't know which way it's going to go.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether there might be a way back later in the series for the contestants who sacrificed themselves, as there was in series one for Amos and Kieran, the two players who were ejected at the castle doors.",
      "Perhaps more significantly, Winkleman tells the new crop that the few contestants who make it to the final this year will no longer reveal whether they are a faithful or traitor as they are banished.",
      "Instead, the remaining players will have to rely solely on their instincts about whether or not any Traitors are left, ultimately making their decision of when to end the game harder.",
      "\"It underlines... the main body of the show, which is trust and gut instinct,\" Winkleman says. \"You're going to like the end, I hope, that's all I can say, it throws it all on its head.\"",
      "It's hard to predict how this might impact the final in practice. Had this rule been in place last year, it may actually have made it easier for Harry to win, as Andrew's last-minute attempt to bring his fellow traitor down before being banished might not have aroused as much suspicion with Jaz.",
      "\u2018Winning formula\u2019",
      "Critics were broadly positive about Wednesday\u2019s series launch, but some noted the show will have to continue innovating to keep things fresh.",
      "\u201cThe Traitors, like its players, must constantly adapt, so the brutality must be upped,\u201d said Carol Midgley of the Times.",
      "\u201cBut I think it needs to twist the screws a lot more than this if it wants to hold a candle to last year's show.\u201d",
      "The Independent\u2019s Nick Hilton noted: \u201cThis third season of The Traitors is, naturally, more self-aware. Contestants know the various gameplans employed, know that the producers keep several cards up their sleeves.",
      "\u201cThere is a sense that competitors want to guarantee more screentime by playing games within the games, presumably at the encouragement of the production team.\u201d",
      "But the Evening Standard\u2019s El Hunt said: \u201cAll of the key ingredients are already in place. Though it's initially hard to get to know 22 contestants, the leaders, court jesters, and potential threats are all beginning to emerge already. A winning formula strikes again.\u201d",
      "In the opening episode, one of the new contestants shrewdly suggests that more of the Traitors this year might be women, after those in the last series were predominantly men.",
      "\"There is a little bit of that, and you'll see how it works out for us,\" Winkleman tells journalists, giving nothing further away.",
      "But, the presenter adds, she does not choose the traitors by herself. Instead, she explains: \"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "There are two sisters taking part this year, although they are open from the beginning about their relation to each other - unlike some contestants in previous series.",
      "Their casting is part of the wider effort to make sure the show is always slightly different, with new people, new personality types, and new relationships.",
      "\"In any entertainment format, you can't repeat,\" Winkleman reflects. \"You want to give the people who are playing and watching, something new. So yes, two sisters, let's see how that works.\"",
      "Some of the latest crop have come up with innovative new tactics - one contestant is attempting to maintain a fake Welsh accent throughout her time in the game.",
      "\"I get it, if you're playing a game of deception, why not start at the beginning?\" Winkleman reflects.",
      "The presenter's biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables. \"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head.\"",
      "By her own admission, Winkleman gets emotionally involved in the series and keeps in touch with contestants after they've been on the show.",
      "\"I love them, each and every one, all of them,\" she smiles. \"I was texting Maddy from series one the other day, I sent a message to Charlotte's aunt.",
      "\"Matt from series one wanted to show me his new skill - sorry, that sounds like code, it was skateboarding. Aubrey sends me pictures of his living room.",
      "\"But I stay in touch with all of them because I'm so grateful to them for playing the way they do. And these people [in the new series] are extraordinary game players.\"",

      "Even if we don't know it, he muses, all of us are always addressing this type of conflict in some form.",
      "An interview with Dafoe is never dull; he's a thoughtful and intelligent actor, who, for the best part of 50 years, has combined big Hollywood successes (Spiderman movies, John Wick, Born on the Fourth of July) with the arthouse films he relishes.",
      "He dropped out of university in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to join an experimental theatre company but, since those early days, his voracious work ethic and intense appeal as perhaps the greatest living character actor have seen him in more than 130 films. His debut, Heaven's Gate, was in 1980. Seven years later, he was first nominated for an Oscar for the Vietnam war film Platoon.",
      "Dafoe was crucified as Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ and cut off his ear as Van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate. He spent six hours a day in the prosthetics make-up chair to morph into a reclusive scientist in Poor Things, and he has even been a version of a vampire himself, in Shadow of the Vampire.",
      "While the original 1922 silent movie by F.W. Murnau pioneered some early special effects, including superimposing the image of Nosferatu on to a ship to create a frightening ghostly glow, Eggers goes for an earthy take, grounded in history and reality.",
      "There were 2,000 real live rats on set.",

      "Don't expect well-trodden vampire movie fare in this Nosferatu. Count Orlok doesn't have the symmetrical fanged teeth we're used to. This vampire isn't a suave seducer in a high-collared black cloak.",
      "Dafoe says Eggers wanted to get back to \"a time when people actually believed in vampires\". To do this, \"he went for a much more folk-based vampire\".",
      "The actor believes this is \"why this Orlok in the movie is so very different to anything we've ever seen before\".",
      "The film is packed with talent popular with Gen Z (Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult, Emma Corrin). The cast - and the status of the 1922 original in the film firmament - means Eggers' movie had achieved a cult-like following even before its release.",
      "In the US, that was on Christmas Day. I asked whether Dafoe thought a movie about a bloodsucking, diseased creature and the horror he unleashes on a 19th Century German town was the perfect antidote to a day of family festivities.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 15:56:57 GMT",
    "summary": "The pair were married for two years - but it has taken four times that time to reach a divorce deal.",
    "story": [
      "Arguably the modern era's biggest A-list couple, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were married for two years - but it has taken eight years since announcing their divorce to finally reach a deal. Why did it take four times as long as the marriage itself to settle?",
      "One part of the answer is that it's a particularly messy divorce, complicated by  bitter legal disputes involving their children and a French vineyard they bought together.",
      "Some of that still needs to be resolved in what Jolie's lawyer has called \"a long ongoing process\".",
      "Celebrity lawyer Chris Melcher told BBC News the divorce settlement had taken an unusually long time.",
      "\"This is much longer than any divorce we typically see,\" he said.",
      "\"But they initially had fights over custody and then it revolved around this winery they own together, and that's been the focus of their fight over the last few years.\"",
      "Many celebrities want to divorce quickly and move on, Melcher explained.",
      "\"A lot of times in a case of this magnitude we can settle it within six months, a year at the very most. Eight years is really a sign of something more going on.",
      "\"It's an inability to let go and a desire to really harm the other.\"",
      "Kate Daly, co-founder of online divorce company Amicable, told the BBC that such a case was very different from an average divorce.",
      "\"It's an industry... [they can afford] lots of expensive lawyers,\" she said. \"Most people couldn't afford for it to take eight years. It's an industry and it's a bad example - we have to distance [normal] people from that kind of narrative.\"",
      "Romantic beginning",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, got together after meeting on the set of the film Mr & Mrs Smith, which was released in 2005.",
      "\"Because of the film, we ended up being brought together to do all these crazy things, and I think we found this strange friendship and partnership that kind of just suddenly happened,\" Jolie told Vogue in 2007.",
      "Both had been married before - Pitt to Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie to actors Jonny Lee Miller (1996 to 2000) and Billy Bob Thornton (2000 to 2003).",
      "Jolie and Pitt share six children together.",
      "Jolie adopted Maddox from Cambodia in 2002 a few months after he was born. Pitt later adopted him after he and Jolie had begun their relationship.",
      "In 2005, the pair adopted daughter Zahara from Ethiopia when she was a few months old.",
      "The couple's first biological child, Shiloh, was born in Namibia in 2006. Earlier this year, it was reported that Shiloh had submitted a petition to a court to drop Pitt from her name.",
      "Their son Pax was adopted at the age of three from Vietnam in 2007, and twins Knox and Vivienne were born in 2008.",
      "Beginning of the end",
      "The couple made their final red carpet appearance together in November 2015 for a film they both starred in, By the Sea. It was about an unhappily married couple, and was written and directed by Jolie.",
      "The couple rarely discussed their relationship but when promoting the film, Jolie told The Telegraph: \"Brad and I have our issues.",
      "\"We have fights and problems like any other couple. We have days when we drive each other absolutely mad and want space, but the problems in the movie aren't our specific problems.\"",
      "The news that Jolie was filing for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\", came as a shock to many in September 2016.",
      "'Vitriolic hatred'",
      "It emerged that she filed for divorce a day after an incident on board a private plane.",
      "Pitt was initially alleged to have hit son Maddox, then 15, on the flight from France to Los Angeles. The FBI and social workers examined the claims, but neither took any action. Pitt denied wrongdoing.",
      "Then in 2022, legal papers from the vineyard dispute revealed that Jolie accused Pitt of drunkenly attacking her and two children during the flight.",
      "At the time, a source close to the actor told the BBC that her claims were false.",
      "Speaking to Vogue in 2020, Jolie said she left Pitt for the \"wellbeing\" of her family.",
      "\"It was the right decision,\" she said. \"I continue to focus on their healing.\"",
      "In an interview with GQ in 2017, Pitt spoke about his decision to quit drinking and smoking marijuana, saying the split had been a \"huge generator for change\".",
      "Regarding the divorce, Pitt said he and Jolie had decided to abandon a path of \"vitriolic hatred\" and work together to sort out their issues, adding that they were committed to resolving matters amicably and privately.",
      "Custody battle",
      "Their attempts to reach agreements over the divorce and custody of their children appeared to be acrimonious and protracted.",
      "In 2019, a judge declared that the couple were officially single, but that the divorce still needed to be finalised.",
      "They reached a custody deal in 2018, but that appeared to fall apart. In 2021, Pitt was granted joint custody after a court battle, but the private judge who oversaw the case was later removed because he did not disclose his business relationships with Pitt's lawyers.",
      "That raised the prospect of a fresh custody case, but nothing has been made public.",
      "And while the divorce saga may now be drawing to a close, there is another legal battle still ongoing - to do with the vineyard.",
      "Pitt and Jolie bought Chateau Miraval together in 2008 and got married in its small chapel in 2014.",
      "But Jolie sold her share to a spirits manufacturer owned by a Russian oligarch, according to Pitt's lawsuit. He is suing his ex-wife for selling her stake in the estate, saying they agreed not to sell their shares without the permission of the other. Jolie has not publicly commented.",
      "Emotional fallout",
      "Few details of the divorce proceedings have been revealed. Private judges are often hired in the US to mediate disputes between divorcing celebrities for privacy reasons.",
      "Their children are now all aged between 16 and 23, and showbiz journalist Jeanne Wolf emphasised the emotional fallout.",
      "\"It's been a very emotional and complicated divorce settlement. It's taken a big toll on the children and the couple involved,\" she said.",
      "\"They have tried very hard not to let too many details known about what went on in that marriage.\"",
      "Jolie's lawyer highlighted the passage of time in his statement on Monday. \"This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The government pledged to cut the list of patients waiting more than 18 weeks for treatment in England by nearly half a million over the next year.",
    "story": [
      "More NHS hubs will be set up in community locations and there will be greater use of the private sector to help reduce hospital waiting lists in England, the prime minister says.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer also promised to give patients more choice over where they get treated as he unveiled plans to tackle the NHS backlog.",
      "The waiting list currently stands at 7.5 million with four in 10 already having waited longer than the target time of 18 weeks. Sir Keir unveiled a new pledge to cut the list of patients waiting more than 18 weeks by nearly half a million over the next year.",
      "Doctors' leaders welcomed the plan, but expressed concern over whether there were enough staff to achieve the goals being set.",
      "The plan includes:",
      "Expanding the existing network of community diagnostic centres and surgical hubs so more treatment can be done outside of hospitals Making it easier to exercise patient choice - this was introduced 20 years ago but only a quarter of patients believe they are offered a choice of where they get treatedA new deal with the independent sector so more NHS patients can get treated in private clinics with a particular emphasis on joint operations and gynaecological procedures",

      "Making it easier to exercise patient choice - this was introduced 20 years ago but only a quarter of patients believe they are offered a choice of where they get treated",
      "A new deal with the independent sector so more NHS patients can get treated in private clinics with a particular emphasis on joint operations and gynaecological procedures",
      "Sir Keir said: \"NHS backlogs have ballooned in recent years, leaving millions of patients languishing on waiting lists, often in pain or fear. Lives on hold. Potential unfulfilled.",
      "\"This elective reform plan will deliver on our promise to end the backlogs.",
      "On expanding use of the private sector, Sir Keir acknowledged \"some would not like this\".",
      "But he added: \"I'm not interested in putting ideology before patients.\"",
      "A key Labour election pledge, now included in the government's six main priorities, is for 92% of patients to begin treatment or be given the all-clear within 18 weeks by the end of this Parliament.",
      "This has been an official NHS target for some time, but has not been met since 2015. Currently, only 59% of patients meet the 18-week target, with three million people waiting longer.",
      "The new promise is to reach 65% by March 2026, which, according to the government, would reduce the backlog by more than 450,000.",
      "The aim of the community diagnostic hubs is to get patients treated more quickly, closer to home and without relying on hospitals. Officials say these centres will provide up to half a million extra appointments each year.",
      "GPs will also be able, where appropriate, to refer patients directly to these centres without requiring a prior consultation with a specialist doctor.",
      "More surgical hubs will be created to focus on common, less complex procedures, such as cataract surgeries and some orthopaedic work. These hubs are ring-fenced from other parts of the hospital to ensure operating theatre time is not lost if there are emergency cases.",
      "The new plan also says that one million unnecessary appointments per year will be freed up for patients who need them. This will be made possible by abolishing automatic review appointments after treatment and only offering them to patients who request them.",
      "'Boosting convenience'",
      "Officials say the extra appointments created will be in addition to what was promised by Labour before the election. That pledge was for 40,000 more appointments per week, or two million a year, to be created within the first year.",
      "This compares with a normal annual total of more than 100 million appointments. Ministers have confirmed that work on this pledge began soon after the election.",
      "Plans for patients to use the NHS App to monitor and book consultations and test results, with greater control over where they are treated, have already been announced. The goal is to make the system more efficient and reduce the number of missed appointments.",
      "NHS England Chief Executive Amanda Pritchard said: \"The radical reforms in this plan will not only allow us to deliver millions more tests, appointments, and operations, but do things differently too \u2013 boosting convenience and putting more power in the hands of patients, especially through the NHS app.\"",
      "The overall waiting list for NHS appointments, procedures, and surgeries in England stands at just under 7.5 million.",
      "No target level has been set in the plan, but ministers say that the waiting list will inevitably fall as measures to meet the 18-week benchmark take effect.",
      "The funding for NHS England has been set for the upcoming year, but the additional money needed to support extra activity in hospitals will be outlined in the government's spending review later this year.",
      "'Frustrated'",
      "Professor Phil Banfield, of the British Medical Association, expressed doubt over whether the plan could be delivered.",
      "\"Doctors have been just as frustrated as their patients by the lack of facilities to deliver care and want to bring waiting lists down,\" he said.",
      "\"But the reality is that without the workforce to meet constantly rising demand, we will not see the progress we all hope for.\"",
      "Prof Banfield's concerns were echoed by Dr Jeanette Dickinson, Chair of Council of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges.",
      "\"We know that these things can make a difference, we know that these have been tried in small areas, piloted, and do make a difference,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"It's doing it at pace and at scale, having the staff available, having the estate available, the operating theatres, the consulting rooms, the capacity to deliver those changes.\"",
      "Ed Argar, Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary, said it was the Conservatives who \"revolutionised\" the diagnostic process by rolling out 160 community diagnostic centres.",
      "He said the government's plan is \"another announcement that makes clear after 14 years in opposition, the Labour Party have no new ideas of their own for the NHS \u2013 despite promising change\".",
      "\"Patients cannot wait for more dither and delay from the government who promised so much, and so far have delivered so little,\" he said.",

      "When you think of new year's resolutions, a 75-day workout might not top the list.",
      "But that's what's going viral this year as people take to TikTok to document their progress.",
      "First, the ground rules: you stick to a healthy diet with no cheat meals or alcohol.",

      "Easy, right? Well in case you fancy your chances, two people who have finished the challenge told us what it's really like - and experts have cautioned that if it sounds a bit strict, something more relaxed might work better for you.",

      "Meet 29-year-old Devamsha Gunput, who completed 75 Hard last March whilst working full-time as a digital consultant for a large corporation.",
      "\"It was definitely hard,\" she tells the BBC. \"Also living in Edinburgh, it was dark, wet and cold and you had to do one of the workouts outside.\"",
      "Devamsha says one of the most challenging aspects of 75 Hard was \"setting boundaries\" when visiting her South Asian family so that she could be strict with her diet.",
      "\"Having to exercise twice a day and be strict on my diet were really uncomfortable and new areas for me to tackle, because I hadn't had that conversation before,\" she says.",
      "But since completing the challenge, she's noticing the lasting impacts so far.",
      "\"I exercise a lot more regularly, my reading habits and my relationship with food have transformed,\" she says.",
      "While 75 Hard has turned into a viral craze over the last few weeks, it was actually invented back in 2019 by author and podcaster Andy Frisella.",
      "He said on his podcast that he's spent \"20 years figuring out how to master mental toughness\" and has used this knowledge to create the plan.",
      "He is not a qualified personal trainer or doctor and does not give guidance over what classifies as a healthy diet in the plan, but it's understood to mean balanced and nutrient-rich.",
      "More relaxed variations of the challenge have been popping up on social media recently, called 75 Soft and 75 Medium, in which participants can have the odd alcoholic drink and unhealthy meal while still doing exercise and reading.",
      "'My family and friends were blown away'",
      "Sophie Deakins, 27, also completed 75 Hard last year while working as an assistant manager at a London cinema.",

      "She overhauled her diet, cutting out chocolate and sweets but allowing for anything with naturally occurring sugar, like fruit and honey.",
      "Sophie also made all her meals at home and tracked her protein and water consumption using an app.",
      "She found it useful to give herself small rewards like getting her nails done or buying a new book, but the hardest part was socialising for her, as this would revolve around eating out and drinking alcohol.",
      "To solve this, she explains: \"I was very vocal about what I was doing, so there was no pressure when I got there [to social events] but there was still real self-discipline to do it.\"",
      "Since completing it, she's stuck to some part of the plan such as not eating out or buying unnecessary coffees and cakes, helping her \"save so much money\".",

      "Pros and cons of the challenge",
      "But the challenge isn't for everyone, which is something strength and conditioning coach Tana von Zitzewitz wants those who are considering it to bear in mind.",
      "\"You need a lot of time, not only for the workouts, but for reading the book - it seems a lot to try and cram into one day,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I definitely think there are elements people can implement, committing to 45 minutes of daily movement, being conscious of drinking more water and reducing screen time, but you need to be aware of what's involved,\" Tana adds.",
      "Another aspect is motivation. \"There is so much pressure for people to transform their lives at this time of year,\" she says.",
      "She suggests finding a way to \"challenge yourself while also being kind\", so that you add fun and value to every day, without exercise and food feeling like a punishment.",
      "From a medical perspective, it is difficult to determine whether 75 Hard is beneficial.",
      "NHS GP Sam Whiteman points out that, because \"it has not been studied\" in a clinical setting, it cannot claim to change your life in any way.",
      "He also says that it would need to be compared to a more basic regime, to see if that could achieve the same results.",
      "\"If it's a way for people to get out and be active then I am all for it, but if it's a question of whether this is better than going to the gym three times a week or going for a run once a week and eating healthily, then I am not sure,\" he adds.",
      "Hitting certain criteria isn't the intention of 75 Hard's founder, Mr Frisella. He doesn't set any rules that involve losing a certain amount of weight, for example.",

      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC on Sunday: \"The NHS needs investment, but it also needs reform, otherwise we will not break this cycle of annual winter crises.\"",
      "The plan will set out how the government intends to meet one of its key election pledges - for more than nine in 10 patients to have their treatment or be signed off within 18 weeks of a referral by the end of this parliament.",

      "Announcing the plan, he said the move would shift the NHS \"into the digital age\" and help cut waiting times \"from 18 months to 18 weeks\".",
      "The app would \"put patients in the driving seat and treat them on time\", and they would be \"put in control of their own healthcare\", the health secretary said.",
      "Action will also be taken to tackle missed appointments, which can be costly for the health service, including an artificial intelligence pilot to help pinpoint patients that may need extra help to attend.",

      "Some of these features are already available on the NHS app and a website Manage Your Referral. But officials say just 8% of bookings are made through these platforms.",
      "Other plans include expanding a scheme for GPs to discuss some cases with\u00a0 hospital specialists before making referrals to ensure patients are treated in the right setting.",
      "The current Advice and Guidance Scheme has resulted in 50% of cases being directed to more appropriate care rather than being put on long waiting lists and so reducing pressure on hospitals. These include some ear, nose and throat conditions.",
      "GPs will also be able to refer patients with certain conditions directly for tests or scans without the need to see a consultant first. The aim is to reduce waiting times and remove those who are given the all clear from waiting lists.",
      "Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of NHS England, said using technology would revolutionise access to healthcare and put \"patients in the driving seat of elective care\".",
      "But the chairman of the BMA council, Professor Phil Banfield, said the focus should be on patients most in need rather than a \"wasteful obsession\" with artificial targets.",
      "He said there was a danger patients without access to tablets and smartphones would be alienated.",

      "It comes as health officials warn about the impact of the very cold weather expected this weekend on vulnerable patients, and the health system.",
      "Prof Julian Redhead, NHS national clinical director for urgent and emergency care, said the figures show \"the pressure from flu was nowhere near letting up before we headed into the new year, skyrocketing to over 5,000 cases a day in hospital as of the end of last week and rising at a very concerning rate\".",
      "\"With what looks like an extreme cold snap expected right across England ahead of the weekend, we know the low temperatures can be dangerous for those who are vulnerable or have respiratory conditions,\" he added.",

      "'Lack of beds'",
      "Hospitals have put extra beds in place this year to help deal with the pressure on admissions created by flu and other winter viruses, including Covid and norovirus (the winter vomiting bug).",
      "NHS chiefs say they have also added more support for people who frequently need emergency services, with more care being delivered outside hospitals.",
      "Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the NHS had done \"all it could\" in advance to reduce risk to patients, but the service remained in a position of \"national vulnerability\" with \"intense pressures\" starting to impact local services.",
      "Figures for last week show some 12,200 patients were left waiting in ambulances for more than an hour before they could be cared for in hospital.",
      "Dr Adrian Boyle, head of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was a very difficult time for both patients and staff.",
      "\"What we are seeing is ambulances are frequently stuck outside emergency departments, and our emergency departments are full.\"",
      "He said there was \"an enormous amount of avoidable harm - excess deaths that shouldn't be happening\".",
      "\"Flu is the straw that is breaking the camel's back - because we have this chronic lack of beds within our hospitals, and we don't use those beds properly because we haven't reformed social care,\" he added.",
      "His criticism comes on the day the health and social care secretary set out plans for reforming adult social care in England, although they are unlikely to be delivered before 2028 at the earliest.",
      "A number of hospitals across different regions in England have restricted visits and asked patients and visitors to wear face masks to prevent further spread of flu.",

    "story": [
      "Wes Streeting has defended the timescale for reforming adult social care in England, with proposals on its long-term funding unlikely to be delivered before 2028.",
      "The health and social care secretary is promising \"to finally grasp the nettle on social care reform\", but said on Friday the process \"would take time\".",
      "The independent commission, chaired by Baroness Louise Casey, will begin work in April but is not due to publish its final report until 2028.",
      "Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of health think-tank The King's Fund, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the timescale \"feels far too long\" and urged the government to look at measures that could be implemented sooner.",
      "Other councils and care providers have said the final 2028 report is too long to wait for the long-term reform of vital services already on their knees.",
      "The commission comes alongside immediate government plans to get care workers to do more health checks, and a funding boost for services to help elderly and disabled people remain in their homes.",
      "It will be split into two phases, the first of which will report by mid-2026 and identify critical issues and recommend medium-term improvements.",
      "But phase two, which will look at how to organise care services and fund them for the future, will not report until 2028 - a year before when the next election must be held.",
      "The government's ultimate aim is \"a new National Care Service, able to meet the needs of older and disabled people into the 21st Century\", said Streeting.",
      "He rejected the suggestion the government is pushing social care reform into the long grass, saying it is \"already acting\" and had \"done a lot in the first six months\".",
      "Ms Woolnough told the Today programme the government should \"get on and do a whole range of things that [it] can now\" and then accelerate the timetable for further reform.",
      "\"Measures to help the workforce, measures to improve quality and so on, you don't need a commission to enable you to do a whole load of stuff,\" she added.",
      "Social care means help for older or disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, medication and eating.",
      "Only those with the most complex health needs get social care provided free by the NHS, so most care is paid for by councils.",
      "In England, only people with high needs and savings or assets of less than \u00a323,250 are eligible for that help, leaving a growing number of people to fund themselves.",
      "Some face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result.",
      "Streeting said he had invited opposition parties to take part in the commission \"to build a cross-party consensus to ensure the National Care Service survives governments of different shades, just as our NHS has for the past 76 years\".",
      "He told BBC Breakfast there was \"genuine desire\" from across the political spectrum \"to work together\", calling it \"a big moment for social care\".",
      "When asked if proposed funding for the sector was enough, the health secretary said public services were \"on their knees\" and \"there's so much more that needs to be done\", but the process \"would take time\".",
      "Baroness Casey - who has led several high-profile reviews, including into homelessness, the Rotherham child exploitation scandal and the Metropolitan Police - said she was pleased \"to lead this vital work\". The commission will report to the prime minister.",
      "She is viewed in government as being straight-talking, with good cross-party links, and as someone who gets things done.",
      "Even so, drawing up a plan for a National Care Service that meets the needs of an ageing population and is affordable is perhaps her biggest challenge yet.",
      "There is agreement the care system has been in crisis for years, struggling with growing demand, under-funding and staff shortages.",
      "The problem has been getting political agreement on how overdue reform will be funded.",
      "In 2010, Labour plans to fund social care were labelled a \"death tax\" in that year's election, and Conservative plans were called a \"dementia tax\" in the 2017 election.",
      "There have also been numerous commissions, reviews and inquiries over the past 25 years that have failed to bring change.",
      "The 2011 Dilnot Commission plan for a cap on individual care costs came closest, making it into legislation, but was not implemented.",
      "It was finally scrapped by the new Labour government last summer because it said the last Conservative administration had not set aside the money to fund the reform.",
      "However, providing enough support for people in their own homes, care homes and supported living remains a pressing issue.",
      "The care systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are slightly more generous, but all are facing the pressures of growing demand and squeezed finances.",
      "The crisis in care: Who pays?",
      "The government had promised a National Care Service in its manifesto, although provided little detail.",
      "Streeting told the Today programme that, for him, the service is \"about national standards - consistent access to higher quality care for older and disabled people everywhere in the country\".",
      "The independent commission will work with users of care services, their families, staff, politicians and the public to recommend how best to build a care service to meet current and future needs.",
      "Melanie Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said the \"timescales are too long\".",
      "She believes many options on how to reform adult social care are already known and worries that \"continuing to tread water until a commission concludes will be at the detriment of people's health and well-being\".",
      "The Conservatives welcomed the government's commission but urged ministers to reach a quicker conclusion.",
      "Edward Argar, the shadow health secretary, told the BBC's World At One said Streeting should \"be brave, be bold, be ambitious, speed up those discussions and try to get to a conclusion and a way forward before 2028\".",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he was \"bewildered\" by the planned length of the commission and told broadcasters his party \"had expected that it could be done and dusted within a year\".",
      "About 835,000 people received publicly funded care in 2022, according to the King's Fund. The charity Age UK estimates there are about two million people in England who have unmet care needs - and according to workforce organisation Skills for Care, while 1.59 million people work in adult social care in England, there are currently 131,000 vacancies.",

      "A new deal with the independent sector so more NHS patients can get treated in private clinics with a particular emphasis on joint operations and gynaecological procedures",
      "Sir Keir said: \"NHS backlogs have ballooned in recent years, leaving millions of patients languishing on waiting lists, often in pain or fear. Lives on hold. Potential unfulfilled.",
      "\"This elective reform plan will deliver on our promise to end the backlogs.",
      "On expanding use of the private sector, Sir Keir acknowledged \"some would not like this\".",
      "But he added: \"I'm not interested in putting ideology before patients.\"",
      "A key Labour election pledge, now included in the government's six main priorities, is for 92% of patients to begin treatment or be given the all-clear within 18 weeks by the end of this Parliament.",
      "This has been an official NHS target for some time, but has not been met since 2015. Currently, only 59% of patients meet the 18-week target, with three million people waiting longer.",
      "The new promise is to reach 65% by March 2026, which, according to the government, would reduce the backlog by more than 450,000.",
      "The aim of the community diagnostic hubs is to get patients treated more quickly, closer to home and without relying on hospitals. Officials say these centres will provide up to half a million extra appointments each year.",
      "GPs will also be able, where appropriate, to refer patients directly to these centres without requiring a prior consultation with a specialist doctor.",
      "More surgical hubs will be created to focus on common, less complex procedures, such as cataract surgeries and some orthopaedic work. These hubs are ring-fenced from other parts of the hospital to ensure operating theatre time is not lost if there are emergency cases.",
      "The new plan also says that one million unnecessary appointments per year will be freed up for patients who need them. This will be made possible by abolishing automatic review appointments after treatment and only offering them to patients who request them.",
      "'Boosting convenience'",
      "Officials say the extra appointments created will be in addition to what was promised by Labour before the election. That pledge was for 40,000 more appointments per week, or two million a year, to be created within the first year.",
      "This compares with a normal annual total of more than 100 million appointments. Ministers have confirmed that work on this pledge began soon after the election.",
      "Plans for patients to use the NHS App to monitor and book consultations and test results, with greater control over where they are treated, have already been announced. The goal is to make the system more efficient and reduce the number of missed appointments.",
      "NHS England Chief Executive Amanda Pritchard said: \"The radical reforms in this plan will not only allow us to deliver millions more tests, appointments, and operations, but do things differently too \u2013 boosting convenience and putting more power in the hands of patients, especially through the NHS app.\"",
      "The overall waiting list for NHS appointments, procedures, and surgeries in England stands at just under 7.5 million.",
      "No target level has been set in the plan, but ministers say that the waiting list will inevitably fall as measures to meet the 18-week benchmark take effect.",
      "The funding for NHS England has been set for the upcoming year, but the additional money needed to support extra activity in hospitals will be outlined in the government's spending review later this year.",
      "'Frustrated'",
      "Professor Phil Banfield, of the British Medical Association, expressed doubt over whether the plan could be delivered.",
      "\"Doctors have been just as frustrated as their patients by the lack of facilities to deliver care and want to bring waiting lists down,\" he said.",
      "\"But the reality is that without the workforce to meet constantly rising demand, we will not see the progress we all hope for.\"",
      "Prof Banfield's concerns were echoed by Dr Jeanette Dickinson, Chair of Council of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges.",
      "\"We know that these things can make a difference, we know that these have been tried in small areas, piloted, and do make a difference,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"It's doing it at pace and at scale, having the staff available, having the estate available, the operating theatres, the consulting rooms, the capacity to deliver those changes.\"",
      "Ed Argar, Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary, said it was the Conservatives who \"revolutionised\" the diagnostic process by rolling out 160 community diagnostic centres.",
      "He said the government's plan is \"another announcement that makes clear after 14 years in opposition, the Labour Party have no new ideas of their own for the NHS \u2013 despite promising change\".",

      "An inquiry into abuse in Rotherham found 1,400 children had been sexually abused over a 16-year period, predominantly by British Pakistani men.",
      "An investigation in Telford found that up to 1,000 girls had been abused over 40 years - and that some cases had not been investigated because of \"nervousness about race\".",

      "The report found there was no evidence of \"widespread\" child sex abuse in those settings, or of a cover-up by the council, but the review did point out other serious failings among safeguarding services in the area.",
      "The Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse (IICSA), which published its final report in 2022, knitted several of these inquiries together alongside its own investigations.",
      "Professor Alexis Jay, who led the inquiry, said in November she felt \"frustrated\" that none of its 20 recommendations to tackle abuse had been implemented more than two years later.",

      "Asked why the Tory government had not conducted a national public inquiry into such gangs, Philp pointed to IICSA but added \"I don't think it was, frankly, as comprehensive on this topic as it should have been\".",
      "Philp said: \"We need a proper national inquiry to look at all of these issues across all of the towns affected. And I'm afraid to say there are something like 15 to 25 different towns involved, covering thousands and thousands of victims.\"",
      "Questions about the conduct of local authorities, the police and social care needed answering on a national scale, he argued. Philp also did not rule out the inquiry looking at the role of Sir Keir Starmer, who was director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013.",
      "He said an inquiry should examine why perpetrators in \"grooming gangs and rape gangs\" appeared to be \"overwhelmingly of South Asian background\".",

      "In July, Oldham Council, which is led by a Labour minority administration, asked the Home Office to lead a fuller inquiry into historical abuse in the area.",
      "Phillips rejected the request, pointing to council-run inquiries in Rotherham and Telford, which she argued had greater legitimacy because they were locally commissioned and delivered.",
      "In a letter to the council, the safeguarding minister said she recognised the \"strength of feeling\" but believed it was \"for Oldham Council alone to decide to commission an inquiry into child sexual exploitation locally, rather than for the Government to intervene\".",
      "Conservative Oldham councillor Lewis Quigg said the decision was \"just not good enough\".",
      "An Oldham Council spokesman said: \"Survivors sit at the heart of our work to end child sexual exploitation.",

      "The Business and Trade Select Committee said binding timeframes were needed, with any money arising from missed deadlines going to the claimants if they weren't met.",
      "The committee also called for the Post Office to be removed from its role in the compensation schemes, and asked for more transparency over how much it was paying for lawyers.",
      "The government said it was \"working tirelessly\" to settle claims \"at a faster rate than ever before\".",
      "Committee chairman Liam Byrne MP said: \"The fault lies with the Post Office, but ultimately government is the shareholder in the Post Office and acts on our behalf\".",
      "The government is already looking at the Post Office's role in the compensation schemes.",

      "One of those accused, Seema Misra, was eight weeks pregnant when she was wrongfully imprisoned.",
      "Speaking to the BBC after she was made an OBE in the King's New Year list for her role in campaigning for justice, she said it was an acknowledgement of the \"scale of the injustice and scandal\".",

      "It found the application process was akin to a second trial for the victims, adding that lawyers administering the schemes were making millions whilst the vast majority of the money set aside for redress had still to be paid out.",

      "Only around \u00a3499m of the budgeted \u00a31.8bn has been paid out so far, to more than 3,000 claimants. The committee said that meant 72% of the budget had still not paid.",

      "Byrne added that hard deadlines and fines would help the government and the Post Office to \"get a grip\".",

      "The Post Office told the select committee in December that legal fees had made up \u00a3136m of the cost of administering the Post Office-led schemes since 2020, which is around 27% of the compensation paid out.",

      "Currently, councillors must attend meetings in person to be able to vote and contribute to a quorum.",
      "However, ministers are looking to ease the rules to allow remote and hybrid meetings, with members having full voting rights even when they are not physically present in the room.",
      "According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, North Yorkshire Council suggested up to half of its members could choose to attend council meetings remotely over a year, but that it recognised it was important to hold some meetings in person",
      "It said: \"This council values physical presence for the majority of meetings but does not consider central government should mandate how physical and remote meetings should be handled.",
      "\"It was noted during lockdown that having informal remote meetings was extremely helpful and in the future, it would be beneficial if those remote meetings could make binding decisions.\"",
      "It added: \"Having the flexibility for members to attend remotely would be a very welcome option for this Council which is the geographically largest in the country.",
      "\"Allowing remote meetings in appropriate circumstances can reduce mileage, travel time, costs and reduce carbon emissions.\"",
      "However, on the issue of proxy voting, when a councillor would ask a colleague to vote on their behalf, the authority said it was not in favour.",

    "summary": "Newly-released files show ministers had concerns about more workers coming to the UK when the EU expanded.",
    "story": [
      "Senior ministers urged the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair to delay granting employment rights to eastern and central European workers when the EU expanded in 2004, newly released files have revealed.",
      "In February that year, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw pointed out that Britain was alone amongst the bigger EU members in offering a \"concession\".",
      "The concession meant people from Poland and other newly joined EU countries would be able to work in Britain after 1 May.",
      "Almost all the other large states would not allow this for two years: only Italy was undecided. Smaller EU countries, aside from Ireland, had work permit schemes which would limit numbers.",
      "Papers from the National Archives - which have been released now they are 20 years old - show Straw proposed a six-month delay for the UK.",
      "He said: \"I believe we could be faced with a very difficult situation in early May\".",
      "He warned the UK could \"be forced to revoke the concession in the least propitious of circumstances\".",
      "His letter was copied to other senior ministers, and the then-deputy prime minister John Prescott supported Straw.",
      "Prescott wrote that he was \"extremely concerned\" about the potential impact on social housing.",
      "He was also worried that many workers would come to London and the South East, and unable to find decent housing would \"resort to sharing overcrowded housing in poor conditions\".",
      "But David Blunkett, the then-home secretary, argued the economy needed the \"flexibility and productivity\" these new workers could provide.",
      "Eight eastern and central European countries joined the EU in 2004, including Poland. According to the government, the number of Polish nationals living in the UK increased from around 69,000 to around 853,000 over the next decade.",
      "Blair asked whether the UK could have work permits, but instead the Home Office speedily drew up a \"workers registration scheme\".",
      "That scheme required A8 workers - those from the eight new member states - to pay a fee and register their employment in a specific job. Failing to do so would incur a significant fine.",
      "From May 2004 onwards, No 10 monitored these registration numbers week by week.",
      "The government was particularly worried because it had publicly estimated that only 13,000 new workers a year would come to Britain after the EU expanded.",
      "The files show that Kate Gross, one of the private secretaries at No 10, wrote to the prime minister on 2 July 2004.",
      "She enclosed a briefing note for the press which would say \"the influx of new arrivals predicted by the media simply hasn't arrived\", even though that 13,000 had been exceeded.",
      "She explained that while 24,000 people had registered with the scheme, most had been living in the UK before 1 May.",
      "Kate Gross's memo notes that most were young, aged 18-34 - and there was no evidence of them \"exploiting the benefits system\". Blair scrawled \"that is the key\" by the side of that statement.",
      "However Kate Gross noted \"the key elephant trap is how these figures relate to previous HO [Home Office] projections\".",
      "If applications continued to increase, she wrote, the number of new arrivals would hit \"50-60,000 by May 2005\".",
      "The next set of figures for the scheme showed a drop, and a briefing paper to No 10 said: \"It looks like we are over the peak in applications.\"",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Directorate \"should be congratulated on implementing the workers registration scheme in short order\", it said.",
      "The problem was, the scheme wasn't providing an accurate record.",
      "The self-employed did not have to register, for example, which excluded many building workers like carpenters.",
      "And there was little enforcement.",
      "The shortcomings of the workers registration scheme were exposed in late 2005, when according to the WRS there were only 95 Polish plumbers in the whole of the  UK.",
      "In 24 hours the Daily Mail found 95 Polish plumbers in London alone.",
      "Over the next few years hundreds of thousands of A8 nationals, mostly Polish, moved to the UK.",

    "story": [
      "Visitors' books from Downing Street signed by some of the most famous figures in recent history have been made public for the first time.",
      "World leaders and members of the Royal Family are among the names in the three red leather, gilt-tooled volumes being released by the National Archives, spanning 1970 to 2003.",
      "The names of visitors to No 10 are not made public so the books provide a valuable record of who had private conversations with prime ministers.",
      "One of the volumes was offered for sale earlier this year by a London auction house who said it had been rescued from a waterlogged basement by a former civil servant, but the government blocked the sale saying it was Crown property.",
      "Dr Jack Brown, lecturer at King's College London described the books as \"wonderful... historical novelties\".",
      "As the first resident researcher at No 10, he explained the book wasn't left on a table for everyone to sign, but only offered to special guests.",
      "Some left private messages, especially to Margaret Thatcher, who spent more than a decade in Downing Street from 1979 to 1990.",
      "In 1989, then US President George Bush wrote: \"With Respect, Friendship and Gratitude for this Relationship that means so much\".",
      "Dr Brown said he was referring to the so-called special relationship between Britain and the US, rather than a personal bond, but President Bush's wife Barbara also signed, adding: \"Me. Too.\"",
      "Relations with fellow EU leaders were not always so smooth.",
      "That same year the French Prime Minister Michel Rocard wrote: \"It always is an extraordinary occasion to confront with the Prime Minister, especially when we agree, even when we disagree. Thank you very, very much.\"",
      "\"That was wonderful,\" said Dr Brown, \"I think you did confront with Thatcher... particularly if you were a socialist French prime minister, towards the end of her term.\"",
      "The visitors' book seems to have been introduced by the Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath, who was in office from 1970-1974.",
      "Among the earliest to sign it were members of the Royal Family, who left just their first name, including in March 1971 an entry which reads \"Charles\", from the then Prince of Wales.",
      "Many Asian and African leaders signed the first volume. One name from 12 July 1971, in uneven letters reads: \"General I Amin Dada\" \u2013 Idi Amin of Uganda.",
      "Amin had taken power in a coup six months before, and the brutal nature of his regime wasn't yet clear to Western governments. In 1971 he was invited to Buckingham Palace, as well as Downing Street.",
      "Just a year later, Amin expelled tens of thousands of Ugandan Asians, giving them only 90 days to leave the country. Many held British passports and came to settle in the UK.",
      "Among the world leaders - including Jimmy Carter, Ferdinand Marcos and Indira Gandhi - is an anomaly, four pages packed with signatures of well-known British women of 1978 - Anna Ford, Cleo Laine, Prue Leith and Janet Street-Porter.",
      "The latter was a well-known face on TV, but Janet Street-Porter remembers being intimidated by the event, a reception to mark 50 years of equal suffrage.",
      "\"I always appeared cocky and self-assured,\" she said, \"but to be invited to Downing Street for something so historically important was quite a formidable experience for me.\"",
      "While there were many receptions in Downing Street, the book was brought out for very few \u2013 including to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Downing Street in 1985.",
      "The Queen and Prince Philip signed, as did six other prime ministers, including the increasingly frail Harold Macmillan, Lord Stockton.",
      "The book captures the changing times: President Mikhail Gorbachev signed in April 1989, when he came for a state visit with his wife, Raisa.",
      "Early the following year, the leaders of the newly independent Eastern European countries visited No 10 - including Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, who added his trademark little heart.",
      "The book seems to have been rarely used by John Major and Tony Blair, though there is one striking message from early 2002, a few months after the 9/11 attacks.",
      "Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani wrote: \"Mr. Prime Minister, we are eternally grateful for your support for us at a time of great peril, you will always hold a special place in the minds and hearts of all New Yorkers and Americans.\"",
      "Dr Brown said \"despite being a seemingly semi-random collection of autographs\", the book was a \"story of Britain's place in the world\" told in these signatures over time.",
      "Janet Street-Porter, who has visited Downing Street several times since 1978, thinks all guest lists should be published.",

    "story": [
      "Find yourself in a marquee on a Saturday afternoon where there's a bar with wine and beer, gags being cracked, and speeches being made and you might think it's a wedding.",
      "But the marquee at Chelmsford City Racecourse on Saturday was packed with more than 1,000 people who had turned up to a Reform UK rally, where the best man's speech and jokes were provided by the MP Lee Anderson, the crowd sang 'Here We Go' as he took the stage and the star turn who arrived to his own thumping sound track was Nigel Farage.",
      "The crowd seemed to be having fun, even though it is plain some of those gathered there have been drawn in because they are deeply disgruntled with the status quo in the UK.",
      "One grandfather told me he felt \"emotionally angry even talking to you and keeping my composure\", citing illegal immigration and the grooming scandal as the reason for his unhappiness.",
      "A newly joined party member said he was there because Farage \"is a breath of fresh air\" and current politicians were failing to give younger generations a chance to get on.",
      "And a Reform councillor from Suffolk said people were cross about the idea of pylons going everywhere as the government plans more green energy. They might have listed different reasons. But that obvious unhappiness is what seems to be driving the rapid growth of Reform UK.",
      "As if by magic, when Farage was on stage the party's membership passed 170,000, and two hours later the party told me they had added another 1,000.",
      "With new financial backers and a rapidly growing base, Reform UK does, at this moment, seem to have what they brag is the big momentum. Farage claims he's putting the party on the path to win the next election.",
      "The Reform leader has never been short on ambition \u2013 it goes far beyond his obvious desire to be a political celebrity, which he achieved long ago, and beyond the UK leaving the EU, in which his decades of agitating played a huge part.",
      "The mood in a packed room in Chelmsford made it clear Farage and his growing party reckon they can shake everything up.",
      "And he's not hanging around in 2025. He has made two big speeches over the past few days, is the first UK political leader of the year to appear on a public platform \u2013 and he'll be appearing on our Sunday programme this week.",
      "But how realistic is that ambition to win power \u2013 and when will we know whether Reform's growing support is here to stay?",
      "Tactics and controversy",
      "Since the election, Labour's sagging popularity and the Tories' doldrums have made space that Farage, and his four fellow Reform MPs, have stepped into. The party has used his tried and tested techniques, talking about issues in a way that other politicians just won't. He would say those politicians are too cautious or politically correct \u2013 they'd say they have a responsibility not to stir up tensions.",
      "I'll always remember intakes of breath around Westminster when he unveiled his poster depicting refugees on the continent and claiming immigration was at \"breaking point\" during the EU referendum in 2016. Some other Leave campaigners said it made them \"shudder\" and it was even reported to the police. But did it stir up a conversation about the EU that Farage wanted? It certainly did.",
      "Years later, now with a perch in Parliament, Mr Farage was met with howls of criticism when he questioned the police's assessment of what had gone on in the Southport attacks. His willingness to jump into controversy is part of the brand - and for his backers, part of the appeal.",
      "Trump and Musk",
      "Who'd know a thing or two about that? Enter Farage's two pals across the Atlantic \u2013 one of them, Donald Trump, will in two weeks again be the most powerful man in the Western world, and the other is a tech billionaire, Elon Musk.",
      "From the outside it's hard to tell how deep these friendships are \u2013 whether the Reform gang lurk on the fringes waiting to be invited for brief chats, or whether over time Musk and Trump will donate political fire power (or even cash through Musk's UK business).",
      "But without question, these unusual bromances give more oxygen to Reform UK, and for the leader of a small UK party to have a direct line to the White House and the richest man in the world is hard to ignore. Can you imagine Ed Davey hanging out with Jeff Bezos? Or John Swinney spending time with Mark Zuckerberg?",
      "Making headlines is not, of course, the same as getting people on side, and while these high-wattage friendships are a draw for some voters, they risk hurting Reform with others.",
      "Musk, who appears to have a fixation with the UK, on Friday accused PM Sir Keir Starmer of being complicit in the \"rape of Britain\" by not going after gangs grooming and abusing vulnerable young girls \u2013 it's hard to think of a more offensive charge, and Labour's Wes Streeting branded it \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\".",
      "Musk also suggested safeguarding minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\" after she rejected a request for the Home Office to order a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham. Phillips had said the council should commission a local inquiry instead, as happened in Rotherham and Telford. In a further post on X on Saturday, Musk said \"what an evil human\" in response to a video showing a previous appearance by Phillips on Question Time.",
      "And in the last couple of days Musk has been tweeting support for right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, a man with criminal convictions who Nigel Farage tried incredibly hard to distance himself from. Farage described Musk as a \"hero\" for buying Twitter, but conceded he has \"a whole range of opinions, some of which I agree with very strongly, and others of which I am more reticent about\".",
      "Cash and growth",
      "So Farage has new friends and new energy \u2013 and what has also changed since the election is Reform's potentially bulging bank balance.",
      "Whether you like it or not, money matters in politics. It's needed to pay for a lot of the unglamorous but vital work, such as hiring political organisers, opening local branches, and managing Farage's burgeoning social media accounts. Since the recruitment of Nick Candy, a billionaire and former Conservative donor, as the party's new treasurer, Farage has an ally who can write big cheques to support all that \u2013 he has promised to give Reform a seven-figure sum.",
      "The latest recorded donation figures show donations of only \u00a370,000 for the third quarter of 2024, but that seems set to change. The party's website is advertising jobs, and Reform is putting on regular events and building its membership around the country, which it says is now bigger than the Conservatives' rank and file.",
      "Over the next week Farage is appearing in Leicester, Chelmsford, Esher, and Chester. The party is yet to make a huge amount of noise in the Commons with their tiny band of MPs, but their whole persona is to do politics in a new way, outside Parliament.",
      "As they grow, so too will the scrutiny they face.",
      "There is likely to be more checking back over what they branded their \"contract with the people\" in the general election. They promised to cut \u00a35 out of every \u00a3100 in government spending within a hundred days, end shortages of doctors and nurses over the same time and give tax breaks to anyone who wanted to pay to go private in the NHS. They promised a freeze on non-essential immigration, more police, big changes to education, massive changes to the benefit system, and cutting tax while increasing spending on defence.",
      "To some voters their plans might sound like an appealing pick and mix, but there are big questions over whether many of the plans are remotely workable.",
      "And it's not just their policies they need people to get behind \u2013 it's their personnel, too. In the general election, as we revealed, candidates who wanted to stand for the party had expressed offensive views Reform found hard to defend. As they seek to expand, have they come up with a cast of characters the general public could get behind?",
      "Success - a distant prospect?",
      "Voters attracted to Reform don't come from any one political tribe, but ask pollsters and they share a sentiment \u2013 they're pretty peeved with the UK in 2025.",
      "Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common says the party has prospered because of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and disappointment with the early signs from Labour.",
      "He says their ratings have bumped up from around 15 to 20% thanks to people who previously would have said they liked Farage but were worried about him as PM, but are now saying, \"well we've tried the Tories they didn't work, Labour have taken away my mum's winter fuel allowance, so we may as well try Reform\".",
      "Their current polling suggests they could, theoretically, nab dozens of seats from Labour, although their actual backers are mainly former Conservative voters - and a general election is years away.",
      "And unlike the other main political parties the chance someone would vote Reform does not change that much on the age you are. Their average voter is a Gen X man \u2013 born between the mid-sixties and 1980. It's only among older pensioners that research suggests the level of support falls away. The pattern doesn't seem to follow the clich\u00e9 that parties on the right grab elderly traditional 'small c' conservatives.",
      "In other words, the environment is ripe for Farage to thrive. But as his own political career demonstrates very vividly, political fashions come and go.",
      "Labour hopes desperately that doing the hard yards will pay off, restore their popularity, and they will be able to improve the country in at least some of the ways they promised you back in July. The Conservatives fervently hope that before too long their new leader Badenoch can make some progress.",
      "In 2025, the public will decide whether the party continues its march - or mucks up the opportunity it has. There will be tests during important elections in Wales, and contests for local mayors and local councils in May.",
      "A senior government figure told me \"we shouldn't over think\" the threat from Reform. But not to think hard about the party could prove foolish indeed.",
      "Farage's dream of a general election victory is years away and politically distant too. But he hopes in 2025 to prove that by the end of this year, it's an ambition that will look less far-fetched.",

    "story": [
      "In Donald Trump's first term, governments around the world braced for his morning social media posts. What policy would be reversed, what insult thrown? Four years on, diplomats are once more getting twitchy when the sun rises on America's east coast.",
      "Back then, they learned to take Trump - as the adage had it - \"seriously but not literally\". Despite many campaign promises, he did not take the US out of Nato or lock up Hilary Clinton. But can ministers stay so sanguine a second time around?",
      "Trump's latest morning salvo criticised the UK government's decision to increase taxes on oil and gas firms working in the North Sea, in part to help fund renewable energy.",
      "On his platform, Truth Social, Trump responded to a report about a US oil firm leaving the region, saying: \"The U.K. is making a very big mistake. Open up the North Sea. Get rid of Windmills!\"",
      "Was this merely a familiar defence of a US firm by Trump and a repetition of his pro-fossil fuel instincts? Or was it evidence of a greater willingness by the president-elect to intervene in an ally's own domestic policies?",
      "The main difference - four years on - is that Trump is no longer alone at the keyboard; his increasingly powerful fellow traveller, Elon Musk, is even more prolific, using his own platform, X, to attack the British government across the board. He has criticised its handling of last summer's riots, the running of the economy and now especially its attitude towards child abuse scandals.",
      "Musk has issued a torrent of tweets attacking Sir Keir Starmer personally, accusing the prime minister of not doing enough to prosecute child grooming gangs while he was the director of public prosecutions.",
      "British politicians cannot stem these posts from across the Atlantic. But they can control their reaction. During Trump's first term, governments - and news desks - learned to pause and take a moment before responding to - or reporting - the latest electronic missives from the White House.",
      "Thus far the Conservatives have chosen to engage with and echo Musk's agenda. The party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said a full national inquiry into organised grooming gangs was \"long overdue\".",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 01:51:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The government says the rule change will raise \u00a3460m extra to spend in state schools in 2024/25.",
    "story": [
      "VAT is now being added to private school fees after new rules came into force on 1 January.",
      "The government plans to spend the money raised on more teachers for state schools in England.",
      "Private schools say they have already seen a drop in secondary school pupil numbers because of higher fees.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods or services and the standard rate is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education.",
      "Private school fees are liable for 20% VAT from 1 January.",
      "The government previously said the tax would apply to all payments made for the January term after 29 July 2024.",
      "About half of England's private schools are also charities, so receive an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "Separate legislation will be introduced to remove this tax relief from April 2025, but plans to remove private schools' charitable status have been dropped.",
      "How will the extra money be spent?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in 2024/25, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"every single penny\" will go to state schools.",
      "Labour has repeatedly pledged to use the money to recruit 6,500 new teachers for state schools in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "In October's Budget, the government allocated different sources of funding to address other issues in schools, like crumbling buildings and a stretched system for pupils with special educational needs.",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",
      "While some famous schools, like Eton and Harrow, charge about \u00a350,000 a year, the average is about \u00a315,000.",
      "There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England.",
      "Private schools have more freedom than government-funded state schools, and do not have to follow the national curriculum.",

      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Will private school fees go up for everyone?",
      "Applying VAT does not necessarily mean fees will go up by 20%. Some private schools may decide to put up their fees more than others.",
      "On average, the government expects fees to increase by around 10%.",
      "The average cost of private school fees has risen by 55% since 2003, even without VAT, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tanks says.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period has not fallen.",

      "But only those with a local authority education, health and care plan (EHCP) which names the specific school will continue to be exempt.",
      "The government says a grant to help cover boarding-school fees for children of military families is being increased to take account of rising charges.",
      "What could the tax change mean for state schools?",
      "The government does not expect a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "It estimates that around 37,000 students will move to the state sector over the long term, but believes class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which says it would be possible for the state sector to \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,400 private schools, says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in Year 7 pupils in September 2024.",
      "The ISC believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",
      "In October 2024, the organisation said it would press ahead with plans for a legal challenge against the policy. It argues the tax changes breach the European Convention on Human Rights on two counts: the prohibition of discrimination, and the right to education.",
      "The Treasury said it would not comment on potential litigation."

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 01:28:52 GMT",
    "summary": "After edging close to extinction, there are now some 2,000 Iberian lynxes in Spain and Portugal.",
    "story": [
      "With his leopard-like spots, Navarro - a male lynx - calls out during mating season as he walks towards a camera trap.",
      "Just short of 100cm (39 inches) in length and 45cm in height, the Iberian lynx is a rare sight. But there are now more than 2,000 in the wild across Spain and Portugal, so you're much more likely to see them than you were 20 years ago.",
      "\"The Iberian lynx was very, very close to extinction,\" says Rodrigo Serra, who runs the reproduction programme across Spain and Portugal.",
      "At the lowest point there were fewer than 100 lynxes left in two populations that didn't interact, and only 25 of them were females of reproductive age.",
      "\"The only feline species that was threatened at this level was the sabre tooth tiger thousands of years ago.\"",
      "The decline of the lynx population was partly down to more and more land being used for agriculture, a rise in fatalities on the roads, and a struggle for food.",
      "Wild rabbits are essential prey for the lynx and two pandemics led to a 95% fall in their number.",
      "By 2005, Portugal had no lynxes left, but it was also the year that Spain saw the first litter born in captivity.",
      "It took another three years before Portugal decided on a national conservation action plan to save the species. A National Breeding Centre for Iberian lynxes was built in Silves in the Algarve.",
      "Here they are monitored 24 hours a day. The aim is twofold \u2013 to prepare them for life in the wild and to pair them for reproduction.",
      "Serra speaks in a whisper, because even from a distance of 200m you can cause stress to the animals in the 16 pens where most of the animals are kept.",
      "Sometimes, though, stress is exactly what the lynxes need.",
      "\"When we notice a litter is becoming a bit more confident, we go in and chase them and make noise so they are scared again and climb the fences,\" says Serra. \"We're training them not to get close to people in the wild.\"",
      "That's partly for their own protection, but also so they stay away from people and their animals. \"A lynx should be a lynx, not be treated like a house cat.\"",
      "So the lynxes never associate food with people, they are fed through a tunnel system at the centre.",
      "Then, when the time comes, they are released into the wild.",
      "Genetics determines where they end up, to diminish the risks of inbreeding or disease. Even if a lynx was born in Portugal it might be taken to Spain.",
      "Pedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in Portugal and has studied the Iberian lynx for 30 years.",
      "\"As a biologist there are two things that strike me when I'm handling a lynx. It's an animal with a fairly small head for its body and extraordinarily wide paws. That gives them an impulse and ability to jump which are rare.\"",
      "The breeding programme and the return of the lynx have been hailed as great successes, but as their numbers climb there may be problems too.",
      "As lynxes are often released on private land in Portugal, the organisers of the reproduction programme have to reach an agreement with the owners first.",
      "Where the animals go after that is up to them, and although there have been some attacks on chicken coops, Sarmento says there have not been many.",
      "\"This can lead to uneasiness within locals. We've been strengthening the coops so lynxes can't access them, and in some cases we keep monitoring the lynxes and scare them off if needed.\"",
      "He recounts the story of L\u00edtio, one of the first lynxes released in Portugal.",
      "For six months L\u00edtio stayed in the same area but then the team lost track of him.",
      "He eventually made his way to Do\u00f1ana, a national park in southern Spain where he had come from originally.",
      "As L\u00edtio was sick, he was treated and then returned to the reproduction team in the Algarve.",
      "Within days of his release from the centre he began heading back to Do\u00f1ana, swimming across the Guadiana river to reach Spain.",
      "For a time he disappeared, but eventually he was brought back to the Algarve.",
      "When he was released for a third time, L\u00edtio did not venture back to Spain but instead he walked 3km (two miles), found a female and never moved again.",
      "\"He is the oldest lynx we have here, and he's fathered plenty of cubs ever since,\" says Sarmento.",
      "Three decades after Spain decided to save the lynx, the species is no longer endangered, and Sarmento hopes it'll reach a favourable conservation status by 2035.",
      "For that to happen, the numbers need to reach 5,000-6,000 in the wild.",
      "\"I saw the species disappearing. It's surreal that we're in a place where we can see lynxes in nature or through camera trapping almost daily,\" says Sarmento.",
      "The reproduction team are not being complacent and there are risks involved in their work. Last year 80% of lynx deaths took place on the roads.",
      "For now, though, they feel confident the Iberian lynx has been saved.",

      "The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands.",

      "They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened.",
      "The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside.",
      "\"The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],\" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb.",

    "story": [
      "The UK's biggest ever dinosaur trackway site has been discovered in a quarry in Oxfordshire.",
      "About 200 huge footprints, which were made 166 million years ago, criss-cross the limestone floor.",
      "They reveal the comings and goings of two different types of dinosaurs that are thought to be a long-necked sauropod called Cetiosaurus and the smaller meat-eating Megalosaurus.",
      "The longest trackways are 150m in length, but they could extend much further as only part of the quarry has been excavated.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropalaeontologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The tracks were first spotted by Gary Johnson, a worker at Dewars Farm Quarry, while he was driving a digger.",
      "\"I was basically clearing the clay, and I hit a hump, and I thought it's just an abnormality in the ground,\" he said, pointing to a ridge where some mud has been pushed up as a dinosaur's foot pressed down into the earth.",
      "\"But then it got to another, 3m along, and it was a hump again. And then it went another 3m - hump again.\"",
      "Another trackway site had been found nearby in the 1990s, so he realised the regular bumps and dips could be dinosaur footprints.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal - a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "This summer, more than 100 scientists, students and volunteers joined an excavation at the quarry which features on the new series of Digging for Britain.",
      "The team found five different trackways.",
      "Four of them were made by sauropods, plant-eating dinosaurs that walked on four legs. Their footprints look a bit like an elephant's - only much much bigger - these beasts reached up to 18m in length.",
      "Another track is thought to have been created by a Megalosaurus.",
      "\"It's almost like a caricature of a dinosaur footprint\", explained Dr Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate palaeontologist from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "\"It's what we call a tridactyl print. It's got these three toes that are very, very clear in the print.\"",
      "The carnivorous creatures, which walked on two legs, were agile hunters, she said.",
      "\"The whole animal would have been 6-9m in length. They were the largest predatory dinosaurs that we know of in the Jurassic period in Britain.\"",
      "The environment they lived in was covered by a warm, shallow lagoon and the dinosaurs left their prints as they ambled across the mud.",
      "\"Something must have happened to preserve these in the fossil record,\" said Prof Richard Butler, a palaeobiologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"We don't know exactly what, but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away.\"",
      "The team studied the trackways in detail during the dig. As well as making casts of the tracks, they took more than 20,000 photographs to create 3D models of both the complete site and individual footprints.",
      "\"The really lovely thing about a dinosaur footprint, particularly if you have a trackway, is that it is a snapshot in the life of the animal,\" Prof Butler explained.",
      "\"You can learn things about how that animal moved. You can learn exactly what the environment that it was living in was like. So tracks give us a whole different set of information that you can't get from the bone fossil record.\"",
      "One area of the site even reveals where the paths of a sauropod and megalosaurus once crossed.",
      "The prints are so beautifully preserved that the team have been able to work out which animal passed through first - they believe it was the sauropod, because the front edge of its large, round footprint is slightly squashed down by the three-toed megalosaurus walking on top of it.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" said Dr Duncan Murdock from Oxford University.",
      "\"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "The future fate of the trackways hasn't yet been decided but the scientists are working with Smiths Bletchington, who operate the quarry, and Natural England on options for preserving the site for the future.",
      "They believe there could be more footprints, these echoes of our prehistoric past, just waiting to be discovered.",
      "The excavation is featured on Digging for Britain  on BBC Two at 20:00 on Wednesday 8 January. The full series will be available on BBC iPlayer on 7 January."

    "story": [
      "From the end of the Roman occupation through the Anglo-Saxon and Viking invasions - a new way of testing DNA in ancient bones could force a rethink of key moments in Britain's early history, say researchers.",
      "Scientists could already track big alterations in DNA that occur over thousands or millions of years, helping us learn, for example, how early humans evolved from ape-like creatures.",
      "Now researchers can identify subtler changes over just hundreds of years, providing clues as to how people migrated and interacted with locals.",
      "They are using the new method to analyse human remains found in Britain, including from the time when Romans were replaced by an Anglo-Saxon elite from Europe.",
      "Prof Peter Heather, from Kings College London, who is working on the project with the developers of the new DNA technique at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the new technique could be \"revolutionary\".",
      "While the project will analyse the DNA of more than 1,000 ancient human remains of people who lived in Britain during the past 4,500 years, researchers have homed in on the time after the Romans left as a particularly interesting era to study.",
      "What happened in this period more than 1,500 years ago is unclear from written and archeological records. Historians are divided in their views about the scale and nature of the Anglo-Saxon invasion, whether it was large or small, hostile or co-operative.",
      "\"It is one of the most contested and therefore one of the most exciting things to work on in the whole of British history,\" according to Prof Heather.",
      "\"[The new method] will allow us to see the type of relations that are being found with the native population,\" he said. \"Are they co-operative, is there interbreeding, are the locals able to make their way into the elite?\"",
      "Humans may not have survived without Neanderthals",
      "They are optimistic about the success of the technique, known as Twigstats, after testing it on human remains found in mainland Europe between the years 1 and 1,000 CE.",
      "Much of what they gleaned from the DNA about the spread of the Vikings into Scandinavia tallied with historical records.",
      "This result, published in the journal Nature, confirmed the method worked while showing how powerful it could be at shedding new light on accepted facts when findings didn't match what was written in the history books.",
      "\"That was the moment we got really excited,\" said Dr Leo Speidel, who developed the technique with his group leader Dr Pontus Skoglund. \"We could see that this could really change how much we can find out about human history.\"",
      "The problem the researchers were trying to overcome is that a human's genetic code is extremely long - consisting of 3 billion separate chemical units.",
      "Spotting the small genetic changes in that code which occur over a few generations, for example, as a result of new arrivals interbreeding with the local population, is like looking for a needle in a haystack.",
      "The researchers solved the problem by, as it were, taking away the haystack and leaving the needle in plain sight - they found a way to identify the older genetic changes, disregard them and look only at the most recent alterations.",
      "They combed the genetic data of thousands of human remains from an online scientific database, then calculated how closely they were related to each other, which chunks of DNA were inherited from which groups and when.",
      "This created a family tree with older changes appearing in earlier branches, and more recent changes showing up in newer 'twigs', hence the name Twigstats.",
      "Each of the people whose remains will be studied have their own tales to tell and soon scientists and historians will be able to hear their stories, said Dr Skoglund.",

      "As well as showing up interbreeding with different populations, embedded in the ancient DNA are hugely important details on how people coped with key historical moments, such epidemics, shifts in diet, urbanisation, and industrialisation.",
      "The technique can potentially be applied to any part of the world for which there are a large collection of well preserved human remains.",
      "Prof Heather wants to use it to investigate what he describes as one of European history's biggest mysteries: why central and eastern Europe changed from being Germanic speaking to Slavic speaking, 1,500 years ago.",

      "This was a landmark moment for humanity \u2013 but one without any human directly involved, as the spacecraft carried out its pre-programmed tasks by itself as it flew past the sun, with no communication with Earth at all.",
      "Robotic probes have been sent across the solar system for the last six decades, reaching destinations impossible for humans. During its 10-day flyby, the Parker Solar Probe experienced temperatures of 1000C.",
      "But the success of these autonomous spacecraft \u2013 coupled with the rise of new advanced artificial intelligence \u2013 raises the question of what role humans might play in future space exploration.",
      "Some scientists question whether human astronauts are going to be needed at all.",
      "\"Robots are developing fast, and the case for sending humans is getting weaker all the time,\" says Lord Martin Rees, the UK's Astronomer Royal. \"I don't think any taxpayer's money should be used to send humans into space.\"",
      "He also points to the risk to humans.",
      "\"The only case for sending humans [there] is as an adventure, an experience for wealthy people, and that should be funded privately,\" he argues.",
      "Andrew Coates, a physicist from University College London, agrees. \"For serious space exploration, I much prefer robotics,\" he says. \"[They] go much further and do more things.\"",
      "They are also cheaper than humans, he argues. \"And as AI progresses, the robots can be cleverer and cleverer.\"",
      "But what does that mean for future generations of budding astronauts \u2013 and surely there are certain functions that humans can do in space but which robots, however advanced, never could?",
      "Rovers versus mankind",
      "Robotic spacecraft have visited every planet in the solar system, as well as many asteroids and comets, but humans have only gone to two destinations: Earth's orbit and the Moon.",
      "In all, about 700 people have been to space, since the earliest in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin from the then-Soviet Union became the first cosmic explorer. Most of those have been into orbit (circling the Earth) or suborbit (short vertical hops into space lasting minutes, on vehicles like the US company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket).",
      "\"Prestige will always be a reason that we have humans in space,\" says Dr Kelly Weinersmith, a biologist at Rice University, Texas and co-author of A City on Mars. \"It seems to have been agreed upon as a great way to show that your political system is effective and your people are brilliant.\"",
      "But aside from an innate desire to explore, or a sense of prestige, humans also carry out research and experiments in Earth's orbit, such as on the International Space Station, and use these to advance science.",
      "Robots can contribute to that scientific research, with the ability to travel to locations inhospitable to humans, where they can use instruments to study and probe the atmospheres and surfaces.",
      "\"Humans are more versatile and we get stuff done faster than a robot, but we're really hard and expensive to keep alive in space,\" says Dr Weinersmith.",
      "In her 2024 Booker Prize-winning novel Orbital, author Samantha Harvey puts it more lyrically: \"A robot has no need for hydration, nutrients, excretion, sleep\u2026 It wants and asks for nothing.\"",
      "But there are downsides. Many robots are slow and methodical \u2013 for example on Mars, the rovers (remote-controlled motor vehicles) trundle along at barely 0.1mph.",
      "\"AI can beat human beings at chess, but does that mean they'll be able to beat human beings in exploring environments?\" asks Dr Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist at the University of London. \"I just don't think we know.\"",
      "He does, however, believe that AI algorithms might enable rovers to be \"more efficient\".",
      "AI assistants and humanoid robots",
      "Technology can play a part in complementing human space travel by freeing up astronauts from certain tasks to allow them to focus on more important research.",
      "\"[AI could be used to] automate tedious tasks,\" explains Dr Kiri Wagstaff, a computer and planetary scientist in the US who previously worked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. \"On the surface of a planet, humans get tired and lose focus, but machines won't.\"",
      "The challenge is that vast amounts of power are needed to operate systems like large language models (LLM), which can understand and generate human language by processing vast amounts of text data. \"We are not at the point of being able to run an LLM on a Mars rover,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"The rovers' processors run at about a tenth [of the speed] that your smartphone has\" \u2013 meaning they are unable to cope with the intense demands of running an LLM.",
      "Complex humanoid machines with robotic arms and limbs are another form of technology that could take on basic tasks and functions in space, particularly as they more closely mimic the physical capabilities of humans.",
      "Nasa's Valkyrie robot was built by the Johnson Space Center to compete in a 2013 robotics challenge trial. Weighing 300lb and standing at 6ft2in, it looks not unlike a Star Wars Stormtrooper, but it is one of an increasing number of human-like machines with superhuman abilities.",
      "Long before the Valkyrie was created, Nasa's Robonaut was the first humanoid robot designed for use in space, taking on tasks that were otherwise performed by humans.",
      "Its specially designed hands meant it could use the same tools as astronauts and carry out complex, delicate tasks like grasping objects or flicking switches, that were too challenging for other robotic systems.",
      "A later model of the Robonaut was flown to the International Space Station on the space shuttle Discovery in 2011, where it helped with maintenance and assembly.",
      "\"If we need to change a component or clean a solar panel, we could do that robotically,\" says Dr Shaun Azimi, lead of the dexterous robotics team at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Texas. \"We see robots as a way to secure these habitats when humans aren't around.\"",
      "He argues that robots could be useful, not to replace human explorers but to work alongside them.",
      "Some robots are already working on other planets without humans, sometimes even making decisions on their own. Nasa's Curiosity rover, for example, is exploring a region called Gale Crater on Mars and autonomously performs some of its science without human input.",
      "\"You can direct the rover to take pictures of a scene, look for rocks that might fit science priorities for the mission, and then autonomously fire its laser at that target,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"It can get a reading of a particular rock and send it back to Earth while the humans are still asleep.\"",
      "But the capabilities of rovers like Curiosity are limited by their slow pace. And there is something else they cannot compete with too. That is, humans have the added bonus of inspiring people back on Earth in a way that machines cannot.",
      "\"Inspiration is something that is intangible,\" argues Prof Coates.",
      "Leroy Chiao, a retired Nasa astronaut who went on three flights to space in the 1990s and 2000s on Nasa's Space Shuttle and to the International Space Station, agrees. \"Humans relate when humans are doing something.",
      "\"The general public is excited about robotic missions. But I would expect the first human on Mars to be even bigger than the first Moon landing.\"",

      "Humans have not travelled further than Earth's orbit since December 1972, when the last Apollo mission visited the Moon. Nasa is hoping to return humans there this decade with its Artemis programme.",
      "The next crewed mission will see four astronauts fly around the Moon in 2026. A further mission, scheduled for 2027, will see Nasa astronauts land on the Moon's surface.",
      "The Chinese space agency, meanwhile, also wants to send astronauts to the Moon.",
      "Elsewhere Elon Musk, CEO of the US company SpaceX, has his own plans related to space. He has said that his long-term plan is to create a colony on Mars, where humans could land.",
      "His idea is to use Starship, a vast new vehicle that his company is developing, to transport up to 100 people there at a time, with the aim for there to be a million people on Mars in 20 years.",
      "\"Musk is arguing we need to move to Mars because that could be a backup for humanity if something catastrophic happens on Earth,\" explains Dr Weinersmith. \"If you buy that argument, then sending humans into space is necessary.\"",
      "However, there are large unknowns about living on Mars, including myriad technical challenges that she says remain unsolved.",
      "\"Maybe babies can't develop in that environment,\" she says. \"There [are] ethical questions [like this] that we don't have the answers to.",
      "\"I think we should be slowing down.\"",
      "Lord Rees has a vision of his own, though, in which human and robotic exploration might merge to the point that humans themselves are part-machine to cope with extreme environments. \"I can imagine they will use all of the techniques of genetic modification, cyborg add-ons, and so on, to cope with very hostile environments,\" he says.",
      "\"We may have a new species that will be happy to live on Mars.\"",

      "\"I feel it myself when I travel now \u2013 even to the southern parts of Sweden \u2013 and abroad, that people really ask me questions,\" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt.",

      "\"I think it would be presumptuous to say that, okay, now we are doomed here in the Nordics because one company has failed,\" she argues.",

      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",

      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",

      "From busy freeways to classic-car street racing, Los Angeles has long been considered the capital of American car culture. Can it change in time for the Olympics?",
      "With nearly year-round sunny skies, some say LA is the ideal place for cycling.",
      "\"It is the perfect community for runners and cycling and outdoors, yet as a generality we are hooked on our vehicles, we are hooked on the need to have speed,\" said Damian Kevitt, the executive director of Streets Are For Everyone (Safe).",
      "But until recently, it was cars - and not pedestrians or cyclists - that ruled the roads.",
      "Spreading over 460 square miles (1,200 sq km), Los Angeles is known for its never-ending sprawl, and its traffic jams.",
      "While cities like New York and Boston have embraced mass transit, in LA it never quite caught on - only about 7% of Angelenos take transit to work, according to Neighborhood Data for Social Change.",
      "And while LA weather would be the envy of any Amsterdam cyclist, only about 1% bikes to work.",
      "But with hundreds of thousands of spectators expected to attend the city for the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games, something has to be done to make getting around the city easier.",
      "Los Angeles adopted the \"Twenty-eight by '28\" transport plan in 2017 to expand mass transit options before the summer Olympics. Since then, miles and miles of new bike lanes have been popping up.",
      "\"This is long overdue,\" Mr Kevitt said.",
      "A cyclist who lost his leg in 2013 after a car hit him as he rode his bike in Griffith Park, Kevitt thinks more people will commute using their own bikes or rentable Metro city bikes once the streets are safer and bike lanes are more connected to each other.",
      "LA voters in 2024 overwhelmingly supported a ballot measure to require the city to build more bike lanes and more walkable, livable spaces in Los Angeles.",
      "But will car-loving Angelenos embrace bike culture? Some are actively fighting the changes, grumbling that bike lanes only worsen traffic for cars in the city of stars.",
      "\"What do you mean we voted for it? Not here! Not me!\" said Darin Drabing, the president and CEO of Forest Lawn Cemetery, who is fighting against bike lanes near the cemetery because he thinks it will increase traffic during his commute and funerals.",
      "\"Everywhere I've seen [it] implemented, they failed,\" he said. \"All it does is increase congestion and frustration for people.\"",
      "Some do fail.",
      "While protected bike lanes have transformed Olympic host cities like Paris and London, politicians are currently trying to rip out bike lanes in Toronto that have been a part of the city's streets for almost a decade (they are being sued by cyclists to stop that plan).",
      "In Los Angeles County, the city of Glendale recently voted to remove some bike lanes after complaints about increased traffic.",
      "And new protected bike lanes are creating frustration along Hollywood Boulevard, where automobile traffic is now limited to one lane in each direction for several miles. But it's also causing others to commute by bike occasionally instead of driving.",
      "Cyclist Mimi Holt used to ride her bike in Seattle then quit riding for nearly 20 years out of fear of speeding drivers on LA's busy streets.",
      "\"In LA people drive so fast, it's so utterly terrifying,\" she said.",
      "When her doctor told her she was pre-diabetic, she decided to risk the roads to get more exercise, and said since getting back on two wheels, she feels much younger.",
      "She said she can't wait for the city's \"islands of bike lanes\" to be connected to one another.",
      "\"If only there was a connecting path, I would be on them all the time,\" Ms Holt said, adding that she would get rid of her car if cycling safely everywhere were an option in Los Angeles.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the city and the LA 2028 Olympic committee were making great progress towards a \"transit first\" Olympics, as she calls it, after she initially sparked controversy by championing a \"car-free\" Games.",
      "But with over 100 miles (160km) of bike lanes planned, advocates worry the process is taking too long.",
      "So far, just five of the \"Twenty-eight by '28\" projects have been completed and 23 are in progress - and not all of them are expected to be completed in time for the Games.",
      "Los Angeles has already secured $900m (\u00a3717m) from the Biden administration to help mostly with rail projects. But it will take more to make the city's transit dreams come true by 2028.",
      "Mayor Bass and other city leaders have written a letter to the Trump transition team requesting $3.2bn in federal funding for \"the largest and most spectacular sporting event held in American history\".",
      "President Trump was supportive of LA's Olympic bid during his first presidency, telling officials not to forget to invite him.",
      "Mayor Bass said they haven't had a response yet to the letter, but she said she's hopeful President-elect Trump will be supportive despite his frequent tensions with other California political leaders, such as Governor Gavin Newsom and congresswoman Nancy Pelosi.",
      "Some people, like Ms Holt, love the idea of ditching their cars, for a variety of reasons.",
      "\"I can barely afford my car. Insurance is really expensive, gas is really expensive and it's not good for the environment,\" Ms Holt said at a meeting to view proposed bike paths all over Los Angeles.",
      "But while many Angelenos rely on mass transit to get to work and school, many others who live here have never taken a bus or ventured underground to the subway, which is often portrayed as crime-infested and dystopian in the media.",
      "And many locals think the idea of a car-free Games is absurd.",
      "\"That's a wonderful dream,\" said Shivon Ozinga, a Burbank resident opposed to additional bike lanes near her neighborhood. She said the city is too vast, sprawling and reliant on cars to change.",
      "\"I can't imagine it happening in that short amount of time given our car culture here.\"",
      "But Mayor Bass can imagine a transportation revolution and said she believes the transit changes in Los Angeles will be lasting long beyond the Olympic Games and the 2026 World Cup.",
      "\"As a bike rider, I certainly hope so,\" she said."

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 22:55:51 GMT",
    "summary": "The ruling marks a significant moment in the long running battle over how to regulate internet providers.",
    "story": [
      "A US court has rejected the Biden administration's bid to restore \"net neutrality\" rules, finding that the federal government does not have the authority to regulate internet providers like utilities.",
      "It marks a major defeat for so-called open internet advocates, who have long fought for protections that would require internet providers such as AT&T to treat all legal content equally.",
      "Such rules were first introduced by the Federal Communications Commission under former Democratic president Barack Obama but later repealed during Republican Donald Trump's first term.",
      "The decision, just as Trump is poised to enter the White House for a second term, likely puts an end to the long-running legal battle over the issue.",
      "In their decision, the judges noted that different administrations have gone back and forth on the issue.",
      "But they said the court no longer had to give \"deference\" to the FCC's reading of the law, pointing to a recent Supreme Court decision that limits the authority of federal agencies to interpret laws, a decision that critics expect will be used to weaken regulation in the years ahead.",
      "\"Applying Loper Bright, means we can end the FCC's vacillations,\" the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals said.",
      "Brendan Carr, a Republican member of the FCC who Trump has tapped to lead the agency, said he was pleased the court had invalidated the Biden administration's \"Internet power grab\".",
      "The FCC's outgoing Democratic commissioner said the ruling turned the issue over to Congress.",
      "\"Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair,\" Jessica Rosenworcel said.",
      "\"With this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law.\"",
      "US net neutrality vote: a brief guide",
      "The fight over net neutrality was once a heated issue in the US, pitting internet providers against big tech companies such as Google and Netflix.",
      "Comedian John Oliver famously urged his audience to express support for the rules, leading to a deluge of comments that crashed the government's site.",
      "But the issue has faded in prominence since the rules were repealed in 2018.",
      "Thursday's ruling does not affect state-level net neutrality laws, which in some places offer similar protections.",
      "But advocates, like Mr Oliver, have said that national rules are important to preventing internet providers from having powers to throttle certain content or charge more for speedy delivery of their service.",
      "Public Knowledge, a progressive-leaning internet policy group, said the decision had weakened the FCC's power to shape privacy protections, implement public safety measures and take other action.",
      "It said it believed the court had erred in ruling that internet service providers were simply offering an \"information service\" rather than acting as telecommunications companies.",
      "\"The court has created a dangerous regulatory gap that leaves consumers vulnerable and gives broadband providers unchecked power over Americans' internet access,\" it said.",
      "But USTelecom, an industry group whose members include AT&T and Verizon, said the decision was \"a victory for American consumers that will lead to more investment, innovation, and competition in the dynamic digital marketplace.\""

    "title": "30 years ago Tomorrow's World predicted 2025 - how did it do?",
    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:42:58 GMT",
    "summary": "From space junk gel to hologram surgery, the team had lots of intriguing predictions. Which, if any, came true?",
    "story": [
      "In 1995, the BBC's Tomorrow's World programme decided to predict what the world would look like 30 years later, in 2025.",
      "The show, which is no longer broadcast, featured one of the most famous scientists of the age, Prof Stephen Hawking, who predicted: \"By 2025 we can expect big changes.\"",
      "The programme team agreed, suggesting a raft of world-shaking innovations from hologram surgery to space junk gel.",
      "So, with the help of some experts - and the benefit of three decades of hindsight - let's take a look at how much of today's world that Tomorrow's World successfully anticipated.",
      "The 'Cyberspace Riots' of 2005",
      "In 1995, the world wide web was really taking off - a development Tomorrow's World thought would bring future trouble.",
      "They predicted \"business barons\" and banks would take control of the internet by 2000, establishing a \"supernet\" which they restricted access to.",
      "That, in turn, would prompt hacks, viruses and even riots.",
      "Verdict - The internet has remained - mostly - open, and there have been no riots but there is little doubt the actions of hackers have caused misery for many people.",
      "One thing the programme didn't predict was the role of the nation state hackers like North Korea, expertly told in the BBC's Lazarus Heist podcast.",
      "Cybersecurity is hugely important for governments and companies, and people who are suspicious of banks have championed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Asteroid mining and space junk gel",
      "The programme speculated space mining would become a lucrative industry, with companies excavating asteroids near Earth for precious metals.",
      "The show also suggested space junk would become such a problem it would not be safe for astronauts. The answer - a gigantic foam gel to slow down debris.",
      "Verdict - Well, there is no super foam gel and the problem of space junk is an acute one. There is also no space mining industry - but that could change.",
      "Futurist Tom Cheesewright is an optimist about mining beyond our planet.",
      "\"The potential riches are unfathomable and the technology is entirely within our grasp,\" he said.",
      "The super surgeons and their robots",
      "Tomorrow's World predicted by 2004, a law would be passed for all UK hospitals to publish a league table of surgeon success rates. The top surgeons would become so popular, and so well paid, it would make no sense for them to travel to patients.",
      "Instead, patient holograms would be sent to them and the surgeon would operate using \"spacial gloves\". At the patient's end, a robot would perfectly mimic the movements of the surgeon.",
      "Verdict - They didn't get it exactly right but robots are helping with surgeries.",
      "A smart speaker with a floating head",
      "The programme featured a man of the future (wearing a fetching VR headset), his wife and a young girl in what appears to be modern-day London.",
      "In one section, the floating head of a woman comes out of a \"smart speaker\" to tell the man it has been a year since his holiday to \"Indo Disney.\" She encourages him to take another holiday via a \"shuttle to Bangalore\" - which would only take 40 minutes.",
      "Verdict - Ultra-fast travel feels as far away as ever, but holograms, smart speakers and VR headsets are becoming ever more prevalent.",
      "Banking using a microchip in your arm",
      "Elsewhere in the programme, we were given a vision of the future of banking.",
      "It featured a woman going to a bank, complaining there were no humans, and then withdrawing 100 \"Euro marks.\" The bank gives her the money after scanning a chip in her arm.",
      "Verdict - Banking has indeed become more and more automated. And though paying via microchips inside the human body is a reality, other technologies - mainly fingerprint and face scanning - are much more widely used.",
      "Memories from the presenters",
      "Gardeners' World star Monty Don was one of the presenters on that Tomorrow's World programme 30 years ago. His segment predicted a huge restoration of British woodlands thanks to genetic engineering and multi-storey agri facilities, leading to the return of animals including the brown bear.",
      "Reflecting on it now, he told BBC News that his part of the programme was \"utopian\" and \"naive\".",
      "Looking towards the next 30 years, he is pleased the current generation of young people are \"much more sensitive to climate change\" and thinks people will be growing more of their own food by 2055.",
      "Listen on BBC Sounds: Tech Life looks forward to 2025",
      "Listen on BBC Sounds: Tech Life looks forward to 2025",
      "He added: \"Tomorrow's World was by definition geared towards the way that mankind could change and improve the world, whereas what we have really learnt since then is that mankind has a habit of making things worse, particularly environmentally, and we have to work with nature rather than try modify and control it.\"",
      "Vivienne Parry was another presenter on the prediction show, and fronted a section about medicine.",
      "She fondly remembers filming it - and the rather limited visual effects of the day. \"I had to stay absolutely still. I had a set of glasses on with a little camera attached. They were stuck on my face via a big blob of black sticky stuff.",
      "\"It was this fantastically hot day, and this black stuff started to leak down my face and I couldn't move. Someone from make-up came along with a long cane with cotton wool on the end to get it off.\"",
      "Vivienne has been involved with Genomics England since 2013, and highlights that some of the predictions from the 1995 Tomorrow's World about genomic sequencing have come true, as she works on a research study to help diagnose and treat genetic conditions.",
      "So what could the world look like in 2055?",
      "Futurist Tracey Follows thought the 1995 programme got a lot of big ideas right, but missed two of the biggest themes of the last 30 years - the spread of big tech and social media.",
      "By 2055, she thinks many people will be \"cognitively connected\" - a hive mind of humans and technology via servers, which will help in the sharing of ideas.",
      "\"Brainstorming will literally be brainstorming, where you can share ideas by thinking them.\"",
      "Tom Cheesewright thinks two of the most exciting prospects for the next 30 years will be materials science and bioengineering.",
      "In materials, the creation of devices that are even stronger, lighter and thinner could change the world, while bioengineering - married with tight regulation - has the power to transform medicine and tackle \"some of the biggest challenges humanity faces - decarbonisation, clean water, food\".",
      "So what do you think the world will look like in 30 years?",
      "Whatever your answers, it would be wise to listen to what Prof Hawking said to Tomorrow's World three decades ago.",
      "\"Some of these changes are very exciting, and some are alarming. The one thing that we can be sure of is that it will be very different, and probably not what we expect.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 00:05:18 GMT",
    "summary": "A row has erupted over a long-standing US visa programme, We looked into the figures behind the scheme.",
    "story": [
      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Critics say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "What happened under Trump?",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",
      "The vast majority of those approved come from India.",
      "The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens.",
      "About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",
      "About 70% of those who enter the US on H-1B visas are men, with the average age of those approved being around 33.",

    "story": [
      "US President Joe Biden has announced a ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling along most of America's coastline, weeks before Donald Trump takes office.",
      "The ban covers the entire Atlantic coast and eastern Gulf of Mexico, as well as the Pacific coast off California, Oregon and Washington and a section of the Bering Sea off Alaska.",
      "It is the latest in a string of last-minute climate policy actions by the Biden administration ahead of Trump's return to the White House.",
      "During his campaign, Trump pledged to \"unleash\" domestic fossil fuel production in a bid to lower gas costs, despite the US already seeing record high extraction rates.",

      "Biden is taking the action under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, which allows presidents to withdraw areas from mineral leasing and drilling.",
      "The law, however, does not grant them the legal authority to overturn prior bans, according to a 2019 court ruling. It also does not allow presidents to revoke any areas already leased for offshore drilling.",
      "Trump - despite being in favour of more oil and gas exploration and repeatedly deploying his tag line \"Drill, baby, drill\" during campaigning - has used the law himself to protect waters off the coast of Florida in 2020.",
      "At the time, this was seen as an effort to garner votes from the state ahead of the 2020 US election, and the protection was due to expire in 2032. Biden's decision will protect the same area with no expiry date.",
      "The new offshore drilling ban covers more than 625 million acres (253 million hectares) of waters.",
      "After it was reported last week that Biden would introduce the policy, Trump's incoming press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it \"a disgraceful decision\".",

      "A looming deadline",
      "Time has almost run out for the investigators leading the criminal case against Yoon.",

    "summary": "More Vietnamese attempted small-boat crossings in early 2024 than any other nationality - what makes them risk this dangerous journey?",
    "story": [
      "More Vietnamese attempted small-boat Channel crossings in the first half of 2024 than any other nationality. Yet they are coming from one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Why, then, are so many risking their lives to reach Britain?",
      "Phuong looked at the small inflatable boat and wondered whether she should step in. There were 70 people packed in, and it was sitting low in the water. She recalls the fear, exhaustion and desperation on their faces. There weren't enough lifejackets to go around.",
      "But Phuong was desperate. She says she had been stuck in France for two months, after travelling there from Vietnam via Hungary, sleeping in tents in a scrubby forest.",
      "Already she had refused to travel on one boat because it seemed dangerously overcrowded, and previously had been turned back in the middle of the Channel three times by bad weather or engine failure.",
      "Her sister, Hien, lives in London, and recalls that Phuong used to phone her from France in tears. \"She was torn between fear and a drive to keep going.",
      "\"But she had borrowed so much - around \u00a325,000 - to fund this trip. Turning back wasn't an option.\" So, she climbed on board.",
      "Today Phuong lives in London with her sister, without any legal status. She was too nervous to speak to us directly, and Phuong is not her real name. She left it to her sister, who is now a UK citizen, to describe her experiences.",
      "In the six months to June, Vietnamese made up the largest number of recorded small boat arrivals with 2,248 landing in the UK, ahead of people from countries with well-documented human rights problems, including Afghanistan and Iran.",
      "The extraordinary efforts made by Vietnamese migrants to get to Britain is well documented, and in 2024 the BBC reported on how Vietnamese syndicates are running successful people-smuggling operations.",
      "It is not without significant risks. Some Vietnamese migrants end up being trafficked into sex work or illegal marijuana farms. They make up more than one-tenth of those in the UK filing official claims that they are victims of modern slavery.",
      "And yet Vietnam is a fast-growing economy, acclaimed as a \"mini-China\" for its manufacturing prowess. Per capita income is eight times higher than it was 20 years ago. Add to that the tropical beaches, scenery and affordability, which have made it a magnet for tourists.",
      "So what is it that makes so many people desperate to leave?",
      "A tale of two Vietnams",
      "Vietnam, a one-party Communist state, sits near the bottom of most human rights and freedom indexes. No political opposition is permitted.  The few dissidents who raise their voices are harassed and jailed.",
      "Yet most Vietnamese have learned to live with the ruling party, which leans for legitimacy on its record of delivering growth. Very few who go to Britain are fleeing repression.",
      "Nor are the migrants generally fleeing poverty. The World Bank has singled Vietnam out for its almost unrivalled record of poverty reduction among its 100 million people.",
      "Rather, they are trying to escape what some call \"relative deprivation\".",
      "Despite its impressive economic record, Vietnam started far behind most of its Asian neighbours, with growth only taking off well after the end of the Cold War in 1989. As a result, average wages, at around \u00a3230 a month, are much lower than in nearby countries like Thailand, and three-quarters of the 55-million-strong workforce are in informal jobs, with no security or social protection.",
      "\"There is a huge disparity between big cities like Hanoi and rural areas,\" says Nguyen Khac Giang, a Vietnamese academic at the Institute of South East Asian Studies-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"For a majority of workers with limited skills, there is a glass ceiling. Even if you work 14 hours a day you cannot save enough to build a house or start a family.\"",
      "This was what Phuong felt, despite coming from Haiphong, Vietnam's third-largest city.",
      "Her sister Hien had made it to Britain nine years earlier, smuggled inside a shipping container. It had cost her around \u00a322,000 but she was able to pay that back in two years, working long hours in kitchens and nail salons. Hien married a Vietnamese man who already had British citizenship, and they had a daughter; all three are now UK citizens.",
      "In Haiphong, jobs were scarce after the pandemic and at 38 years old, Phuong wanted what her sister had in London: the ability to save money and start a family.",
      "\"She could survive in Vietnam, but she wanted a home, a better life, with more security,\" explains Hien.",
      "Lan Anh Hoang, a professor in development studies at Melbourne University, has spent years studying migration patterns. \"Twenty to thirty years ago, the urge to migrate overseas was not as strong, because everyone was poor,\" she says. \"People were happy with one buffalo, one motorbike and three meals a day.",
      "\"Suddenly a few people successfully migrated to countries like Germany or the UK, to work on cannabis farms or open nail salons. They started to send a lot of money home. Even though the economic conditions of those left behind have not changed, they feel poor relative to all these families with migrants working in Europe.\"",
      "'Catch up, get rich'",
      "This tradition of seeking better lives overseas goes back to the 1970s and 80s, when Vietnam was allied to the Soviet Union following the defeat of US forces in the south.",
      "The state-led economy had hit rock bottom. Millions were destitute; some areas suffered food shortages. Tens of thousands left to work in eastern bloc countries like Poland, East Germany and Hungary.",
      "This was also a time when 800,000 mainly ethnic Chinese boat people fled the communist party's repressive actions, making perilous sea journeys across the South China Sea, eventually resettling in the USA, Australia or Europe.",
      "The economic hardships of that time threatened the legitimacy of the communist party, and in 1986 it made an abrupt turn, abandoning the attempt to build a socialist system and throwing the doors open to global markets. The new theme of Vietnam's national story was to catch up, and get rich, any way possible. For many Vietnamese, that meant going abroad.",
      "\"Money is God in Vietnam,\" says Lan An Hoang. \"The meaning of 'the good life' is primarily anchored in your ability to accumulate wealth. There is also a strong obligation to help your family, especially in central Vietnam.",
      "\"That is why the whole extended family pools resources to finance the migration of one young person because they believe they can send back large sums of money, and facilitate the migration of other people.\"",
      "New money: spoils of migration",
      "Drive through the flat rice fields of Nghe An, one of Vietnam's poorer provinces lying south of Hanoi, and where there were once smaller concrete houses, you will now find large, new houses with gilded gates. More are under construction, thanks, in part, to money earned in the West.",
      "The new houses are prominent symbols of success for returnees who have done well overseas.",
      "Vietnam is now enjoying substantial inflows of foreign investment, as it is considered an alternative to China for companies wanting to diversify their supply chains. This investment is even beginning to reach places like Nghe An, too.",
      "Foxconn, a corporate giant that manufactures iPhones, is one of several foreign businesses building factories in Nghe An, offering thousands of new jobs.",
      "But monthly salaries for unskilled workers only reach around \u00a3300, even with overtime. That is not enough to rival the enticing stories of the money to be made in the UK, as told by the people smugglers.",
      "From travel agents to labour brokers",
      "The business of organising the travel for those wishing to leave the province is now a very profitable one. Publicly, companies present themselves as either travel agents or brokers for officially approved overseas labour contracts, but in practice many also offer to smuggle people to the UK via other European countries. They usually paint a rosy picture of life in Britain, and say little about the risks and hardships they will face.",
      "\"Brokers\" typically charge between \u00a315,000 and \u00a335,000 for the trip to the UK. Hungary is a popular route into the EU because it offers guest-worker visas to Vietnamese passport holders. The higher the price, the easier and faster the journey.",
      "The communist authorities in Vietnam have been urged by the US, the UK and UN agencies to do more to control the smuggling business.",
      "Remittances from abroad earn Vietnam around \u00a313bn a year, and the government has a policy of promoting migration for work, although only through legal channels, mostly to richer Asian countries.",
      "More than 130,000 Vietnamese workers left in 2024 under the official scheme. But the fees for these contracts can be high, and the wages are much lower than they can earn in Britain.",
      "The huge risks of the illicit routes used to reach the UK were brought home in 2019, when 39 Vietnamese people were found dead in Essex, having suffocated while being transported inside a sealed container across the Channel.",
      "Yet this has not noticeably reduced demand for the smugglers' services. The increased scrutiny of container traffic has, however, pushed them to find alternative Channel crossings, which helps explain the sharp rise in Vietnamese people using small boats.",
      "'Success stories outweigh the risks'",
      "\"The tragedy of the 39 deaths in 2019 is almost forgotten,\" says the cousin of one of the victims, Le Van Ha. He left behind a wife, two young children and a large debt from the cost of the journey. His cousin, who does not want to be named, says attitudes in their community have not changed.",
      "\"People hardly care anymore. It's a sad reality, but it is the truth.",
      "\"I see the trend of leaving continuing to grow, not diminish. For people here, the success stories still outweigh the risks.\"",
      "Three of the victims came from the agricultural province of Quang Binh. The headteacher of a secondary school in the region, who also asked not to be named, says that 80% of his students who graduate soon plan to go overseas.",
      "\"Most parents here come from low-income backgrounds,\" he explains. \"The idea of [encouraging their child to] broaden their knowledge and develop their skills is not the priority.",
      "\"For them, sending a child abroad is largely about earning money quickly, and getting it sent back home to improve the family's living standards.\"",
      "In March the UK Home Office started a social media campaign to deter Vietnamese people from illegal migration. Some efforts were also made by the Vietnamese government to alert people to the risks of using people-smugglers. But until there are more appealing economic opportunities in those provinces, it is likely the campaigns will have little impact.",
      "\"They cannot run these campaigns just once,\" argues Diep Vuong, co-founder of Pacific Links, an anti-trafficking organisation. \"It's a constant investment in education that's needed.\"",
      "She has first-hand experience, leaving Vietnam to the US in 1980 as part of the exodus of Vietnamese boat people.",
      "\"In Vietnam, people believe they have to work hard, to do everything for their families. That is like a shackle which they cannot easily escape. But with enough good information put out over the years, they might start to change this attitude.\"",
      "But the campaigns are up against a powerful narrative. Those who go overseas and fail \u2013 and many do \u2013 are often ashamed, and keep quiet about what went wrong. Those who succeed come back to places like Nghe An and flaunt their new-found wealth. As for the tragedy of the 39 people who died in a shipping container, the prevailing view in Nghe An is still that they were just unlucky.",

    "title": "The remarkable life of Andr\u00e9e Blouin - Africa's overlooked independence heroine",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 07:23:38 GMT",
    "summary": "Blouin ran in the same circles as liberation icons like Patrice Lumumba, Kwame Nkrumah and S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9.",
    "story": [
      "\"I know that you can die twice. First comes physical death... to be forgotten is a second death,\" notes screenwriter Eve Blouin, in an epilogue at the end of her mother's autobiography.",
      "Eve understands this sentiment more than most.",
      "In the 1950s and 60s, her mother, the late Andr\u00e9e Blouin, threw herself into the fight for a free Africa, mobilising the Democratic Republic of Congo's women against colonialism and rising to become a key adviser to Patrice Lumumba, DR Congo's first prime minister and a revered independence hero.",
      "She traded ideas with famed revolutionaries like Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah, Guinea's S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 and Algeria's Ahmed Ben Bella, yet her story is hardly known.",
      "In an attempt to remedy this injustice, Blouin's memoir, titled My Country, Africa: Autobiography of the Black Pasionaria, is being re-released, having spent decades out of print.",
      "In the book, Blouin explained that her yearning for decolonisation was sparked by a personal tragedy.",
      "She grew up between Central African Republic (CAR) and Congo-Brazzaville, which at the time were French colonies named Ubangi-Shari and the French Congo respectively.",
      "In the 1940s, her two-year-old son, Ren\u00e9, was being treated in hospital for malaria in the CAR.",
      "Ren\u00e9 was mixed-race like his mother, and because he was one-quarter African, he was denied medication. Weeks later, Ren\u00e9 was dead.",
      "\"The death of my son politicised me as nothing else could,\" Blouin wrote in her memoir.",
      "She added that colonialism \"was no longer a matter of my own maligned fate but a system of evil whose tentacles reached into every phase of African life\".",
      "Blouin was born in 1921, to a 40-year-old white French father and a 14-year-old black mother from the CAR.",
      "The two met when Blouin's father passed through her mother's village to sell goods.",
      "\"Even today, the story of my father and my mother, while giving me much pain, astonishes me still,\" Blouin said.",
      "When she was just three, Blouin's father placed her in a convent for mixed-race girls, which was run by French nuns in the neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville.",
      "This was common practice in France and Belgium's African colonies - it is thought that thousands of children born to colonialists and African women were sent to orphanages and separated from the rest of society.",
      "Blouin wrote: \"The orphanage served as a kind of waste bin for the waste products of this black-and-white society: the children of mixed blood who fit nowhere.\"",
      "Blouin's experience in the orphanage was extremely negative - she wrote that the children at the institution were whipped, underfed and verbally abused.",
      "But she was headstrong - she escaped from the orphanage aged 15 after the nuns attempted to force her into marriage.",
      "Blouin eventually married by her own will, twice. After Ren\u00e9's death, she moved with her second husband to Guinea, a West African country which was also governed by the French.",
      "At the time, Guinea was in the midst of a \"political tempest\", she wrote. France had promised the country independence, but also required Guineans to vote in a referendum on whether or not the country should maintain economic, diplomatic and military ties with France.",
      "The Guinean branch of the pan-African movement the Rassemblement D\u00e9mocratique Africain (RDA) wanted the country to vote \"No\", arguing that the country needed total liberation. In 1958, Blouin joined the campaign, driving throughout the country to speak at rallies.",
      "A year later, Guinea secured its independence by voting \"No\" and S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, Guinea's RDA leader, became the nation's first president.",
      "By this point, Blouin had begun to develop considerable clout in post-colonial, pan-African circles. She wrote that after Guinea became independent, she used this influence to advise the CAR's new President Barth\u00e9lemy Boganda, persuading him stand down in a diplomatic row with Congo-Brazzaville's post-independence leader, Fulbert Youlou.",
      "But counselling was not all Blouin had to offer this fast-changing Africa.",
      "In a restaurant in Guinea's capital, Conakry, she met a group of liberation activists from what would later become DR Congo. They urged her to help them mobilise Congolese women in the fight against Belgian colonial rule.",
      "Blouin was pulled in two directions. On one hand, she had three young children - including Eve - to raise. On the other, \"she had the restlessness of an idealist with a certain anger at the world as it was\", Eve, now 67, told the BBC.",
      "In 1960, with Nkrumah's encouragement, Andr\u00e9e Blouin flew alone to DR Congo. She joined prominent male liberation activists, such as Pierre Mulele and Antoine Gizenga, on the road, campaigning across the country's 2.4 million sq km (906,000 sq miles) expanse. She cut a striking figure, travelling through the bush with her coiffed hair, form-fitting dresses and chic, translucent shades.",
      "In Kahemba, near the border with Angola, Blouin and her team paused their campaign to help build a base for Angolan independence fighters who had fled from the Portuguese colonial authorities.",
      "She addressed crowds of women, encouraging them to push for gender equality as well as Congo's independence. She also had a knack for organising and strategy.",
      "Soon, the colonial powers and international press caught wind of Blouin's work. They accused her of being, among many things, Nkrumah's mistress, S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9's agent and \"the courtesan of all the African chiefs of state\".",
      "She attracted even more attention when she met Lumumba.",
      "In her book, Blouin describes him as a \"lithe and elegant\" man whose \"name was written in letters of gold in the Congo skies\".",
      "When the country clinched its independence in 1960, Lumumba became its first prime minister. He was just 34 years old.",
      "Lumumba selected Blouin as his \"chief of protocol\" and speechwriter. The pair worked together so closely that the press dubbed them \"Lumum-Blouin\".",
      "Blouin was described by the US's Time magazine as a \"handsome 41-year-old\" whose \"steel will and quick energy make her an invaluable political aide\".",
      "But a slew of disasters struck team Lumum-Blouin - and the newly formed government - just a few days into their tenure.",
      "Firstly, the army revolted against their white Belgium commanders, sparking violence across the nation. Then, Belgium, the UK and US backed secession in Katanga, a mineral-rich region that all three Western nations had interests in. Belgian paratroopers swooped back into the country, supposedly to restore security.",
      "Blouin described the events as a \"war of nerves\", with traitors \"organising everywhere\".",
      "She wrote that Lumumba was a \"true hero of modern times\", but also admitted she thought he was na\u00efve and, at times, too soft.",
      "\"It is true that those who are of the best faith are often the most cruelly deceived,\" she said.",
      "Within seven months of Lumumba taking charge, army chief of staff Joseph Mobutu seized power.",
      "On the 17 January Lumumba was assassinated by firing squad, with the tacit backing of Belgium. It is possible the UK was complicit, while the US had organised previous plots to kill Lumumba - fearing that he was sympathetic to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.",
      "In her book, Blouin said the shock and grief caused by Lumumba's death left her speechless.",
      "\"Never before had I been left without torrents of things to say,\" she wrote.",
      "She was living in Paris at the time of the killing, having being forced into exile after Mobutu's coup.",
      "To ensure Blouin would not talk to the international press, the authorities made her family - who had moved to Congo - stay in the country as \"hostages\".",
      "The separation was crushing for Blouin, who, as Eve describes, was \"very protective\" and \"very maternal\".",
      "Reflecting on her mother's personality, Eve adds: \"One wouldn't want to antagonise her because even though she had a big and generous heart, she could be rather volatile.\"",
      "While Blouin was in exile, soldiers looted her family home and brutally beat her mother with a gun, permanently damaging her spine.",
      "Blouin's family were finally able to join her after months of separation.",
      "They spent a brief period in Algeria - where they were offered sanctuary by the country's first post-independence President, Ahmed Ben Bella.",
      "They then settled in Paris. Blouin remained involved in pan-Africanism from afar \"in the form of articles and almost daily meetings\", Eve wrote in the memoir's epilogue.",
      "When Blouin began writing her autobiography in the 1970s, she still had great reverence for the independence movements she had dedicated herself to.",
      "She had high praise for S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, who by that point had established a one-party state and was ruthlessly suppressing freedom of expression.",
      "Blouin did however grow deeply despondent that Africa had not become \"free\", as she had hoped.",
      "\"It is not the outsiders who have damaged Africa the most, but the mutilated will of the people and the selfishness of some of our own leaders,\" she wrote.",
      "She grieved the death of her dream, so much so that she refused to take medication for the cancer that was ravaging her body.",
      "\"It was terrible to watch. I was absolutely powerless,\" Eve said.",
      "Blouin passed away in Paris on 9 April 1986, at the age of 65. According to Eve, her mother's death was met by the world with \"dreary indifference\".",
      "She remains an inspiration in some corners, however. In DR Congo's capital, Kinshasa, a cultural centre named after Blouin offers the likes of educational programmes, conferences, and film screenings - all underpinned by a pan-African ethos.",
      "And through My Country, Africa, Blouin's extraordinary story is being released for a second time, this time into a world that shows greater interest in the historical contributions of women.",
      "New readers will learn of the girl who went from being stashed away by the colonial system, to fighting for the freedom of millions of black Africans.",

    "title": "Saving a species: The slow return of the Iberian lynx",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 01:28:52 GMT",
    "summary": "After edging close to extinction, there are now some 2,000 Iberian lynxes in Spain and Portugal.",
    "story": [
      "With his leopard-like spots, Navarro - a male lynx - calls out during mating season as he walks towards a camera trap.",
      "Just short of 100cm (39 inches) in length and 45cm in height, the Iberian lynx is a rare sight. But there are now more than 2,000 in the wild across Spain and Portugal, so you're much more likely to see them than you were 20 years ago.",
      "\"The Iberian lynx was very, very close to extinction,\" says Rodrigo Serra, who runs the reproduction programme across Spain and Portugal.",
      "At the lowest point there were fewer than 100 lynxes left in two populations that didn't interact, and only 25 of them were females of reproductive age.",
      "\"The only feline species that was threatened at this level was the sabre tooth tiger thousands of years ago.\"",
      "The decline of the lynx population was partly down to more and more land being used for agriculture, a rise in fatalities on the roads, and a struggle for food.",
      "Wild rabbits are essential prey for the lynx and two pandemics led to a 95% fall in their number.",
      "By 2005, Portugal had no lynxes left, but it was also the year that Spain saw the first litter born in captivity.",
      "It took another three years before Portugal decided on a national conservation action plan to save the species. A National Breeding Centre for Iberian lynxes was built in Silves in the Algarve.",
      "Here they are monitored 24 hours a day. The aim is twofold \u2013 to prepare them for life in the wild and to pair them for reproduction.",
      "Serra speaks in a whisper, because even from a distance of 200m you can cause stress to the animals in the 16 pens where most of the animals are kept.",
      "Sometimes, though, stress is exactly what the lynxes need.",
      "\"When we notice a litter is becoming a bit more confident, we go in and chase them and make noise so they are scared again and climb the fences,\" says Serra. \"We're training them not to get close to people in the wild.\"",
      "That's partly for their own protection, but also so they stay away from people and their animals. \"A lynx should be a lynx, not be treated like a house cat.\"",
      "So the lynxes never associate food with people, they are fed through a tunnel system at the centre.",
      "Then, when the time comes, they are released into the wild.",
      "Genetics determines where they end up, to diminish the risks of inbreeding or disease. Even if a lynx was born in Portugal it might be taken to Spain.",
      "Pedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in Portugal and has studied the Iberian lynx for 30 years.",
      "\"As a biologist there are two things that strike me when I'm handling a lynx. It's an animal with a fairly small head for its body and extraordinarily wide paws. That gives them an impulse and ability to jump which are rare.\"",
      "The breeding programme and the return of the lynx have been hailed as great successes, but as their numbers climb there may be problems too.",
      "As lynxes are often released on private land in Portugal, the organisers of the reproduction programme have to reach an agreement with the owners first.",
      "Where the animals go after that is up to them, and although there have been some attacks on chicken coops, Sarmento says there have not been many.",
      "\"This can lead to uneasiness within locals. We've been strengthening the coops so lynxes can't access them, and in some cases we keep monitoring the lynxes and scare them off if needed.\"",
      "He recounts the story of L\u00edtio, one of the first lynxes released in Portugal.",
      "For six months L\u00edtio stayed in the same area but then the team lost track of him.",
      "He eventually made his way to Do\u00f1ana, a national park in southern Spain where he had come from originally.",
      "As L\u00edtio was sick, he was treated and then returned to the reproduction team in the Algarve.",
      "Within days of his release from the centre he began heading back to Do\u00f1ana, swimming across the Guadiana river to reach Spain.",
      "For a time he disappeared, but eventually he was brought back to the Algarve.",
      "When he was released for a third time, L\u00edtio did not venture back to Spain but instead he walked 3km (two miles), found a female and never moved again.",
      "\"He is the oldest lynx we have here, and he's fathered plenty of cubs ever since,\" says Sarmento.",
      "Three decades after Spain decided to save the lynx, the species is no longer endangered, and Sarmento hopes it'll reach a favourable conservation status by 2035.",
      "For that to happen, the numbers need to reach 5,000-6,000 in the wild.",
      "\"I saw the species disappearing. It's surreal that we're in a place where we can see lynxes in nature or through camera trapping almost daily,\" says Sarmento.",
      "The reproduction team are not being complacent and there are risks involved in their work. Last year 80% of lynx deaths took place on the roads.",
      "For now, though, they feel confident the Iberian lynx has been saved.",

    "title": "Trump's eyeing Greenland - but other Arctic investment is frozen",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 00:06:10 GMT",
    "summary": "While Trump eyes Greenland, Norway and Russia have put the brakes on their polar region investments.",
    "story": [
      "The Arctic recently made headlines after Donald Trump repeated his desire to buy Greenland. Trump cited national security interests, but for many the territory's vast mineral wealth is the main attraction. Yet economic development elsewhere in the vast polar region has ground to a halt.",
      "Working conditions in the Arctic Ocean are extremely challenging at this time of the year for Norwegian fisherman Sondre Alnes-Bonesmo.",
      "The sun last rose at the end of October, and it is not due to appear in the sky again until the middle of February.",
      "In addition to the endless dark, temperatures can plummet below minus 40C, and storms can bring vast waves.",
      "Mr Alnes-Bonesmo, 30, works two six-hour shifts a day, during five-week tours on a ship called Granit. One of the largest factory trawlers fishing in Arctic waters north of Norway, and off the coast of Greenland, it doesn't stop for winter.",
      "Unsurprisingly, he prefers the endless daylight of summer. \"I do like it when the weather is nice, as we're not sent crashing into the walls and such, the way we are during storms, when the waves can be fairly big,\" he grins in understatement.",
      "Mr Alnes-Bonesmo is a participant in the so-called Arctic \"cold rush\".",
      "A play on words with gold rush, it began in earnest around 2008 when a series of reports identified vast mineral and hydrocarbon reserves across the Arctic region. Reserves that, together with large fishing stocks, could continue to become more accessible as climate change reduces ice levels.",
      "This reduction in ice has also increasingly opened up Arctic sea routes, north of the Canadian mainland and Russia.",
      "So much so that, in the decade from 2013 to 2023, the total recorded annual distances sailed by ships in the Arctic Sea more than doubled from 6.1 million to 12.9 million miles.",
      "The hope in the longer term is that cargo ships can travel from Asia to Europe and the east coast of the US, through Arctic waters above Canada and Russia.",
      "But the question Mr Alnes-Bonesmo now asks himself is this \u2013 did he arrive too late?",
      "Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 much of the planned economic development of the Arctic region ground to a halt as relations between Russia and the West deteriorated.",
      "\"Russia had great plans in the Arctic,\" says Morten Mejlaender-Larsen, Arctic operation and technology director from Norwegian firm DNV. His company sets rules and standards for the maritime sector.",
      "\"They began constructing regional rescue centres complete with ships and helicopters to facilitate both destination shipping for gas, oil and coal projects in Siberia, as well as for shipping along the Northeast Passage [north of Russia].",
      "\"[But] since the invasion of Ukraine, international shipping in the Northeast passage has all but stopped, apart from a few Chinese ships,\" observes Mr Mejlaender-Larsen.",
      "He adds that Norway has also halted oil and gas exploration in the region. \"It's completely stopped,\" he says.",
      "\"We don't expect to see any further developments in the Barents Sea north of Bear Island.\" This small Norwegian island is some 400km (250 miles) north of Norway's mainland.",
      "Norway's scaled back ambitions in the Arctic have pleased environmentalists who have consistently warned about the impact of drilling for hydrocarbons on both wildlife and the fragile environment of the polar region.",
      "Last month Greenpeace welcomed the decision of the Norwegian government to stop the first round of licensing for deep sea mining in Arctic waters between Norway's Svalbard and Jan Mayen islands.",
      "Commentators say that while poor relations with Russia is a key reason why Norway is wary of ploughing money into Arctic projects, its interest in the polar region had already cooled.",
      "Helene Tofte, director of international cooperation and climate at the Norwegian Shipowners Association, says that in hindsight the outlook for shipping in the Arctic had been \"exaggerated\".",
      "She points out that despite the impact of climate change, the Arctic remains a difficult place in which to operate. \"Conditions in the Arctic can be extremely challenging, even when the absence of sea ice allows passage,\" she says.",
      "\"Large parts of the route are far from emergency response capacities, such as search and rescue, and environmental clean-up resources.",
      "\"Increased shipping in this area would require substantial investments in ships, emergency preparedness, infrastructure, and weather forecasting systems, for a route that is unpredictable and has a short operational season. At present, we have no indication that our members view this as commercially interesting.\"",
      "Mr Mejlaender-Larsen points to a \"belief that thanks to global warming there'll be summers up there. That'll never happen. If it's minus 40C and it gets 3C warmer, it's still not warm.\"",
      "Moreover, Prof Arild Moe, from Norwegian research group Fridtjof Nansen Institute, says the entire cold rush of the Arctic was based on exaggerated assumptions. \"The exuberance was excessive,\" says the expert on oil and gas exploration in the region.",
      "\"What the reports from 2008 referred to weren't actual reserves, but potential and highly uncertain resources, which would be risky, expensive, and difficult to locate and exploit.\"",
      "Regarding Trump's renewed interest in Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, authorities in Greenland and Denmark were again quick to reply that it was not for sale.",
      "Prof Moe says that Trump's \"crude and undiplomatic statement\" shows that the US under Trump eyes both security and economic interests in the island, including its \"rich mineral resources\".",
      "The Danish government also responded by announcing a huge increase in defence spending for Greenland.",
      "Elsewhere in the Arctic, Trump is expected to allow increased oil and gas exploration in Alaska, specifically in the resource rich Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.",
      "This 19 million acre expanse is the US's largest wildlife refuge, and back in 2020 Trump authorised drilling in one section of it.",
      "Meanwhile, Canada is continuing to build a deep-water port at Grays Bay, on the north coast of Nunavut, its most northern territory. Grays Bay is approximately in the centre of the so-called Northwest Passage, the Arctic sea route north of the Canadian mainland.",
      "Back on the Granit fishing ship, Mr Alnes-Bonesmo says that, while he has earned good money, fishing quotas continue to go down to try to preserve stocks in Norwegian Arctic waters.",
      "Nevertheless, he is philosophical. \"After a few years at sea I've grown more scared of the Arctic Ocean, but I've also come to respect and value it for all its power and beauty.\""

    "title": "After bruising election loss, what next for Kamala Harris?",
    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 05:10:34 GMT",
    "summary": "The outgoing vice-president is weighing her options, which could include another White House run, or a bid to be California's governor.",
    "story": [
      "Exactly two months after her election loss to Donald Trump, Vice-President Kamala Harris will preside over the certification of her own defeat.",
      "As president of the Senate, on Monday she will stand at the House Speaker's rostrum to lead the counting of Electoral College votes, officially cementing her rival's triumph two weeks before he returns to the White House.",
      "The circumstances are painful and awkward for a candidate who decried her opponent as an urgent threat to American democracy, but Harris aides insist she will conduct her constitutional and legal duty with seriousness and grace.",
      "It is not the first time a losing candidate will lead the joint session of Congress to count their opponent's presidential electors - Al Gore endured the indignity in 2001 and Richard Nixon in 1961.",
      "But it's a fitting coda to an improbable election that saw Harris elevated from a back-up to the nation's oldest president to the Democratic standard bearer - whose fleeting campaign provided a jolt of hope to her party before a crushing loss exposed deep internal faultlines.",
      "Harris and her team are now deliberating her second act, and weighing whether it includes another run for the White House in 2028 or pursuing a bid for the governor's mansion in her home state of California.",
      "While recent Democratic candidates who lost elections - Al Gore, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton - have decided against seeking the presidency again, aides, allies and donors argue that the groundswell of support Harris captured in her unsuccessful bid and the unusual circumstances of her condensed campaign proves there's still scope for her to seek the Oval Office.",
      "They even point to Donald Trump's own circuitous political path - the former and future president's bookend wins in 2016 and 2024, despite losing as the incumbent in 2020.",
      "But while many Democrats do not blame Harris for Trump's win, some - stung by a bruising loss that has called the party's strategy into question - are deeply sceptical of giving her another shot at the White House. A host of Democratic governors who coalesced behind the vice-president in 2024 but have ambitions of their own are seen by some strategists as fresher candidates with a much better chance of winning.",
      "Harris herself is said to be in no rush to make any decisions, telling advisers and supporters she is open to all the possibilities that await her after Inauguration Day on 20 January.",
      "She is assessing the last few months, which saw her launch an entirely new White House campaign, vet a running-mate, lead a party convention and barnstorm the country in just 107 days. And aides point out that she remains the US vice-president, at least for another two weeks.",
      "\"She has a decision to make and you can't make it when you're still on the treadmill. It may have slowed down \u2013 but she's on the treadmill until 20 January,\" said Donna Brazile, a close Harris ally who advised the campaign.",
      "\"You can't put anyone in a box. We didn't put Al Gore in a box and it was obvious the country was very divided after the 2000 election,\" said Brazile, who ran Gore's campaign against George W Bush and pointed to his second life as an environmental activist. \"All options are on the table because there's an appetite for change and I do believe that she can represent that change in the future.\"",
      "But the nagging question that shadows any potential 2028 run is whether the 60-year-old can separate herself from Joe Biden - something she failed to do in the election campaign.",
      "Her allies in the party say that Biden's choice to seek re-election despite worries about his age, only then to ultimately drop out of the race with months to go, doomed her candidacy.",
      "Though Trump swept all seven battleground states and is the first Republican in 20 years to win the popular vote, his margin of victory was relatively narrow while Harris still won 75 million votes, an outcome her supporters argue can't be ignored as a currently faceless Democratic party rebuilds over the next four years.",
      "On the other side, those close to Biden remain convinced he could have defeated Trump again, despite surveys showing he had been bleeding support from key Democratic voting blocs.",
      "They point out that Harris fell short where the president didn't in 2020, underperforming with core Democratic groups like black and Latino voters. Critics continue to bring up her 2019 campaign to become the Democratic presidential nominee, which sputtered out in less than a year.",
      "\"People forget that had there been a real primary [in 2024], she never would have been the nominee. Everyone knows that,\" said one former Biden adviser.",
      "The adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, applauded Harris for reviving the Democratic base and helping key congressional races, but said Trump's campaign successfully undercut her on critical campaign issues including the economy and the border.",
      "Members of Trump's team, however, including his chief pollster, have acknowledged that Harris performed stronger as a candidate than Biden on certain issues like the economy among voters.",
      "Yet there's no escaping that any Democratic primary contest for 2028 would be a tough fight, with rising stars like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and California Governor Gavin Newsom already weighing presidential runs.",
      "Some Democrats say that Harris would nonetheless start ahead of the pack, with national name recognition, a much-coveted mailing list and a deep bench of volunteers.",
      "\"What state party would not want her to come help them set the table for the 2026 midterm elections?\" Brazile said. \"She's going to have plenty opportunities not only to rebuild, but to strengthen the coalition that came together to support her in 2024.\"",
      "Others have suggested she could step out of the political arena entirely, running a foundation or establishing an institute of politics at her alma mater, Howard University, the Washington-based historically black college where she held her election night party.",
      "The former top state prosecutor could also be a contender for secretary of state or attorney general in a future Democratic administration. And she'll need to decide if she wants to write another book.",
      "For all of her options, Harris has told aides, she wants to remain visible and be seen as a leader in the party. One adviser suggested that she could exist outside the domestic political fray, taking on a more global role on an issue that matters to her, but that's a difficult perch without a platform as large as the vice-presidency.",
      "In the waning days of the Biden-Harris administration, she plans to embark on an international trip to multiple regions, according to a source familiar with the plans, signalling her desire to maintain a role on the world stage and build a legacy beyond being Biden's number two.",
      "For Harris and her team, the weeks since the election have been humbling, a mix of grief and resolve. Several aides described the three-month sprint that began when Biden dropped out as having begun with the campaign \"digging out of a hole\" and ending with their candidate more popular than when she began, even if she didn't win.",
      "\"There's a sense of peace knowing that given the hand we were dealt, we ran through the tape,\" said one senior aide.",
      "Following the election, Harris and her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, spent a week in Hawaii with a small group of aides to relax and discuss her future.",
      "During a staff holiday party at her official residence before Christmas, Harris recounted election night and how she delivered a pep talk to her family as the results became clear.",
      "\"We are not having a pity party!\" she told the crowd of her reaction that night.",
      "Advisers and allies say she is still processing what happened, and wants to wait and see how the new administration unfolds in January before staking out any position, let alone seeking to become the face of any so-called Trump \"resistance\".",
      "Democrats have found the resistance movement that took off among liberals in the wake of his 2016 win no longer resonates in today's political climate, where the Republican has proven that his message and style appeals to a huge cross-section of Americans.",
      "They have adopted a more conciliatory approach in confronting the incoming president's agenda. As several Democrats put it: \"What resistance?\"",
      "Though she's kept a relatively low profile since her loss, Harris provided a glimpse of her mindset at an event for students at Prince George's Community College in Maryland in December.",
      "\"The movements for civil rights, women's rights, workers' rights, the United States of America itself, would never have come to be if people had given up their cause after a court case, or a battle, or an election did not go their way,\" she said.",
      "\"We must stay in the fight,\" she added, a refrain she has repeated since her 2016 Senate win. \"Everyone of us.\"",
      "What that means is less clear. For some donors and supporters, staying \"in the fight\" could translate to a run for California governor in 2026, when a term-limited Gavin Newsom will step down and potentially pursue his own White House ambitions. The job, leading the world's fifth-largest economy, would also put Harris in direct conflict with Trump, who has regularly assailed the state for its left-leaning policies.",
      "But governing a major state is no small feat, and would derail any presidential run,  as she would be sworn into office about the same time she would need to launch a national campaign.",
      "Those who have spoken to Harris said she remains undecided about the governor's race, which some allies have described as a potential \"capstone\" to her career.",
      "She has won statewide office three times as California's attorney general and later as a US senator. But a gubernatorial win would give her another historic honour - becoming the nation's first black female governor.",
      "Still, some allies acknowledge it would be difficult to transition from being inside a 20-car motorcade and having a seat across the table from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the governor's mansion.",
      "The private sector is another option.",
      "\"For women at other levels of office, when they lose an election, sometimes options are not as available to them compared to men, who get a soft landing at a law firm or insurance business, and it gives them a place to take a beat, make some money and then make decisions about what's next,\" said Debbie Walsh, director for the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.",
      "\"I don't think that's going to be a problem for Kamala Harris. I think doors will open for her if she wants to open them.\"",
      "But for Harris, who has been in elected office for two decades, and worked as a public prosecutor before that, an afterlife as governor may be the most fitting option.",
      "\"When you've had one client \u2013 the people \u2013 for the entirety of your career,\" said one former adviser, \"where do you go from here?\""

    "summary": "An increasingly popular symphony orchestra concert is a screening of a movie such as \"Jaws\" accompanied by a live performance of the music\u2014reeling in new audiences to the concert hall.",
    "story": [
      "The worst way to watch \"Jaws\" is without music. A good way is to watch it with John Williams' famous score coming from your speakers. But the best way to watch \"Jaws\" might be with a live orchestra playing that iconic score.",
      "The New York Philharmonic plays for four movies a year at Lincoln Center. Almost every showing is sold out.",
      "\"A live orchestra absolutely reaches people in a way that no recorded sound can even approximate,\" said the Philharmonic's former acting CEO Deborah   Borda. \"It's like you're sitting in the middle of the orchestra.\"",
      "In the silent film days, live music always accompanied movies, and movies were events.",
      "\"Over the years, theaters got smaller,\" said Steve Linder. \"Then, people started watching it on their television. Then they watch it on their computer. Then they watch that on their phone.\"",
      "Linder is the cofounder of Film Concerts Live, one of several companies that rent out the sheet music and equipment that orchestras need to perform one of these movies. \"What we do is we bring moviegoing back to what it was originally intended to be, with live music, and in a communal experience.\"",
      "But for Borda, one of the best features of live movie scores is the way they attract new and younger audiences to the concert hall. \"Almost 50% of the people who come to our film series are first-time attendees of the New York Philharmonic, and the first time in the hall,\" she said.",
      "For the conductor, these shows are tricky. You have to keep one eye on the musicians, one eye on the score, and one eye on a special monitor running the film. But how does the conductor know exactly when to bring in the orchestra in sync with the action? That's the purpose of moving vertical bars called streamers. Those streamers and the bright dots are like countdowns to important musical moments.",
      "Anthony Parnther conducted the Philharmonic's screenings of \"Jaws.\" But his main gig is conducting the actual Hollywood recording sessions for films, such as \"Oppenheimer,\" \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" and \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\"",
      "Asked if there is a feeling among his fellow conductors that such concerts are more crowd-pleasers than art, Parnther replied, \"All I know is that when I turn around from my score to address the audience, every seat is filled.\"",
      "So, how flexible is conducting a score live to a film? \"I have a little bit of license to phrase the orchestra around the streamers,\" Parnther said. \"There could be a little bit of variance. And I think that's what makes these particularly appealing for the musicians to perform and for conductors to conduct.\"",
      "These days, there are over a thousand live-orchestra movie screenings a year. The classic blockbusters usually work best, from \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Superman\" to \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Lord of the Rings.\"",
      "\"It has to be great music that the audience wants to hear, of course,\" said Linder. \"But also it has to be great music that the orchestra is interested in playing.\"",
      "Ryan Roberts is the New York Philharmonic's English horn and oboe player. Unfortunately, during the projection concerts, he sits directly under the screen, so he never gets to see any of the movies, even when he's not playing.",
      "\"But we have a few sneaky ways of watching the movie in the woodwind section,\" Roberts said. His favorite? A rearview mirror he bought on Amazon. \"We tape it right on top of our stand lights.\"",
      "And management approves of this? \"I plead the fifth!\" Roberts laughed.",
      "With the New York Philharmonic performing four performances of four films a year, which all sell out, shouldn't they do 10 performances of each film? Borda said, \"This is a symphony orchestra. We play Mahler. We play Bach. We play Mozart. We have a responsibility to the canon of music. And no, we're not a movie house; we're a symphony orchestra.\"",
      "Well, OK. But even Borda acknowledges that live-orchestra movies have become a popular and important option for American orchestras. \"We should be places that are integrated into the fabric of the community,\" she said. \"And so, we want the New York Philharmonic to be as popular as the New York Yankees or the Mets. And movies can help get us there.\"",

    "summary": "In the sweeping new period drama, Adrien Brody stars as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth, a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and seeks to rebuild his career after emigrating to America.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, on a boat called the Manhattan, Adrien Brody and I sailed into New York Harbor.\u00a0 Destination: The Statue of Liberty. He'd been to the landmark before, spending time there with his mother, an immigrant who came to America in 1958.",
      "\"My mother and my grandparents fled Hungary during the revolution,\" Brody said. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss. And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"",
      "Brody's immigrant roots make his latest film, \"The Brutalist,\" a deeply personal one. It's a sweeping, decades-long tale of love, ambition, and a complicated American Dream, all centered around one man, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth. \"He's a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and is forced to toil through poverty and rebuild,\" Brody said.",
      "Toth is hired by a wealthy industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete.",
      "To get Toth just right, Brody drew on his memories of his Hungarian grandfather. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said.",
      "\"So, do you hear your grandfather's voice a little bit in this character of L\u00e1szl\u00f3?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh definitely, yeah, I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Brutalist\" click on the video player below:",
      "The film's received seven Golden Globe nominations, and Oscar buzz is high. But at three-and-a-half hours, it requires a commitment.",
      "Asked if he was worried about the film's length, Broday replied, \"This is an event. Generations before us, you could expect to see something like this in a theater. But that's becoming much more rare today. I think we all need to be fed nourishing meals! And this is one of them.\"",
      "At 51, Brody's portrayal of a man rebuilding his life after a war makes for a fascinating counterpoint to a role he played more than two decades ago: his Oscar-winning performance of a man enduring the horrors of war in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist.\"",
      "To play Wladyslaw Szpilman, the real-life pianist who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland, Brody virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning to play the piano.",
      "Learning to play Chopin, he said, quelled his pangs of hunger. \"'Cause it was a kind of meditative, intensely-focused activity where I was memorizing. And I became quite proficient at playing minutes of Chopin's Nocturne and a ballade. And I don't even read music.\"",
      "At 29, he was the youngest man to ever win the Oscar for best actor. The child of an immigrant was living his own American dream.",
      "Adrien Brody was raised in Queens, N.Y. His father, Elliot, is a retired teacher.\u00a0 His mother, Sylvia Plachy, is a photographer. \"As an only child and the son of a photographer, I was her favorite subject,\" he said. \"And so, I had a lens from a very nurturing and ever-present perspective on me. And I think that also helped as a film actor.\"",
      "\"You were comfortable in front of a camera thanks to Mom?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes. Thanks to Mom.\"",
      "He dabbled in magic, calling himself \"The Amazing Adrien,\" but settled on acting by middle school. At 13, he landed a leading role as a rebellious orphan in a made-for-TV movie, \"Home at Last.\" \u00a0\"I remember thinking how I never wanted it to end,\" he said. \"And that sense of joy that I get from it in that immersion, it's never gone away.\"",
      "Brody aged into a mohawked punk rocker in Spike Lee's \"Summer of Sam.\" He's carried a blockbuster like \"King Kong,\" and shown some whimsy in his five films with director Wes Anderson, including \"The Darjeeling Limited\" and \"The French Dispatch.\"",
      "Anderson, said Brody, \"has given me a lot of opportunity to do comedic work, more overtly comedic stuff, which at the time when we started working together, I think people just thought I was a serious actor.\"",
      "\"The Brutalist\" is a return to his serious side, and maybe a reminder that, as an artist, Adrien Brody is up for anything. \"It's a nice moment right now,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"When you're not working, what makes you happy?\"",
      "\"Lots of things. I need to be creatively immersed. So, that may be fulfilled through cooking, through painting, through making music. I'm a pretty good cook.\"",
      "\"What do you make?\"",
      "\"I mean, hot dogs,\" he laughed. \"What do you like? You tell me what would you like? I can whip something up. You can come over one day, come see the artwork. I'll whip up something to eat. I can make some good cocktails.\"",
      "\"You're a mixologist as well?\"",
      "\"Oh, I can hook it up.\"",

      "Drawing on those experiences helped Swinton earn an acting nomination for Sunday's Golden Globes. In \"The Room Next Door,\" she portrays a woman with a terminal cancer diagnosis. Her character, Martha, faces questions about how to live. \"My first 'Martha,' if you like, was Derek Jarman,\" she said. The director, artist and gay activist (who cast Swinton in her first film, \"Caravaggio\"), was diagnosed with HIV in 1986.",
      "The Oscar-winner credits Jarman with finding her a home in cinema, and showing her how collaborative filmmaking could be. They made seven feature films together before his death, in 1994.",
      "She said, \"He modeled a kind of attitude to his dismount that I drew on, like, to my core, for myself, and in fact I have reflected in the portrait of Martha.\"",

      "\"Well, an attitude, yeah, that I've seen played out, that I've witnessed \u2013 my parents, my children's beloved father, John Byrne, who died last year,\" she replied. \"It's been such a privilege to be in that hot seat beside them and seeing them face the inevitable with such dignity and humor and wit, and just power.\"",
      "\"The Room Next Door\" is the first English-language feature film by Spanish director Pedro Almod\u00f3var. Swinton's co-star, Julianne Moore, is another Academy Award-winner. \"He asked me who I wanted,\" said Swinton. \"It was her face that I saw at the end of the bed.

      "Asked about the expressiveness of her eyes, and of how much she can \"say\" without saying anything, Swinton said, \"I suppose I started in silent cinema with Derek Jarman. I actually prefer silent cinema.\"",
      "Why? \"I loved it first,\" she said. \"And then when I started working with Derek, I found my comfort zone in front of a silent camera. I think it's a very rare screenplay that is able to approach what I'm really interested in, which is inarticulacy. Even now, I sort of know what I want to say to you, but I can't pull the words out my ear, and they're coming out a little wrong.\"",
      "I asked, \"Can you say it with your eyes?\"",

      "I asked, \"You've done a lot of films, but you can seem so serious \u2026 Like this? Not at all. There is a curiosity and a warmth, and you jump out.\"",
      "\"The jumping out, I get. The seriousness, I am a little confused by.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\"",
      "\"I am always doing comedy,\" she said. \"I feel everything I do is funny. But I think maybe because I'm a shy person and I don't tend to smile with my teeth all over the place, there's has been an assumption that there was more seriousness than nonsense, but there is a hell of a lot of nonsense.\"",
      "\"You're a shy person?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"You picked a tough career for that!\"",

      "So, when she's alone on the red carpet, she finds that ensemble approach through fashion.\u00a0 \"It's very playful. My relationship with fashion is entirely dependent on my relationship with certain individuals who are my friends, who happen to be some of the greatest designers in the world, who give me clothes. And that makes going out into a public arena when you are someone who is not an extrovert, not only much easier, but actually possible.\"",
      "When we met in Paris. Swinton had just flown in from a trip to China for Chanel. She was wearing a military coat: \"I first fell in love with my father's uniforms. My mother was always in some nice silk dress, but I was really interested in my father's uniform.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 17:10:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The iconic ruby slippers sold for a total of $32.5 million at auction last month. The slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids.",
    "story": [
      "A man accused of long hiding a stolen pair of sequined ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in \"The Wizard of Oz\" plans to plead guilty, his attorney confirmed Friday.",
      "The slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in Minneapolis in 2018.",
      "They fetched a record price for movie memorabilia when they were auctioned off for $32.5 million last month, according to Heritage Auctions, which conducted the sale. The buyer still has not been revealed.",
      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, now 77, of Crystal, Minnesota, was charged last March with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering.",
      "He's expected to plead not guilty when he's arraigned Monday before a federal magistrate judge, a formality because magistrate judges can't accept guilty pleas in felony cases in Minnesota. But the district judge overseeing the case on Friday scheduled a change of plea hearing for Jan. 10.",
      "Saliterman's attorney, John C. Brink, confirmed to The Associated Press that his client will change his plea then to guilty, but he declined to give details about any potential plea agreement. The U.S. Attorney's Office for North Dakota, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment.",
      "The man who stole the slippers, Terry Jon Martin, now 77, pleaded guilty in 2023 to theft of a major artwork, admitting to what his attorney said was an attempt to pull off \"one last score\" after turning from a life of crime. The 76-year-old Grand Rapids man was sentenced to time served, one year of supervised release and $23,000 in restitution to the museum.",
      "The indictment against Saliterman says that from August 2005 to July 2018, he \"received, concealed, and disposed of an object of cultural heritage.\" Saliterman, according to the indictment, knew they were stolen, and that he threatened to release a sex tape of a woman and \"take her down with him\" if she did keep her mouth shut about the slippers.",
      "Saliterman is also in poor health. He was in a wheelchair and on supplemental oxygen last March during his first court appearance.",
      "Authorities have not said how Martin and Saliterman might have been connected. Martin, who lives near Grand Rapids, said at his plea hearing in October 2023 that he hoped to sell what he thought were real rubies from the shoes. But a person who deals in stolen goods, known as a fence, informed him the rubies weren't real, he said. Martin said he then got rid of the slippers, but declined to say how he did so.",
      "Garland's character, Dorothy, wore several pairs while filming the classic 1939 musical, but only four pairs are known to remain. Hollywood memorabilia collector Michael Shaw had loaned his pair to the museum before Martin stole them. Shaw eventually got them back, and had them auctioned last month.",
      "Garland was born Frances Gumm in 1922. She lived in Grand Rapids, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of Minneapolis, until she was 4 years old. She died in 1969. The Judy Garland Museum says it has the world's largest collection of Garland and \"Wizard of Oz\" memorabilia.",

      "\"No fees, no licenses, no tracking down the person who owns it, no permission,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024.",
      "How does the public domain work?",
      "Copyright protects an original work for a finite amount of time. When this protection expires, the work enters the public domain. The founding fathers wrote this concept into the U.S. Constitution under the intellectual property clause, intended \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\"",
      "However, the laws governing the public domain can be tricky. For example: Although Mickey Mouse returned to the people in 2024, this classification only applied to his first appearance in 1928's \"Steamboat Willie.\" It was not until 1929 that Mickey began wearing white gloves, meaning any public reinterpretation showcasing this characteristic could have been liable for copyright infringement until this year.",
      "When does intellectual property enter the public domain?",
      "In the U.S., the length of copyright protection for a certain property depends on various elements. Generally, for works published or registered before 1978, the term lasts 95 years. For works created after this date, protection typically lasts for the author's life plus 70 years.",
      "\"The public domain doesn't represent the death of copyright,\" said Jenkins. \"It's just the second part of copyright's life cycle.\"",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2026?",
      "2026 will be another exciting year for the public domain with works from 1930 losing their copyright. Protection will run out for the earliest versions of Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse's dog Pluto and his friend Clarabelle Cow, teen detective Nancy Drew, M.C.

      "A judicial officer confirmed Monday the judge's decision and said that one of the two people ordered to be put under preventive prison \u2014 a form of pre-trial detention \u2014 was an employee of the hotel in Buenos Aires where Payne stayed until he died after falling from the balcony of his room in October.",
      "The officer said the other person was a waiter Payne met in a restaurant. The officer, who requested not to be identified as a condition to talk about the ruling, said that both face charges for supplying drugs and they need to present themselves before the judge.",
      "The judge also charged three other people with manslaughter, including a businessman who was with Payne in Argentina and two managers of the hotel. The official said that they were not ordered to be held under preventive prison.",
      "The hotel manager and hotel reception manager who were charged saw Payne intoxicated and unable to stand in the hotel lobby prior to his death, according to a\u00a0news release from the prosecutor's office. Authorities said the manager permitted Payne to be taken up to his room, which had a balcony, and the reception manager helped bring him up to his room, instead of keeping him in a place without sources of danger and with company until medical help could arrive.",
      "In November, prosecutors filed initial charges against three people, but they didn't reveal their names.",
      "Payne fell from his room's balcony on the third floor of his hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo in the Argentine capital. His autopsy said he died from multiple injuries and external bleeding.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 06:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, her lawyer says, apparently ending one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.",
    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, ending one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history but not every legal issue between them.",
      "Jolie and Pitt signed off on a default declaration filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Monday, saying they've entered into a written agreement on their marital and property rights. The filing says they give up the right to any future spousal financial support but gives no other details. A judge will need to sign off on the agreement.",
      "The settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "Jolie's lawyer, James Simon, told CBS News in a statement that, \"More than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt. She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\"",
      "A representative for Pitt declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood's most prominent pairings for 12 years, two of them as a married couple. The Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A representative for Pitt, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly, strongly denied Jolie's allegations.",
      "During the long divorce fight, four of the couple's six children became adults, negating the need for a custody agreement for them. The only two who are still minors are 16-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. In June, one of their daughters, then known as Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, successfully petitioned to remove Pitt's name from hers.",
      "Their other children are 23-year-old Maddox, 21-year-old Pax and 19-year-old Zahara.",
      "There have been no official court actions in the case in nearly a year, and no indication that the two had been nearing an agreement.",
      "Some details on their disputes, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. Jolie instead sold her part of the winery, Chateau Miraval, to the Tenute del Mondo wine group, a subsidiary of the Stoli Group, which Pitt said was a \"vindictive\" move that ruined a private space that had been a second home.",
      "Jolie's attorneys said the winery sale agreement broke down over Pitt's demand that as part of the deal she sign a wide-ranging non-disclosure agreement about him. In court documents, she called that an attempt to cover up his physical abuse of her, which she said turned toward the children on the 2016 flight.",
      "It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect the winery lawsuit.",
      "Publicly, both Pitt and Jolie have been extremely tight-lipped on everything surrounding their split, despite robust promotional tours and many media appearances for various projects.",
      "Pitt said in a 2017 interview with GQ that he had had a drinking problem at the time of the plane incident and the split, but had since become sober and was going to therapy. He has not defended his behavior on the family flight.",
      "Jolie has also declined to make any public statements about the family issues or the divorce, though she has sought a broader examination and airing of his behavior by the courts in both the divorce and winery cases.",
      "Both Jolie and Pitt were among the most elite stars in film when they began dating in 2004, after co-starring as hitman-and-hitwoman spouses in \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith,\" and remained atop the Hollywood A-list throughout their coupling. The daughter of Hollywood luminary Jon Voight and the star of \"Maleficent\" and \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,\" Jolie won an Oscar for her performance in 1999's \"Girl, Interrupted.\"",
      "Pitt, the star of \"Fight Club\" and \"Inglourious Basterds,\" thrived as both actor and producer after the split. He won his own Academy Award for 2019's \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,\" the crowning achievement in an awards season that some in media framed as a redemption and brought major public affection for him.",
      "Jolie has kept a less visible profile in the years since the divorce, though she directed several films and appeared in several more while trying to focus on raising the children.",
      "She has very much returned to the Oscar conversation this year for her portrayal of the legendary soprano Maria Callas in \"Maria.\"",

    "story": [
      "Emergency room visits with influenza are now \"very high\" nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday, in this week's update on the winter respiratory virus season.",
      "This season's wave of flu cases is arriving later than it has in the past two years. After the COVID-19 pandemic, annual waves of influenza during the colder months increased weeks earlier than they had during many pre-pandemic seasons.",
      "This year, flu trends look to be closely in line with the 2019 to 2020 season, which also reached peak levels around the New Year.",
      "Some of the highest levels of influenza are now in Western states, several of which have already topped the peaks recorded during the worst of last winter's flu season.",
      "In Oregon, the CDC's data show 8.4% of emergency room visits involved flu at the end of December. This is now more than three times higher than the peak reached last season.",
      "\"You can see that in Dec. 2022, we also had a very large spike in flu cases, but this year has been significantly higher than last year,\" said Sara Hottman, a spokesperson for Oregon Health & Science University Hospital, in an email.",
      "According to figures shared by Hottman for the hospital and the other health care facilities in their system, 1,101 cases of influenza were treated in November and December of 2024, up from 251 cases during the same months in 2023.",
      "Daily tallies of flu patients now rank as among the highest in recent years at the hospital, second only to a record surge during the 2022 to 2023 season.",
      "\"In 2022, the combination of RSV, flu and COVID led to a public health emergency and crisis standards of care among hospitals in the region. We have not experienced that, and do not currently expect to, this year,\" said Hottman.",
      "A \"tripledemic\" is also unlikely to repeat again this year nationwide, experts estimate. This season's influenza wave comes as COVID-19 levels are only now beginning to accelerate in several parts of the country, weeks later than in some previous years.",
      "Updated CDC modeling published over Christmas estimated that this winter's COVID-19 wave is also not expected to be as large as some previous winter surges, in part given the lack so far of a \"new immune-escape variant\" of the virus.",
      "The CDC last estimated that most COVID infections are from the XEC variant, which officials have said is closely related to previous strains. The LP.8.1 strain that variant trackers have been closely monitoring still made up less than 1 in 10 cases.",
      "The latest data from CDC's wastewater surveillance suggests that COVID-19 levels have only recently crossed from \"moderate\" to \"high\" levels nationwide.",
      "Levels of the virus in wastewater are worst across the Midwest, though they remain far below the peaks seen during last winter's wave.",

      "\"The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is advising residents to not feed their pets Monarch Raw Pet Food sold at several farmers markets in California,\" the agency said, noting that an L.A. county house cat that was fed the product had been confirmed to have the virus. Four other cats from the same home were \"presumed to have also been positive for H5 bird flu after consuming the product.\"",
      "The health department urged residents who fed their pets the Monarch raw food products or any other raw meat or dairy items and noticed their animal exhibiting any unusual behavior to immediately contact their veterinarian.",

      "Northwest Naturals, a pet food company in Portland, Oregon, announced a voluntary recall Tuesday of one batch of its 2-pound Feline Turkey Recipe raw frozen pet food after it tested positive for the virus. The product was sold in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin, as well as Canada's British Columbia.",

These include barn and feral cats, indoor cats, and big cats in zoos and in the wild.",
      "Dogs seem to be less vulnerable than cats, but they should eat only thoroughly cooked foods, Bailey said.",
      "Cats should not drink unpasteurized dairy products or eat raw meat, Bailey said, and pet owners should keep cats away from wild birds, livestock and poultry.",

      "If your cat is usually playful and likes to look out the window, but instead has been sleeping all the time or hiding from you, take note, Bailey said. \"There's something wrong,\" he said.",

      "Fans often flock to the home, sometimes with hundreds of cars driving by in a single day, Joanne Quintana\u00a0told Albuquerque television station KOB-TV.",
      "Quintana said her parents purchased the home in the 1970s and that she and her siblings grew up there. As her parents got older and the show's popularity skyrocketed, it became harder to protect them. The family was forced to put up a metal fence and install security cameras to keep fans at bay.",
      "Now that her parents are gone, it's time to sell.",
      "\"This was our family home from 1973, almost 52 years,\" she told the station. \"So we're going to walk away with just our memories. It's time to move on. We're done. There's no reason to fight anymore.\"",
      "Hollywood magic",
      "It was 2006 when a film scout first approached Quintana's mother about shooting a pilot episode at the home. Within months, the equipment was set up and filming began.",
      "The family got to meet Cranston and the other stars and watched from behind the scenes as crew members worked their magic. Quintana's mother was always sure to have cookies for the cast and crew.",
      "The inside of the home was used to prep, while interior scenes were shot in a studio.",

      "Priced to sell?",
      "The housing market in New Mexico's largest city certainly isn't what it would have been when Walter White was applying for a mortgage, and the price paid by Quintana's parents five decades ago is unimaginable now.

    "summary": "The Biden administration blocked the purchase of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel. Here's what that could mean for the once iconic American company.",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration's move on Friday to\u00a0block Nippon Steel's proposed purchase\u00a0of U.S. Steel raises questions about the once iconic American company's future, with industry sources saying the manufacturer could struggle to energize growth or attract rival acquisition bids.",
      "President Biden stopped the $15 billion deal over national security and supply-chain concerns.",
      "U.S. Steel CEO David B. Burritt blasted the decision, calling Mr. Biden's action \"shameful\" and \"corrupt\" in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"He gave a political payback to a union boss out of touch with his members while harming our company's future, our workers and our national security. He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk,\" Burritt said.",
      "Burritt added that the proposed deal \"is what guarantees a great future for U. S. Steel, our employees, our communities and our country.\"",
      "Limited options",
      "Industry experts said that without outside investment from Japan, the U.S-based steel manufacturer's path forward is murky.",
      "\"With foreign ownership seemingly off the table, we see limited avenues moving forward,\" Bill Peterson, metals and mining analyst for JPMorgan said in a research note.",
      "U.S. Steel leaders had warned that without an infusion of capital from Nippon Steel, it would be forced to curtail its legacy blast furnace investments and shift to cheaper nonunion electric arc furnaces. Additionally, executives said U.S. Steel could move its headquarters out of Pittsburgh.",
      "The company could still entertain bids from domestic rivals, said Peterson, noting that U.S. Steel's mini-mill assets could be attractive to peers like steel products company Nucor Group, which considered buying parts of U.S. Steel before dropping out over price concerns.",
      "Others see rival bids as unlikely.",
      "\"No one was ready to follow Nippon Steel and Cliffs above [$50 per share] a year ago,\" BNP Paribas analysts said in a report, referring to Nippon Steel's $55 a share offer, which offered a hefty premium to U.S. Steel shareholders. \"Cliffs no longer has enough firepower while foreign interested parties are now likely to stay well put given the backlash Nippon Steel had to face.\"",
      "Should U.S. Steel choose continue to operate as an independent company, it could focus on growing its Big River steel plant in Arkansas, which it acquired in 2021 and which produces 70% to 80% fewer emissions than typical steel-making processes, according to JPMorgan analysts. In that scenario, the company could simultaneously trim its legacy blast furnace assets over time, they said.",
      "Challenges from both sides",
      "U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel are expected to challenge the Biden administration's ruling, but face an uphill battle.",
      "\"The president's statement and order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision,\" the companies\u00a0said\u00a0in a joint statement Friday. \"Following President Biden's decision, we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.\"",
      "The companies added that the transaction would \"revitalize communities\" that rely on the steel industry, provide steelworkers with job security and improve the American steel supply chain.",
      "Nippon Steel has proposed investing $3 billion in U.S. Steel under the deal.",
      "\"Blocking this transaction means denying billions of committed investment to extend the life of U. S. Steel's aging facilities and putting thousands of good-paying, family-sustaining union jobs at risk,\" the companies said in their statement.",
      "By contrast. the United Steelworkers, the union representing 850,000 workers, cheered the administration's move.",
      "\"It's clear from U.S. Steel's recent financial performance that it can easily remain a strong and resilient company. We now call on U.S. Steel's board of directors to take the necessary steps to allow it to further flourish and remain profitable,\" the union said in\u00a0 a statement.",
      "In December, U.S. Steel\u00a0said\u00a0it expected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of roughly $150 million, undershooting Wall Street forecasts of nearly $262 million. The company reported third-quarter net earnings of $119 million, down from $299 million in the year-ago period. The company's annual revenues, which approached $24 billion in 2008, had slipped to $18 billion by 2023, highlighting its struggle to boost sales.",
      "U.S. Steel shares fell 6.5% on the day to $30.47 and are down 36% from the same period last year.",
      "Antitrust concerns",
      "Even if another domestic rival like Nucor Corporation or Cleveland-Cliffs expressed interest in acquiring some or all of U.S. Steel, antitrust concerns could quash possible transactions.",
      "\"I think they have Federal Trade Commission issues in terms of monopolistic practices when it comes to companies merging,\" said corporate adviser Jay McDonald.",
      "Jeremy Flack, CEO of Flack Global Metal Supply, a midsize metal supplier and a U.S. Steel client, echoed that concern.",
      "\"One nice thing about the Nippon deal was we had a new entrant to the market buying assets, as opposed to continued consolidation in which you eventually get an oligopoly if the steel mills here continue to buy each other up,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "If U.S. Steel can't turn around unprofitable plants, it may have no choice but to close them, Flack said, describing the company's future as uncertain.",
      "\"Blocking this deal doesn't serve anyone \u2014 customers, shareholders, workers or national security,\" he said, while adding, \"It will be challenged in court and we have a new administration coming in, so story is not written yet.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Biden announced Friday that he is blocking the $15 billion proposal by Japan's Nippon Steel to buy U.S. Steel after a government panel recently failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal.",
      "Mr. Biden said his decision is aimed at protecting the nation's security and infrastructure, as well as supply chain resiliency. The U.S., he said, needs domestic companies that represent the majority of the nation's steelmaking capacity to \"keep leading the fight on behalf of America's national interests.\"",
      "Mr. Biden\u00a0long opposed the deal\u00a0and was waiting for a report on the merger to be issued by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, to announce his final decision. The interagency committee, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks, and can block sales or force changes in the terms to protect national security. CFIUS said on Dec. 23 that it was unable to reach a consensus on the deal, leaving it to Mr. Biden.",
      "\"It is my solemn responsibility as president to ensure that, now and long into the future, America has a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry that can continue to power our national sources of strength at home and abroad; and it is a fulfillment of that responsibility to block foreign ownership of this vital American company,\" the president said in a statement Friday announcing his decision to block the deal. \"U.S. Steel will remain a proud American company \u2014 one that's American-owned, American-operated, by American union steelworkers \u2014 the best in the world.\"",
      "An accompanying order prohibiting the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel signed by Mr. Biden said there is \"credible evidence\" that Nippon Steel \"might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\"",
      "\"This action reflects my unflinching commitment to utilize all authorities available to me as president to defend U.S. national security, including by ensuring that American companies continue to play a central role in sectors that are critical for our national security,\" the president's statement said.",
      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel condemned the decision and said in a joint statement they would take \"all appropriate action\" to protect their legal rights. The companies called Mr. Biden's move \"unlawful.\"",
      "\"We are dismayed by President Biden's decision to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U. S. Steel, which reflects a clear violation of due process and the law governing CFIUS,\" the companies said. \"Instead of abiding by the law, the process was manipulated to advance President Biden's political agenda. The president's statement and Order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision.\"",
      "They argued the record before CIFIUS shows the acquisition would strengthen national security and claimed the committee's process was infected by politics.",
      "\"It is shocking \u2014 and deeply troubling \u2014 that the U.S. government would reject a procompetitive transaction that advances U.S. interests and treat an ally like Japan in this way,\" the two companies said. \"Unfortunately, it sends a chilling message to any company based in a U.S. allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States.\"",
      "In a separate statement provided to CBS News, U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt called Mr. Biden's decision \"shameful and corrupt.\"",
      "\"He gave a political payback to a union boss out of touch with his members while harming our company's future, our workers, and our national security,\" Burritt said. \"He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk.\"",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "But a U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",

      "On Tuesday, Nippon Steel, which is headquartered in Japan, proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from CFIUS that was intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase of U.S. Steel could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel during the presidential campaign and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. However, the appeal of Nippon Steel's acquisition was that it has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the U.S.",
      "Trump also opposed the acquisition and vowed in a Truth Social post earlier this month to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",

      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics. U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday, Dec. 23, that the deal was \"the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "Did Apple break any laws?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial.",
      "The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \"fundamental human right.\"",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "Should I be worried about microphones on other devices being used to spy on me?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "How do I disable Siri?",
      "You can turn Apple's virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for 'Hey Siri' and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone.",

      "Each flight was chronically delayed for five consecutive months or more. Despite DOT warning JetBlue about inaccurate flight departure and arrival times on its flight between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, the airline continued to operate three more repeatedly delayed flights between Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, Florida and JFK; and between Fort Lauderdale and Windsor Locks, Connecticut, the agency said.",
      "There were 395 delays and cancellations across these four chronically delayed flights in total, and the DOT's investigation found\u00a0 JetBlue responsible for more than 70% of its chronically delayed flights.",
      "JetBlue said it had invested tens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays over the past two years, and had seen significant improvements in 2024.",
      "\"While we've reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four flights in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the U.S. government, which operates our nation's air traffic control system,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Consumers advocates applauded the government's move to penalize JetBlue.",
      "\"Airlines often don't allow enough time between flights and they often allow for no margin for error,\" Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, said in a statement. \"They often treat travelers like seat numbers, not people who have lives and commitments and plans for everything from vacations to weddings or funerals.\"",
      "What counts as a chronic delay?",
      "The agency has ongoing investigations into other airlines for unrealistic flight schedules that do not reflect actual departure and arrival times. A flight is considered chronically delayed if it is flown at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late more than 50% of the time, with cancellations included as delays, it stated.",
      "The penalty comes as the Biden administration winds down, leaving uncertain how the incoming Trump regime will tackle transportation issues. Under Biden, transportation regulators have taken a series of actions to safeguard airline passengers, including passing rules that now provide automatic refunds when flights are significantly delayed or canceled.",
      "\"Illegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today's action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. \"The department will enforce the law against airlines with chronic delays or other unrealistic scheduling practices in order to protect healthy competition in commercial aviation and ensure passengers are treated fairly.\"",
      "Passengers getting money",
      "JetBlue must pay half the penalty in cash to the U.S. Treasury, with the other $1 million going to compensate JetBlue passengers harmed by the delayed flights or any future disruptions caused by JetBlue within the next year. The future compensation must be a minimum of $75 for each affected passenger.",
      "JetBlue had one of the poorest on-time performances last year among the U.S. airlines, according to a ranking by Cirium. The aviation analytics firm found that less than 75% of JetBlue's flights arrived on schedule, putting the airline behind all the major domestic carriers, including some of its low-cost rivals. Only Frontier Airlines had a worse showing in the U.S., Cirium said in a\u00a0report published Thursday.",

      "The vehicles used in two separate incidents, the deadly New Orleans attack and the explosion in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, were rented via the same app, a peer-to-peer service called Turo, the company said.",
      "Authorities are looking into several parallels between the incidents, including that both involved trucks \u2014 a Ford pickup in New Orleans and Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas \u2014 were rented from Turo and occurred on New Year's Day. Both also involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe, but don't appear to have any known connections.",
      "But on Thursday, an FBI official, Christopher Raia, said that at this point, there's \"no definitive link\" between the two occurrences.",
      "In an email to CBS News, a Turo spokesperson said the company is \"actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents.\"",
      "Turo CEO Andre Haddad released a statement on Friday detailing the company's ongoing cooperation with authorities. \"We've spent these tense, mournful hours investigating, partnering with law enforcement, and working around the clock to figure out how our platform could be misused by the perpetrators of such atrocities,\" the CEO said.",
      "According to the 12-year-old company, out of its entire history of rentals \u2014 which includes 27 million bookings spanning 8.6 billion miles driven \u2014 less than .10% have ended in a \"serious incident, such as a vehicle theft.\"",
      "\"Despite this strong track record, and as an immediate next step while we wait for law enforcement to conclude their investigations, we're consulting with national security and counterterrorism experts to learn more about how we can get even better and play our part in helping prevent anything like this from happening ever again,\" Haddad said.",
      "They added, \"We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",
      "Turo operates similarly to Airbnb, but with cars instead of houses or apartments. Car owners who aren't using their vehicles can rent them out to others via the app, which handles screening, billing and other services. In some cases, individuals have become \"professional hosts\" by renting out fleets of cars via Turo, according to a company filing.",
      "In a separate email to CBS MoneyWatch, a Turo spokesperson said, \"We are outraged by the misuse of our marketplace by the two individuals who perpetrated these acts.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Turo.",
      "How many people use Turo?",
      "Turo, which started in 2009, had about 150,000 active hosts who rented out about 350,000 vehicles as of Sept. 30, according to the company's filing. About 3.5 million people rented those cars in the 12-month period through the end of September, it added.",
      "The car rental service operates in 16,000 cities in the U.S., Australia, France, the U.K. and Canada.",
      "How do you rent a car on Turo?",
      "Turo says that in order to use its service, individuals need an email address, Google account or Apple ID, and a valid driver's license. Renters must also provide a home address and payment card.",
      "Customers must be at least 18 years old to rent a car on Turo, or over 25 for more expensive vehicles. For instance, to rent a \"deluxe\" car \u2014 those valued between $45,000 to $85,000 \u2014 drivers must be older than 25. \"Super deluxe\" cars, or those valued over $85,000, are limited to people over 30.",
      "Does Turo screen people who rent cars?",
      "On its website, Turo says \"We may ask for additional photos and information and/or may check your personal and/or business credit report, auto insurance score, and criminal background to verify your account.\"",
      "The man who drove the Ford truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, had pleaded guilty in 2015 to charges tied to driving under the influence (DUI), according to CNN.",
      "In the state of Louisiana, a DUI offense is considered a felony on third and subsequent convictions,\u00a0according to Louisiana Court Records, although first-time DUI offenders can face felony charges in instances where a death or violation of child endangerment laws is involved.",
      "Turo also says it relies on its proprietary \"risk score\" to assess potential renters, which relies on \"more than 50 data inputs,\" such as information submitted by customers as well as parameters set by the car owner.",
      "\"Every Turo renter is screened through a proprietary multilayer, data science-based trust and safety process,\" the Turo spokesperson wrote to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"These individuals in question had valid driver's licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military,\" the spokesperson added. \"They could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain. We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone \u2014 including Big Rental or law enforcement.\"",
      "In a separate statement Thursday, Turo CEO Haddad also said the company is consulting with national security and counterterrorism experts to \"learn more about how we can get even better and play our part in helping prevent anything like this from happening ever again.\"",
      "Who are the men who rented the cars used in the attacks?",
      "The driver in the New Orleans attack, Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S.-born citizen from Texas, was a U.S. Army veteran who lived in Houston. The FBI said he posted several videos before the attack proclaiming his support for ISIS.",
      "Jabbar rented a Ford electric pickup truck from Turo in Houston on Dec. 30, 2024, and drove the vehicle to New Orleans on Dec. 31. On Jan. 1, he bypassed barriers put in place on Bourbon Street, which included patrol cars and law enforcement, before plowing onto the sidewalk, according to police officials. The attack killed at least 14 people and injured dozens.",
      "In the second Jan. 1 occurrence, Matthew Alan Livelsberger, an active-duty U.S. Army Special Forces intelligence sergeant who was serving in Germany but on leave in Colorado at the time of the incident, rented a Tesla Cybertruck from Turo in Denver.",
      "That Cybertruck, a 2024 model, pulled up to the Trump hotel's glass entrance doors on Wednesday morning, officials said. Smoke began emerging from the vehicle, and then a large explosion occurred. Gasoline and camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were found in the back of the vehicle after the explosion, which occurred about 15 seconds after the vehicle pulled in front of the building.",
      "The Cybertruck explosion, which is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, killed the driver of the car and injured seven people outside of the vehicle.",
      "The body was \"burnt beyond recognition,\" Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a briefing Thursday, but the coroner's office later confirmed it was Livelsberger.

      "The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, \"Hey, Siri.\" Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted.",

    "summary": "The Fed has been pushing down borrowing cuts since September, yet mortgage rates remain close to 7%. Here's what to expect in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Americans started to see some financial relief in 2024 as cooling inflation led the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates three times after jacking up borrowing costs to their highest level in 23 years in a bid to hose down red-hot prices.",
      "The Fed's policy shift raises questions about what 2025 might bring for borrowers, especially on the home-buying front, where mortgage rates have remained stubbornly high despite the rate cuts. On Jan. 2, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage inched up to 6.91%, its highest point in almost six months, Freddie Mac said\u00a0on Monday.",
      "Complicating the financial picture are President-elect Donald Trump's economic plans. Those could include\u00a0sweeping new tariffs\u00a0on foreign goods and more tax cuts, policies economists warn could reignite inflation. If that occurs, the Fed could be hard-pressed to continue its rate-cutting push.",
      "To be sure, Trump may be using the threat of aggressive new tariffs chiefly as a bargaining tactic to win better trading terms from other nations, while inflation may continue to drift lower this year, giving the Fed room to continue cutting rates. For now, however, uncertainty over Trump's policies and their potential impact on the economy, according to Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, leaves unanswered questions for investors and consumers.",
      "\"For much of the past year, investors have viewed rate cuts as a key ingredient that would take pressure off struggling portions of the economy and lead to a broadening of the market,\" he noted, in a research note last month.",
      "Read on about to see what financial experts predict for interest rates for 2025.",
      "Will the Fed cut rates again in 2025?",
      "Most economists think the Fed will continue to cut rates this year, although many have pared their forecasts for the number of cuts given stickier-than-expected inflation in the second half of 2024.",
      "At its December policy meeting, the Fed\u00a0projected that it will loosen rates less next year than it had previously expected. The central bank is now penciling in only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four it had forecast in September.",
      "Some economists are projecting three rate cuts this year, including Goldman Sachs, whose economists expect rates to end 2025 in the range of 3.5% to 3.75%, down from its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. Economists are currently split on whether the Fed will again lower its benchmark rate at its January 28-29 meeting.",
      "\"Stubborn inflation and economic growth that has surprised to the upside in 2024 will give way to stubborn inflation and slower, still solid economic growth in 2025,\" Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride predicted in an email.",
      "Will mortgage rates drop in 2025?",
      "Mortgage rates around the U.S. have remained high despite the Fed's three rate cuts, which have lowered the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "Despite that step-down, mortgage costs haven't seen a commensurate decline. The typical rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now about 0.3 percentage points higher than it was in January 2024, when it stood at about 6.6%, according to Freddie Mac data.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't dipped along with the Fed's cuts because they're based on several factors besides the central bank's benchmark rate. Those issues include the strength of the U.S. economy and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond, and experts now say home buyers might not see significant relief in 2025.",
      "\"Continued economic growth and worries about inflation and government debt will keep mortgage rates elevated,\" McBride wrote.",
      "Mortgage rates could end 2025 at 6.5%, he predicted.",
      "That jibes with a forecast from Lawrence Yun, the chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, who told CBS MoneyWatch in November that the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is likely to hover around 6.5% for much of 2025, although rates might bounce around between 6% and 7% over the course of the year.",
      "Will credit card rates fall in 2025?",
      "Credit card rates will likely decline along with additional Fed cuts in 2025, but people with revolving balances are still going to be paying high fees. It could also take up to three months for rate cuts to result in lower card APRs, McBride noted.",
      "He expects the typical credit card to charge about 19.8% by the end of 2025. Currently, the average APR for new card offers is about 24.4%, according to LendingTree.",
      "How will rates on CDs and savings account change in 2025?",
      "One bright spot during the Fed's regime of interest-rate hikes was that it boosted returns for savers, who could earn healthy returns on their money held in savings accounts, CDs and money market accounts.",

    "summary": "The explosion outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas on New Year's Day is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, sources said.",
    "story": [
      "A Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas early Wednesday, killing one person, in an incident that is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, according to law enforcement.",
      "Investigators do not believe there's \"any other danger to the community right now,\" FBI agent Jeremy Schwartz said at a news conference Wednesday evening.",
      "The sole person inside the vehicle died, and seven people suffered minor injuries, Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. He called the explosion \"an isolated incident\" and said there is no indication that it was linked to ISIS.",
      "Law enforcement sources told CBS News that the Cybertruck was rented to Matthew Alan Livelsberger, 37, an active duty U.S. Army Special Forces intelligence sergeant, who was serving in Germany but was on leave in Colorado at the time of the incident.",
      "Las Vegas Police said the Clark County Coroner confirmed Thursday that Livelsberger had been identified as the driver of the vehicle in the explosion. The cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the coroner's office said.",
      "At a briefing earlier Thursday, the FBI said their investigation determined the driver had shot himself in the head before the vehicle detonated, and a gun was found at his feet.",
      "They said they considered Livelsberger the subject of the investigation, but needed a dental or DNA match for identification since the body was burned beyond recognition. They said his military ID, passport and credit cards were found in the vehicle, along with several firearms.",
      "\"I'm comfortable calling it a suicide,\" McMahill said at the briefing.",
      "CBS News spoke to two relatives of Livelsberger who were unaware of any involvement in the incident, but who confirmed he had rented a Cybertruck. One relative told CBS News that Livelsberger's wife had not heard from him in several days.",
      "Federal agents have been at his townhome in Colorado Springs since Wednesday evening and said the activity is related to the explosion in Las Vegas, CBS Colorado reported. No one has been evacuated during the investigation there.",
      "According to CBS News' conversations with his father, Livelsberger was based at Fort Carson but had been serving in Germany. His father said he works with drones. He attended Bucyrus High School in Ohio and enlisted in the Army in 2006. His father said they last spoke on Christmas Day and described everything as normal, emphasizing that Matthew was a devoted father.",
      "Law enforcement officials said Thursday there were no other subjects of the investigation at this time.",
      "Schwartz also noted, \"We do not believe that there's a bunch of folks out there supporting this or helping this.\"",
      "A short time after the Cybertruck, a 2024 model that had been rented in Colorado, pulled up to the hotel's glass entrance doors, smoke began emerging from the vehicle, and then a large explosion occurred.",
      "Several videos posted on social media showed the blast and the Cybertruck engulfed in flames.",
      "McMahill said gasoline canisters, camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were found in the back of the vehicle after the explosion, which occurred about 15 seconds after the vehicle pulled in front of the building. It's still unclear how the explosives were ignited, he said.",
      "The sheriff said the Cybertruck arrived in Las Vegas at about 7:30 a.m. Wednesday morning and drove through the Strip before approaching the hotel.",
      "Las Vegas Mayor Shelley Berkley\u00a0said police and city marshals \"will remain on extra alert,\" and told people to expect \"a significant officer presence on the Strip, in the downtown and throughout the valley for the next 2 days.\"",
      "The explosion occurred hours after a deadly\u00a0New Orleans attack, when a man intentionally drove a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street, killing at least 14 people. The driver was killed in a shootout with police. The FBI said \"weapons and a potential IED,\" or improvised explosive device, were found in his vehicle, which was flying an ISIS flag.",
      "But on Thursday, Christopher Raia, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division, said, \"At this point there is no definitive link between the attack here in New Orleans and the one in Las Vegas.\"",
      "Authorities were looking into several odd similarities between the incidents in the two cities. In addition to their timing on New Year's Day, both incidents involved trucks rented from the carsharing app Turo. Both involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe. But two U.S. officials say the military has not yet found any overlap between them at either Fort Bragg or in Afghanistan. They both served there, these officials say, but not at the same time.",
      "President Biden said Wednesday evening that law enforcement and the intelligence community are investigating whether the Las Vegas blast has any possible connection with the New Orleans attack, but \"thus far there's nothing to report.\"",
      "In a statement, a Turo spokesperson said: \"We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents. We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",

      "\"[O]bviously a Cybertruck, the Trump Hotel \u2014 there's lots of questions that we have to answer as we move forward with that,\" McMahill said.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a post on X, Musk said \"The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now.   Will post more information as soon as we learn anything.  We've never seen anything like this.\"",
      "In another post a few hours later, he said the blast \"was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself.\"",
      "Evacuation at Trump Las Vegas hotel",
      "A county spokeswoman said in a statement that the fire in the valet area of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas was reported at 8:40 a.m. Details about the incident were initially sketchy.",
      "\"I know you have a lot of questions,\" Jeremy Schwartz, acting FBI Special Agent in Charge for the Las Vegas office, said at the news conference. \"We don't have a lot of answers.\"",
      "Eric Trump, one of the president-elect's sons, posted about the fire on X,\u00a0saying\u00a0that an \"electric vehicle fire occurred in the porte coch\u00e8re of Trump Las Vegas.\"",

    "story": [
      "China on Thursday said it was adding dozens of American companies to its export control list to \"safeguard national security and interests.\"",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce said it would impose measures on 28 U.S. entities and would also prohibit exports of dual-use items to the listed companies starting on Thursday, reported the Global Times, a Chinese daily viewed as aligned with Beijing, and the government-run Xinhua news agency. Dual-use items refers to those that can be used for either civilian or military purposes.",
      "China also sanctioned 10 defense firms on Thursday over military sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own, adding them to China's \"Unreliable Entities List,\" the ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "\"It really does seem to be a warning shot \u2014 that escalation in U.S. policies against China, particularly under Trump, will be met with a more aggressive response,\" Jesse Schreger, an associate professor of Macroeconomics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"China is signaling it will not take tariffs passively.\"",
      "The threat to not sell dual-use goods to listed companies could be consequential, given China's role as the world's manufacturing powerhouse, said Schreger. Unclear is how China intends to enforce the measures and which products will be viewed as dual use and therefore have their sales restricted. Tires, for instance, could be viewed as produced for both civilian and military use, he noted.",
      "The moves come as Beijing readies for the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House and after the Biden administration broadened its restrictions on Chinese firms amid an escalating back-and-forth. During his presidential campaign, Trump also raised the idea of imposing a\u00a0tariff of up to 60%\u00a0on all Chinese goods.",
      "\"The desire to put high tariffs on China seems credible, if you think back to the first Trump administration and its willingness to use [tariffs] for geopolitical ends,\" offered Schreger. \"The Biden administration didn't undo that \u2014 in fact, they professionalized it. The Trump administration's rhetoric might have been stronger, but the Biden administration took this economic battle to the next level.\"",
      "China last month said it was investigating U.S. microchip maker Nvidia over potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.",
      "China's action comes less than a week after it\u00a0placed\u00a0sanctions on seven companies in responding to recently announced U.S. military sales and aid to Taiwan.",
      "Still, sanctions by Beijing targeting American defense companies tend to have a muted impact given that U.S. military firms don't sell arms or related goods to China. The tit-for-tat trade measures also could be limited, some analysts think.",
      "\"Changes to immigration, trade and fiscal policy under the second Trump administration will likely be meaningful but stop short of some of the more dramatic proposals,\" stated Goldman Sachs analysts in a recent report. \"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 16:48:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Luma, a private company that distributes electricity in Puerto Rico, has blamed previous \"financial mismanagement\" for problems with the island's grid.",
    "story": [
      "A massive power outage\u00a0blanketed most of Puerto Rico\u00a0early Tuesday, leaving more than 1.2 million people without electricity. Here's what to know about the blackout and Luma Energy, which handles distribution and transmission of electricity on the island.",
      "What caused the blackout?",
      "Luma Energy said in a statement that it is investigating the cause of the outage, which closed many businesses and forced government agencies to limit their hours. But Luma noted that preliminary findings point to problems with an underground power line.",
      "How soon will power be restored in Puerto Rico?",
      "Luma said in a statement early Tuesday that it would likely take 24-28 hours to restore electricity across Puerto Rico.",
      "Later the company said service had resumed in some areas, including the Municipal Hospital of San Juan, but it didn't disclose how many people still lacked power.",
      "Puerto Rico's main airport, the Aeropuerto Internacional Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, said Tuesday on social media that it had activated backup power generators and was operating normally.",
      "What is Luma?",
      "Luma is a private Canadian-American company, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, that operates and manages the electric power infrastructure in Puerto Rico.",
      "In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which\u00a0devastated the U.S. territory\u00a0in September of 2017, the Puerto Rico government in 2021 hired Luma to handle the transmission and distribution of electricity on the island. Power was previously overseen by the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which went\u00a0bankrupt in 2017\u00a0as the government faced billions of dollars in public debt payments.",
      "Luma CEO Juan Saca, a veteran telecom industry executive who was appointed to lead the company in 2023, said in a Sept. 26 hearing before a House panel that Luma has made significant investments to improve Puerto Rico's grid. That includes installing more than 17,850 hurricane-proof utility poles, adding thousands of automation devices aimed at softening the impact of power outages, and clearing vegetation around the island that can impede maintenance.",
      "\"The impact of this has been real. Over the last year, more than 95% of customers had concurrent service more than 98% of the time when generation was available,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "But Saca also sought to deflect criticism that Puerto Rico's electricity system remains unreliable, pointing to previous \"financial mismanagement.\" PREPA's bankruptcy seven years ago has also hindered progress in strengthening and modernizing the island's grid, he said.",
      "Have Puerto Ricans faced previous power outages?",
      "Puerto Rico's electric grid was troubled even before Maria, a consequence of inadequate maintenance and years of underinvestment. But the Category 4 storm crippled the system: Seven years after Maria, chronic power outages and high electricity costs are common in Puerto Rico.",
      "In June, to cite one recent example, a power outage plunged more than 340,000 Puerto Ricans into darkness after two power plants on the island shut down.",
      "\"They're part of my everyday life,\" Enid N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events, told the Associated Press. Ra\u00fal Pacheco, a 63-year-old diabetic struggling with an injured foot, said he planned to sleep on his balcony during the outage.",
      "Antonio Torres Miranda, associate commissioner of Puerto Rico's energy agency, said in the House hearing this fall that the island's power distribution and transmission systems have made progress but remain subpar.",
      "\"The recent outage events of June 2024, which affected over 300,000 customers, serve as a stark reminder of the fragility of our infrastructure and the urgent need for comprehensive improvements,\" he said. \"These incidents highlight the complex interplay of aging assets, deferred maintenance and the increasing impacts of climate change on our island's power grid.\"",
      "Some critics are blunter in their assessment of Luma's record in Puerto Rico.",
      "\"Almost 25 years into the 21st century, it is ridiculous that Puerto Rico's power grid has failed its people again. Puerto Ricans deserve answers and accountability from Luma for this latest fiasco,\" Camille Rivera, founder of La Brega Y Fuerza, a grassroots advocacy group, said in a statement. \"Luma has Puerto Rico in an energy stranglehold, and Puerto Ricans shouldn't have to put up with continued subpar service.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday.",
      "The department didn't provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that \"at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.\" It said the hack was being investigated as a \"major cybersecurity incident.\"",
      "\"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,\" a department spokesperson said in a separate statement. \"Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.\"",
      "China denied any involvement, Agency France-Presse reported, citing China's foreign ministry as saying Beijing \"has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes.\"",
      "\"We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.",

      "The revelation comes as U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.

      "The Treasury Department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key \"used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support\" to workers. That key helped the hackers override the service's security and gain remote access to several employee workstations.",
      "The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee.",

    "summary": "With Trump's pledge to issue pardons and shut down the investigation, many of those who breached the Capitol four years ago could see their convictions erased and records wiped clean.",
    "story": [
      "While Congress meets Monday to count the Electoral College votes and affirm President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election, the roughly 1,500 people accused of storming the Capitol four years ago will be focused on what happens next.",
      "Charged as part of the largest Justice Department's investigation in history, they have been waiting to see if Trump fulfills his promise to pardon them or commute their sentences.",
      "Prosecutors have charged more than 1,580 defendants with crimes tied to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot, including more than 170 who are accused of using deadly or dangerous weapons like fire extinguishers and bear spray against officers. While a majority were charged with nonviolent misdemeanor crimes, some were accused of conspiring to use force to resist the peaceful transfer of power. Others admitted to fighting officers and attacking members of the media.",
      "More than 1,000 defendants have since pleaded guilty, and about 220 more were convicted at trial. Federal investigations said they are also seeking the public's assistance in locating at least five known fugitives.",
      "According to the Justice Department, 1,100 defendants have already had their cases fully adjudicated, and hundreds have already completed prison terms.",
      "The outgoing U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., has continued to bring new charges against defendants.",
      "\"The Department continues to pursue those criminally culpable, especially those who assaulted law enforcement officers and engaged in disruptive or obstructive conduct that interfered with the peaceful transfer of power,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement.",
      "But with Trump's pledge to pardon at least some defendants and shut down the investigation, many of those who breached the Capitol four years ago could see their convictions erased and records wiped clean.",
      "Potential pardons",
      "Trump told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" in December he's \"inclined to pardon many\" of the defendants immediately upon his inauguration, although he has also said some \"got out of control\" and might not receive a pardon. He expressed sympathy for Jan. 6 defendants, who he said had \"suffered long and hard.\"",
      "The Constitution gives presidents unfettered power to pardon any federal crime. Recently, President Biden used the authority to pardon his son, Hunter, a move that was met with bipartisan criticism. In December, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 1,500 people who were convicted of nonviolent crimes and \"demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation.\"",
      "Usually, presidents work with the Justice Department's pardon attorney to consider clemency requests. The Trump transition team has not disclosed how it plans to handle the gargantuan task of reviewing pardons for hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "Trump transition spokeswoman Caroline Leavitt told CBS News that Trump would \"pardon Americans who were denied due process and unfairly prosecuted by the weaponized Department of Justice.\"",
      "Fallout in court",
      "Trump intends to nominate former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to be attorney general, and he plans to tap former defense official Kash Patel to be FBI director. If confirmed, Bondi and Patel \u2014 who has said he opposes the Jan. 6 prosecutions \u2014 would have the power to shut down the Capitol breach investigations altogether and weigh in on the administration's clemency strategy.",
      "Ahead of Trump's inauguration, Jan. 6 defendants have been asking judges to pause their cases or delay proceedings, citing Trump's pardon promises.",
      "A day after the election, attorneys for one defendant, Christopher Carnell, wrote that their client \u2014 who faced nonviolent disorderly conduct charges \u2014 is \"expecting to be relieved of the criminal prosecution that he is currently facing when the new administration takes office.\" A federal judge in D.C. rejected Carnell's request to delay his case. He was later convicted on multiple counts and sentenced to six months in prison.",
      "Like Carnell, the majority of the Jan. 6 defendants were charged with nonviolent crimes, like illegal entry into the Capitol or unlawful picketing. Prosecutors say they opted not to charge individuals who merely protested outside the Capitol that day and focused instead on those who entered the building.",
      "Advocates for Jan. 6 defendants say they deserve pardons, contending that some faced charges that were too harsh, some jury pools were unfair or some received unduly harsh penalties for the crimes.",
      "A group of family members and supporters have regularly gathered outside the D.C. jail where some defendants are being held and pushed for clemency. At his campaign rallies, Trump often played a recording of the National Anthem sung by defendants in the jail. According to the U.S. attorney in Washington, about 10 defendants are currently being housed in the D.C. facility either pending trial or waiting to be moved to a federal prison.",
      "Some defendants faced more serious charges, like assault. Members of the far-right Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were charged with seditious conspiracy, the most severe charge levied by prosecutors. Juries in those cases found numerous defendants, including Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, guilty of using force to oppose the federal government. Tarrio received the longest of the Jan. 6 sentences \u2014 22 years in prison \u2014 while Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years.",
      "James Lee Bright, who represented Rhodes during his criminal trial but has withdrawn from the case, said, \"I absolutely think a pardon for him is warranted.\"",
      "Bright has also represented other Jan. 6 defendants, and he described a sense of \"dismay\" that courts and prosecutors haven't acknowledged the looming possibility of Trump pardons.",
      "Rhodes' current attorney did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Tarrio's legal team plans to \"explore every possible avenue to seek the release from custody\" for their client, according to a letter provided to CBS News.",
      "Both Rhodes and Tarrio are appealing their convictions.",
      "Attorney Carmen Hernandez represented a Tarrio codefendant who was also convicted of seditious conspiracy. In an interview, she argued \"at a minimum,\" the seditious conspiracy charge for all defendants should be pardoned.",
      "\"I think the seditious conspiracy convictions of the Proud Boys should be pardoned. There is no reason for those men to have been charged and convicted for seditious conspiracy,\" Hernandez said. She said pardoning them would enable defendants who are also veterans to maintain some of their benefits.",
      "Hernandez represents at least a dozen other Jan. 6 defendants and said almost all of her clients with open felony cases hope to be pardoned when Trump takes office. But the process for requesting clemency remains uncertain, and it's not expected to begin until Trump is inaugurated. Trump told Time magazine he'd consider the Jan. 6 cases soon after he takes office.",
      "\"I'll be looking at J6 early on, maybe the first nine minutes,\" he said",
      "Alexis Loeb, a former federal prosecutor who helped lead the Capitol attack investigation until last October, said she stood by the cases and noted they were based on a uniquely large amount of evidence.",
      "While she declined to discuss any individual case or internal Justice Department deliberations, Loeb said, \"These were prosecutions that were staffed by career employees. And the cases often had a remarkable amount of evidence given all of the video that was taken that day.\"",
      "An uncertain future",
      "The federal judges overseeing the Jan. 6 cases in district court in Washington, D.C., are also grappling with the uncertainty that lies ahead. Nearly all of these judges have been involved in the roughly 1,500 cases. A CBS News review of court hearings and records over the last four years showed judges appointed by presidents from both parties, including by Trump, have condemned the Jan. 6 riot and warned of future unrest.",
      "Judge Royce Lamberth \u2014 a senior judge appointed to the bench by Ronald Reagan who has been an outspoken critic of attack \u2014 recently defended the court's handling of the cases.",
      "\"Just as the President must make decisions on matters of clemency without interference from the coordinate branches, so too must our judiciary independently administer the laws and sentence convicted offenders,\" Lamberth wrote. \"No matter what ultimately becomes of the Capital Riots cases already concluded and still pending, the true story of what happened on January 6, 2021 will never change.\"",
      "Should Trump decide to pardon some of the Jan. 6 defendants, the cases would be wiped from the judges' dockets and closed. Lamberth and his colleagues would no longer have jurisdiction over the defendants.",
      "Loeb, the former prosecutor, argued that any pardons would be \"a real affront to the victims\" of the riot, including police officers, members of Congress and their staff. More than 140 officers were assaulted during the attack, according to the Justice Department. Multiple people died during the breach, including Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by a U.S. Capitol Police officer. At least five officers died in the aftermath, including four by suicide.",
      "Federal judges, Loeb contended, have served in a unique position during sentencing hearings, where they both note the significance of Jan. 6 and look \"at the criminal conduct, the individuals' history and characteristics and the need for deterrence among other factors.\"",
      "Pardons would risk repeat occurrences of the violence, Loeb said, and nullify any deterrent effect of the convictions.",
      "There are also questions about how pardon or clemency decisions would be communicated to the courts and the federal prison system, which has housed more than 600 individuals tied to Capitol breach over the last four years.",
      "\"I don't know what the president is planning to do,\" Hernandez said. She suggested \"an easy first step\" for Trump would be to sign a blanket order commuting the sentence of all Jan. 6 defendants. After that, Hernandez said, the cases could be evaluated at a more detailed level.",
      "As for the future of Jan. 6 investigations, Hernandez said she anticipates at a minimum the charging and plea decision-making processes within a Trump Justice Department would avoid what she characterized as the \"overcharging\" of the last four years.",
      "For Loeb, who helped lead the Justice Department's Capitol riot unit beginning in February 2021, potential pardons aren't sitting well. \"If you look at the publicly available facts presented in court, the facts fit the crimes,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt, Trump's spokeswoman, alleged the media \"still refuses to report the truth about what happened that day,\" and criticized the work of the congressional committee that investigated the attack.",
      "\"The American people did not fall for the Left's fear mongering over January 6th. They reelected President Trump by a resounding margin because they want him to unify our country through success, and that's exactly what he will do,\" Leavitt added.",
      "Libby Cathey and \n                                                  \n                                  Scott MacFarlane\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Washington \u2014 When Congress convenes on Monday to count Electoral College votes from each state and finalize\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the November presidential election, the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted the joint session four years ago will be looming over the proceedings.",
      "But unlike on\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021, when then-Vice President Mike Pence faced pressure to unilaterally toss out electoral votes from battleground states, Monday's joint session will be governed by a revised set of procedures that clarify the vice president's role to prevent attempts to overturn the results of an election.",
      "\"The 2020 election exposed how ambiguities in the Electoral Count Act could be exploited to sow chaos and disrupt the peaceful transfer of presidential power,\" said Holly Idelson, a policy strategist at Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. \"The bipartisan Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 will help ensure future transitions proceed smoothly and honor the will of the voters.\"",
      "What is the Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022?",
      "In December 2022, Congress approved the changes as part of a broader government spending package. The legislation updated the Electoral Count Act, an 1887 law that laid out the framework for the casting and counting of Electoral College votes after a presidential election.",
      "Called the Electoral Count Reform Act, the revised measure clarified the process that begins in the wake of Election Day and culminates with Congress confirming the winner of the presidential election during a joint session on Jan. 6. The goal of the legislation was to address ambiguities in the 1887 law that Trump's allies seized on in 2020 to challenge the results of the election.",
      "Trump faced federal charges as a result of the alleged scheme to subvert the transfer of power in 2020 but they were dismissed in late November after he won a second term. Several of the president-elect's allies who allegedly helped orchestrate or participated in the plans were charged by local prosecutors in Arizona and Georgia. Some have agreed to plead guilty while others have denied wrongdoing.",
      "What's different about Jan. 6 this time?",
      "Who certifies the state's appointment of electors",
      "After states make their pick for the White House on Election Day, \"certificates of ascertainment\" are issued that name the electors selected by the winning candidate for president and vice president.",
      "The Electoral Count Reform Act makes clear the certificates of ascertainment are issued by each state's executive, defined as the governor unless otherwise specified, no later than six days before the date the Electoral College meets, which was Dec. 17.",
      "It also states that those certificates issued by governors \"shall be treated as conclusive in Congress\" with respect to the electors appointed. Under the law, federal courts are also the final deciders of questions regarding the appointment of electors arising under the Constitution or federal law, and their determinations \"shall be conclusive in Congress.\"",
      "Following the 2020 election, groups of Trump's electors met in key battleground states on the same day the Electoral College convened to cast votes for president and vice president based on the election results. They signed fake certifications falsely claiming they were the legitimate electors, according to federal and congressional investigations. Some of them were mailed to the vice president and other government officials.",
      "Federal prosecutors said that under the plan developed by Trump and his allies, submitting the fraudulent slates of electors would create a fake controversy on Jan. 6 and position Pence to replace legitimate electors with those backing Trump.",
      "The legitimate electors' signed certificates, though, were added to the certificates of ascertainment from state executives before they were sent.",
      "The limited role for the vice president",
      "The Electoral Count Reform Act clarifies the role of the vice president \u2014 who serves as the president of the Senate \u2014 when overseeing the counting of electoral votes. Under the law, the vice president's role is limited to \"performing solely ministerial duties.\" It explicitly denies the vice president the power to \"solely determine, accept, reject or otherwise adjudicate or resolve disputes over the proper certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors, the validity of electors, or the votes of electors.\"",
      "The provisions regarding the vice president are a direct response to the 2020 election, when Trump and his allies pressured Pence to reject the legitimate electoral votes from seven battleground states and either send them to state legislatures for review or use the fake slates of electors that supported Trump.",
      "Pence resisted the pressure, writing in a letter to lawmakers on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, that the Constitution constrained him \"from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.\" He said the vice president's role as presiding officer during the joint session is \"largely ceremonial,\" an opinion the 2022 law formally adopted.",
      "\"I do not believe that the Founders of our country intended to invest the vice president with unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted during the joint session of Congress, and no vice president in American history has ever asserted such authority,\" Pence wrote.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Trump defeated in November, will preside over the joint session Monday and reaffirm the president-elect's win.",
      "A higher threshold for objections",

Under the Electoral Count Reform Act, an objection must be made in writing and be signed by at least one-fifth of senators and one-fifth of House members.

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 22:11:55 -0500",
    "summary": "New law means police officers, teachers and others with public pensions will now collect their full Social Security benefits.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden on Sunday signed legislation expanding Social Security benefits for millions of retired Americans, including firefighters, police officers and teachers.",
      "\"Americans who have worked hard all their life to make an honest living should be able to retire with economic security and dignity,\" Mr. Biden told a gathering at the White House before signing the Social Security Fairness Act, which he said would mean an average monthly increase of $360 for more than 2.5 million Social Security recipients.",
      "\"That's a big deal in middle-class households like the one I grew up in and many of you did,\" the president added.",
      "Those beneficiaries will also receive a lump sum in the thousands of dollars to make up for the shortfall in benefits they should have received in 2024, the president said.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act\u00a0eliminates two federal policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program and that reduced benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "\"Biden is the first president in more than 20 years to expand Social Security benefits,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement. \"The bill he is signing today will expand benefits by hundreds of dollars per month for more than 2.5 million Americans.\"",
      "Social Security Fairness Act could restore benefits for millions, but policies still cause hardship",
      "Social Security Fairness Act could restore benefits for millions, but policies still cause hardship",
      "The new law came in just under the wire, with Mr. Biden signing it only weeks before the end of his presidency and after the Senate on December 21\u00a0voted 76-20\u00a0to pass the measure in the waning hours of the 118th Congress. House lawmakers approved the bill, known as H.R. 82, in November.",
      "Long, hard road",
      "The push to enhance Social Security payments for public pension recipients has been decades in the making, with the Senate holding its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act had bipartisan support, yet faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the law would add an estimated\u00a0$195 billion\u00a0to the federal deficit over a decade.",
      "The benefits hike under the new law would be retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Specifically, the new Social Security law repeals policies known as the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which together act to reduce Social Security payments to 2.5 million retirees. International Association of Fire Fighters General President Edward Kelly in a statement Sunday said Congress \"broke a promise\" when it enacted the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset.",
      "\"Today, that promise has been restored, and retired fire fighters and emergency medical workers will now receive the full Social Security benefits they've earned and paid into,\" Kelly said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0estimated in September that eliminating the WEP would increase monthly payments to affected Social Security recipients by an average of $360 by December 2025, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Scrapping the GPO would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses, the agency found. The increase would amount to an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.",
      "\"The law that existed denied millions of Americans access to the full Social Security benefits they earned,\" Mr. Biden said after signing the bill into law.",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 18:12:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Several changes to the electoral vote count process have been enacted since a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House and Senate will convene Monday to certify President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election.",
      "It comes four years after a violent mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol to prevent Congress from affirming President Biden's win. There appear to be no plans by Democrats to stand in the way of certifying Trump's win.",
      "Here's what to expect this time.",
      "How does Congress count the presidential election results?",
      "Senators and members of the House will meet in a joint session at 1 p.m. to tally the electoral votes from the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Vice President Kamala Harris will preside in her role as president of the Senate.",
      "The vice president will read aloud the electoral votes, and then Congress counts each state's results to affirm Trump's victory. Trump won 312 Electoral College votes, far surpassing the 270 needed for victory. Harris won 226 votes.",
      "The process is typically a ceremonial step before a president is inaugurated on Jan. 20.",
      "Does Congress always count results on Jan. 6 following presidential elections?",
      "Congress is required by law to count the electoral votes on Jan. 6 after each presidential election. However, the date has been temporarily changed by law\u00a0when Jan. 6 fell on a weekend. In 2013, Congress affirmed that President Barack Obama won the election on Jan. 4, rather than on Jan. 6, which was a Sunday.",
      "What is the Electoral Count Reform Act, and what's different about Jan. 6 this time?",
      "After the Capitol riot in 2021, Congress moved to reform the Electoral Count Act \u2014 an 1887 law that governed the counting of electoral votes \u2014 to prevent another effort to overturn the results of a presidential election.",
      "Congress passed the Electoral Count Reform Act in 2022, which clarified that the vice president's role in presiding over the joint session of Congress is ceremonial. It also made it more difficult for members of Congress to challenge a state's electors by raising the threshold to 20% of members of each chamber. Previously, just one member of the House and one senator were needed to raise an objection.",
      "Following Trump's defeat in the 2020 election, he and his allies fueled unfounded allegations of fraud and argued that Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to accept or reject electoral votes. Pence denied he had such authority.",
      "As Congress was tallying the votes in 2021, Rep. Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, joined Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, to object to Mr. Biden's votes from Arizona.",
      "The joint session was then suspended and the House and Senate separately debated the objection. The process was abruptly interrupted as a violent mob of protesters made their way into the building after Trump urged them to march to the Capitol.",
      "Hours later, after rioters were cleared from the building, both chambers voted to reject the objection that would have thrown out Arizona's electoral votes for Mr. Biden. The House and Senate then reconvened in a joint session to continue the count. They later were forced to split and debate another objection to Pennsylvania's results, which was brought by Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. Both chambers also rejected the attempt to throw out the state's votes for Mr. Biden.",
      "What happens if a member of Congress objects to the electoral votes?",
      "This time, it will be nothing more than a complaint. In the last presidential election, a member from each chamber needed to object to the count to force lawmakers to debate and vote on whether to accept or reject a state's results. The Electoral Reform Act, passed by Congress in 2022, raised the threshold to one-fifth of members in each chamber.",

      "How should Americans understand the threat environment we're in?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right, right.",
      "Well, it's certainly very difficult. And our heart breaks as we think of what occurred just after New Year's Eve and on New Year's Day. The \u2013 what we know that the FBI director has said is that we \u2013 we are in a heightened threatened environment.",
      "We see from, of course, what occurred in New Orleans, we have the threat of those who can be lone wolves, those individuals who might be, as the self- declared terrorist has indicated, inspired by ISIS, by terrorist threats. We also have those who \u2013 who are here who have come across the border that the director has said are affiliated with terrorist groups or organizations outside of the country who want to do Americans harm.",
      "Those individuals still pose a threat to Americans and to the United States. The director, the FBI, local law enforcement are continuing to work to try to find them and try to lessen the risk, but, certainly, at this time, as we go into the inauguration for Donald Trump, where we even have state actors like Iran who \u2013 where we have in custody individuals who have come here with the stated purpose to \u2013 to assassinate as a part of a plot\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 to have been alleged to perpetrate a plot to assassinate Donald Trump, we have a number of actors that pose a risk and a threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Himes, ISIS has not claimed responsibility for this New Orleans attacker. He did pledge allegiance in these social media videos.",
      "But Homeland Security, as far as we have heard from them, said there's no linkage to the U.S. border. There is no linkage established to a foreign actor at this point. Is this just an example of someone with mental health issues choosing violence?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-Connecticut): Well \u2013 and I'm glad you said that, because there was so much misinformation right out of the box, because these attacks happened at the same time. You know, there was all sorts of stuff on social media about how they were coordinated and together\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Las Vegas.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 and that the \u2013 Las Vegas with New Orleans.",
      "You know, the New Orleans \u2013 Jabbar, the attacker there, clearly had himself affiliated with ISIS.",
      "Now, what we need to know and what \u2013 to date, there is no evidence that this is the case, but we need to know whether that individual was deliberately tasked. Again, no evidence that he was. And, of course, we constantly see these lone wolf attackers who get radicalized, maybe on social media, maybe in some other location.",
      "And \u2013 and, you know, I would certainly agree with Mike's characterization of the danger out there, but just add that, as Americans think about the people who are protecting them \u2013 and I think the chairman would agree with me on this \u2013 the people and assets that we put up against this threat are the best in the world.",
      "It is also true that lone wolf attackers, that is, an individual who's not communicating with somebody abroad, who's not sending texts or sending e- mails, are extraordinarily difficult to detect. And, you know, though our people are the best in the world, that is hard to find.",
      "And, by the way, there's a role for people. You know, in New York City, if you go on the subway, it says, if you see something, say something. And so there's a role for everybody out there, you know, to help try to solve, to help try to stop these kinds of lone wolf attacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, as one official said to me, this isn't a problem you solve with another aircraft carrier to the Middle East. Some of these things run deeper in terms of the lone wolf element. That's the term you've used.",
      "How do you diagnose and deal with that, Chair Turner, if people are able to be radicalized online, and whether it's political violence or just another form of domestic violent extremism?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, on the issue of New Orleans, we \u2013 we don't know yet whether or not he \u2013 he will evolve as \u2013 as the actual lone wolf, where he operated completely alone.",
      "As Jim is saying, as the investigation unfolds, he himself indicated that he joined, as he claimed it, ISIS in the summer. We don't know what that involved. We don't know if it's going to turn out that he was tasked. Excuse me. He \u2013 he went to New Orleans also in October.",
      "There may have been opportunities or times at which he could have been found and could have been prevented. We'll learn what those are and ways in which he might have been \u2013 been found, and maybe we could have intervened.",
      "But those will give U.S. greater opportunities at which we'll look to how we might be able to in the future find others.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, we've spoken to both of you on this program, in particular, about the heightened threat environment many times. And back in June, when there was that arrest of those eight men from Tajikistan who were ISIS-linked. We spoke in depth about that.",
      "Chair Turner, shortly after that, you said on this program: \"We have terrorists that are actively working inside the United States that are a threat to Americans.\"",
      "Do you know if there are active terror cells in the United States right now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think the \u2013 the issue of cells \u2013 and you and I were talking about that at the beginning of the show.",
      "Are there individuals that are affiliated with ISIS and terrorist groups and organizations that have crossed the border that are inside the United States? Director Wray, FBI director, has said so. We certainly have intelligence that says so. I agree with his assessment. I \u2013 Jim has also seen it.",
      "He's testified before our committee publicly of that fact. Those individuals are working in conjunction with \u2013 with ISIS, with the intention of harming Americans. The director has said it directly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are known to U.S. intelligence and law enforcement, is what you're\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And we are working diligently to try to take them down, to prevent them from doing so.",
      "And that's why the director is publicly saying such. And that's what the new administration is going to be handed, the fact that these individuals are here, that we need to locate them, we need to remove them, we need to bring them to justice, and prevent them from doing harm to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we have spoken about this issue in the past, you characterized particularly the arrest of the eight as a success story, because there was no plot carried out. They were disrupted.",
      "Are the individuals that are of concern, do we know where they are? In terms of those eight, they are \u2013 we know they were detained, and five of them were actually sent back to Tajikistan.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You never know what you don't know. And so none of us certainly in positions of responsibility would ever say that there's not terrorists in the United States.",
      "Now, I will say what I said before, which is that we have the very best people and the very best technology looking to root these people out and find them. But let's \u2013 if the question is, what should Americans be afraid of, what has killed Americans since 9/11? It hasn't been people sneaking across the border.",
      "And that's not to say that the border shouldn't be secure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: The border must be secure. But what has been killing Americans? Whether it was Fort Hood in 2009, I think, whether it was the New York attacks that killed eight people in 2017, what we just sad \u2013 sadly, saw in New Orleans, it's actually Americans who are in this country, actually, in a bizarre number of cases, servicepeople.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: That was the Fort Hood attacks. That was what we saw in New Orleans. That was \u2013 though I don't \u2013 it doesn't seem to be shaping up as a terrorist attack, what we saw in Las Vegas.",
      "So, again, that's hard, right? Why is that hard? Because if you're in this country, you have constitutional rights, meaning the FBI can't say, without a warrant, I want your Facebook posts, I want your e-mails. That's what makes this very hard.",
      "And, again, let's look at what has actually killed Americans in the 20 years. And, sadly, it has been radicalized other Americans. So this gets to the question of, what are the mechanisms by which they are radicalized, and how can we as a community push back on that radicalism?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, which is why I asked you. That's a harder problem to solve for.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Much harder, because you have constitutional rights and because \u2013 you know, let me give you an example.",
      "If somebody is standing out on the street corner right now saying ISIS is the greatest thing in the world, and the president is a traitor, that \u2013 people would say, boy, we should interview that person. That is constitutionally protected speech.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And I wonder how some of my colleagues would respond to the idea, because this individual in New Orleans did post some Facebook posts saying, I pledge allegiance to ISIS.",
      "You know, what if we had that debate? Should \u2013 should Facebook have instantly submitted that to the FBI? And, if so, where's the line?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: If I say I'm not a big fan of the next president, and I don't believe that he was, you know, whatever, should that go to the FBI? It's a tough conversation.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Margaret, there's no question that \u2013 that that is what we're seeing from New Orleans.",
      "But the answer to your question is, no, we don't know where they are. We don't know where the people are that Director Wray has indicated\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The people who have exploited vulnerabilities at the southwest border.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 that has come across the border, that are terrorists affiliated with ISIS, that intend to do American harm \u2013 Americans harm that are here in our country, we do not know where they are.",
      "And part of the work and part of the reason why he's raising the alarm is, we need to find them to protect Americans. Now, what Jim's saying is absolutely correct. And that \u2013 that obviously, is the part that also breaks our heart and makes what happened in New Orleans so hard is, is that we had an American who was killing Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, American-born Army vet.",
      "I want to ask you both about China as well. In terms of traditional adversaries, they are looming large here. We learned just in the past few days that China hacked the U.S. Treasury Department. This is on top of the major cyber espionage against nine telecom companies, against hacking of U.S. infrastructure that incoming National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said was planting cyber time bombs in U.S. infrastructure.",
      "How much of a trump card is this? I mean, can the U.S. expel China from these systems and get control?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, so, I mean, let's start with what we know.",
      "China has been absolutely predatory in just about every dimension. They've stolen our I.P. \u2013 our I.P., our intellectual property. You know, they've manipulated the trading system to hollow out our industrial base, absolutely predatory.",
      "And, by the way, I happen to believe \u2013 and it'll be interesting the chair \u2013 if the chairman agrees with me on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: They believe they can operate inside our networks without consequence, and that needs to change immediately.",
      "They need to understand that we're as good at this stuff as they are. And if they get into our networks and start planting beacons or start planting landmines or whatever, we're going to do the same to them, so that we establish deterrence.",
      "Now, you also have to acknowledge that China does and the U.S. do about $800 billion in trade back and forth, right? And if you snap your fingers and make that go away, you think COVID inflation was bad? Wait until you see that. By the way, they own a trillion dollars of our Treasuries.",
      "So, the point I'm making here is that I think we need to be a lot tougher on them on the areas in which they are predatory against us, even as we recognize that there are areas where we need to tread very carefully, including that economic interconnection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know that we're going to have you both back to talk about exactly this problem.",
      "I'm out of time today, but thank you both.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: There have to be consequences.",

      "And we began by asking her why she thinks so many Americans decided that Donald Trump's support for the rioters in 2020 should not disqualify him from a second term as president.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even just last night at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump was screening a documentary about the 2020 election, claiming his win and trying to talk about the legal challenges he had. There seems to be a continued effort to claim that he won in 2020.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: It's really sad. It really is sad.",
      "And I don't know about the film that he had and the rest, but it's \u2013 it's almost sick that he would be thinking that in 2020. He's won the election now. That will be clear. That will be clear, and, tomorrow, he will be clearly \u2013 we will be accepting the results of the Electoral College.",

      "Now, it didn't end that day. As you know, he called out to these people to continue their violence, my husband being a victim of all of that. And it still \u2013 he still has injuries from that attack. So it just goes on and on. It isn't something that happens and then it's over.",
      "No, once you are attacked, you have consequences that continue. So I don't \u2013 it's really a strange person who's going to be president of the United States who thinks that it's OK to pardon people who were engaged in an attack.",
      "But let's \u2013 you know, let's do this. Let's just say OK to the American people. This is what this is about. Do not be conned by the denial of the election of 2020. And why would he be saying that? But he \u2013 but he is, and then, on top of that, the denial of what happened on January 6.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But some of the 1,600 defendants here were really only charged with trespassing. And when you look at the profiles, University of Chicago did a study. About half of those who broke into the Capitol were white-collar workers. They were small business owners, didn't necessarily have a criminal record.",
      "When you look at that profile, you said intention. It \u2013 it was the intention itself, you think, that needs to be considered more so than the crime, you know that \u2013 that it casts the crime itself of trespassing in a different light for you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, the president said he would go on a case-by-case basis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",

      "Look, at this beautiful Capitol, the dome built by Lincoln, under Lincoln's leadership during the Civil War, they said, don't build the dome. It takes too much steel and person power, manpower, they said, from the war effort. And he said, no, I have to show the resilience of America.",
      "And then under that dome, you saw \u2013 you saw flags, the flags that \u2013 you know, just horrible flags under the dome of Lincoln. And so it was a tragedy, and we cannot be in denial about what it was.",
      "If the president is going to go on a case-by-case basis, I hope he does, and then maybe\u2026",

      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, I certainly hope not.",
      "But, over the years, when I was encouraging people to run for office, especially women, they would say, we could never take the abuse that you take. And that was really just abuse. It wasn't physical, it was criticism and the rest of that, and that we don't want our children subjected to that.",
      "And, yes, I do think it will have a negative impact on people running for public office. Just \u2013 you know, in other words, if you're \u2013 if you're a mom, and they go after you as a \u2013 as a mom, and your child comes home crying from school because somebody said a negative thing because they saw it on TV, that the other side said something bad about you, you might not run for office.",

See, for women, they always \u2013 they always \u2013 women are known to be more, shall we say, ethical than men. And so, when they go after women candidates, they go after their ethics.",

We have the same set of objectives. We want to get to the same destination. But I think at times there will be differences in how we get there.

His picks are going to come through a process where if they get reported out of the committee, come across the floor of the Senate, we'll make sure that they get the - the vote.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They don't know yet.",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well, I think that what we do know is we need physical barriers, we need technological barriers, we need more ICE agents, we need more Border Patrol agents and - and, yes, we're going to need ways of deporting people that are on that - on that list that you mentioned. And so, it's going to take some resources to do that, which is why I would argue that when the president takes office, and he's going to do a lot of things on the border by executive order, by executive action, that we're going to need to be able to provide the resources in order for him to do that. And that's why I've suggested that we take that border issue on right away and enable him to do the things that he needs to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it true you're going to put some defense spending in that as well?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well, I think one of the things that we always argue about around here is the amount of money that we need to spend on defense. If you look at every Biden administration budget, there wasn't a single one of them when it came to military spending that came up - kept up even with inflation. So, we have a military readiness in this country. You know, we have the defense commission strategy group that comes out with a report all the time and tells us we are dramatically underfunded relative to countries like China and that we don't have the capacity -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those should be bipartisan issues, right? So -",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well, and we don't have the capacity and capability to do what needs to be done to protect the country. There's a big difference in delta in the two parties and how they approach the issue of defense and, you know, and military readiness. And I think we are dramatically underfunding our military today. I think the president believes that, President Trump. And I think a lot of our Republican colleagues in the House and the Senate share that view.",

      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The estimates are it could add $4 trillion over the next decade. Is that really something you think is going to pass on a party-line vote and without any revenue or spending cuts?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well, they're -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can't be comfortable.",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: These are tax laws that will expire at the end of this year if Congress doesn't take action to extend them. And it would represent a $4 trillion tax increase on the American people if we don't extend that policy.",
      "We're going to have a very robust conversation about tax reform. There's a lot riding on it economically. I think regulatory policy, tax policy, energy policy are going to be really essential to the strength of our economy, how fast we can grow and expand and creator better paying jobs in this country.",
      "So, I'm a big believer in pro-growth tax policy. I believe you get a lot of that back through growth in additional revenue. Every 1 percent -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not tariffs, as Mr. Trump has promised?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well - well, that's - that's a different subject. But I would say every 1 percent increase in - in GDP, in economic growth, we're told, generates about $3 trillion in additional tax revenue. So, you're going to get some back in terms of a growth dividend. And there will be spending cuts. There's no question about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But going out of the gate with two big issues on party- line votes, aren't you concerned that will blow up your chances at working with Democrats on some of those bigger immigration issues, or bigger policies?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: We need to continue to work on those big policy issues. But I also think that we have some immediate concerns, matters that need to be addressed. One of which is national security, given the increasingly dangerous world in which we live. And, of course, I would argue, that starts with the border. So, border, national security. I think energy policy, energy dominance, is a huge objective and goal. And I would hope that a reconciliation bill could also address that issue. If we do something on taxes, that traditionally has been in the past. The Democrats did it twice while they had the majority in the last session of the Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trump did that in 2017, too, with taxes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: And that's - and both sides have done it. And that's the unique aspect of having unified control of the government. But I think those are all important and they are things that, as a country, if we don't get right, I fear what the results and the outcome will be.",

Actually, if you drill into the numbers, about 80 percent of those numbers are actually Border Patrol arrests that the enforcement (INAUDIBLE) operation of ICE processed and moved back across the border. They weren't (INAUDIBLE) enforcement arrest.",
      "If you look at the historic number of illegal entries the last four years, ICE, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, has the lowest number of deportations in the history of the agency. So, they're playing a numbers game, just like they played a numbers game with a number of people coming across to border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "TOM HOMAN: So, even though they claim they've got the highest number of deportations, look at those deportations, who actually made those arrests, who actually removed those people, it's not ICE.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. It's still a higher number than the Trump administration. But I want to ask you, for the income Trump administration, what's - what's the measure? It is not deportations at the border. You're saying you are going to measure success by people who are already internal in the country to deport. That's how you're going to measure it. And what's that figure?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, again, let's get the numbers straight. You say they were higher than the Trump administration. This isn't about how many got deported because Trump had illegal border crossings at a 45-year low. So, of course removal is going to be lower. The numbers, how many were released into the United States that - that are not in the country legally? Under the Biden administration we have millions of people released in the United States who have lost their hearings and we've got millions of people that are, you know, released in the United States despite a statute saying that you cannot be released in the United States without proper documentation and you shall be detained. So, you can compare the numbers of deportations under Trump versus Biden, but when you consider a 45-year low in crossings, of course the number of deportations is going to be lower because we don't have that population to process and deport.",

And as you heard from your previous segments, we have a huge national security issue in this country. The southwest border has become the biggest national security vulnerability we've seen in this nation. FBI Director Wray agrees with me. We know there's people in this country pose a national security threat. They've arrested a record number of people on the terrorist watch list. A 3,500 percent increase in people on the terrorist watch list being arrested at the border.",

      "TOM HOMAN: Get a free hotel room, get three meals a day, get free medical care. Why did 2 million people pay more to get away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. I'm not disputing that it is a hemisphere-wide crisis. We're talking about how you're going to deal with it. That's why I'm asking you, when you say \"criminals,\" does that mean you are going to go into already-existing prisons, at local level, and deport people who are in those prisons? Are you going to go to workforces? I mean, how do you know where the criminals are I guess is the question? And if they're working at a work site, are you going to show up to surprise them?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, look, we know where a lot of the criminals are. ICE does - they're great at this work. We know where some are, but they simply haven't been able to go arrest them because of Secretary Mayorkas' priorities, it handcuffed ICE. So, we know where a lot of criminals are. They've been prevented from arresting them. We're going to arrest starting day one.",
      "As far as being in jails and prisons, we would love to work in local jails, but sanctuary cities won't allow us into those jails. It's much easier to arrest a public safety threat and the safety and security of public jail than out in the street because the officer is after that way, the alien is safer that way, the community is safer that way. But sanctuary cities who continue to release public safety threats back into the community -",

But if they happen to be living in a house where there are other undocumented people, you're going to sweep them up, too. That's what I think you were just saying there.",
      "I wonder how you're going to parse out some of those collateral arrests. For example, will dreamers be protected? Donald Trump has said he wants to work with Democrats to protect them and give them status. That takes a long time in Congress. What do you do in the meantime? How do you make sure they're not caught up in drag net?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Look, every person ICE arrests, they do what they call a fugitive operation spreadsheet. They know exactly who they're going to arrest, they know exactly where they're probably likely to find him, and they have a lot of information on that arrest. Other people that are there that may be illegal, they'll handle them by a case-by-case basis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "TOM HOMAN: The concentration - I want to be clear on some public safety threats, if we - more agents in the jails means less agents in the neighborhood. That's why I'm pleading with sanctuary cities, let us into the jail to arrest the bad guy, that way you're not forcing into the community. So, you know, if you go to an immigrant community and ask them, would you rather have ICE operating in your local jails or would you want them in the community, what do you think they're going to say? They don't - they don't want bad - bad criminal aliens in their neighborhoods, either.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "TOM HOMAN: So, let us work with the jails. Let us work with law enforcement. Sanctuary cities are not safe for the immigrant community, they're not safe for our officers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, that's like Secure Communities Act kind of - kind of action. But then where do you send people? Because some of these countries, like Venezuela, don't accept deportations right now. Mexico's president indicated her country might be willing to receive non-Mexican migrants who are deported. How does that work? Does the U.S. pay Mexico to then ship those people off somewhere else?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, first of all, we've got President Trump coming into the Oval Office and he's proven, during his first administration, his leadership on illegal immigration was a game changer because, for instance, El Salvador wouldn't take back MS-13 members when I was the ICE director. It took President Trump 48 hours to get El Salvador to take back their criminal aliens into their prisons. And Mexico didn't want to do the remain in Mexico program, but President Trump was able to get remain in Mexico established in Mexico. He was able to get Mexico to put military on their southern and northern border. President Trump's a strong president.",
      "This administration has not forced these countries to take them back. And we have what we call a third save (ph) countries. We already have countries talking about taking back people from other countries if - if, for instance, Venezuela don't want to take their people back, there's others ways we can do it. There's other countries that will be willing to accept them. We're hoping that President Trump will work with Venezuela, like he did with Mexico and El Salvador and get these countries to take them back. If they don't, they're still going to be deported, they're just going to be deported to a different country.",
      "We've not going to be held up by removing public safety threats in this country. We've got to put - we've got to put the safety of the American people first.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "TOM HOMAN: We've got too many young women murdered and raped and burn alive by members of Venezuelan gangs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TOM HOMAN: They need to be a priority under this administration. And they're going to be a priority starting day one. And they will be deported.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Tom Homan. He will serve as Mr. Trump's border czar and he joins us this morning from Naples, Florida. Good morning to you, sir.",
      "TOM HOMAN: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Deportations are now at a decade high. They were at the end of 2024. Nearly 300,000 people deported by the Biden administration. The incoming administration has promised the largest deportation operation in history. What's the number? What's the measure of success?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, let's talk about this administration. What they claim is a huge deportation number this year. Actually, if you drill in- drill into the numbers, about 80% of those numbers were actually Border Patrol arrests that the Enforcement and Removal Operations of ICE processed and moved back across the border. They weren't interior enforcement arrests. If you look at the historic number of illegal entries the last four years, ICE, Immigration Customs Enforcement, has the lowest number of deportations in the history of the agency. So they're playing a numbers game. Just like they play the numbers game the number of people come across the border. So even though they claim we got the highest number of deportations, look at those deportation, who actually made those arrests, who actually removed those people? It's not ICE.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. It's still a higher number than the Trump administration. But I want to ask you, for the incoming Trump administration, what's- what's the measure? It is not deportations at the border. You're saying you are going to measure success by people who are already internal in the country to deport. That's how you're going to measure it. And what's that figure?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, again, let's get the numbers straight. You say they're higher than Trump administration. This isn't about how many get deported, because Trump had illegal border crossings at a 45 year low. So, of course, removal is going to be lower. The number is how many were released into the United States that are now in the country illegally. Under the Biden administration, we have millions of people released in United States who have lost their hearings, and we have millions of people that are released in United States despite a statute saying that you cannot be released in the United States without proper documentation, you shall be detained. So you can compare the numbers of deportations under Trump versus Biden. But is it- when you can when you consider a 45 year low in crossings, of course, the number of deportations's going to be lower because we don't have that- that population to process and deport.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Well, I'm just trying to measure success going forward for day one. Can you help us understand what the plan is? You know, a number of industries in this country hire undocumented workers because they are cheap labor. On day one, are you going to restart raids on work sites, on construction sites?",
      "TOM HOMAN: The- President Trump has been clear, as I've been clear from day one, the president is going to concentrate on public safety threats and national security threats. And have you heard from your previous segments, we have a huge national security issue in this country. The Southwest border has become the biggest national security vulnerability we've seen in this nation. FBI Director Wray agrees with me. We know there's people in this country who oppose the national security threat. They've arrested a record number of people on terrorist watch lists, a 3500% increase in people on the terrorist watch list being arrested at the border. We got over 2 million known gotaways. We know 2 million people crossed the border, weren't arrested, weren't vetted, weren't fingerprinted. So you gotta ask yourself, why did 2 million people pay more to get away? Why didn't they pay less, turn themselves into border patrol, get a free airline ticket to the city of their choice, get a free hotel room, get three meals a day, get free medical care. Why did\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm- I'm not disputing that it is a hemisphere wide crisis. We're talking about how you're going to deal with it. That's why I'm asking you, when you say criminals, does that mean you are going to go into al- already existing prisons at local level and deport people who are in those prisons? Are you going to go to work forces? I mean, how do you know where the criminals are, I guess, is the question? And if they're working at a work site, are you going to show up to surprise them?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, look, we know where a lot of the criminals are. ICE- ICE does. They're great at this work. We know where some are, but they simply haven't been able to go arrest them, because the Secretary Mayorkas priorities, it handcuffed ICE. So we know where a lot of criminals are, they- they've been- been prevented from arresting that we're going to arrest starting day one. As far as being in jails and prisons, we would love to work in local jails, but sanctuary cities won't allow us into those jails. It's much easier to arrest a public safety threat in the safety and security of a public jail than out in the street, because the officer is safer that way, the alien's safer that way, the community is safer that way. But sanctuary cities who continue to release public safety threats back in the community to the immigrant community, it puts that community at greater risk of crime. And- and- and here's what's going to happen, when we go to the community and find that person, find that criminal alien, it's probably going to be with others. Others we'll have to arrest. So it's not safe for the community, not safe for the officers, not safe for anybody. Let us arrest a bad guy in the jail cell where you chose to arrest somebody and put him in the jail cell because obviously he's a public safety threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. What you just said in there, it sounded like you were talking about collateral arrests. So you're going to target people you know are criminals, but if they happen to be living in a house where there are other undocumented people, you're going to sweep them up too. That's what I think you were just saying there. I wonder how you're going to parse out some of those collateral arrests. For example, will Dreamers be protected?

Let us work with law enforcement. Sanctuary cities are not safe for this- for the immigrant community, not safe for our officers.",

There's other countries be willing to accept them. We're hoping that President Trump will work with Venezuela and like he did with Mexico and El Salvador, and get these countries take them back. If they don't, they're still gonna be deported. They're just gonna be deported to a different country. We're not gonna be held up on removing public safety trust in this country. We gotta put- we gotta put the safety of the American people first. We've had too many young women murdered and raped and burned alive by members of Venezuelan gangs. They need to be a priority under this administration. They're gonna be a priority starting day one, and they will be deported.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Reps. Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio, and Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Jan. 5, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" As we begin the new year, the first few days of January are already proving and providing enormous challenges, both here in Washington and around the country, especially in terms of security. We begin today with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner and Ranking Member Jim Himes, who join us in a bipartisan fashion. Thank you for doing so and for joining us today.",
      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thanks for having us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we have, Chairman, heightened security at U.S. airports, on trains, military bases. This bulletin that went out recently warning of perhaps retaliatory attacks, copycat attacks from that New Orleans car ramming incident. How should Americans understand the threat environment we're in?",
      "REP. TURNER: Right, right. Well, it's certainly very difficult, and our heart breaks as we think of what occurred just after New Year's Eve, on New Year's Day. The- what we know that the FBI director has said is that we- we are in a heightened, threatened environment. We see from, of course, what occurred in New Orleans. We have the threat of those who can be lone wolves, those individuals who might be, as the self-declared terrorist has indicated, inspired by ISIS, by terrorist threats. We also have those who- who are here, who have come across the border, that the director has said are affiliated with terrorist groups, organizations outside of the country who want to do Americans harm. Those individuals still pose a threat to Americans and to the United States. The director, the FBI, local law enforcement are continuing to work to try to find them and try to lessen the risk, but certainly at this time, as we go into the inauguration for Donald Trump, where we even have state actors like Iran who- where we have in-custody individuals who have come here with the stated purpose to- to assassinate as a part of a plot, to have been alleged to perpetrate a plot to assassinate Donald Trump. We have a number of actors that pose a risk and a threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Himes, ISIS has not claimed responsibility for this New Orleans attacker. He did pledge allegiance in these social media videos, but Homeland Security, as far as we have heard from them, said there's no linkage to the US border. There is no linkage established to a foreign actor at this point. Is this just an example of someone with mental health issues choosing violence?",
      "REP. JIM HIMES: Well- and I'm glad you said that, because there was so much misinformation right out of the box, because these attacks happened at the same time. You know, there was all sorts of stuff on social media about how they were coordinated and together, and that the Las Vegas, with New Orleans, you know, the New Orleans- Jabbar, the attacker there, clearly had himself affiliated with ISIS. Now, what we need to know and what- to date, there is no evidence that this is the case, but we need to know whether that individual was deliberately tasked. Again, no evidence that he was. And of course, we constantly see these lone wolf attackers who get radicalized, maybe on social media, maybe in some other location. And- and you know, I would certainly agree with Mike's characterization of the danger out there. But just to add that, as Americans think about the people who are protecting them, and I think the chairman would agree with me on this, the people and assets that we put up against this threat are the best in the world. It is also true that lone wolf attackers, that is an individual who's not communicating with somebody abroad, who's not sending texts or sending emails, are extraordinarily difficult to detect. And you know, though our people are the best in the world, that is hard to find. And by the way, there's a role for people, you know. In New York City, if you go on the subway, it says, if you see something, say something. And so there's a role for everybody out there, you know, to help try to solve, to help try to stop these kinds of lone wolf attacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as one official said to me, this isn't a problem you solve with another aircraft carrier to the Middle East. Some of these things run deeper. In terms of the lone wolf element, that's the term you've used. How do you diagnose and deal with that, Chair Turner, if people are able to be radicalized online? And whether it's political violence or just another form of domestic violent extremism?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, on the issue of New Orleans, we- we don't know yet whether or not he- he will evolve as- as the actual lone wolf, where he operated completely alone. As Jim is saying, as the investigation unfolds, he himself indicated that he joined, as he claimed it, ISIS in the summer. We don't know what that involved. We don't know if it's going to turn out that he was tasked- excuse me. He- he went to New Orleans also in October. There may have been opportunities or times at which he could have been found and could have been prevented. We'll learn what those are, and ways in which he might have been- been found, and maybe we could have intervened. But those will give us greater opportunities at which we'll look to how we might be able to, in the future, find others.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, we've spoken to both of you on this program, in particular about the heightened threat environment many times. And back in June, when there was that arrest of those eight men from Tajikistan who were ISIS linked, we spoke in depth about that. Chair Turner, shortly after that, you said on this program, \"we have terrorists that are actively working inside the United States that are a threat to Americans.\" Do you know if there are active terror cells in the United States right now?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I think- I think the issue of cells, and you are talking about that beginning of the show, are there individuals that are affiliated with ISIS and terrorist groups and organizations that have crossed the border, that are inside the United States? Director Wray, FBI director, has said so, we certainly have intelligence that says so, I agree with his assessment that- Jim has also seen it. He's testified before our committee publicly of that fact. Those individuals are working in conjunction with- with ISIS, with the intention of harming Americans. The director has said it directly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are known to U.S. intelligence and law enforcement, is what you're telling me.",
      "REP. TURNER: And we are working diligently to try to take them down, to prevent them from doing so. And that's why the director is publicly saying such, and that's what the new administration is going to be handed the fact that these individuals are here, that we need to locate them, we need to remove them, we need to bring them to justice and prevent them from doing harm to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we have spoken about this issue in the past, you characterized particularly the rest of the eight as a success story, because there was no plot carried out. They were disrupted. Are the individuals that are of concern, do we know where they are? In terms of those eight they are, we know they were detained, and five of them were actually sent back to Tajikistan.",
      "REP. HIMES: You never know what you don't know. And so none of us, certainly in positions of responsibility, would ever say that there's not terrorists in the United States. Now, I'll say what I said before, which is that we have the very best people and the very best technology looking to root these people out and find them. But let's- if the question is, what should Americans be afraid of? What has killed Americans since 9/11? It hasn't been people sneaking across the border. And that's not to say that the border shouldn't be secure\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Right.",
      "REP. HIMES: The border must be secure. But what has been killing Americans? whether it was Fort Hood in 2009 I think whether it was the New York attacks that killed eight people in 2017 what we just sad- sadly saw in New Orleans. It's actually Americans who are in this country, actually, in a bizarre number of cases, service people. That was the Fort Hood attacks. That was what we saw in New Orleans. That was, though I don't- it doesn't seem to be shaping up as a terrorist attack, what we saw in Las Vegas. So again, that's hard, right? Why is that hard? Because if you're in this country, you have constitutional rights, meaning the FBI can't say without a warrant, I want your Facebook posts. I want your emails. That's what makes this very hard. And again, let's look at what has actually killed Americans in the 20 years, and sadly, it has been radicalized other Americans. So this gets to the question of, what are the mechanisms by which they are radicalized, and how can we as a community push back on that radicalism?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Which is why I asked you, that's a harder problem to solve for.",
      "REP. HIMES: Much harder. Because you have constitutional rights and because, you know, let me give you an example, if somebody is standing out on the street corner right now saying ISIS is the greatest thing in the world, and the President is a traitor. That people would say, boy, we should interview that person. That is constitutionally protected speech. And I wonder how some of my colleagues would respond to the idea, because this individual in New Orleans did post some Facebook posts saying, I pledge allegiance to ISIS. You know what if we had that debate? Should- should Facebook have instantly submitted that to the FBI? And if so, where's the line if I say I'm not a big fan of the next president, and I don't believe that he was, you know, whatever, should that go to the FBI? It's a tough conversation.",
      "REP. TURNER: Margaret, there's no question that- that- that is what we're seeing from New Orleans. But the answer to your question is, no, we don't know where they are. We don't know where the people are that Director Wray has indicated\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013the people who have exploited vulnerabilites at the southwest border.",
      "REP. TURNER: \u2013that has come across the border, that are terrorists affiliated with ISIS that intend to do American harm- Americans harm that are here in our country. We do not know where they are. And part of the work and part of the reason why he's raising the alarm is we need to find them to protect Americans. Now, what Jim's saying is absolutely correct, and that that obviously, is the part that also breaks our heart and makes what happened in New Orleans so hard is, is that we had an American who was killing Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. American born Army vet. I want to ask you both about China as well. In terms of traditional adversaries, they are looming large, here. We learned just in the past few days that China hacked the U.S. Treasury Department. This is on top of the major cyber espionage against nine telecom companies, against hacking of US infrastructure that incoming National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said was 'planting cyber time bombs' in U.S. infrastructure. How much of a trump card is this? I mean, can the U.S. expel China from these systems and get control?",
      "REP. HIMES: So, I mean, let's start with what we know. China has been absolutely predatory in just about every dimension. They've stolen our IP- our IP, our intellectual property. You know, they've manipulated the trading system to hollow out our industrial base, absolutely predatory. And by the way, I happen to believe, and It'll be interesting the chair, if the chairman agrees with me on this, they believe they can operate inside our networks without consequence, and that needs to change immediately. They need to understand that we're as good at this stuff as they are. And if they get into our networks and start planting beacons or start planting landmines or whatever, we're going to do the same to them, so that we establish deterrence. Now you also have to acknowledge that China does, and the U.S. do about $800 billion in trade back and forth, right? And if you snap your fingers and make that go away, you think COVID inflation was bad? Wait till you see that. By the way, they own a trillion dollars of our treasury. So the point I'm making here is that I think we need to be a lot tougher on them, on the areas in which they are predatory against us, even as we recognize that there are areas where we need to tread very carefully, including that economic interconnection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know that we're going to have you both back to talk about exactly this problem. I'm out of time today, but thank you\u2013",
      "REP. TURNER: \u2013There have to be consequences.",
      "REP. HIMES: What he said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will stay tuned. Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined by Speaker Emerita, Nancy Pelosi. It's so good to see you here in person.",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA NANCY PELOSI: My pleasure to be here. Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, tomorrow morning at the Capitol you and other members of Congress will be there to certify the election win in 2024 of Donald Trump. There's an unprecedented level of security, in part because of what happened four years ago with the violent attack by his supporters to change the outcome of the last election. Why do you think that so many members of the American public decided that was not disqualifying when it came to reelecting him president?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Well it- again, thank you for the opportunity to talk about this because the denial that they had about the election, which is what they were acting upon, and the denial they've had since then about what happened on Jan- January 6 is just appalling. They want to revise history. And they just- they just can't. But I'm so glad that they have increased security and I'm hoping that this will be very peaceful because- the public knows it. Now to your question, I think- it isn't, I- I wouldn't say that the American people disregarded this. They just had a different view as to what was in their interest, economically and the rest. So I don't- I don't call this a disregard of January 6. I just call it something that they saw in their interest economically.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even just last night at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump was screening a documentary about the 2020 election, claiming his win and trying to talk about the legal challenges he had. There seems to be a continued effort to claim that he won in 2020.",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: It's really sad. It really is sad. And I don't know about the film that he had and the rest, but it's- it's almost sick that he would be thinking that in 2020. He's won the election now, that will be clear- that will be clear, and tomorrow he will be clearly- we will be accepting the results of the Electoral College. So he should be triumphant about that. But to be still trying to fight a fight that he- he knows he lost is- is really sad.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, the President-elect has said that in the first nine minutes of his new term, he will pardon many of those who participated in January 6. He said he'll look at it on a case-by-case basis, but in looking back at what happened four years ago, there are recordings, there's video evidence of what happened. This is personal for you, some of these rioters in your office. chanting your name. One of them, one of the defendants: \"We were looking for Nancy to shoot her in the friggin brain, but we didn't find her.\" For you, this is personal. So when you hear about pardons, do you think the non-violent attackers deserve to be pardoned?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: The non-violent- I think that's a violent attacker, with the intent\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 the violence itself.",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Yeah\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013The violent language, you think.",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: The violent language- yes, the intention. And of course, the intention to attack the Vice President of the United States. Now it didn't end that day. As you know, he called out to these people to continue their violence, my husband being a victim of all of that, and it still- he still has injuries from that attack. So it just goes on and on. It isn't something that happens and then it's over. No, once you are attacked, you have consequences that continue. So I don't- it's really a strange person who's going to be President of the United States, who thinks that it's okay to pardon people who are engaged in an attack. But let's- you know, let's do this. Let's just say okay to the American people. This is what this is about. Do not be conned by the denial of the election of 2020 and- why would he be saying that? But he- but he is. And then on top of that, the denial of what happened on January 6.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But some of the 1600 defendants here were really only charged with trespassing. And when you look at the profiles, University of Chicago did a study, half of those who broke into the Capitol were white collar workers. They were small business owners. Didn't necessarily have a criminal record. When you look at that profile, you said intention. It- it was the intention itself, you think, that needs to be considered more so than the crime. You know that- that it casts the crime itself of trespassing in a different light for you.",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Well the President said he would go on a case-by-case basis. So I assume that- that some of those people may not have engaged in the violent activities that some of the others did. Look at this beautiful Capitol, the dome built by Lincoln. Under Lincoln's leadership during the Civil War, they said, don't build the dome. It takes too much steel and person power, manpower, they said, from the war effort. And he said, no, I have to show the resilience of America. And then under that dome you saw, you saw flags, the flags that, you know, just horrible flags under the dome of Lincoln. And so it was a tragedy, and we cannot be in denial about what it was. If the President is going to go on a case by case basis, I hope he does, and then maybe\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Trespassers, you would be comfortable with pardoning?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Well, just depends on how they define what that is. But the- but I know that some of that encouragement and then the follow up that- that so many people were threatened, including me and- and to my home, looking for me and finding my husband, and as I say, who still suffers from head injuries from- on that day. So these things don't just happen and go away when you have a head injury. But anyway to- to- to see the threat to so many people in elective office, now going beyond me, but so many people in elective office, it shouldn't be a threat to your family that you have chosen to do public service.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You wrote in your book about that 2022 attack on your husband, and you said your daughter told you [if] she had known what you were signing up for, she would never have given you her blessing to run for office in the first place. Do you think that this threat of domestic violent extremism is having a chilling effect on new talent and- and anyone running for office?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Well, I certainly hope not. But over the years, when I was encouraging people to run for office, especially women, they would say, we could never take the abuse that you take, and that was really just abuse. It wasn't physical, it was criticism and the rest of that, and that we don't want our children subjected to that. And yes, I do think it will have a negative impact on people running for public office. Just- you know, in other words, if you're- if you're a mom, and they go after you as a- as a mom, and your child comes home crying from school because somebody said a negative thing, because they saw it on TV, that the other side said something bad about you, you might not run for office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you think it will discourage particularly women\u2014",
      "NANCY PELOSI: Particularly women.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014from running?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Yeah, I do. I mean, I know that it has. But I hope that it will not, that we will have shine a bright light on this and just say, this is unacceptable. This is unacceptable. See, for women, they always- they always- women are known to be more, shall we say, ethical, than men. And so when they go after women candidates, they go after their ethics. And they'll say this, that and the other thing. And then the child comes home from school crying because somebody said a bad thing about mom on TV. And nobody- nobody wants that. So hopefully the bright light shining on that will reduce- reduce that. But I think that women have proven that they are- are more ethical, and that they- they are, well, maybe they're not more ethical, they're all ethical, but that they can- then withstand that criticism.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you- during the first Trump presidency, as speaker, you took very public stance to challenge Donald Trump when he was president. Democrats now are in the minority in this new congress. Tom Suozzi from New York recently said, it would be a mistake for Democrats to reflexively oppose Trump's ideas and brand themselves a \"national resistance movement.\" This is a Democrat who won in a Trump district, and he's warning fellow Democrats. Do you agree resistance is a bad strategy this time?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Well I- let me just say, historically, when I became speaker, it was when I ran with a Republican president, George Bush, and we opposed his policies. He wanted to privatize Social Security. And so we went against that, and we won. And then when I won again as speaker, George- Donald Trump was president, and we ran against him by saying, we're going to save the Affordable Care Act. This is- this is it. We were saving Social Security in the beginning. Now we're saving the Affordable Care Act. So we won the majority, yes, by disagreeing on certain points. That doesn't mean you disagree on every issue, no. But it does mean that you protect the values that bring you to Congress, the vision that you have about health care, the values that you have about health care, again, because health care is an issue that is so important because health care cost are so high that- that it affects whether you can have housing, whether you can have food on the table, and the rest. And so\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would encourage Democrats to work with Donald Trump on an issue like health care?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: I don't know that he wants to be on health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are there opportunities to work with him on anything?",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: No- on other issues. No. On health care, no. But no, just be- well, we both- with George Bush on many issues, and- several issues, let me say, and no, I don't- I don't say that we should work with him on health care. I'm saying we are out there to protect the Affordable Care Act. He said, Obamacare sucks. Now that's not something we want to work with, that Obamacare sucks. So we want to be out there to save the Affordable Care Act, and recognize that reducing the cost of health care can enable people to have housing, have food on the table and the rest. And that's- there are studies that show the relationship between ability to have housing and food when you have good, affordable care, health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker Emerita, thank you for your time today.",
      "SPEAKER EMERITA PELOSI: Thank you. My pleasure to be with you. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more \"Face the Nation.\" Stay with us."

Mitch McConnell's decision to step down after nearly two decades at the helm, among his first priorities will be the confirmation of Trump's nominees to top administration and Cabinet positions.

We have the majorities in the House, the Senate, the White House, but the majority in the House is incredibly narrow, which creates some unique management challenges. But they've worked around them, and we will work around them and work with the Trump administration, the President and his team, on an agenda that he campaigned on, and that many of our colleagues here in the Senate and the House campaigned on, and so we're excited about the opportunity. Yes, it's- these are unusual circumstances with respect to the margins, particularly in the house, but we expect to deliver on what the American people asked us to do.",

      "SEN. THUNE: I think JD is already performing that role, and I think will continue to. I think, obviously, he has the President's ear. He's widely respected by his colleagues here in the Senate and in the House, I would add. And I think he will be somebody who can help the administration, as they work through these issues, figure out what's realistic, what's achievable, what we can accomplish here in the Senate, because he's been here. He knows it's challenging\u2014",

      "SEN. THUNE: \u2014but he's an incredibly talented person, as you know, very smart and a quick study. And I think there- if there's anybody who has been able to acclimate and understand the, sort of the unique aspects of how the Senate operates in a short amount of time, it's him. But he's the President of the Senate, and I would expect that he'll continue to be someone that acts as a, you know, sort of an intermediary with the- with the White House and the Senate and the House in trying to implement the President's agenda.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've had disagreements with Donald Trump in the past, as part of this Advise and Consent role, the role of the Senate. Will you tell him when you think he's wrong?",
      "SEN. THUNE: I will, and I think my job is to do everything I can to help him achieve success, be a successful president, which, in my view, means that we'll be a successful country. The things that he talked about on the campaign trail, the things that the American people voted for, are all things that I think this President wants to get done, we want to get done, and I say that our incentives are aligned. We have the same set of objectives. We want to get to the same destination, but I think at times, there will be differences in how we get there. And I think I have to spell out as clearly as I can to anybody who asks, what the challenges are in the Senate. The Senate is a very different institution. Clearly functions different than the House of Representatives. And understanding the unique aspects of how the Senate operates is something that I'm going to have to be able to share and convey to the President and help him understand, I think, what the- you know, what the contours are, what we can accomplish here in the Senate, and what's realistic",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have a 53 seat majority over here, which means you can only lose three votes if Democrats remain unified in their opposition to some of Mr. Trump's picks for his cabinet. Do you expect them all to make it through? And if so, how quickly?",
      "SEN. THUNE: I think, what I've promised is a fair process for all of them, and we'll ensure that they get a confirmation hearing, an opportunity to make their case, answer the hard questions that inevitably are going to come, and perform the role that the Senate has in terms of advice and consent. But I also believe that the President deserves- I defer to the President. I'm very- when it comes to his picks, and I would say this of any president, they deserve a lot of latitude. And I think that, you know, his picks are going to come through a process where, if they get reported out of the committee, come across the floor of the Senate, we'll make sure that they get the- the vote. And I think that- I suspect a lot of them will get through. And- and we'll see about all of them. Remains to be seen, but I think that's why we have the process, and we will adhere to that process and give all of these nominees an opportunity to make their case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said you have to see if Democrats play ball or not, but you don't need Democrats to get these through. So does that mean you already know some of your Republican senators won't vote to confirm Kash Patel at the FBI or Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon?",
      "SEN. THUNE: We don't have, at this point, I don't think, clarity on that. I think these are nominees who are new enough, they've been going around and conducting their meetings, which I think, frankly, have gone very well, but they still have to make their case in front of the committee. And, you know, we don't know all the information about some of these nominees. I think we know a lot about them, but they deserve a fair process, and that's what we've committed to and promised and- and I expect to deliver on. And ultimately, whether or not they get through that process is- is going to be up to each individual senator and how they decide to vote. We have a three vote margin in the Senate, as you point out. But I do think that in most cases, at least, most of our Republican senators are inclined to give the President the people that he wants in these positions, given, you know, the process that they go through and whether or not they can manage the committee process and ensure that they get to the floor for vote.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that include FBI background checks? I know often the ranking members get them on armed services, for example, but some of your colleagues, they want to see Pete Hegseth's FBI background check before they vote.",
      "SEN. THUNE: Right, and I think that's going to be determined largely by the committee chairs. I think there will be an interest, obviously\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013would you encourage them?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, sure. I mean, I think that you want to have as much background as possible that is available to the committees as they make their decisions. But I have a lot of confidence in our committee chairs. One of the things that I've made a focus of, at least my leadership here, is to get the committees functioning again, in a way, ensuring that the committee chairs and individual members of the committee have an opportunity to make sure their voices are heard in the process and that we take advantage of the talent that we have on those individual committees. So I have a high level of confidence in our chairs that they will ensure that as members of the committee, and of the full Senate, have an opportunity to consider these nominees that they've got all of the information available to them that they should have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of your colleagues told me you are a \"count the votes guy.\" You're not a \"twist the arm guy.\" Do you think that's fair?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, I think that, you know, sometimes it depends a little bit on what your role is. The job that I have held now for the last six years, the whip job, differs if you're in the minority or in the majority. If you're in the majority, you need to get the votes. You're in the minority, you want to know where your vote count is, and you're playing defense as opposed to playing offense. They're very different roles. But I know, I believe how to- I understand my members have worked with them all for a really long time, and I think whether it's actually counting, and I think we're very accurate when it comes to counting. I take great pride in that, and the team- the work the team has done the last six years. But also it's important to get the votes, and I believe when necessary, we know how to do that, and I've had to do that in the role that I have now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Joe Manchin, a now former senator, told us recently on \"Face the Nation\", that if you- his dad told him, \"if you can say no with a tear in your eye, you're all good.\" Do you agree with him on that?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, I think that, you know I- what I've always said is, and as a whip, every member's vote is their vote. You in the end can't force somebody to vote, you know, how they- against what their- their wishes are, what their constituents want them to do. So their vote is their vote. What I've always asked is that they not surprise us, and that if they give you- tell you something, that that's that that's their word and and you expect them to adhere to that. And that's kind of always the way that I proceeded. And I think there are times in which individual senators, for state reasons, and the constituents that they represent may come to a different conclusion, and that's their right. That's their prerogative. And that's why my style, as I described, is obviously, it's persuasion. It's trying to get them to a place where, if possible, they can support the team. But I understand there are circumstances in which they're going to have to reflect the views the people that elected them, and that's- that's what this job ultimately, is about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Recess appointments. Bypassing the Senate entirely. Would you ask Mr. Trump not to do that?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, here's the thing, and you asked earlier about cooperation from the Democrats. I don't think the Democrats are going to give us any votes. I mean, I hope they do. And I think they will on some- some nominees. I mean, I've got enough feedback, readouts, I think, from some of these meetings, and I think that the some of our the President's nominees, will win Democrat votes, but by and large, their leadership\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Senator Rubio, for example\u2013",
      "SEN. THUNE: \u2013Sure, yeah. I mean\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013But Tulsi Gabbard?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, but I mean\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Pete Hegseth, Kash Patel.",
      "SEN. THUNE:\u00a0 We'll see there's a whole bunch of- of nominees, some of whom will have more Democrat support than others. But I think in the end, the Democrat leadership, in most cases, is probably not going to be largely supportive of some of the President's picks, with maybe a few exceptions. But what's more important to me is not how they ultimately vote. You're right. You pointed this out. We have a majority. If we get 51 votes, Republican votes, we can win most of these nominees, but it's how much they drag that process out. And I pointed out to people that if you go back to President Obama, he had his first 12 Cabinet nominees in 15 days. It took President Trump 42 days and President Biden 50 days. So we're moving in the wrong direction when it comes to giving a President the opportunity to get their people in place as quickly as possible. And so what I've said is we're going to keep, you know, the options at our disposal to make sure that we are moving in a way consistent with the way the Senate functions and works that gets these folks an opportunity to be voted on in the Senate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what you need to get done policy wise as well, in terms of providing the president the funding to execute on some of his big goals.",
      "SEN. THUNE: Right",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said you're going to go out of the gate with a generation- \"a generational investment in border security and immigration enforcement.\" You're going to pass it on 51 party line votes. If you want to govern through regular order, why go through this in a party line direction?",
      "SEN. THUNE:\u00a0 Well, it's one of those issues that has become incredibly divisive for the country, and there aren't very many people left in the middle. Reconciliation enables us. It doesn't come along very often where you have unified control of the government. In a lot of cases, it doesn't last very long. It's a couple of years. The Democrats provided a template in the last couple of years for how to expand the scope of what's available to get done through the reconciliation process. It's the only process in the Senate that enables you to enact legislation with a 51 vote threshold, as opposed to 60.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. THUNE: And so immigration, the border\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, it's out of the gate saying, we're not going to work with Democrats.",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, I'm not saying what- they came out of the gate. They had their first reconciliation bill done in four weeks coming on it when they got the majority.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 $2 trillion\u2013",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013with the COVID bill and you didn't like it.",
      "SEN. THUNE: $2 trillion\u2013",
      "[crosstalk]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013you faulted them for using reconciliation\u2013",
      "SEN. THUNE: 11:01:11\u00a0 \u2013 and another- another trillion with the IRA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.",
      "SEN. THUNE: It would be ideal if we could figure out a way to do things at the 60 vote threshold and there are a number of things we will. I mean, there are a number of issues where we're going to have to get 60 votes. We have to get 60 votes on appropriation bills. We have to get 60 votes on 60 votes on a farm bill, which is expired. Those are going to be bipartisan initiatives, but there are some things that you can do. And the Democrats, again, created the template for doing this with how they did the IRA and the American Rescue Plan for doing some things at 51 and we think that a generational investment in the border is necessary, given where we are after the last four years of a what I think is a very failed Biden Harris border policy. And I think there isn't anybody who objectively wouldn't agree with that. 10 and a half million people coming across the border illegally, including a lot of very unsavory folks, members of terrorist organizations and criminal elements and cartels, etc.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Do you know they're members of terrorist organizations? Here on U.S. soil?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Sure. Yeah. Well, I'm saying they've been apprehended there. We know that there are almost 300 that have been apprehended that are on the terrorist watch list.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. THUNE: And I think if they've apprehended that many, I suspect a lot of them have gotten through.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 1.4 million people here with deportation orders, orders of removal against them. I've seen numbers that put the cost of expelling them at between $80 to $100 billion annually. Can you get that kind of money in the first 100 days?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, I think that what we're trying to do is get an assessment from the people who are going to be in place. They're going to be implementing a lot of the President's policies when it comes to the border determine what that- that resource allocation is going to need.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They don't know yet.",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, I think that what we do know is we need physical barriers. We need technological barriers. We need more ICE agents. We need more Border Patrol agents. And yes, we're going to need ways of deporting people that are on that- on that list that you mentioned. And so it's going to take some resources to do that, which is why I would argue that when the President takes office and he's going to do a lot of things on the border by executive order, by executive action, that we're going to need to be able to provide the resources in order for him to do that. And that's why I've suggested that we take that border issue on right away and enable him to do the things that- that he needs to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it true you're going to put some defense spending in that as well?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, I think one of the things that we always argue about around here is the amount of money that we need to spend on defense. And clearly that is an issue where if you look at every Biden administration budget, there wasn't a single one of them when it came to military spending that came up- kept up even with inflation. So we have a military readiness in this country. You know, we have the defense strategy or commission, defense commission strategy group that comes out with report all the time and tells us we are dramatically underfunded relative to countries like China\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those should be bipartisan issues, right?",
      "SEN. THUNE: And that we don't have the capacity well, and we don't have the capacity and the capability to do what needs to be done to protect the country. So, I- my argument would be, and yes, those should be bipartisan, but there- it is very difficult, in my experience around here, there's a big difference in Delta, in the two parties and how they approach the issue of defense and, you know, and military readiness. And I think we are dramatically underfunding our military today. I think the President believes that, President Trump, and I think a lot of our Republican colleagues in the House, the Senate, share that view. So can we do this through reconciliation? We're obviously looking at our options.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to make sure I ask you about the other big promise you made in terms of delivering on tax reform and reconciliation. The estimates are it could add $4 trillion over the next decade. Is that really something you think is going to pass on a party line vote and without any revenue or spending cuts? You can't be comfortable.",
      "SEN. THIUNE:",
      "Well- there- there are- its current policy. So it's- it is these are- these are tax laws that will expire at the end of this year if Congress doesn't take action to extend them, and it would represent a $4 trillion tax increase on the American people if we don't extend that policy. We're going to have a very robust conversation about tax reform. I was a big part of it back in 2017 when we did the initial Trump tax cuts. And this time around, there's a lot riding on it. There's a lot riding on it economically. I think regulatory policy, tax policy, energy policy, are going to be really essential to the strength of the- our economy, how fast we can grow and expand and create better paying jobs in this country. So I'm a big believer in pro-growth tax policy. I believe you get a lot of that back through growth and additional revenue every 1 percent\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not tariffs as Mr. Trump has promised?",
      "SEN. THUNE: Well, that's- that's a different subject, but I would say every 1 percent increase in GDP and economic growth, we're told, generates about $3 trillion in additional tax revenue. So you're going to get some back in terms of a growth dividend, and there will be spending cuts. There's no question about it. Our members in both the House and the Senate want to ensure that when we do tax reform through reconciliation, that it also includes significant reductions in spending, particularly in certain areas. And I think that's something that as we work through this, we'll figure out a way to do this in a way that hopefully inspires 51 votes in the Senate and 218 in the House to get this across the finish line.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But going out of the gate with two big issues on party line votes \u2013 aren't you concerned that will blow up your chances at working with Democrats on some of those bigger immigration issues or bigger policies?",
      "SEN. JOHN THUNE: Well, I think we- we need to continue to work on those big policy issues, but I also think we have some immediate concerns - matters that need to be addressed - one of which is national security, given the increasingly dangerous world in which we live. And of course, I would argue that starts with the border. So border, national security. I think energy policy, energy dominance is a huge objective and goal, and I would hope that a reconciliation bill could also address that issue. If we do something on taxes, that traditionally has been- in the past, the Democrats did it twice while they had the majority in the last session of the Congress, they did two big reconciliation bills, both of which did a lot of tax policy, spending policy, etc.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Trump did that in 2017 too, with taxes.",
      "SEN JOHN THUNE: And that's - and both sides have done it. And that's- that's the unique aspect of having unified control of the government. You can do things in the Senate at 51 votes. But I think those are all important, and they are things that, as a country, if we don't get right, I fear what the results and the outcome will be. You can't have a $4 trillion increase in taxes on the American people at the end of this year if Congress doesn't act. I think that is a very compelling, you know, powerful incentive for members of Congress to come together and work constructively in a unified way as a team to get some of these things done. And yes, it'd be ideal if you could do it bipartisan. I hope that there are some Democrats who would vote for some of the tax policies that we have, but I'm not- I'm not expecting that at the moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Leader, it is wonderful to be here with you and to have the time, and I hope we can have more conversations in the future.",
      "SEN. JOHN THUNE: Sounds good. Thanks Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot more to cover.",
      "SEN. JOHN THUNE: Great to be with you. Thank you. Happy New Year.",

      "President Biden has made it clear that Israel has the right to defend its citizens as the American ally presses forward with its war against Hamas in Gaza.",
      "Some of the arms in the package could be sent through current U.S. stocks but the majority would take upwards of a year to several years to deliver, the U.S. official said.",
      "The sale includes medium-range air-to-air missiles to help Israel defend against airborne threats, 155 mm projectile artillery shells for long-range targeting, Hellfire AGM-114 missiles, 500-pound bombs and more.",
      "The news of the weapons sale was first reported by Axios.",
      "The weapons package would add to a\u00a0record of at least $17.9 billion in military aid\u00a0that the U.S. has provided Israel since the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, launched the war.",
      "The Biden administration has faced criticism over mounting deaths of Palestinian civilians. There have been demonstrations on college campuses and\u00a0unsuccessful efforts in Congress\u00a0by Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, and some Democrats to block sales of offensive weapons to Israel.",
      "The United States\u00a0paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs\u00a0to Israel in May over concerns about civilian casualties if the bombs were to be used during an assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The Biden administration has demanded that Israel increase humanitarian aid into the enclave. But in November, citing some limited progress, it declined to limit arms transfers as it threatened to do if the situation did not improve.",
      "In recent days, Israel has been\u00a0conducting airstrikes in Gaza\u00a0that have killed dozens of people, adding to the tens of thousands of deaths since the war began more than a year ago.",
      "The Israeli army said Friday that it had struck dozens of Hamas gathering points and command centers throughout Gaza. Israel's military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas.",
      "The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times.\u00a0Winter has now arrived, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in tents near the sea.",
      "The informal notice to Congress isn't the final notification before a sale. Now the leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee can review the package.",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 14:12:27 -0500",
    "summary": "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
    "story": [
      "British researchers have unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Teams from Oxford and Birmingham Universities made the \"exhilarating\" discovery at a quarry in Oxfordshire in central England after a worker came across \"unusual bumps\" as he was stripping clay back with a mechanical digger, according to a new BBC documentary.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham, told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The site features five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous track stretching almost 500 feet in length.",
      "Four of the five trackways uncovered are believed to have been made by a long-necked herbivorous dinosaur, most likely a cetiosaurus.",
      "The fifth set of tracks likely belongs to a nine-meterlong carnivorous megalosaurus known for its distinctive three-toed feet with claws, according to the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"It's rare to find them so numerous in one place and it's rare to find such extensive trackways as well,\" Emma Nicholls of Oxford University's Museum of Natural History told AFP.",
      "The area could turn out to be one of the world's biggest dinosaur track sites, she added.",
      "The discovery will feature in the BBC television documentary \"Digging for Britain\", due to be broadcast on January 8.",
      "\"Exhilarating\" discovery",
      "A 100-strong team led by academics from Oxford and Birmingham excavated the tracks during a week-long dig in June.",
      "The new footprints follow a smaller discovery in the area in 1997, when 40 sets were uncovered during limestone quarrying, with some trackways reaching up to 180 meters in length.",
      "The researchers took 20,000 photographs of the latest footprints and created detailed 3D models of the site using aerial drone photography.",
      "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" the Oxford museum's Duncan Murdock told the BBC. \"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "Richard Butler, a paleobiologist from the University of Birmingham, said some chance weather may be the reason the tracks had been so well preserved.",
      "\"We don't know exactly... but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away,\" he said.",
      "Quarry worker Gary Johnson, whose watchfulness triggered the excavation, said the experience had been spellbinding.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal -- a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found matching dinosaur footprints on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "Last year, engineers working to prevent flooding on a beach in the U.K. made a \"dramatic discovery\" of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

      "\"While Parker Solar Probe was closer to the Sun than any other human-made object in history, it operated just as it was designed to do, and made observations that no one has been able to make before,\" Parker Solar Probe Project Manager Helene Winters said in a statement. \"From the heat shield to the solar array cooling system, there was so much enabling technology required to fly this mission, and to gather data scientists have awaited for decades. Parker Solar Probe's ability to thrive in the hostile environment around the Sun is a tribute to the team that designed and built this remarkable spacecraft.\"",

      "The new year will kick off with the Quadrantid meteor shower, which is set to peak early on Friday.",
      "The Quadrantids have the potential of 200 meteors an hour under perfect conditions, but most astronomy fans can catch 20-30 meteors an hour under clear, dark skies during the peak, according to NASA. The moon will be a \"mere crescent\" and set early in the night, which should make for good meteor viewing conditions, according to the space agency.",
      "When and where you can see the Quadrantids",
      "The meteor shower will peak in the early morning hours on Friday, according to NASA. While meteor showers last for days, the per hour rate of meteors will be best during the peak and the highest as dawn approaches.",
      "The Quadrantids will be active until Jan. 16, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "NASA advises viewing meteor showers in areas well away from city and street lights. The Quadrantids are best seen from the Northern Hemisphere, and observers in the Northwest and Pacific region will likely have the best viewing opportunities this year.",
      "Those heading outside to catch the celestial show should lie flat on their backs with their feet facing northeast and look up. Be prepared to wait about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark. Viewers should also bring along a blanket or sleeping bag to help with the chilly January weather.",
      "What is a meteor shower?",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. They streak through the sky every night, and when Earth encounters many meteors at once, it's called a meteor shower. The meteors heat up as they pass through the atmosphere, making them look like shooting stars.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "Did Apple break any laws?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial.",
      "The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \"fundamental human right.\"",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "Should I be worried about microphones on other devices being used to spy on me?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "How do I disable Siri?",
      "You can turn Apple's virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for 'Hey Siri' and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",

      "The revelation comes as U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.

      "While Congress meets Monday to count the Electoral College votes and affirm President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election, the roughly 1,500 people accused of storming the Capitol four years ago will be focused on what happens next.",
      "Charged as part of the largest Justice Department's investigation in history, they have been waiting to see if Trump fulfills his promise to pardon them or commute their sentences.",
      "Prosecutors have charged more than 1,580 defendants with crimes tied to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot, including more than 170 who are accused of using deadly or dangerous weapons like fire extinguishers and bear spray against officers. While a majority were charged with nonviolent misdemeanor crimes, some were accused of conspiring to use force to resist the peaceful transfer of power. Others admitted to fighting officers and attacking members of the media.",
      "More than 1,000 defendants have since pleaded guilty, and about 220 more were convicted at trial. Federal investigations said they are also seeking the public's assistance in locating at least five known fugitives.",
      "According to the Justice Department, 1,100 defendants have already had their cases fully adjudicated, and hundreds have already completed prison terms.",
      "The outgoing U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., has continued to bring new charges against defendants.",
      "\"The Department continues to pursue those criminally culpable, especially those who assaulted law enforcement officers and engaged in disruptive or obstructive conduct that interfered with the peaceful transfer of power,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement.",
      "But with Trump's pledge to pardon at least some defendants and shut down the investigation, many of those who breached the Capitol four years ago could see their convictions erased and records wiped clean.",
      "Potential pardons",
      "Trump told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" in December he's \"inclined to pardon many\" of the defendants immediately upon his inauguration, although he has also said some \"got out of control\" and might not receive a pardon. He expressed sympathy for Jan. 6 defendants, who he said had \"suffered long and hard.\"",
      "The Constitution gives presidents unfettered power to pardon any federal crime. Recently, President Biden used the authority to pardon his son, Hunter, a move that was met with bipartisan criticism. In December, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 1,500 people who were convicted of nonviolent crimes and \"demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation.\"",
      "Usually, presidents work with the Justice Department's pardon attorney to consider clemency requests. The Trump transition team has not disclosed how it plans to handle the gargantuan task of reviewing pardons for hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "Trump transition spokeswoman Caroline Leavitt told CBS News that Trump would \"pardon Americans who were denied due process and unfairly prosecuted by the weaponized Department of Justice.\"",
      "Fallout in court",
      "Trump intends to nominate former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to be attorney general, and he plans to tap former defense official Kash Patel to be FBI director. If confirmed, Bondi and Patel \u2014 who has said he opposes the Jan. 6 prosecutions \u2014 would have the power to shut down the Capitol breach investigations altogether and weigh in on the administration's clemency strategy.",
      "Ahead of Trump's inauguration, Jan. 6 defendants have been asking judges to pause their cases or delay proceedings, citing Trump's pardon promises.",
      "A day after the election, attorneys for one defendant, Christopher Carnell, wrote that their client \u2014 who faced nonviolent disorderly conduct charges \u2014 is \"expecting to be relieved of the criminal prosecution that he is currently facing when the new administration takes office.\" A federal judge in D.C. rejected Carnell's request to delay his case. He was later convicted on multiple counts and sentenced to six months in prison.",
      "Like Carnell, the majority of the Jan. 6 defendants were charged with nonviolent crimes, like illegal entry into the Capitol or unlawful picketing. Prosecutors say they opted not to charge individuals who merely protested outside the Capitol that day and focused instead on those who entered the building.",
      "Advocates for Jan. 6 defendants say they deserve pardons, contending that some faced charges that were too harsh, some jury pools were unfair or some received unduly harsh penalties for the crimes.",
      "A group of family members and supporters have regularly gathered outside the D.C. jail where some defendants are being held and pushed for clemency. At his campaign rallies, Trump often played a recording of the National Anthem sung by defendants in the jail. According to the U.S. attorney in Washington, about 10 defendants are currently being housed in the D.C. facility either pending trial or waiting to be moved to a federal prison.",
      "Some defendants faced more serious charges, like assault. Members of the far-right Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were charged with seditious conspiracy, the most severe charge levied by prosecutors. Juries in those cases found numerous defendants, including Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, guilty of using force to oppose the federal government. Tarrio received the longest of the Jan. 6 sentences \u2014 22 years in prison \u2014 while Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years.",
      "James Lee Bright, who represented Rhodes during his criminal trial but has withdrawn from the case, said, \"I absolutely think a pardon for him is warranted.\"",
      "Bright has also represented other Jan. 6 defendants, and he described a sense of \"dismay\" that courts and prosecutors haven't acknowledged the looming possibility of Trump pardons.",
      "Rhodes' current attorney did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Tarrio's legal team plans to \"explore every possible avenue to seek the release from custody\" for their client, according to a letter provided to CBS News.",
      "Both Rhodes and Tarrio are appealing their convictions.",
      "Attorney Carmen Hernandez represented a Tarrio codefendant who was also convicted of seditious conspiracy. In an interview, she argued \"at a minimum,\" the seditious conspiracy charge for all defendants should be pardoned.",
      "\"I think the seditious conspiracy convictions of the Proud Boys should be pardoned. There is no reason for those men to have been charged and convicted for seditious conspiracy,\" Hernandez said. She said pardoning them would enable defendants who are also veterans to maintain some of their benefits.",
      "Hernandez represents at least a dozen other Jan. 6 defendants and said almost all of her clients with open felony cases hope to be pardoned when Trump takes office. But the process for requesting clemency remains uncertain, and it's not expected to begin until Trump is inaugurated. Trump told Time magazine he'd consider the Jan. 6 cases soon after he takes office.",
      "\"I'll be looking at J6 early on, maybe the first nine minutes,\" he said",
      "Alexis Loeb, a former federal prosecutor who helped lead the Capitol attack investigation until last October, said she stood by the cases and noted they were based on a uniquely large amount of evidence.",
      "While she declined to discuss any individual case or internal Justice Department deliberations, Loeb said, \"These were prosecutions that were staffed by career employees. And the cases often had a remarkable amount of evidence given all of the video that was taken that day.\"",
      "An uncertain future",
      "The federal judges overseeing the Jan. 6 cases in district court in Washington, D.C., are also grappling with the uncertainty that lies ahead. Nearly all of these judges have been involved in the roughly 1,500 cases. A CBS News review of court hearings and records over the last four years showed judges appointed by presidents from both parties, including by Trump, have condemned the Jan. 6 riot and warned of future unrest.",
      "Judge Royce Lamberth \u2014 a senior judge appointed to the bench by Ronald Reagan who has been an outspoken critic of attack \u2014 recently defended the court's handling of the cases.",
      "\"Just as the President must make decisions on matters of clemency without interference from the coordinate branches, so too must our judiciary independently administer the laws and sentence convicted offenders,\" Lamberth wrote. \"No matter what ultimately becomes of the Capital Riots cases already concluded and still pending, the true story of what happened on January 6, 2021 will never change.\"",
      "Should Trump decide to pardon some of the Jan. 6 defendants, the cases would be wiped from the judges' dockets and closed. Lamberth and his colleagues would no longer have jurisdiction over the defendants.",
      "Loeb, the former prosecutor, argued that any pardons would be \"a real affront to the victims\" of the riot, including police officers, members of Congress and their staff. More than 140 officers were assaulted during the attack, according to the Justice Department. Multiple people died during the breach, including Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by a U.S. Capitol Police officer. At least five officers died in the aftermath, including four by suicide.",
      "Federal judges, Loeb contended, have served in a unique position during sentencing hearings, where they both note the significance of Jan. 6 and look \"at the criminal conduct, the individuals' history and characteristics and the need for deterrence among other factors.\"",
      "Pardons would risk repeat occurrences of the violence, Loeb said, and nullify any deterrent effect of the convictions.",
      "There are also questions about how pardon or clemency decisions would be communicated to the courts and the federal prison system, which has housed more than 600 individuals tied to Capitol breach over the last four years.",
      "\"I don't know what the president is planning to do,\" Hernandez said. She suggested \"an easy first step\" for Trump would be to sign a blanket order commuting the sentence of all Jan. 6 defendants. After that, Hernandez said, the cases could be evaluated at a more detailed level.",
      "As for the future of Jan. 6 investigations, Hernandez said she anticipates at a minimum the charging and plea decision-making processes within a Trump Justice Department would avoid what she characterized as the \"overcharging\" of the last four years.",
      "For Loeb, who helped lead the Justice Department's Capitol riot unit beginning in February 2021, potential pardons aren't sitting well. \"If you look at the publicly available facts presented in court, the facts fit the crimes,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt, Trump's spokeswoman, alleged the media \"still refuses to report the truth about what happened that day,\" and criticized the work of the congressional committee that investigated the attack.",
      "\"The American people did not fall for the Left's fear mongering over January 6th. They reelected President Trump by a resounding margin because they want him to unify our country through success, and that's exactly what he will do,\" Leavitt added.",
      "Libby Cathey and \n                                                  \n                                  Scott MacFarlane\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Washington \u2014 When Congress convenes on Monday to count Electoral College votes from each state and finalize\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the November presidential election, the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted the joint session four years ago will be looming over the proceedings.",
      "But unlike on\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021, when then-Vice President Mike Pence faced pressure to unilaterally toss out electoral votes from battleground states, Monday's joint session will be governed by a revised set of procedures that clarify the vice president's role to prevent attempts to overturn the results of an election.",
      "\"The 2020 election exposed how ambiguities in the Electoral Count Act could be exploited to sow chaos and disrupt the peaceful transfer of presidential power,\" said Holly Idelson, a policy strategist at Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. \"The bipartisan Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 will help ensure future transitions proceed smoothly and honor the will of the voters.\"",
      "What is the Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022?",
      "In December 2022, Congress approved the changes as part of a broader government spending package. The legislation updated the Electoral Count Act, an 1887 law that laid out the framework for the casting and counting of Electoral College votes after a presidential election.",
      "Called the Electoral Count Reform Act, the revised measure clarified the process that begins in the wake of Election Day and culminates with Congress confirming the winner of the presidential election during a joint session on Jan. 6. The goal of the legislation was to address ambiguities in the 1887 law that Trump's allies seized on in 2020 to challenge the results of the election.",
      "Trump faced federal charges as a result of the alleged scheme to subvert the transfer of power in 2020 but they were dismissed in late November after he won a second term. Several of the president-elect's allies who allegedly helped orchestrate or participated in the plans were charged by local prosecutors in Arizona and Georgia. Some have agreed to plead guilty while others have denied wrongdoing.",
      "What's different about Jan. 6 this time?",
      "Who certifies the state's appointment of electors",
      "After states make their pick for the White House on Election Day, \"certificates of ascertainment\" are issued that name the electors selected by the winning candidate for president and vice president.",
      "The Electoral Count Reform Act makes clear the certificates of ascertainment are issued by each state's executive, defined as the governor unless otherwise specified, no later than six days before the date the Electoral College meets, which was Dec. 17.",
      "It also states that those certificates issued by governors \"shall be treated as conclusive in Congress\" with respect to the electors appointed. Under the law, federal courts are also the final deciders of questions regarding the appointment of electors arising under the Constitution or federal law, and their determinations \"shall be conclusive in Congress.\"",
      "Following the 2020 election, groups of Trump's electors met in key battleground states on the same day the Electoral College convened to cast votes for president and vice president based on the election results. They signed fake certifications falsely claiming they were the legitimate electors, according to federal and congressional investigations. Some of them were mailed to the vice president and other government officials.",
      "Federal prosecutors said that under the plan developed by Trump and his allies, submitting the fraudulent slates of electors would create a fake controversy on Jan. 6 and position Pence to replace legitimate electors with those backing Trump.",
      "The legitimate electors' signed certificates, though, were added to the certificates of ascertainment from state executives before they were sent.",
      "The limited role for the vice president",
      "The Electoral Count Reform Act clarifies the role of the vice president \u2014 who serves as the president of the Senate \u2014 when overseeing the counting of electoral votes. Under the law, the vice president's role is limited to \"performing solely ministerial duties.\" It explicitly denies the vice president the power to \"solely determine, accept, reject or otherwise adjudicate or resolve disputes over the proper certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors, the validity of electors, or the votes of electors.\"",
      "The provisions regarding the vice president are a direct response to the 2020 election, when Trump and his allies pressured Pence to reject the legitimate electoral votes from seven battleground states and either send them to state legislatures for review or use the fake slates of electors that supported Trump.",
      "Pence resisted the pressure, writing in a letter to lawmakers on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, that the Constitution constrained him \"from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.\" He said the vice president's role as presiding officer during the joint session is \"largely ceremonial,\" an opinion the 2022 law formally adopted.",
      "\"I do not believe that the Founders of our country intended to invest the vice president with unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted during the joint session of Congress, and no vice president in American history has ever asserted such authority,\" Pence wrote.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Trump defeated in November, will preside over the joint session Monday and reaffirm the president-elect's win.",
      "A higher threshold for objections",
      "The law also changed the procedures for objections to a state's electoral votes. Under the Electoral Count Reform Act, an objection must be made in writing and be signed by at least one-fifth of senators and one-fifth of House members. Previously, objections had to be signed by just one senator and House member.",
      "There are only two grounds for objections under the law: when a state's electors were not lawfully certified under a certificate of ascertainment, or when the vote of at least one elector has not been regularly given.",
      "If an objection is made and meets these requirements, the House and Senate separately consider them. An objection is sustained by a majority vote of each chamber.",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 22:11:55 -0500",
    "summary": "New law means police officers, teachers and others with public pensions will now collect their full Social Security benefits.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden on Sunday signed legislation expanding Social Security benefits for millions of retired Americans, including firefighters, police officers and teachers.",
      "\"Americans who have worked hard all their life to make an honest living should be able to retire with economic security and dignity,\" Mr. Biden told a gathering at the White House before signing the Social Security Fairness Act, which he said would mean an average monthly increase of $360 for more than 2.5 million Social Security recipients.",
      "\"That's a big deal in middle-class households like the one I grew up in and many of you did,\" the president added.",
      "Those beneficiaries will also receive a lump sum in the thousands of dollars to make up for the shortfall in benefits they should have received in 2024, the president said.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act\u00a0eliminates two federal policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program and that reduced benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "\"Biden is the first president in more than 20 years to expand Social Security benefits,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement. \"The bill he is signing today will expand benefits by hundreds of dollars per month for more than 2.5 million Americans.\"",
      "Social Security Fairness Act could restore benefits for millions, but policies still cause hardship",
      "Social Security Fairness Act could restore benefits for millions, but policies still cause hardship",
      "The new law came in just under the wire, with Mr. Biden signing it only weeks before the end of his presidency and after the Senate on December 21\u00a0voted 76-20\u00a0to pass the measure in the waning hours of the 118th Congress. House lawmakers approved the bill, known as H.R. 82, in November.",
      "Long, hard road",
      "The push to enhance Social Security payments for public pension recipients has been decades in the making, with the Senate holding its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act had bipartisan support, yet faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the law would add an estimated\u00a0$195 billion\u00a0to the federal deficit over a decade.",
      "The benefits hike under the new law would be retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Specifically, the new Social Security law repeals policies known as the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which together act to reduce Social Security payments to 2.5 million retirees. International Association of Fire Fighters General President Edward Kelly in a statement Sunday said Congress \"broke a promise\" when it enacted the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset.",
      "\"Today, that promise has been restored, and retired fire fighters and emergency medical workers will now receive the full Social Security benefits they've earned and paid into,\" Kelly said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0estimated in September that eliminating the WEP would increase monthly payments to affected Social Security recipients by an average of $360 by December 2025, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Scrapping the GPO would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses, the agency found. The increase would amount to an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.",

    "title": "What to know as Congress counts electoral votes on Monday",
    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 18:12:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Several changes to the electoral vote count process have been enacted since a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House and Senate will convene Monday to certify President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election.",
      "It comes four years after a violent mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol to prevent Congress from affirming President Biden's win. There appear to be no plans by Democrats to stand in the way of certifying Trump's win.",
      "Here's what to expect this time.",
      "How does Congress count the presidential election results?",
      "Senators and members of the House will meet in a joint session at 1 p.m. to tally the electoral votes from the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Vice President Kamala Harris will preside in her role as president of the Senate.",
      "The vice president will read aloud the electoral votes, and then Congress counts each state's results to affirm Trump's victory. Trump won 312 Electoral College votes, far surpassing the 270 needed for victory. Harris won 226 votes.",
      "The process is typically a ceremonial step before a president is inaugurated on Jan. 20.",
      "Does Congress always count results on Jan. 6 following presidential elections?",
      "Congress is required by law to count the electoral votes on Jan. 6 after each presidential election. However, the date has been temporarily changed by law\u00a0when Jan. 6 fell on a weekend. In 2013, Congress affirmed that President Barack Obama won the election on Jan. 4, rather than on Jan. 6, which was a Sunday.",
      "What is the Electoral Count Reform Act, and what's different about Jan. 6 this time?",
      "After the Capitol riot in 2021, Congress moved to reform the Electoral Count Act \u2014 an 1887 law that governed the counting of electoral votes \u2014 to prevent another effort to overturn the results of a presidential election.",
      "Congress passed the Electoral Count Reform Act in 2022, which clarified that the vice president's role in presiding over the joint session of Congress is ceremonial. It also made it more difficult for members of Congress to challenge a state's electors by raising the threshold to 20% of members of each chamber. Previously, just one member of the House and one senator were needed to raise an objection.",
      "Following Trump's defeat in the 2020 election, he and his allies fueled unfounded allegations of fraud and argued that Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to accept or reject electoral votes. Pence denied he had such authority.",
      "As Congress was tallying the votes in 2021, Rep. Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, joined Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, to object to Mr. Biden's votes from Arizona.",
      "The joint session was then suspended and the House and Senate separately debated the objection. The process was abruptly interrupted as a violent mob of protesters made their way into the building after Trump urged them to march to the Capitol.",
      "Hours later, after rioters were cleared from the building, both chambers voted to reject the objection that would have thrown out Arizona's electoral votes for Mr. Biden. The House and Senate then reconvened in a joint session to continue the count. They later were forced to split and debate another objection to Pennsylvania's results, which was brought by Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. Both chambers also rejected the attempt to throw out the state's votes for Mr. Biden.",
      "What happens if a member of Congress objects to the electoral votes?",
      "This time, it will be nothing more than a complaint. In the last presidential election, a member from each chamber needed to object to the count to force lawmakers to debate and vote on whether to accept or reject a state's results. The Electoral Reform Act, passed by Congress in 2022, raised the threshold to one-fifth of members in each chamber.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we have, Chairman, heightened security at U.S. airports, on trains, military bases, this bulletin that went out recently warning of perhaps retaliatory attacks, copycat attacks from that New Orleans car-ramming incident.",
      "How should Americans understand the threat environment we're in?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right, right.",
      "Well, it's certainly very difficult. And our heart breaks as we think of what occurred just after New Year's Eve and on New Year's Day. The \u2013 what we know that the FBI director has said is that we \u2013 we are in a heightened threatened environment.",
      "We see from, of course, what occurred in New Orleans, we have the threat of those who can be lone wolves, those individuals who might be, as the self- declared terrorist has indicated, inspired by ISIS, by terrorist threats. We also have those who \u2013 who are here who have come across the border that the director has said are affiliated with terrorist groups or organizations outside of the country who want to do Americans harm.",
      "Those individuals still pose a threat to Americans and to the United States. The director, the FBI, local law enforcement are continuing to work to try to find them and try to lessen the risk, but, certainly, at this time, as we go into the inauguration for Donald Trump, where we even have state actors like Iran who \u2013 where we have in custody individuals who have come here with the stated purpose to \u2013 to assassinate as a part of a plot\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 to have been alleged to perpetrate a plot to assassinate Donald Trump, we have a number of actors that pose a risk and a threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Himes, ISIS has not claimed responsibility for this New Orleans attacker. He did pledge allegiance in these social media videos.",
      "But Homeland Security, as far as we have heard from them, said there's no linkage to the U.S. border. There is no linkage established to a foreign actor at this point. Is this just an example of someone with mental health issues choosing violence?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-Connecticut): Well \u2013 and I'm glad you said that, because there was so much misinformation right out of the box, because these attacks happened at the same time. You know, there was all sorts of stuff on social media about how they were coordinated and together\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Las Vegas.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 and that the \u2013 Las Vegas with New Orleans.",
      "You know, the New Orleans \u2013 Jabbar, the attacker there, clearly had himself affiliated with ISIS.",
      "Now, what we need to know and what \u2013 to date, there is no evidence that this is the case, but we need to know whether that individual was deliberately tasked. Again, no evidence that he was. And, of course, we constantly see these lone wolf attackers who get radicalized, maybe on social media, maybe in some other location.",
      "And \u2013 and, you know, I would certainly agree with Mike's characterization of the danger out there, but just add that, as Americans think about the people who are protecting them \u2013 and I think the chairman would agree with me on this \u2013 the people and assets that we put up against this threat are the best in the world.",
      "It is also true that lone wolf attackers, that is, an individual who's not communicating with somebody abroad, who's not sending texts or sending e- mails, are extraordinarily difficult to detect. And, you know, though our people are the best in the world, that is hard to find.",
      "And, by the way, there's a role for people. You know, in New York City, if you go on the subway, it says, if you see something, say something. And so there's a role for everybody out there, you know, to help try to solve, to help try to stop these kinds of lone wolf attacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, as one official said to me, this isn't a problem you solve with another aircraft carrier to the Middle East. Some of these things run deeper in terms of the lone wolf element. That's the term you've used.",
      "How do you diagnose and deal with that, Chair Turner, if people are able to be radicalized online, and whether it's political violence or just another form of domestic violent extremism?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, on the issue of New Orleans, we \u2013 we don't know yet whether or not he \u2013 he will evolve as \u2013 as the actual lone wolf, where he operated completely alone.",
      "As Jim is saying, as the investigation unfolds, he himself indicated that he joined, as he claimed it, ISIS in the summer. We don't know what that involved. We don't know if it's going to turn out that he was tasked. Excuse me. He \u2013 he went to New Orleans also in October.",
      "There may have been opportunities or times at which he could have been found and could have been prevented. We'll learn what those are and ways in which he might have been \u2013 been found, and maybe we could have intervened.",
      "But those will give U.S. greater opportunities at which we'll look to how we might be able to in the future find others.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, we've spoken to both of you on this program, in particular, about the heightened threat environment many times. And back in June, when there was that arrest of those eight men from Tajikistan who were ISIS-linked. We spoke in depth about that.",
      "Chair Turner, shortly after that, you said on this program: \"We have terrorists that are actively working inside the United States that are a threat to Americans.\"",
      "Do you know if there are active terror cells in the United States right now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think the \u2013 the issue of cells \u2013 and you and I were talking about that at the beginning of the show.",
      "Are there individuals that are affiliated with ISIS and terrorist groups and organizations that have crossed the border that are inside the United States? Director Wray, FBI director, has said so. We certainly have intelligence that says so. I agree with his assessment. I \u2013 Jim has also seen it.",
      "He's testified before our committee publicly of that fact. Those individuals are working in conjunction with \u2013 with ISIS, with the intention of harming Americans. The director has said it directly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are known to U.S. intelligence and law enforcement, is what you're\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And we are working diligently to try to take them down, to prevent them from doing so.",
      "And that's why the director is publicly saying such. And that's what the new administration is going to be handed, the fact that these individuals are here, that we need to locate them, we need to remove them, we need to bring them to justice, and prevent them from doing harm to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we have spoken about this issue in the past, you characterized particularly the arrest of the eight as a success story, because there was no plot carried out. They were disrupted.",
      "Are the individuals that are of concern, do we know where they are? In terms of those eight, they are \u2013 we know they were detained, and five of them were actually sent back to Tajikistan.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You never know what you don't know. And so none of us certainly in positions of responsibility would ever say that there's not terrorists in the United States.",
      "Now, I will say what I said before, which is that we have the very best people and the very best technology looking to root these people out and find them. But let's \u2013 if the question is, what should Americans be afraid of, what has killed Americans since 9/11? It hasn't been people sneaking across the border.",
      "And that's not to say that the border shouldn't be secure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: The border must be secure. But what has been killing Americans? Whether it was Fort Hood in 2009, I think, whether it was the New York attacks that killed eight people in 2017, what we just sad \u2013 sadly, saw in New Orleans, it's actually Americans who are in this country, actually, in a bizarre number of cases, servicepeople.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: That was the Fort Hood attacks. That was what we saw in New Orleans. That was \u2013 though I don't \u2013 it doesn't seem to be shaping up as a terrorist attack, what we saw in Las Vegas.",
      "So, again, that's hard, right? Why is that hard? Because if you're in this country, you have constitutional rights, meaning the FBI can't say, without a warrant, I want your Facebook posts, I want your e-mails. That's what makes this very hard.",
      "And, again, let's look at what has actually killed Americans in the 20 years. And, sadly, it has been radicalized other Americans. So this gets to the question of, what are the mechanisms by which they are radicalized, and how can we as a community push back on that radicalism?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, which is why I asked you. That's a harder problem to solve for.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Much harder, because you have constitutional rights and because \u2013 you know, let me give you an example.",
      "If somebody is standing out on the street corner right now saying ISIS is the greatest thing in the world, and the president is a traitor, that \u2013 people would say, boy, we should interview that person. That is constitutionally protected speech.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And I wonder how some of my colleagues would respond to the idea, because this individual in New Orleans did post some Facebook posts saying, I pledge allegiance to ISIS.",
      "You know, what if we had that debate? Should \u2013 should Facebook have instantly submitted that to the FBI? And, if so, where's the line?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: If I say I'm not a big fan of the next president, and I don't believe that he was, you know, whatever, should that go to the FBI? It's a tough conversation.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Margaret, there's no question that \u2013 that that is what we're seeing from New Orleans.",
      "But the answer to your question is, no, we don't know where they are. We don't know where the people are that Director Wray has indicated\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The people who have exploited vulnerabilities at the southwest border.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 that has come across the border, that are terrorists affiliated with ISIS, that intend to do American harm \u2013 Americans harm that are here in our country, we do not know where they are.",
      "And part of the work and part of the reason why he's raising the alarm is, we need to find them to protect Americans. Now, what Jim's saying is absolutely correct. And that \u2013 that obviously, is the part that also breaks our heart and makes what happened in New Orleans so hard is, is that we had an American who was killing Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, American-born Army vet.",
      "I want to ask you both about China as well. In terms of traditional adversaries, they are looming large here. We learned just in the past few days that China hacked the U.S. Treasury Department. This is on top of the major cyber espionage against nine telecom companies, against hacking of U.S. infrastructure that incoming National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said was planting cyber time bombs in U.S. infrastructure.",
      "How much of a trump card is this? I mean, can the U.S. expel China from these systems and get control?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, so, I mean, let's start with what we know.",
      "China has been absolutely predatory in just about every dimension. They've stolen our I.P. \u2013 our I.P., our intellectual property. You know, they've manipulated the trading system to hollow out our industrial base, absolutely predatory.",
      "And, by the way, I happen to believe \u2013 and it'll be interesting the chair \u2013 if the chairman agrees with me on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: They believe they can operate inside our networks without consequence, and that needs to change immediately.",
      "They need to understand that we're as good at this stuff as they are. And if they get into our networks and start planting beacons or start planting landmines or whatever, we're going to do the same to them, so that we establish deterrence.",
      "Now, you also have to acknowledge that China does and the U.S. do about $800 billion in trade back and forth, right? And if you snap your fingers and make that go away, you think COVID inflation was bad? Wait until you see that. By the way, they own a trillion dollars of our Treasuries.",
      "So, the point I'm making here is that I think we need to be a lot tougher on them on the areas in which they are predatory against us, even as we recognize that there are areas where we need to tread very carefully, including that economic interconnection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know that we're going to have you both back to talk about exactly this problem.",
      "I'm out of time today, but thank you both.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: There have to be consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There \u2013 we will stay\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: What he said.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will stay tuned.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tomorrow marks four years since the attack on the U.S. Capitol, and we spoke to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just a short while ago this morning. She's recovering from a fall last month.",
      "And we began by asking her why she thinks so many Americans decided that Donald Trump's support for the rioters in 2020 should not disqualify him from a second term as president.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (D-California): I wouldn't say that the American people disregarded this. They just had a different view as to what was in their interest, economically and the rest.",
      "So I don't \u2013 I don't call this a disregard of January 6. I just call it something that they saw in their interest economically.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even just last night at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump was screening a documentary about the 2020 election, claiming his win and trying to talk about the legal challenges he had. There seems to be a continued effort to claim that he won in 2020.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: It's really sad. It really is sad.",
      "And I don't know about the film that he had and the rest, but it's \u2013 it's almost sick that he would be thinking that in 2020. He's won the election now. That will be clear. That will be clear, and, tomorrow, he will be clearly \u2013 we will be accepting the results of the Electoral College.",
      "So he should be triumphant about that. But to be still trying to fight a fight that he \u2013 he knows he lost is \u2013 is really sad.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, the president-elect has said that, in the first nine minutes of his new term, he will pardon many of those who participated in January 6. He said he'll look at it on a case-by-case basis.",
      "But in looking back at what happened four years ago, there are recordings, there's video evidence of what happened. This is personal for you, some of these rioters in your office, chanting your name.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of them, one of the defendants: \"We were looking for Nancy to shoot her in the frigging brain, but we didn't find her.\"",
      "For you, this is personal. So, when you hear about pardons, do you think the nonviolent attackers deserve to be pardoned?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The nonviolent \u2013 I think that's a violent attacker, with the intention\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The violence itself.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The violent language, you think\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The violent language, yes, the intention, and, of course, the intention to attack the vice president of the United States.",
      "Now, it didn't end that day. As you know, he called out to these people to continue their violence, my husband being a victim of all of that. And it still \u2013 he still has injuries from that attack. So it just goes on and on. It isn't something that happens and then it's over.",
      "No, once you are attacked, you have consequences that continue. So I don't \u2013 it's really a strange person who's going to be president of the United States who thinks that it's OK to pardon people who were engaged in an attack.",
      "But let's \u2013 you know, let's do this. Let's just say OK to the American people. This is what this is about. Do not be conned by the denial of the election of 2020. And why would he be saying that? But he \u2013 but he is, and then, on top of that, the denial of what happened on January 6.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But some of the 1,600 defendants here were really only charged with trespassing. And when you look at the profiles, University of Chicago did a study. About half of those who broke into the Capitol were white-collar workers. They were small business owners, didn't necessarily have a criminal record.",
      "When you look at that profile, you said intention. It \u2013 it was the intention itself, you think, that needs to be considered more so than the crime, you know that \u2013 that it casts the crime itself of trespassing in a different light for you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, the president said he would go on a case-by-case basis.",

And so, it's going to take some resources to do that, which is why I would argue that when the president takes office, and he's going to do a lot of things on the border by executive order, by executive action, that we're going to need to be able to provide the resources in order for him to do that. And that's why I've suggested that we take that border issue on right away and enable him to do the things that he needs to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it true you're going to put some defense spending in that as well?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well, I think one of the things that we always argue about around here is the amount of money that we need to spend on defense. If you look at every Biden administration budget, there wasn't a single one of them when it came to military spending that came up - kept up even with inflation. So, we have a military readiness in this country. You know, we have the defense commission strategy group that comes out with a report all the time and tells us we are dramatically underfunded relative to countries like China and that we don't have the capacity -",

There's a big difference in delta in the two parties and how they approach the issue of defense and, you know, and military readiness. And I think we are dramatically underfunding our military today. I think the president believes that, President Trump. And I think a lot of our Republican colleagues in the House and the Senate share that view.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can't be comfortable.",

I think regulatory policy, tax policy, energy policy are going to be really essential to the strength of our economy, how fast we can grow and expand and creator better paying jobs in this country.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not tariffs, as Mr. Trump has promised?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well - well, that's - that's a different subject. But I would say every 1 percent increase in - in GDP, in economic growth, we're told, generates about $3 trillion in additional tax revenue. So, you're going to get some back in terms of a growth dividend. And there will be spending cuts. There's no question about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But going out of the gate with two big issues on party- line votes, aren't you concerned that will blow up your chances at working with Democrats on some of those bigger immigration issues, or bigger policies?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: We need to continue to work on those big policy issues. But I also think that we have some immediate concerns, matters that need to be addressed. One of which is national security, given the increasingly dangerous world in which we live. And, of course, I would argue, that starts with the border. So, border, national security. I think energy policy, energy dominance, is a huge objective and goal. And I would hope that a reconciliation bill could also address that issue. If we do something on taxes, that traditionally has been in the past. The Democrats did it twice while they had the majority in the last session of the Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trump did that in 2017, too, with taxes.",

Actually, if you drill into the numbers, about 80 percent of those numbers are actually Border Patrol arrests that the enforcement (INAUDIBLE) operation of ICE processed and moved back across the border. They weren't (INAUDIBLE) enforcement arrest.",
      "If you look at the historic number of illegal entries the last four years, ICE, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, has the lowest number of deportations in the history of the agency. So, they're playing a numbers game, just like they played a numbers game with a number of people coming across to border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "TOM HOMAN: So, even though they claim they've got the highest number of deportations, look at those deportations, who actually made those arrests, who actually removed those people, it's not ICE.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. It's still a higher number than the Trump administration. But I want to ask you, for the income Trump administration, what's - what's the measure? It is not deportations at the border. You're saying you are going to measure success by people who are already internal in the country to deport. That's how you're going to measure it. And what's that figure?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, again, let's get the numbers straight. You say they were higher than the Trump administration. This isn't about how many got deported because Trump had illegal border crossings at a 45-year low. So, of course removal is going to be lower. The numbers, how many were released into the United States that - that are not in the country legally? Under the Biden administration we have millions of people released in the United States who have lost their hearings and we've got millions of people that are, you know, released in the United States despite a statute saying that you cannot be released in the United States without proper documentation and you shall be detained. So, you can compare the numbers of deportations under Trump versus Biden, but when you consider a 45-year low in crossings, of course the number of deportations is going to be lower because we don't have that population to process and deport.",

And as you heard from your previous segments, we have a huge national security issue in this country. The southwest border has become the biggest national security vulnerability we've seen in this nation. FBI Director Wray agrees with me. We know there's people in this country pose a national security threat. They've arrested a record number of people on the terrorist watch list. A 3,500 percent increase in people on the terrorist watch list being arrested at the border.",

      "TOM HOMAN: So, you've got to ask yourself, why did 2 million people pay more to get away. Why didn't they pay less, turn themselves into Border Patrol, get a free airline ticket to the city of their choice -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TOM HOMAN: Get a free hotel room, get three meals a day, get free medical care. Why did 2 million people pay more to get away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. I'm not disputing that it is a hemisphere-wide crisis. We're talking about how you're going to deal with it. That's why I'm asking you, when you say \"criminals,\" does that mean you are going to go into already-existing prisons, at local level, and deport people who are in those prisons? Are you going to go to workforces? I mean, how do you know where the criminals are I guess is the question? And if they're working at a work site, are you going to show up to surprise them?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, look, we know where a lot of the criminals are. ICE does - they're great at this work. We know where some are, but they simply haven't been able to go arrest them because of Secretary Mayorkas' priorities, it handcuffed ICE. So, we know where a lot of criminals are. They've been prevented from arresting them. We're going to arrest starting day one.",
      "As far as being in jails and prisons, we would love to work in local jails, but sanctuary cities won't allow us into those jails. It's much easier to arrest a public safety threat and the safety and security of public jail than out in the street because the officer is after that way, the alien is safer that way, the community is safer that way. But sanctuary cities who continue to release public safety threats back into the community -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TOM HOMAN: To the immigrant community, that puts that community at greater risk of crime.",
      "And here's what's going to happen. When we go to the community and find that person, find that criminal alien -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TOM HOMAN: He's probably going to be with others, others who we'll have to arrest. So, it's not safe for the community, not safe for the officers, not safe for anybody.",

But if they happen to be living in a house where there are other undocumented people, you're going to sweep them up, too. That's what I think you were just saying there.",
      "I wonder how you're going to parse out some of those collateral arrests. For example, will dreamers be protected? Donald Trump has said he wants to work with Democrats to protect them and give them status. That takes a long time in Congress. What do you do in the meantime? How do you make sure they're not caught up in drag net?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Look, every person ICE arrests, they do what they call a fugitive operation spreadsheet. They know exactly who they're going to arrest, they know exactly where they're probably likely to find him, and they have a lot of information on that arrest. Other people that are there that may be illegal, they'll handle them by a case-by-case basis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "TOM HOMAN: The concentration - I want to be clear on some public safety threats, if we - more agents in the jails means less agents in the neighborhood. That's why I'm pleading with sanctuary cities, let us into the jail to arrest the bad guy, that way you're not forcing into the community. So, you know, if you go to an immigrant community and ask them, would you rather have ICE operating in your local jails or would you want them in the community, what do you think they're going to say? They don't - they don't want bad - bad criminal aliens in their neighborhoods, either.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "TOM HOMAN: So, let us work with the jails. Let us work with law enforcement. Sanctuary cities are not safe for the immigrant community, they're not safe for our officers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, that's like Secure Communities Act kind of - kind of action. But then where do you send people? Because some of these countries, like Venezuela, don't accept deportations right now. Mexico's president indicated her country might be willing to receive non-Mexican migrants who are deported. How does that work? Does the U.S. pay Mexico to then ship those people off somewhere else?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, first of all, we've got President Trump coming into the Oval Office and he's proven, during his first administration, his leadership on illegal immigration was a game changer because, for instance, El Salvador wouldn't take back MS-13 members when I was the ICE director. It took President Trump 48 hours to get El Salvador to take back their criminal aliens into their prisons. And Mexico didn't want to do the remain in Mexico program, but President Trump was able to get remain in Mexico established in Mexico.

      "Five days after a pickup truck flying the ISIS flag rammed through a crowd celebrating New Year's Eve in New Orleans, investigators say they are learning more about the background and possible motives of the driver who carried out the deadly attack.",
      "While following leads that have cropped up in several United States cities outside of Louisiana, federal agents are also looking into a series of trips the driver took to New Orleans and Cairo, Egypt, in 2023, said Lyonel Myrthil, the special agent in charge of FBI New Orleans, at a briefing Sunday.",
      "The FBI previously identified the perpetrator as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a U.S. citizen from Texas. He was fatally shot by police during the rampage on Bourbon Street, in New Orleans' French Quarter, which left 14 people dead and dozens more injured. Authorities have characterized the attack as an act of terrorism, pointing to social media videos where Jabbar aligned himself with ISIS, and believe he was likely radicalized online.",
      "Federal agents have not found evidence of any accomplices in the attack and reiterated Sunday that it appears Jabbar acted alone. ISIS has not claimed responsibility for the attack and officials with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said there is no established link to foreign actors, but investigators are examining potential connections between Jabbar's past travels and what happened last week in the French Quarter.",
      "\"Our agents are getting answers as to where he went, who he met with and how those trips may or may not tie into his actions here in our city of New Orleans,\" Myrthil told reporters.",
      "The agent said Jabbar traveled to Cairo from June 22 to July 3, 2023, and to Ontario, Canada, from July 10 to July 13 of that year.",
      "Jabbar had visited New Orleans at least twice in the months leading up to the attack, in October and November last year, according to Myrthil. The FBI on Sunday shared video footage that Jabbar recorded using Meta glasses during one of those trips, which showed him riding through the French Quarter on a bicycle.",
      "Myrthil said he was wearing those glasses when he drove into the crowd on Bourbon Street but did not have the recording feature turned on.",
      "Investigators are conducting interviews with hundreds of people who they identified as having knowledge of \"key pieces of this complex, evolving case,\" Myrthil said. They are pursuing leads in Houston, Texas, where Jabbar lived, as well as Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida. Although the FBI believes Jabbar was the sole attacker on New Year's Eve, the agency said it is continuing to probe for \"potential associates\" within the U.S. and abroad.",
      "The FBI did not provide details Sunday about who those potential associates could be. But Joshua Jackson, the special agent in charge of the New Orleans field division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the probe did identify a man who sold Jabbar the rifle found in his possession after the attack, in an illegal private sale in Texas.",
      "Domestic and international terrorism threats against the U.S. are \"elevated\" right now, said Christopher Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterterrorism division, on Sunday. Raia noted that \"lone actors, or small cells of individuals who typically radicalize to violence online and who primarily use easily accessible weapons, have posed the greatest terrorism threat to our homeland.\"",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, echoed Raia's comments on the difficulty authorities face in dealing with lone actors during an interview on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"The people and assets that we put up against this threat are the best in the world,\" said Himes. \"It is also true that lone wolf attackers, that is, an individual who's not communicating with somebody abroad, who's not sending texts or sending emails, are extraordinarily difficult to detect.\"",
      "Himes appeared on \"Face the Nation\" alongside Rep. Mike Turner, the House Intelligence chairman, who discussed the Bourbon Street attack from a national security standpoint.",
      "\"There may have been opportunities or times at which he could have been found and could have been prevented,\" said Turner, referencing Jabbar's prior trips to New Orleans. \"We'll learn what those are, and ways in which he might have been- been found, and maybe we could have intervened. But those will give us greater opportunities at which we'll look to how we might be able to, in the future, find others.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he's committed to helping Donald Trump \"achieve success\" when Trump returns to the White House, but Thune said he will convey to the president-elect \"what's realistic\" in the Senate.",
      "\"We want to get to the same destination, but I think at times, there will be differences in how we get there,\" Thune said in an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And I think I have to spell out as clearly as I can to anybody who asks, what the challenges are in the Senate.\"",
      "Thune stressed that the Senate, with a new Republican majority, functions differently than the House, where members are faced with reelection every two years. Thune said that \"understanding the unique aspects of how the Senate operates is something that I'm going to have to be able to share and convey to the President and help him understand.\"",
      "With a Republican trifecta in Washington, GOP leaders have touted a mandate to deliver for the American people on Trump's agenda outlined on the campaign trail. Thune said he speaks with Trump \"fairly regularly,\" noting the two men have been in contact since before the election and especially now as they \"start charting the path forward\" on the Republican agenda.",
      "\"We're working closely with his team now as we start to take control of the Senate now,\" Thune said Friday as the new Congress convened. \"And hopefully in the next couple of weeks before he takes the oath of office, we'll have things set up for him, including the opportunity to confirm a lot of his nominees.\"",
      "For Thune, who took over Friday as majority leader following Sen. Mitch McConnell's decision to step down after nearly two decades at the helm, among his first priorities will be the confirmation of Trump's nominees to top administration and Cabinet positions. The Senate's confirmation process is expected to take center stage when Trump takes office later this month, as the chamber faces pressure to quickly confirm the picks \u2014 some of whom have sparked controversy even among the president-elect's party.",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Senate Republicans have a narrow margin for opposition when it comes to Trump's nominees. And with a razor-thin GOP majority in the House, both chambers have a precarious path to approving key legislative priorities more broadly \u2014 from border security to taxes \u2014 making coordination between the president and the two chambers a prime concern.",
      "Thune cited Vice President-elect JD Vance, who has represented Ohio in the Senate since 2023, as a bridge between the upper chamber and the Trump administration, calling him \"an incredibly talented person\" whom he said has been a \"quick study\" in the Senate.",
      "\"I think he will be somebody who can help the administration, as they work through these issues, figure out what's realistic, what's achievable, what we can accomplish here in the Senate, because he's been here,\" Thune said. \"He knows it's challenging in the Senate.\"",

    "story": [
      "In his announcement speech for his presidential run, in 1974, Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter said there were things he would not do to become President: \"I would  not tell a lie. I would not mislead the American people ... and I would not betray your trust.\"",
      "If anything defined President Carter, it was his basic decency and morality. Elected in 1976 in the aftermath of Watergate and Gerald Ford's controversial pardon of Richard Nixon, Carter believed he had a responsibility to restore Americans' faith in the integrity of their government.",
      "\"We want to be proud again,\" he told the crowd at the Democratic National Convention. \"We just want the truth again.\"",
      "It was a stunning rise to power for a little-known Georgia governor. \"Jimmy who?\" was the question a lot of Americans asked when Carter first announced that he was going to run for the White House.",
      "Stuart Eizenstat, who started working with Carter when he ran for governor in 1970, and ultimately became his White House Chief of Domestic Policy, said the reason Carter thought he could win was that \"he had a great sense of his own capabilities.\"",
      "Though the son of a successful peanut farmer, Carter grew up without electricity or running water just outside Plains, Georgia. He won admission to the Naval Academy, and while at Annapolis, Carter started dating Rosalynn Smith. They married in 1946 and she would become his most trusted advisor. Eizenstat said, \"They were not only married for over 70 years; they had a love affair.\"",
      "Carter had to abandon his Naval career to take over the family peanut business when his father died.\u00a0 The Carters moved back to Plains and started raising three sons and a daughter.",
      "Chip Carter, the second-born son, recalled that, against all odds, his father captured the Democratic nomination and, with Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale as his running mate, won the election.",
      "Chip said he helped arrange one of the most famous images of the Carter inaugural: \"I went to dad's Secret Service agents and said, 'We might want to do this walk.'\"",
      "That walk down Pennsylvania Avenue seemed to symbolize the open and energetic approach Carter would bring to the White House.",
      "But it was to be a tumultuous presidency, in part because of Carter's complex personality. Journalist and author Jonathan Alter said, \"He was humble, affable, open, and then also he could be difficult, prickly, stubborn.\"",
      "Alter, who spent many hours with Carter for a biography, noted, \"There was much more accomplishment in the Carter presidency than I had thought.\"",
      "Famous for wearing sweaters to dramatize how he'd turned down the White House thermostats, Carter pushed through comprehensive energy legislation. He created the Department of\u00a0 Education; deregulated airlines; doubled the amount of land in our national parks; and in one of his most important and controversial\u00a0 initiatives, Carter negotiated the return of the Panama Canal Zone to the Panamanians. \"This opens a new chapter in our relations with all nations of this hemisphere,\" he said.",
      "But perhaps his crowning foreign policy accomplishment was pushing through the Camp David Accords, the historic 1978 agreement between Israel and Egypt. Alter called it \"the most successful peace treaty since World War II.\"",
      "But in 1979, other Middle East issues would lead to gasoline shortages that created high prices and long waits at gas stations. Carter's popularity plummeted. And in July he decided to give a speech to the nation warning of a crisis in confidence: \"Too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption,\" he said.",
      "Much to the surprise of many politicos and pundits, the speech was immediately popular. According to Eizenstat, \"The speech hit a raw nerve, contrary to my own belief. And then, he stepped on his own headlines. He asked for the resignation of his entire cabinet. It looked like the whole government was in chaos.\"",
      "And then, in November of 1979, 52 Americans were taken hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Iran, followed by a failed attempt to get them out \u2013 all in the lead-up to the 1980 presidential election.",

      "Since then, Suborno has skipped multiple grades, scored a 1500 on his SAT, and at the ripe old age of 12, started college this past September at New York University. \"It feels like just the next natural step,\" he said. \"Most kids go to college after high school, so I said, 'Why not me?'\"",
      "Despite his progression, Suborno seems to have a pretty balanced point of view. \"I know it sounds strange, because it sounds like you're talking to some business CEO on '60 Minutes,' that's, like, 35 years old,\" he laughed. \"But instead I'm only 12. It feels like the voice isn't matching up with the person right in front of you.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you sometimes wonder at the fact that you're only 12?\"",
      "\"Not really,\" Suborno replied. \"I've seen my birth certificate.\"",
      "Psychologist Ellen Winner, a professor emerita at Boston College, and a leading authority on child prodigies, said Suborno demonstrates the hallmarks of a child prodigy. She says virtually all exhibit something she calls a \"rage to master.\"",
      "\"This is all the child wants to do all the time,\" Winner said. \"Not even wanting to go out and play. The kid wants to stay inside and work on whatever it is that that child is gifted in. These are kids that really live in their own minds.\"",
      "\"Is this fairly obvious when you talk to these kids?\"",
      "\"Yes, it is very, very clear, especially in certain domains \u2013 in music performance, in mathematics, in drawing realistically,\" Winner said.",
      "But there is one area where she thinks prodigies are overlooked, because they excel at something a lot murkier: Abstract art. \"It's much harder to detect, because the work doesn't look totally different from typical kids,\" Winner said. \"But it doesn't look totally the same, either. It's more complex, it's more structured.\"",
      "So, while we've all marveled at the obvious skills of math prodigies like Suborno Bari, music prodigies, or chess prodigies, what about young artists who seem to be following in the footsteps of, say, Jackson Pollock?",
      "Meet four-year-old August Gardener, Professor Winner's grandson, who has been obsessed with abstract art for most of his young life. He's done hundreds of paintings, drawings, sculptures, and mixed media artworks.",
      "Asked how what he's doing compares to the scribbling of the average four-year-old, August's father, Andrew Gardener, a former schoolteacher, replied, \"It's the drive. It's the desire to continue doing it, and keep working, and the top-of-mindness of it.\"",
      "August's mother, Vanessa Gardener, said, \"He's often incredibly deliberate for a four-year-old boy who, like, when he's not doing that, you know, he runs around like a maniac, like a lot of four-year-old boys. But when he's working on his art, everything is very thought out and, you know, particular.\"",
      "That deliberate process is the hallmark of an abstract art prodigy, says Jen Drake, a psychology professor at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York.\u00a0 Drake (who's worked with Winner in the past) is now conducting a major study of art prodigies, and August is part of it.",
      "Speaking of August, Drake said, \"I'm really struck by his focus. That one drawing he spent several days working on, that is definitely a 'rage to master,' [demonstrating] their willingness to go back to the drawing to add something to it.\"",
      "But what of the end result? Is that art? \"That's a really good question,\" said Drake. \"And I think because his work is abstract, it may be difficult to assess the skill in there. But there is a use of color and line and form that's not found in typical preschoolers.\"",
      "And no matter what you think of August's art, Drake says his focus in making it is what really sets him apart.",
      "\"Are we talking prodigy?\" I asked.",
      "\"I would say yes. Definitely,\" Drake replied.",
      "And August is in good company: Pablo Picasso was a child prodigy. In fact, from Mozart to Einstein to Stevie Wonder, the list of brilliant people who started young is long. But being a prodigy doesn't guarantee future greatness. According to Ellen Winner, \"Most prodigies do not go on to be major adult creators in their area of giftedness. The reason is that being a child prodigy means you are mastering something that's already been invented. And to be a major adult creator, you have to go beyond what's already been done, and develop something really new.\"",
      "So, how often do we get a Picasso or a Mozart? \"Very, very rare,\" Winner said.",
      "But don't tell that to August just yet \u2026 and certainly not to math whiz Suborno Bari. He's got his eye on a Ph.D. by 16. And then what? \"I mean, I don't want to just be, like, a superstar for five years and then completely vanish and have videos made on me 10 years later saying, 'What happened to Suborno Bari?' I want to actually leave a mark that people will remember me for.\"",

    "story": [
      "On a lakeside peninsula in Eastern Africa, archaeologists have found clues about a society that lived there over 3 million years ago.",
      "The Homa Peninsula, in Kenya, is part of the East African Rift Valley, a part of the world often called \"the cradle of humankind.\" So many of the oldest clues about humanity's earliest days have been preserved under the valley's fertile, human soil, including the remains of \"Lucy,\" an ancient human relative who lived more than 3 million years ago.",
      "Tom Plummer and his team are the latest to make discoveries in the area, working at a site on the peninsula called Nyanga. The team found flakes, or little knives, at the dig site. The blades are believed to be some of the first tools ever used on Earth \u2014 and even after more than 3 million years, they still have a sharp edge.",
      "Plummer, an archaeologist at the City University of New York, said the blades were made by hammering one stone against each other. The knives would have been used to peel and cut fruits and vegetables, and to cut the flesh off prey like hippos, Plummer said. The meat would then be pounded between stones to tenderize it. The knife and stones are known as the Oldowan tool kit, and likely set the stage for further technology advancement down the line.",
      "\"I \u00a0think the Oldowan technology is probably the most important technological innovation that ever happened in human history,\" Plummer told \"CBS Saturday Morning.\"",
      "\"It allowed (the pre-human ancestors) to access a whole array of foods that they would never have had access to before.\"",
      "Plummer said that new diet would have fueled body and brain growth, starting a \"feedback loop\" that created more sophisticated beings who \"start doing more with technology.\" An similar, even older cutting tool was also found in Kenya, but that technology apparently died out, so Plummer believes this tool is the one that can be credited for those developments.",
      "\"I think that's all starting with the Oldowan,\" Plummer said.",
      "Who made the tools is another surprise. Along with the tools, Plummer's team found the tooth of a paranthropus, an early hominin that is not a direct ancestor of humans. That suggests that the first tool making is not a human legacy, but an idea humanity's ancestors copied, then used to dominate other hominins, who ultimately died out.",
      "Rick Potts, the director of the Smithsonian's human origins program and the leader of research on the peninsula, said that discovery can help frame humans' existence on the planet.",
      "\"We are the last biped standing, as I call it,\" Potts said. \"All of those other ways of life became extinct. And so that gives us a lot to think about, and it draws attention to the fragility of life, even in our own journey through time.\"",
      "Searching for pre-human history",
      "The search for these early artifacts has the look and intrigue of an \"Indiana Jones\" film. Finding the splintered rocks that showed evidence of being used as tools was one thing, but the archaeology team then had to find the cut marks on animal bones that confirmed how the knives were being used.",
      "Blasto Onyango, a local archaeological legend who helped uncover the Turkana Boy, the most complete early hominin skeleton ever discovered, said that his impressive find took \"four or five years\" to find. As the time passed, he and other archaeologists found \"different parts of the\" skeleton, working slowly but surely to uncover the remains of a young boy who lived over one and a half million years ago.",
      "Paleontology researcher Rose Nyaboke said that kind of painstaking, slow research is what makes up the day-to-day work of an archaeology dig. Sometimes, she and other researchers find small pieces of bone, but have to leave those fragments where they were found.",
      "\"We don't just pick anything. It has to have a paleontological meaning,\" Nyaboke explained. \"We tell it 'Sorry. We can't pick you today.'\"",
      "The bones that matter are ones that can lend context to the area, such as pig's teeth. Pigs evolved so quickly their skeletons help date the surrounding area. The site is too old for carbon dating, and the ancient volcanic ash that has preserved the artifacts makes other dating methods too hard to use. The area had actually been mostly abandoned by researchers after artifacts from the Homa Peninsula led to inaccurate claims about human origins. Despite all that, Potts started digging on the peninsula nearly 40 years ago.",
      "\"We found a place that's difficult to date, but we didn't leave, because science takes persistence,\" Potts said.",
      "That persistence has been rewarded with discoveries like Plummer's. New technologies have made the sites easier to date, and new discoveries across eastern Africa have refined researchers' understanding of human roots. Researchers knew that modern homo sapiens emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago, but it wasn't until recently that they understood that their hominin ancestors began walking on two legs at least 6 million years ago.",
      "\"Some of the things that we thought occurred in a very short period of time, within the last one million years, are now stretched out over a 6 million year period,\" Potts said. \"That includes tool making.\"",

      "South Korea's spy agency said Friday it was analyzing rare state media footage showing the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un with two children -- saying they could be hers.",
      "Key regime spokeswoman Kim Yo Jong was spotted with two youngsters -- a boy and a girl -- while attending North Korea's New Year art performance.",
      "She was seen holding the boy's hand as the three walked together.",
      "The isolated North has never officially disclosed any information about Kim Yo Jong's marital status or children, but Seoul's spy agency said it was examining whether the children in the state media footage were hers.",
      "\"We are conducting a detailed analysis while keeping the possibility open,\" it said in a statement.",
      "The National Intelligence Service said they had previously detected that Kim Yo Jong might have children, and the ones she was photographed with were in the correct age range.",
      "Seoul's unification ministry told AFP that the art performance event in Pyongyang is understood to be one where participants are expected to accompany their family members, but said it was \"unusual\" to see Kim Yo Jong with children.",
      "State media footage also showed leader Kim with his teenage daughter, known as Kim Ju Ae.",
      "Seoul-based specialist site NK News said the release of the images might be part of a \"propaganda effort to humanize regime officials.\"",
      "\"It also follows a trend that started earlier in 2022 of showing elite officials in Kim Jong Un's inner circle arriving at special events or donating disaster relief with their spouses and family members,\" it said.",

      "Born in 1988, according to the South Korean government, she is one of three children born to Kim's father and predecessor, Kim Jong Il, and his third known partner, former dancer Ko Yong Hui.",
      "She was educated in Switzerland alongside her brother and rose rapidly up the ranks once he inherited power after their father died in 2011.",
      "In April 2015, Seoul's spy agency said that Kim Yo Jong was presumed to be giving birth the following month.",
      "Later, in 2018, the spy agency in the South said it was understood that Kim was pregnant during her visit to South Korea in February of that year for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.",
      "This summer, the National Intelligence Service told lawmakers that Kim Jong Un had regained weight and appeared to have obesity-related health problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Kim, known for heavy drinking and smoking, comes from a family with a history of heart problems. Both Kim's father and grandfather, who ruled\u00a0North Korea\u00a0before his 2011 inheritance of power, died of heart issues.",

However, the agency said it cannot rule out the possibility that she could be replaced by one of her siblings because she hasn't been officially designated as her father's successor.",

      "One of their first stops was the notorious Sednaya prison, not far from the capital.",
      "Accompanied by White Helmet rescuers, Barrot and Baerbock toured the cells and underground dungeons of Sednaya, which for decades stood as a fearsome symbol of the atrocities committed against Assad's opponents.",
      "The prison was the site of extrajudicial executions, torture and forced disappearances. An advocacy group said more than 4,000 people were freed from the detention facility when rebel forces took Damascus on December 8. Countless other inmates \u2014 both criminals and Assad opponents \u2014 simply vanished after being incarcerated there.",

      "\"Fragile hope\" for a \"stable and peaceful\" Syria",
      "Sharaa, head of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), led the offensive that toppled Assad. The HTS-dominated interim authorities now face the daunting task of rebuilding state institutions, with growing calls to ensure an inclusive transition and guarantee minority rights.",

      "She said the visit was a \"clear signal\" to Damascus of the possibility for a new relationship between Syria and Germany, and Europe more broadly.",
      "The European diplomats' closed meeting with Sharaa on Friday lasted about an hour and a half, and they did not give formal statements to journalists afterward.",
      "Earlier, in a post in X, Barrot said: \"Together, France and Germany stand alongside the Syrian people, in all their diversity.\"",
      "He added that the two European powers wanted to promote a \"peaceful transition\" to a new government in the country.",

      "Sharaa has distanced himself and HTS from al-Qaeda in recent years, and the group's public statements have suggested plans to respect Syria's myriad religious groups.",
      "The Biden administration said after Assad fled to Russia that the U.S. could recognize a new Syrian government under certain conditions. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the new leadership and the transition process must ensure the protection of Syria's minority groups, a flow of humanitarian aid into the country, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorist organizations, and help ensure that any chemical and biological weapons are secured and destroyed.",
      "Baerbock said Friday that Berlin stood ready to support \"an inclusive and peaceful transfer of power\" as well as social \"reconciliation\" in Syria.",
      "She also asked the new regime to avoid \"acts of vengeance against groups within the population,\" to avoid a long delay before elections, and to avert any attempts at the \"Islamization\" of the judicial and education systems.",
      "Since Assad's ousting, a bevy of foreign envoys have travelled to Damascus to meet with the country's new leaders. France and Germany had both already sent lower-level delegations last month.",
      "At the start of his visit, Barrot met with representatives of Syria's Christian communities. Diplomatic sources said Barrot told the Christian leaders that France was committed to a pluralistic Syria with equal rights for all, including minority groups.",
      "Syria's civil war \u2014 which started in 2011 with the Assad government's brutal repression of pro-democracy protests \u2014 saw Germany, France and a host of other countries shutter their diplomatic missions in Damascus.",

      "Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0\u2014 A surfer missing in Australia is believed to have died in a shark attack, authorities said Friday, as they searched the waters where the man disappeared. The 28-year-old was in the sea at a popular surf beach in South Australia where another man was killed by a white shark in 2023.",
      "A witness who saw the shark attack on Thursday evening at Granites Beach, near the coastal town of Streaky Bay, rode into the sea on a jet ski and retrieved the man's surfboard, Senior Constable Rebecca Stokes told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\"But there was just no sign of this young man, there's just been no sign of him,\" Stokes told the ABC. \"From witnesses' descriptions we're pretty confident that sadly he's been killed by this shark.\"",

      "Emergency responders and volunteers were searching offshore on Friday for the local man and the beach was closed to the public. Police were preparing a coroner's report, a statement said.",
      "Shark attacks in Australia are rare, with 255 fatal bites recorded since 1791 in the country of 27 million people, according to the Australian Shark Incident Database.",
      "But the state of South Australia has registered more episodes in the past two years than usual. There were five shark attacks off the state's coast in 2023, three of them fatal and one at the same beach as Thursday's incident.",
      "Scientists at the time said they did not know the reason for the cluster. There was one non-fatal shark bite off South Australia's coast in 2024.",

    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 South Korean investigators left the official residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after a near-six-hour standoff during which he defied their attempt to detain him. It's the latest confrontation in a political crisis that has paralyzed South Korean politics and seen two heads of state impeached in under a month.",
      "The country's anti-corruption agency said it withdrew its investigators after the presidential security service blocked them from entering Yoon's residence for hours due to concerns about their safety.",
      "The agency said its outnumbered investigators had several scuffles with presidential security forces and expressed \"serious regret about the attitude of the suspect, who did not comply with the legal process.\"",
      "The National Police Agency said it planned to investigate the chief and deputy chiefs of the presidential security service on suspicion of obstructing official duty and summoned them for questioning on Saturday.",
      "Yoon, a former prosecutor, has defied investigators' attempts to question him for weeks. The last time he is known to have left the residence was on Dec. 12, when he went to the nearby presidential office to make a televised statement to the nation, making a defiant statement that he will fight efforts to oust him.",
      "Investigators from the country's anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by an opposition-dominated parliament, declared martial law on Dec. 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.",
      "Parliament overturned the declaration within hours in an unanimous vote and impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion, while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events.",
      "A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon's detention on Tuesday, but enforcing it is complicated as long as he remains in his official residence.",
      "Yoon's lawyers, who filed a challenge to the warrant on Thursday, say it cannot be enforced at his residence due to a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge.",
      "The office said it will discuss further actions, but did not immediately say whether it would make another attempt to detain Yoon. The warrant for his detention is valid for one week.",
      "Yoon's lawyers have also argued that the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military investigators, lacks the authority to investigate rebellion charges. They said police officers don't have the legal authority to assist in detaining Yoon, and could face arrest by either the \"presidential security service or any citizens.\" They didn't elaborate further on the claim.",
      "If investigators manage to detain Yoon, they will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise, he will be released after 48 hours.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, called the anti-corruption agency's withdrawal regrettable and urged the agency to make another attempt to detain Yoon on Friday.",
      "Kwon Young-se, who heads the emergency leadership committee of Yoon's conservative People Power Party, called the agency's effort to detain Yoon \"highly unfair and exceedingly improper,\" saying there is no risk of Yoon attempting to flee or to destroy evidence.",
      "Thousands of police officers gathered at Yoon's residence on Friday, forming a perimeter around a growing group of pro-Yoon protesters who braved freezing temperatures for hours, waving South Korean and American flags while chanting slogans vowing to protect him. There were no immediate reports of major clashes outside the residence.",
      "Dozens of investigators and police officers were seen entering the gate of the residence in Seoul to execute a warrant for Yoon's detention, but the dramatic scene quickly developed into a standoff. Two of Yoon's lawyers, Yoon Kap-keun and Kim Hong-il, were seen entering the gate of the presidential residence around noon. It wasn't immediately clear what the lawyers discussed with the president.",
      "Seok Dong-hyeon, another lawyer on Yoon's legal team, said the agency's efforts to detain Yoon were \"reckless\" and showed an \"outrageous discard for law.\"",
      "South Korea's Defense Ministry confirmed that the investigators and police officers got past a military unit guarding the residence's grounds before arriving at the building. The presidential security service, which controls the residence itself, refused to comment. South Korea's YTN television reported scuffles as investigators and police confronted the presidential security forces.",
      "As the standoff progressed, the Democrats called on the country's acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, to order the presidential security service to stand down. Choi didn't immediately comment on the situation.",
      "\"Do not drag the upright staff of the presidential security service and other public officials into the depths of crime,\" said Jo Seung-lae, a Democratic lawmaker. Choi must \"remember that swiftly addressing the rebellion and preventing further chaos is your responsibility,\" Jo said.",
      "Yoon's defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the period of martial law.",
      "Yoon's presidential powers have been suspended since the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14. Yoon's fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. At least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor to remove him from office.",
      "The National Assembly voted last week to impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became acting president after Yoon's powers were suspended, over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court's review of Yoon's case.",
      "Facing growing pressure, the new acting president, Choi, appointed two new justices on Tuesday, which could increase the chances of the court upholding Yoon's impeachment.",

      "China on Thursday said it was adding dozens of American companies to its export control list to \"safeguard national security and interests.\"",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce said it would impose measures on 28 U.S. entities and would also prohibit exports of dual-use items to the listed companies starting on Thursday, reported the Global Times, a Chinese daily viewed as aligned with Beijing, and the government-run Xinhua news agency. Dual-use items refers to those that can be used for either civilian or military purposes.",
      "China also sanctioned 10 defense firms on Thursday over military sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own, adding them to China's \"Unreliable Entities List,\" the ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "\"It really does seem to be a warning shot \u2014 that escalation in U.S. policies against China, particularly under Trump, will be met with a more aggressive response,\" Jesse Schreger, an associate professor of Macroeconomics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"China is signaling it will not take tariffs passively.\"",
      "The threat to not sell dual-use goods to listed companies could be consequential, given China's role as the world's manufacturing powerhouse, said Schreger. Unclear is how China intends to enforce the measures and which products will be viewed as dual use and therefore have their sales restricted. Tires, for instance, could be viewed as produced for both civilian and military use, he noted.",
      "The moves come as Beijing readies for the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House and after the Biden administration broadened its restrictions on Chinese firms amid an escalating back-and-forth. During his presidential campaign, Trump also raised the idea of imposing a\u00a0tariff of up to 60%\u00a0on all Chinese goods.",
      "\"The desire to put high tariffs on China seems credible, if you think back to the first Trump administration and its willingness to use [tariffs] for geopolitical ends,\" offered Schreger. \"The Biden administration didn't undo that \u2014 in fact, they professionalized it. The Trump administration's rhetoric might have been stronger, but the Biden administration took this economic battle to the next level.\"",
      "China last month said it was investigating U.S. microchip maker Nvidia over potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.",
      "China's action comes less than a week after it\u00a0placed\u00a0sanctions on seven companies in responding to recently announced U.S. military sales and aid to Taiwan.",
      "Still, sanctions by Beijing targeting American defense companies tend to have a muted impact given that U.S. military firms don't sell arms or related goods to China. The tit-for-tat trade measures also could be limited, some analysts think.",
      "\"Changes to immigration, trade and fiscal policy under the second Trump administration will likely be meaningful but stop short of some of the more dramatic proposals,\" stated Goldman Sachs analysts in a recent report. \"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid.\"",

      "Teams from Oxford and Birmingham Universities made the \"exhilarating\" discovery at a quarry in Oxfordshire in central England after a worker came across \"unusual bumps\" as he was stripping clay back with a mechanical digger, according to a new BBC documentary.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham, told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The site features five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous track stretching almost 500 feet in length.",
      "Four of the five trackways uncovered are believed to have been made by a long-necked herbivorous dinosaur, most likely a cetiosaurus.",
      "The fifth set of tracks likely belongs to a nine-meterlong carnivorous megalosaurus known for its distinctive three-toed feet with claws, according to the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"It's rare to find them so numerous in one place and it's rare to find such extensive trackways as well,\" Emma Nicholls of Oxford University's Museum of Natural History told AFP.",

      "The discovery will feature in the BBC television documentary \"Digging for Britain\", due to be broadcast on January 8.",
      "\"Exhilarating\" discovery",
      "A 100-strong team led by academics from Oxford and Birmingham excavated the tracks during a week-long dig in June.",
      "The new footprints follow a smaller discovery in the area in 1997, when 40 sets were uncovered during limestone quarrying, with some trackways reaching up to 180 meters in length.",
      "The researchers took 20,000 photographs of the latest footprints and created detailed 3D models of the site using aerial drone photography.",

      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" the Oxford museum's Duncan Murdock told the BBC. \"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "Richard Butler, a paleobiologist from the University of Birmingham, said some chance weather may be the reason the tracks had been so well preserved.",
      "\"We don't know exactly... but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away,\" he said.",
      "Quarry worker Gary Johnson, whose watchfulness triggered the excavation, said the experience had been spellbinding.",

By the time I went to bed at night, I was exhausted. That's all I can tell you.\"",

      "In 1990, Bush tapped Schwarzenegger to become the chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.",
      "\"The physical health of all Americans must have a stronger commitment than an annual New Year's resolution. We now know that individuals can influence their health, fitness and productive prime of life through the active pursuit of regular exercise programs,\" Bush wrote in a statement.",
      "\"I have asked Arnold to chair the Council because I believe he is uniquely qualified to address and influence national health and fitness issues, especially among our youth,\" he continued. \"Arnold has devoted much of his career to the pursuit and advocacy of physical fitness. His abilities have produced a broad range of career successes involving athletic competition, acting and business ventures.",
      "\"I challenge him to raise the consciousness of all Americans on the importance of good health through physical fitness.\"",
      "The two were also friends and workout partners. (\u00a0Jean-Louis Atlan/Sygma via Getty Images)",
      "During an interview last year on the \"Jocko Podcast,\" Schwarzenegger recalled his time serving as the council's chair and how he was instrumental in bringing workout equipment to military members who were deployed overseas.",
      "The actor remembered having a conversation with Bush during which the former president told him about an article that he had read in the New York Times, which noted how soldiers in Iraq were working out with sandbags.",
      "\"I said, \"Do you know why they're working out with sandbags? First of all, because resistance training is good. But the other reason is, you haven't sent them any barbells and dumbbells yet. Do you think they wouldn't rather lift with dumbbells and barbells?'\" Schwarzenegger recalled telling Bush.",
      "Schwarzenegger remembered Bush asking him, \"Can you organize that?\"",

      "\"I said, \u2018You\u2019re talking to the right guy.'\"",
      "Schwarzenegger said that he solicited donations from every manufacturer of weight equipment.",
      "\"I got 40 tons of weight equipment together, and I put them in a crate,\" he recalled.",
      "Upon learning that Schwarzenegger planned to ship the equipment overseas, the then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell, stepped in.",
      "\"He says, 'Arnold, I'm not gonna be that stupid and ship this over with a ship, but you never heard that,'\" Schwarzenegger told Jocko. \"'I'm gonna fly the f---ing thing over there. It's gonna be there in two days.'\"",
      "\"And then all of a sudden, three weeks later, I was getting letters from guys on the front lines saying, 'Thank you, Arnold, for helping us get these weights. We just received weights. We are now working at the barracks with the dumbbells and the barbells and stuff. We just don't have enough, obviously, because there's so many of us that are into weight training. But it is a great, great beginning,'\" Schwarzenegger remembered.",
      "Schwarzenegger was instrumental in bringing weight training equipment to military members. (Greg Mathieson/Mai/Getty Images)",
      "Schwarzenegger went on to recount how he traveled to visit the troops stationed in Iraq during the Second Gulf War in 2003. The actor made the trip to screen his film \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.\"",
      "He said it was important to him that the men and women serving in Iraq \"be the first ones to see it before anyone else, any critic or anyone else sees it. I was very fanatic about that.\"",
      "\"I went to various different places over there to show them the movie,\" Schwarzenegger recalled. \"That's when I saw, all of a sudden \u2014 gyms where they were working out. The craziest thing was when I went back there in 2009 . . . I saw gymnasiums that were much bigger than any gymnasium in the world.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"It was insane,\" he continued. \"That's when I realized that we have now gotten to the point where there is no fire station that doesn't have weights, no police station that doesn't have weights, no military station that doesn't have weights.\"",
      "\"This is what happened in the period between the '70s and the '90s. It was an explosion in every direction,\" he added. \"And that was my way of being useful. I believe in this. I feel passionate about this.\"",
      "\"Because I felt like the bigger I make the sport, the healthier the people are going to get.\"",

      "COMMENTARY: Some might suggest that 2024 was not the best year for the British royal family, but as we take a peek back at what went right and wrong, what can we look forward to in 2025?",
      "As we all know, Princess Catherine had the most devastating year when it was announced that she was suffering from cancer, but good things came out of the bad and, according to a very well-placed source, Catherine has rediscovered herself as an individual and, more importantly, is now looking forward to returning to full-time royal duties with a renewed vigor. However, this is not without its initial problems.",
      "This is simply because she\u2019s rediscovered the joys of motherhood and spending time away from the media spotlight, something she\u2019s had to live with for the last 12 years plus since her marriage to Prince William. He himself, though, has mainly flown solo this year and admitted in an interview that it had been a brutal year.",

      "But a huge turning point in William\u2019s life happened only last month, and that was his meeting with the 47th President-elect, Donald J. Trump. The two were at the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral with William representing His Majesty the King, who has had limited travel due to his own health issues.",
      "Prince William met with President-elect Donald J. Trump in France at the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. (Ludovic Marin)",
      "But what truly emerged was William not only engaging incredibly well with President-elect Trump, but also receiving high praise, which reverberated around the world. According to my sources, both William and Catherine, along with the King and Queen, have all been invited to Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20 in Washington, D.C.",
      "Catherine, meanwhile, has been reactivating all the charitable good works that she started out with in 2023, which came predominantly to a shuddering halt with her cancer diagnosis.",
      "What is really going on behind the scenes is simply this: both William and Catherine are being fast-tracked to take on more royal duties and this is the simple fact of age. As we all know, his Majesty the King and the Queen are now in their 70s.",
      "Unlike the previous Prince of Wales, William does not have the luxury of time, and Catherine also knows that once the inevitable does happen, her life will change beyond all recognition, regardless of her children's ages, and can only hark back to the very young Queen Elizabeth and how she had to dedicate her life to the crown.",
      "Both Prince William and Kate Middleton are being fast-tracked to take on more royal duties as King Charles and Queen Camilla are now in their 70s.\u00a0 (Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)",
      "Expect to see a more developing role from the young Prince George in 2025. We saw a streak of independence at the Christmas walkabout when, for the first time, the 11-year-old broke away from his parents to independently meet the public. Once again, there will have to be a focus on the fact that he, too, will now be being fast-tracked behind the scenes into royal protocol and life.",

      "George is fully aware more than ever, having sat through his grandfather\u2019s coronation in May 2023, of just what the future holds, and according to a source, he knows exactly what the public, the Commonwealth and the world will expect of him. But as you can see, he is already a fine, capable, upstanding young man.",
      "Prince George understands what his future holds as second in line to the throne. (The Duchess of Cambridge/Kensington Palace via AP)",
      "Princess Charlotte is also becoming more and more independent and, according to our source, has been a rock to her mother, Princess Catherine, during the very difficult periods and dark moments of illness. My sources told me that Catherine is very much aware that, had Charlotte not been born into a royal family, she would\u2019ve simply enjoyed a life perhaps inside the dance arena. Ballet is a hobby that\u2019s truly taken time, thought, and dedication in the young Princess\u2019s life.",
      "According to sources, Princess Charlotte was a rock for her mother during tough times. (Photo by Aaron Chown - WPA Pool/Getty Images)",

      "Prince Andrew continues to dominate the news, but for all the wrong reasons. However, unlike certain royal relatives, he has resisted the temptation to try to rectify himself by writing a book. According to a well-placed source, Andrew at some point would like to see a low-key return to royal life, predominantly focusing on charitable works and also mostly out of the media spotlight.",
      "All that remains, of course, is the thorny topic of whether he can continue living at Royal Lodge, something he\u2019s fighting hard to keep.\u00a0According to a source, he sees that as a final bastion of independence and one that was promised to him by his late mother, Queen Elizabeth. Others might suggest, though, that this is something of a pipe dream and that he can never return to the royal fold, no matter what he wishes to do.",

      "As for the ex-Royals, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the biggest problem is simply money!",
      "This is because Prince Harry and Meghan have an extravagant lifestyle with a dedicated 24/7 security team and, of course, a sprawling mansion with their Netflix deal hanging by a thread after the colossal disaster of Prince Harry\u2019s polo show. Everything now hinges on Meghan Markle being able to cook up success in her forthcoming cooking show for the streaming company.",
      "Harry and Meghan continue to live in Montecito, California, with their two children. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)",
      "To brighten up our New Year, Meghan decided to post on her brand-new Instagram account, which has actually secretly been running for two years, but now she\u2019s admitted it. Well, her new cooking show for Netflix has finally arrived. Apparently she wants to wrap her arms around everyone so that we can enjoy food, gardening and friendship. You don\u2019t see any good-time friends like Gayle King, Oprah or, indeed, Ellen DeGeneres, but they are so 2024.",
      "The bottom line is, if this fails and does as well as Prince Harry\u2018s polo show, then, despite writing in the sand 2025 in her other Instagram post, she may wish that the waves wash over yet another obvious debacle.",
      "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle took trips to Nigeria and Colombia in 2024. (Photo by Eric Charbonneau/Archewell Foundation via Getty Images)",
      "The Sussexes had hoped, following their quasi-royal tours to Nigeria and Colombia, that many other countries would have been willing to book them. But with colossal fees attached for flights, security, and all that comes with having ex-members of the British monarchy in tow, it seems, so far, that not many countries have taken up this strange and bewildering offer.",
      "I\u2019m also told that Harry has closed the book on any more revealing tell-alls. Even though the original deal was for four books, it now appears that Harry has run out of steam and, more importantly, Penguin Random House, who paid a hefty signing-on fee, despite all the publicity so far, have not regained their initial outlay.",

But many people realize that without the glare of the spotlight, Meghan finds it incredibly hard to even breathe.",

However, many people feel that the king in fact should slow down, take better care of his health and perhaps take time out, letting Catherine and William undertake some of the more demanding overseas tours.",
      "But Charles is adamant that he is not slowing down and relishing the opportunity of taking control and the direction of his own personal reign. However, 2025 looks as exciting and thrilling as the last year, and we are genuinely all truly grateful for the work, fun, glamour and hard work the British Royal Family brings us.",

      "Potential risks of the practice",
      "The most likely risk of microdosing is a lack of effectiveness, McGowan noted.",

      "\"We know that social isolation and loneliness are linked to poorer health, but we\u2019ve never understood why.\"",
      "Loneliness, by contrast, is a subjective measure based on whether an individual feels lonely.",

      "The findings, said a researcher, \"drive home the importance of social contact in keeping us well.\" (iStock)",
      "The researchers then used a statistical technique to explore the causal relationship between social isolation and loneliness, on the one hand, and proteins on the other.",

      "\"Addiction doesn't separate by gender or age or race or income \u2014 people from all walks of life are impacted.\"",
      "Jaffe ultimately spent time in jail before getting clean and returning to school, earning two master\u2019s degrees and a PhD in psychology.",
      "\"I wanted to understand what happened to me \u2014 and then what I've done over the last 15 years, hopefully, is bring those lessons to others who are struggling,\" he said.",

      "Today, Jaffe focuses on helping people beat addiction and improve their mental health. In his upcoming book \u2014 \"Unhooked: Free Yourself from Addiction Forever\" \u2014 he shares a step-by-step program to help people free themselves from harmful habits.",
      "Jaffe shared with Fox News Digital some of his tips and insights.",
      "Recognizing the behavior",
      "While many people think of addiction as involving drugs or alcohol, Jaffe noted that it can take many forms.",
      "Many people assume that the behavior itself is the problem, the psychologist said \u2014 but there is almost always an underlying reason for those unhealthy or harmful choices. (iStock)",
      "\"If you engage in a behavior of any sort over long periods of time that robs you of your ability to be fully present in your life \u2014 and it bothers you, but you can't find yourself stopping it, even though you've tried over and over \u2014 to me, that qualifies,\" he said.",
      "In addiction to substance abuse, addictive behaviors might include \"doom-scrolling\" on your phone for hours a day, binge-eating, gambling or indulging in other unhealthy activities.",
      "SEVERE HEALTH RISKS OF VAPING AND E-CIGARETTES, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUTH, SAY EXPERTS",
      "People can be addicted to work and success, too, Jaffe noted.",
      "\"When things get hard and get tough, they want to go to work,\" he said. \"They believe success or performance will make them feel better, but it can cause damage just like other addictions.\"",
      "\"Doom-scrolling\" on social media is a potentially addictive behavior, the psychologist noted. (iStock)",
      "Social media is another form of addiction, the expert said.",
      "\"When your phone buzzes or pings, you don't know what's there, so it\u2019s a novelty that's interesting, and it releases dopamine,\" he said. \"You almost literally cannot help yourself.\"",
      "Identifying the \u2018hooks\u2019",
      "Many people assume that the behavior itself is the problem, Jaffe said \u2014 but there is almost always an underlying reason for those unhealthy or harmful choices.",
      "\"The behavior was actually a medicine of sorts for a problematic undercurrent.\"",
      "\"The reason you do it is that at some point earlier in your life, there was pain or struggle or emotional discomfort,\" he said.",
      "\"And you discovered that when you engaged in the behavior, that discomfort went away. So the behavior was actually a medicine of sorts for a problematic undercurrent.\"",
      "More than a third of Americans report making New Year\u2019s resolutions, statistics show, many of which are focused on kicking bad habits. (iStock)",
      "For Jaffe, when he was 14 or 15 years old, his \"hook\" was social anxiety.",
      "\"And when somebody handed me a bottle of vodka at some sleepaway camp, I drank it because I didn't want to look awkward,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "Everyone has different hooks, Jaffe said, but there are similarities and patterns.",
      "\"We start living our lives trying to escape the discomfort of the hooks,\" he said.",
      "Replacing the habit",
      "Once people have identified an unhealthy behavior, one of the biggest mistakes they make is just trying to stop it without a plan, according to Jaffe.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"We try to stop ourselves from doing what we don't like,\" he noted. \"Especially around New Year\u2019s, people might say, \u2018I'm going to stop eating bad foods or I'm going to stop being lazy.\u2019\"",
      "Research has shown, however, that the most important aspect of kicking a bad habit is to replace the negative behavior with a positive one, the psychologist noted.",
      "The most important aspect of kicking a bad habit is to replace the negative behavior with a positive one. (iStock)",
      "\"We have to stop trying to just eliminate bad habits \u2014 it doesn't work,\" Jaffe said. \"We have to replace them with something else.\"",
      "For example, if someone wants to quit smoking, they might keep gum or sunflower seeds in their pocket, he said.",
      "\"You just have to keep going.\"",
      "Or, if someone is too focused on work, that might mean letting go of some tasks and delegating them to other people.",
      "Jaffe also emphasized that the process of kicking a bad habit isn\u2019t always perfect or seamless, and that slipping up from time to time doesn\u2019t equate to failure.",

      "Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who led Republicans to their first House majority in four decades in 1994, said Saturday the House Freedom Caucus should recall how his own caucus led conservatives to power within the party.",
      "Gingrich tweeted that he and other conservatives had developed \"positive action principles\" in 1983 as part of what they called the Conservative Opportunity Society.",
      "\"[Those] led 11 years later to the Contract with America and the first GOP House Majority in 40 years.\"",
      "\"If the Freedom Caucus would study them, they could be dramatically more effective,\" Gingrich said, going on to cite and agree with a sentiment from political reporter Mark Halperin\u2019s \"Wide World of News\" newsletter.",
      "\"[T]he Freedom Caucus is a bunch of rebels with a series of causes but no coherent path to achieving said causes,\" Halperin wrote.",

      "GINGRICH BLASTS HARRIS' \u2018RAMBLING\u2019 SPEECHES",
      "Gingrich biographer Craig Shirley told Fox News Digital on Saturday that the Freedom Caucus should study the work of their comparative predecessor, the Conservative Opportunity Society, as well as the path Gingrich led from a low-profile congressman to speaker.",
      "\"I guess the word brilliant is thrown around so, so cavalierly. So let me just say, it was extremely smart politics to make the case for conservative governance,\" Shirley said of Gingrich\u2019s work in the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "\"Reagan had already blazed that path eight years before Gingrich did.\"",
      "While critics say the GOP has shifted hard to the right on some issues and softened on others, Shirley said it\u2019s essentially the same as it was during Gingrich\u2019s rise.",
      "\"Less government, more freedom, less taxes, strong national defense, pro-life.\"",
      "Former Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., another top member of Gingrich\u2019s conservative group, said in a PBS interview that there have not been too many groups like the Conservative Opportunity Society (or the Freedom Caucus, which hadn\u2019t been formed at the time of the interview) and that there was the same issue with apprehension over angering their party leaders.",
      "Weber said there had been a few small intra-caucus conservative groups prior to the Reagan era, including one in the 1960s led by then-Rep. Donald Rumsfeld, R-Ill. \u2013 who would go on to serve as Pentagon chief two times.",
      "On the last day of the 1982 session, Gingrich approached Weber and asked, \"What are you doing next year and for the next 10 years after that?.\"",
      "\"I thought that was interesting and I said, \u2018I expect to be back here, but nothing special other than that,\u2019\" Weber recalled.",
      "\"What he was saying was that he, as one person, was not being effective\u2026. He identified me in the [GOP] conference as somebody [who] had been supportive of his point of view and maybe had some ability to organize things,\" Weber said.",
      "MIKE JOHNSON RE-ELECTED HOUSE SPEAKER",
      "Shirley said the current Freedom Caucus has the rare opportunity to achieve their goals if they play their cards right, with full Republican control of Washington.",
      "\"They don't have a \u2018contract,\u2019 but they have the next best thing there. They have a core set of issues and an ideology that they can easily follow,\" he said, adding that \"no one should ever doubt\" Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s commitment to \"Reaganite\" principles.",
      "In additional comments to Fox News\u2019 \"Hannity,\" Gingrich said the one-round vote Friday was a \"great victory\" for Johnson, R-La.",
      "\"[He\u2019s] just a decent, hardworking, intelligent human being.\u2026 I could not have been the kind of speaker he is. I don't have the patience. I don't have that ability to just keep moving forward. It's really very extraordinary.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Freedom Caucus member Ralph Norman, R-S.C., told Fox News the group met with Johnson earlier and that he \"just didn't come away with the feeling that the \u2018umph\u2019 or the willingness to fight for Trump's agenda was there.\"",

      "\"The main function of the H-1B visa program and other guest worker initiatives is not to hire \u2018the best and the brightest,\u2019 but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad,\"\u00a0Sanders wrote on X. \"The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.\"",
      "The self-described democratic socialist has a history of opposing the program, which\u00a0allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers for specialty occupations.

These stores have built-in security measures that help detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites or third-party stores, as they are more likely to host malicious software. Even on official stores, check the app\u2019s reviews, ratings and download count to ensure it\u2019s trustworthy.",

A flashlight app, for example, doesn\u2019t need access to your contacts or location. Question any permission that doesn\u2019t align with the app\u2019s functionality. Both iOS and Android allow you to review and manage app permissions in your settings, so take the time to double-check what you\u2019ve already allowed.",

      "4. Keep software updated: Regularly update all VPN-related software, including clients, servers and associated networking hardware, to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.",

Many antivirus apps also come with features like web protection, anti-phishing tools and the ability to scan new apps for threats. While there are free options, premium versions often provide more comprehensive protection.

The 911 S5 botnet showed us just how dangerous free VPNs can be, turning millions of devices into a giant network for fraud and attacks. The truth is free VPNs aren\u2019t really free.

      "Why RFID wallets might not outsmart car thieves?",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Apple AirTags use different technology, so even if it was placed in an RFID-blocking wallet or bag, it could still be detected by a thief with an iPhone or locator. Unlike the radio waves used to scan for credit cards and other data, Apple AirTags use Bluetooth and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology. Neither technology can be shielded by RFID-blocking material because those materials cannot block Bluetooth and UWB signals.",

      "Faraday bags, on the other hand, use electromagnetic shielding and can successfully block Apple AirTag signals, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals, from being detected by thieves. The only issue with putting an Apple AirTag in a Faraday bag to hide in your car is that if the car thief cannot read or locate the signal it emits, you cannot either.",
      "While the\u00a0Apple AirTag may go undetected when in a Faraday bag, you will likely not be able to use FindMy or any other tracking methods to locate it either, because those methods require signals pinged from the AirTag to other iPhones and Apple Devices to track location.",

      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags offer some benefits, there are other technologies and methods to consider for enhancing car security. For example, GPS trackers provide real-time location data without the risk of being detected by a nearby iPhone. Additionally, physical deterrents like\u00a0steering wheel locks and alarm systems can act as effective safeguards. Combining multiple layers of security can better protect your vehicle against theft.\u00a0Check out how to prevent your car from being stolen.",
      "HOW TO OUTSMART CAR THIEVES WITH THESE SMART AIRTAG TACTICS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags can be a useful device to help you keep track of your vehicle, whether it is lost or stolen, it does not replace the reliability of a GPS system installed in your vehicle if you are trying to outsmart car thieves. Because car thieves might be able to locate an Apple AirTag hidden in your vehicle, it may not provide the layer of protection you hope for. Though the technology in RFID wallets will not block signals from an Apple AirTag, which will make them detectable to locators and scanners, Faraday bags will. Unfortunately, you will end up outsmarting yourself in trying to outsmart car thieves if you use a Faraday bag because you will then not be able to track the Apple AirTags either. If you are looking for the optimal way to outsmart car thieves, the Apple AirTags might not be the answer you are looking for.",

This endangers your retirement security in three distinct ways, each more dangerous than the last:",
      "They don\u2019t know anything about you, but they have a way to reach you. Even if a scammer knows only your phone number or email address, it\u2019s enough for them to reach out to you. If they don\u2019t know who you are or anything about you, they have to take the most \"one-size-fits-all\" approach they can manage. Their goal is to get you to respond to them or click a link that leads to a malicious website. Once they learn more about you, they can better tailor their next moves.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "They know what you\u2019re like but not who you are. Scammers can buy ready-made packages of personal information from data brokers. A set like this might include only the phone numbers of people over the age of 60, for example, while another might provide the addresses of elderly people who require live-in care and are experiencing cognitive decline. The potential for abuse is clear. They don\u2019t have to know your name to target a dangerously effective scam at you.",
      "In other words, something aimed right at you and very difficult to ignore. Scammers can also buy shockingly detailed information about you, from your full name to your health care and financial information. These scams are the most dangerous, with the attackers knowing enough about you to breeze past many of your defenses.",

Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click on links: No matter how much pressure or stress a message or phone call puts you under, stick to the golden rule of never following or clicking on links. Always go to the source of the communication via official channels from a secure device to confirm what\u2019s happening. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Don\u2019t give out sensitive information: If a message or email can put you under enough pressure to do something you shouldn\u2019t (like follow a link to a phishing site), imagine what a phone call can do. Any request for personal information should raise red flags. If something seems off, hang up.",

      "4. Verify identities before handing over money or information: Always verify who you are dealing with before providing any personal details (name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, financial information, etc.) or money. If someone asks for this information or claims they need to send you money, follow this rule: \"Hang up, look up and call back.\" This applies to phone calls, texts and emails. Hang up or set the message aside, find the legitimate contact information for the organization in question and reach out through official channels (not social media) to confirm the request.",

      "Incoming Trump \"border czar\" Tom Homan joins \"America Reports\" to analyze the aftermath of the New Orleans New Year's attack and the Las Vegas Cybertruck blast.",
      "In the early hours of Jan. 1, 2025, two horrific attacks shook the nation, raising serious questions about car-sharing platform security and potential terrorism links. In Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel, killing the driver and injuring seven others.",
      "Meanwhile, in New Orleans, a pickup truck, later identified as a Ford F-150, plowed into crowds on Bourbon Street, resulting in at least 15 fatalities and dozens of injuries.",

      "The Las Vegas incident",
      "At approximately 8:40 a.m. PT on Jan. 1, 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck pulled up to the valet area of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. Within 15 to 20 seconds, the vehicle exploded, killing the driver and injuring seven bystanders. Investigators discovered that the Cybertruck was packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters.",
      "The FBI is investigating the incident as a potential act of terrorism. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on social media that the explosion was caused by large fireworks or a bomb in the bed of the Cybertruck and was unrelated to the vehicle itself.",
      "The New Orleans attack",
      "In the early hours of New Year's Day, a pickup truck, later identified as a Ford F-150, rammed through police barricades on Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter. The driver, identified as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, an Army veteran from Texas, mowed down pedestrians over a three-block stretch while firing into the crowd.",
      "The attack resulted in at least 15 deaths and dozens of injuries. Jabbar was killed in a subsequent shootout with police. The FBI is treating this incident as an act of terrorism, noting that an Islamic State flag was found on the vehicle and improvised explosive devices were discovered inside.",
      "The Turo connection to both incidents",
      "Both vehicles used in these incidents were rented through\u00a0Turo, a peer-to-peer car-sharing platform. This connection has raised significant questions about the company's security measures and screening processes.",
      "What is Turo?",
      "Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing platform that connects vehicle owners with people looking to rent cars. Often described as the \"Airbnb for cars,\" Turo allows individuals to list their personal vehicles for rent, providing an alternative to traditional car rental companies.",
      "Founded in 2010 as RelayRides and rebranded to Turo in 2015, the company has grown into an international vehicle-sharing marketplace with more than 14 million users worldwide. Turo is available in more than 16,000 cities across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and France.",

      "How does Turo work?",
      "The Turo process is straightforward:",
      "Listing: Car owners list their vehicles on the Turo platform, including details like make, model, price and availability.Booking: Renters search for available cars in their desired location and dates, then book directly through the Turo website or app.Verification: Both car owners and renters must verify their identities through the platform.Pick-up: Renters meet the car owner to pick up the vehicle or arrange for contactless check-in.Return: At the end of the rental period, the renter returns the car to the owner.",

      "In light of the recent incidents, Turo's security measures have come under intense scrutiny. The company's current screening process includes:",
      "Identity verificationBackground checks (though the specific extent of these checks is not clear)",
      "Identity verification",
      "Background checks (though the specific extent of these checks is not clear)",
      "Turo requires users to upload a valid driver's license to the app to be cleared for use. In some instances, Turo may collect additional identity verification information such as photographs or scanned copies of driver's licenses, passports or other forms of identification.",
      "The company has stated that they were \"devastated\" by the recent events and that their trust and safety team is actively cooperating with law enforcement. Importantly, Turo said in a statement to CyberGuy, \"We do not believe that either renter had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat, and we are not currently aware of any information that indicates the two incidents are related.\"",

      "Regulatory landscape for peer-to-peer car-sharing platforms",
      "The regulatory landscape for peer-to-peer car-sharing platforms like Turo is in a state of flux, with at least 13 states having enacted laws specifically governing this industry, distinct from regulations applied to traditional car rental companies.",
      "Turo has been proactive in advocating for additional regulations in various states to establish clearer operational guidelines. A significant development occurred in 2022 when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed SB 6715 into law, providing a comprehensive regulatory framework for peer-to-peer car-sharing operations in the state. This legislation aims to expand transportation options and create economic opportunities for New Yorkers while addressing safety and insurance concerns.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "These tragic events have highlighted potential vulnerabilities in the peer-to-peer car-sharing model. As investigations into these incidents continue, it's likely that there will be increased scrutiny of Turo's operations and security measures. The car-sharing industry may face calls for stricter regulations and enhanced screening processes. Turo and similar platforms might need to reevaluate and strengthen their security protocols to prevent such incidents in the future.",

      "A versatile crime-fighting machine",
      "The RT-G is not your average police assistant. This self-balancing sphere can reach speeds of up to 22 mph on both land and water, making it a formidable pursuer of suspects. Its amphibious capabilities allow it to navigate through mud, slush and even dive into rivers, emerging unscathed on the other side.",
      "What sets the RT-G apart is its rapid acceleration. It can hit speeds of about 19 mph in 2.5 seconds, giving it a significant advantage in pursuit scenarios. This quick burst of speed, combined with its ability to handle drops from knee-high ledges and potentially roll down staircases, makes it a persistent and resilient force in the field.",

      "THE FUTURE OF SECURITY JUST ROLLED IN, AND HER NAME IS ATHENA",
      "Advanced technology at its core",
      "The Rotunbot RT-G is equipped with an array of advanced sensors and technologies that make it a sophisticated piece of equipment. These include GPS for precise positioning, multiple cameras and ultrasonic sensors for environmental awareness, obstacle avoidance capabilities and threat and target tracking systems. These features enable the RT-G to navigate complex environments while avoiding collisions with people and objects. Additionally, the robot uses gyroscopic self-stabilization to maintain its balance and keep its wide contact patch firmly on the ground, ensuring smooth and quiet operation.",

      "Non-lethal arsenal",
      "For law enforcement purposes, the RT-G comes equipped with a comprehensive range of non-lethal tools designed to manage diverse tactical scenarios. These tools include tear gas dispensers, smoke bomb launchers, high-decibel horns, acoustic crowd dispersal devices and net shooters capable of close-range suspect apprehension.",
      "This sophisticated arsenal allows the robot to handle various situations, from crowd control to individual suspect takedowns, without resorting to lethal force, providing law enforcement with a versatile and humane technological solution.",

In Wenzhou, a city in China's Zhejiang province, these robotic spheres are assisting police patrols in commercial zones. This real-world trial is providing valuable insights into the effectiveness and practicality of the RT-G in actual law enforcement scenarios.",
      "However, despite its impressive capabilities, the RT-G is not without its limitations. Video footage shows that the robot can be somewhat unstable when making turns, and its pursuit capabilities may be easily thwarted by a flight of stairs. These challenges highlight the ongoing need for development and improvement in robotic law enforcement technology.",
      "Rotunbot RT-G (Logon Technology)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Rotunbot RT-G's amphibious nature, high-speed capabilities and non-lethal arsenal make it a versatile tool for police forces. However, like any new technology, it raises questions about privacy, surveillance and the increasing automation of policing. The RT-G may be rolling into the future of law enforcement, but we must carefully consider the implications of deploying such advanced robotic systems in our communities.",

If you call back, you may be connected to a premium rate service number owned by the fraudster. You could also be charged heavily for these calls, with the scammer aiming to keep you on the line to increase the billed amount.",
      "While less common with Wangiri scams, there's always a risk of personal information theft if you engage with unknown callers. Sharing sensitive data like bank account numbers or Social Security numbers could lead to identity theft.",
      "Answering or returning these calls may signal to scammers that your number is active, potentially leading to more scam calls in the future. Although not typically associated with Wangiri scams, some sophisticated phone scams can potentially install malware on your device if you click on certain links, prompts or follow instructions given by the scammer.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "How to protect yourself",
      "While these international calls can be concerning, there are several steps you can take to safeguard yourself and your personal information. Here are six effective strategies to help protect against potential scams and unwanted calls.",
      "1) Don't answer or call back: If you receive a call from an unknown international number, resist the urge to answer or return the call.",
      "2) Block suspicious numbers: Use your phone's built-in features to\u00a0block these numbers and prevent future calls.",
      "3) Report the calls: Inform your phone carrier and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about these suspicious calls.",
      "4) Use call-blocking apps: Consider installing\u00a0call-blocking apps to identify and block spam calls.",
      "5) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive data over the phone, especially with unfamiliar callers.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using services that remove your personal data from the internet, reducing the chances of scammers obtaining your information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

While a VPN (virtual private network) provides crucial privacy and security benefits, it doesn't protect your device from malware, viruses or other cyber threats. Let's get into why you need both and how they complement each other to provide comprehensive digital security.",

      "1) Encrypting your internet connection: This makes it extremely difficult for hackers, ISPs or other third parties to intercept and read your data.",
      "2) Masking your IP address: By hiding your real IP address, a VPN allows you to browse the internet anonymously, making it harder for websites and advertisers to track your online activities.",

      "2) Real-time protection: Modern antivirus programs continuously monitor your system, preventing malware from infecting your device in the first place.",

      "VPNs secure your internet connection: They focus on protecting your data as it travels across the internet, ensuring your online activities remain private. Using a\u00a0VPN service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Antivirus protects your device: It guards against threats that could compromise your device's security, regardless of how they reach your system. Therefore, it's important to have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

They have a lot of vacant positions\u2026 and instead of contracting, for example, with the sheriff\u2019s office and the county, they\u2019re hoping to get the state to do it for free.

      "\"Just like Oakland's police need to do their part in running their department correctly, so does Vallejo. That\u2019s a big component of why we are in this state of decline and I agree with the governor on that responsibility,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"Our city can\u2019t expect anyone else to save our situation but to give us the support to gain control in the rebuilding process.\"",
      "In September, the governor signed emergency legislation to allow retired Solano County sheriff's deputies to return to the force full-time to help meet Vallejo's public safety needs.

      "\"As crime rates across California decrease \u2014 including right across the Bay in San Francisco \u2014 Oakland is seeing the opposite trend,\" Newsom said at the time. \"What\u2019s happening in this beautiful city and surrounding area is alarming and unacceptable.

      "The FBI on Sunday released new details about 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, the man authorities say carried out the deadly New Years Day terrorist attack in New Orleans, including his movements in and out of the country and the preparations he took immediately prior to the attack.",
      "Jabbar, who authorities said acted alone in the attack on Bourbon Street that killed 14 people, had traveled to Cairo, Egypt, from June 22 to July 3, 2023, then returned to the U.S. In a separate trip on July 10, 2023, he traveled to Ontario, Canada, and returned to the U.S. a few days later, the FBI said during a press conference. The FBI also said Jabbar visited Tampa, Florida recently.",
      "Jabbar also made at least two trips to New Orleans in October and November prior to the deadly attack and recorded video of Bourbon Street with Meta smart glasses.",
      "\"Our agents are getting answers to where he went, who he went with and how those trips may or may not tie into his actions here,\" said Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans Field Office.",

      "Shamsud Din-Jabbar is pictured in an undated photograph released by the FBI after he attacked New Orleans' Bourbon Street with a pickup truck and died in a shootout with responding officers.\u00a0 (FBI)",
      "While it remains unclear whether those trips were connected to the attack, FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia said the agency is investigating whether Jabbar had any associates in the U.S. or overseas.",
      "\"All investigative details and evidence that we have now still support that Jabbar acted alone here in New Orleans,\" said Raia. \"We have not seen any indications of an accomplice in the United States, but we are still looking into potential associates in the U.S. and outside of our borders.\"",

      "Jabbar, an Army veteran from Houston, plowed a rented Ford pick-up through a crowd of Bourbon Street revelers in the attack that officials say was inspired by the Islamic State. Dozens of others were injured in the truck attack and Jabbar was killed in a shootout with police.",
      "He was wearing Meta glasses at the time of the vehicle attack, but did not activate the glasses to live stream his actions that day, according to Myrthil.",
      "The FBI recovered a black ISIS flag from the rented truck and found that Jabbar pledged allegiance to ISIS in online videos posted hours before the attack.",

      "Jabbar also set a fire on Mandeville Street before heading to Bourbon Street, which was later speculated to be a distraction before he carried out the attack.",
      "WATCH THE FULL PRESS CONFERENCE:",
      "Jabbar purchased ice chests in Texas on Dec. 31, 2024, that he used to hide IEDs before entering Louisiana and going to a home that he rented, officials said. Hours later, in the early morning of Jan. 1, 2025, Jabbar placed IEDs at two locations. New video released by the FBI shows him placing one of the chests at Bourbon and Saint Peter Street and a second at Bourbon and Toulouse Streets. Officials said he botched the detonation of the devices during his attack.",
      "\"He didn't have access to a detonator, so he used an electric match in its place to try to set off the explosive material,\" said Joshua Jackson, ATF Special Agent in Charge of the New Orleans Field Division. \"It's not novel. What was different is he didn't use the right or the correct, device to set it off. And that is just indicative of his inexperience and lack of understanding of how that material might be set off.\"",

      "Israel\u2019s Defense Minister, Israel Katz, recently outlined his vision for Gaza\u2019s future. In a statement that has sparked intense debate, Katz said. \"After we defeat Hamas\u2019s military and political power in Gaza, Israel will maintain full security control, just as in the West Bank. We will not allow any terrorist regroupment or attacks against Israeli citizens from Gaza.\"",
      "Katz\u2019s comments indicate a future where Israel retains security control but with new governance structures in Gaza. A proposal circulating in the media suggested that Egypt and the Palestinian Authority are discussing the creation of a \"technocratic\" body to oversee Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, humanitarian aid and reconstruction. The body would be composed of 12 to 15 Palestinian figures and would be independent of Hamas\u2019s control, potentially signaling a shift in Gaza\u2019s power dynamics.",
      "Officials in Jerusalem have stressed that Israel will maintain security control without re-establishing former settlements in Gaza. \"We will enter whenever we want and conduct military operations to combat terrorism,\" an Israeli security official told Fox News Digital. There is also a desire to involve Arab countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt in Gaza's reconstruction.",

      "However, senior IDF officials are warning that without a clear strategic plan for the post-conflict period, the achievements of the military campaign could be undone. A senior IDF official explained that without alternatives to Hamas, the cycle of conflict will continue. \"Unless Israel puts in place a plan for the day after, and grows an alternative to Hamas, the terror group will rebuild itself and remain in power. It\u2019s an endless cycle,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "Some Israeli officials believe that the lack of a coherent strategy is tied to the uncertainty surrounding U.S. policy under the upcoming administration. \"The day after is still very far off,\" one official said. \"We were dealing with Lebanon until not long ago, we are dealing with Iran and the Houthis, everything that\u2019s happening in Syria . . . rebuilding Gaza wasn\u2019t a top priority. For sure, the war will not end until hostages are released and Hamas is completely dismantled. And we are all waiting to see how the new Trump administration will want to handle the situation.\"",

      "Several plans for Gaza\u2019s future have been proposed, with differing visions for how Israel should proceed.",
      "Retired Major General Giora Eiland, former head of Israel's National Security Council, has advocated for a more militaristic approach. His \"general plan\" calls for the evacuation of northern Gaza\u2019s population, followed by the encirclement and siege of Gaza\u2019s northern region. By cutting off supplies like water, fuel and food, Eiland believes Hamas will be forced to submit, and the hostages could be freed.",
      "In the long term, Eiland envisions an Israel that controls parts of Gaza but only militarily- with no Israeli citizens entering and no settlements on the ground. Eiland told Fox News Digital, \"If we have control over the northern part of Gaza and Hamas is no longer in power, then we can start the process of rebuilding Gaza with international cooperation.\"",
      "While the approach could weaken Hamas, critics warn it might exacerbate Gaza\u2019s dire humanitarian crisis. One senior security official told Fox News Digital, \"If we carry on like this, we risk an endless cycle of violence. It\u2019s crucial to have a strategic endgame that involves dismantling Hamas but also considering international law.\"",

      "Eiland argues that his strategy aligns with international law and could force Hamas into negotiations. \"When I prepared this plan, I read the manual that is published by the American Department of Defense. Twelve hundred pages of explanation of what American doctrine is in regard to the implementation of international humanitarian law. And according to this manual, all that I propose so far is written explicitly in this manual,\" Eiland added, \"Hamas cares only about two things: humiliation and losing land. If we can make them lose control over land, they will be under real pressure.\"",
      "In contrast, Major General (res.) Amos Yadlin is supportive of a diplomatic solution. \"We proposed a mechanism of Palestinian technocrats who have ties to the Palestinian Authority symbolically, but not practically.

He said they have the necessary influence to stabilize Gaza, after Israel dismantled\u00a0Hamas military infrastructure. \"No one will rebuild Gaza while Hamas remains in control,\" Yadlin told Fox News Digital. \"Hamas can be a political party, based on acceptance of the Quartet conditions from 2017: acknowledging Israel and condemning terror,\" he said.",
      "The IDF said that it finished its operation in the Bani Suheila area of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip, destroying infrastructure used by Hamas.\u00a0 (Israel Defense Forces)",
      "One issue that Yadlin is more pragmatic about, and which is a red line for the current Israeli government, is the role of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in Gaza. Israeli officials have made it clear that the PA will not be involved in the post-Hamas governance of Gaza. \"No scenario includes the Palestinian Authority,\" one official said. \"We see its inability in the West Bank and do not want to bring that capability to Gaza.\"",

      "While the FBI has not confirmed that the New Orleans attacker was directly involved in ISIS, reports have suggested he was apparently sympathetic to the terrorist network and \"pledged allegiance to ISIS\" in a series of videos posted to his Facebook page, according to The New York Times.",
      "The FBI has not yet released a motive for the attack, and Roggio explained that this incident is unlikely to indicate there is a \"resurgence\" of ISIS, though the security expert did highlight that increasingly the terrorist network is finding itself up against less resistance in areas where it was previously opposed.",
      "The 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan and the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria last month to the al Qaeda-derived organization dubbed Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham left security vacuums in the Middle East and South Asia \u2013 similar to what contributed to the rise of ISIS following the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. Security experts have warned ISIS and other terrorist networks could use these power gaps.",

      "ISIS-K \u2013 the regional affiliate of the terrorist group that originated in Iraq and Syria \u2013 garnered international attention in August 2021 when it attacked Afghans fleeing the Taliban takeover amid the U.S. withdrawal and used a suicide bombing to kill 13 American service members and some 170 Afghan civilians.",
      "The Taliban takeover prompted concern that Afghanistan would become a safe haven for terrorists like Taliban allies al Qaeda, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and other jihadi groups, though there was also concern that the new governing body in Afghanistan would be unable to oppose ISIS-K.",
      "ISIS-K has largely been unable to significantly thrive in Afghanistan following the fall of the democratic government and the withdrawal of U.S. forces, but it is also no longer as fervently opposed.",
      "\"The Taliban and the Islamic State are enemies. The Taliban goes after the Islamic State even while we're not there \u2013 that doesn't make them a counter-terrorism partner, but now they don't have the dual threat against them \u2013 the U.S. targeting the Islamic State and the Taliban targeting the Islamic State \u2013 they have greater freedom of movement,\" Roggio said.",

      "The security expert said that when it comes to Afghanistan and the threats posed against the U.S. and its Western allies, the Taliban and al Qaeda remain a greater threat than ISIS, though he emphasized that ISIS does increasingly have \"more space to operate.\"",
      "\"The Assad regime was an enemy of the Islamic State,\" Roggio said. \"One of the Islamic State's enemies has been taken off the board, and therefore it will give ISIS more space to regenerate strength in an area where it already has a significant presence.\"",
      "However, there is a third area where ISIS has strong roots and where it could see a resurgence should the U.S. again pull troops from the area.",
      "The Biden administration in September announced that, in coordination with the Iraqi government, the U.S. will end its military mission in Iraq to combat the Islamic State by 2026. The move was met with immediate concern from security experts who argued that ISIS remains a top threat to the U.S., and it could further endanger American soldiers still fighting the terrorist network in Syria.",
      "Specifics on the troop drawdown remain unclear, and plans to renegotiate a change to the withdrawal plans following the collapse of the Assad regime and the ambiguous state of Syria have not emerged.",
      "It remains further unlikely that the incoming Trump administration will push to keep U.S. soldiers in Iraq despite the threat posed by ISIS given the president-elect\u2019s push to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan during his first term.",

      "\"The U.S. has to decide if it wants to remain in Iraq and Syria in order to counter the Islamic State and other target groups,\" Roggio said. \"And if it decides to stay, it needs to beef up [its] presence in order to deter threats from militia groups that have been attacking U.S. troops.",
      "\"The U.S. effort to keep the Islamic State down is critical. Without the U.S. presence there, groups like the Islamic State, will thrive given the lawlessness,\" the security expert added. \"As bad as the Assad regime was, and it was a horrible regime, it did fight the Islamic State \u2013 so without their presence, you have another terrorist organization that is in nominal control of large areas of Syria.",

With popular social media influencers \"normalizing\" hatred of Israel, national leaders around the world escalating anti-Israel rhetoric and extremists not \"feeling they\u2019re going to be held accountable\" when they target the Jewish community, Rabbi Cooper explained that it is \"a perfect storm.\"",
      "In Europe, incidents of antisemitic hate have risen as much as the 800% seen in Sweden between 2022 and 2023. Jews across Europe have reported that they no longer wear items that might identify their religion and have sometimes changed their names to avoid being targeted. In France, there has been a 430% increase in Jews applying to immigrate to Israel from 2022 to 2023.",
      "Though Ireland has a small Jewish population, it has seen an uptick in antisemitic hatred and Jewish self-censorship. In December, Israel announced that it would close its embassy in the country, citing Irish leaders\u2019 \"deligitimization and demonization of the Jewish state.\"",
      "The United Kingdom has also seen a large increase in antisemitic hate, with the Community Security Trust reporting a record 1,978 antisemitic incidents in the first half of 2024. This included a 246% increase in \"damage and desecration to Jewish property\" between the first six months of 2023 and the first six months of 2024. The Israeli minister for Diaspora affairs and combating antisemitism said in March that due to its pro-Hamas atmosphere, London had become the world\u2019s \"most antisemitic city.\"",
      "In late November, a bus carrying Jewish school children was attacked with rocks after protesters harassed those aboard. Days earlier, a man threw bottles at a group of Jewish teens, hitting and hospitalizing one of his targets.",
      "Headlines about hate for the Jewish community overseas have been gruesome. In June, a 12-year-old Jewish girl in France was raped by two teens on account of her religion. In November, the body of Chabad Rabbi Zvi Kogan was found dead in the United Arab Emirates after he disappeared from his Abu Dhabi home.",

      "More than nine synagogues worldwide have been the targets of arson since Oct. 7, according to a social media post from Hen Mazzig, a senior fellow at the Tel Aviv Institute. The latest attack occurred on Dec. 18 in Montreal at a synagogue which was also targeted in November 2023, the New York Post reported. Just two days later, shots were fired overnight at a Jewish elementary school in Toronto. It was the third shooting at the school since May, according to the Times of Israel.",
      "Another recent arson attack took place at a synagogue in Melbourne, Australia, on Dec. 6. The Simon Wiesenthal Center responded to the incident by issuing a travel advisory for Australia, explaining that the country\u2019s leaders had failed to stand up against \"persistent demonization, harassment, and violence against Jews and Jewish institutions.\"",

      "Just a month earlier, the Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a similar advisory for the Netherlands after a soccer match led to a \"Jew Hunt,\" in which Jewish fans were tracked down and assaulted in the city. The incident sparked another attempted \"Jew Hunt\" in Antwerp and attacks on a Berlin youth soccer team.",

      "Cooper said that many appointees from President Trump\u2019s incoming administration, including incoming U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Rep. Elise Stefanik, are \"defenders of our community.\" When they begin implementing new policies, he said that he believes that \"a lot of good things can happen very, very quickly.\"",

    "title": "Capitol heavily secured for election certification as Trump's Jan. 6 pardon plans remain largely a mystery",

    "summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Four years after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Four years after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol in support of his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, members of Congress will be under heavy security Monday as they certify Trump's 2024 election victory, ensuring the first president to face federal felony criminal charges will return to the White House in two weeks.",
      "On Jan. 20, Trump will walk through the lower west tunnel \u2014 the location of some of the worst violence of the attack on Jan. 6, 2021 \u2014 to take the oath of office as the 47th president of the United States. Trump, who himself faced four felony charges in connection with Jan. 6 and his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, has vowed to pardon some untold number of Jan. 6 defendants when he takes office. (Special counsel Jack Smith dropped the charges against Trump after his election, with his team writing that while it stood by the case and while the evidence against Trump was strong, the dismissal was necessary in light of the Justice Department\u2019s long-standing position that the Constitution forbids prosecuting a sitting president.)",
      "But details of Trump's plans are uncertain even as the final days of President Joe Biden's term tick away and even as Jan. 6 defendants involved in the Jan. 6 investigation agree it is clear Trump is not up to speed on the details of the cases.",
      "\u201cEven people familiar with the day-to-day J6 prosecution, it\u2019s difficult to keep up with what is happening,\u201d a Trump ally previously told NBC News, adding that Trump needed to develop a \"very succinct and compelling argument for these pardons.\"",
      "More than 1,580 defendants have been charged and about 1,270 have been convicted in a sprawling investigation that has resulted in more than 660 prison sentences, according to statistics released Monday by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia. Prison sentences have ranged from a few days behind bars to 22 years in federal prison, a sentence imposed on former Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio after he was convicted of seditious conspiracy. Hundreds more Jan. 6 defendants have been sentenced to probation, most of whom were convicted of low-level offenses like unlawful parading.",
      "Back in September, before Trump won the election, the federal government declared the Electoral College certification a National Special Security Event, heightening the level of security at the Capitol. While Trump's win virtually eliminated the threat that a mob would storm the Capitol on Monday, the government went ahead with the original plan and put severe security measures in place that will remain as law enforcement agencies deal with major coming events, including events honoring the late President Jimmy Carter as he lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda, as well as Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20.",
      "On Saturday morning, about 36 hours before a snowstorm was expected to hit Washington, workers at the Capitol were placing additional layers of high fencing around the Capitol grounds, including on the west front, which Trump supporters took over during the Capitol attack four years ago.",
      "Biden implored lawmakers Sunday to speak truthfully about the Capitol attack, in which more than 140 police officers were injured and after which some law enforcement officers died, at an event with newly elected Democratic lawmakers.",
      "\u201cNow, it\u2019s your duty to tell the truth, to remember what happened and not let Jan. 6th be rewritten,\" Biden said. \"It\u2019s one of the toughest days in American history.\"",
      "Trump, like many of his fellow Republicans, underwent a massive shift in his rhetoric since the Jan. 6 attack, from calling the Capitol breach a \"heinous attack\" in 2021 to describing it as a \"day of love\" last year. The effort to rewrite the history of Jan. 6 has been aided by numerous conspiracy theories that have been propagated by Trump allies on Capitol Hill, leading a federal judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan to warn about the \"preposterous\" rhetoric used by many prominent Republican politicians and express shock that such \"meritless justifications of criminal activity\" had gone mainstream.",
      "\"The bedrock assumption of our judicial system is that truth and justice, law and order, are values of\u00a0paramount importance and are worth protecting even at great expense,\" U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said at a separate sentencing hearing last month. \u201cThis proceeding and others like it show that our system of justice is always working, no matter the political winds of the day. That is a message worth sending.\"",
      "Inside the Capitol last week, there were no signs of a plaque that was supposed to have been installed on the west side of the Capitol to honor the law enforcement officers who protected lawmakers and the building during the Jan. 6 assault.",
      "Trump, who chose a Jan. 6 conspiracy theorist, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., to be his attorney general until Gaetz withdrew amid sexual misconduct allegations involving an underage girl, has used outdated talking points in discussing Jan. 6 cases and said members of the House Jan. 6 committee \"should go to jail.\" (Gaetz has denied the allegations.) Trump said that Jan. 6 defendants were subject to \"a very nasty system\" and that he would be \"acting very quickly\" on Jan. 6 pardons.",
      "Trump has said there \"may be some exceptions\" to his Jan. 6 pardons \"if somebody was radical, crazy,\" but he did not rule out pardoning people who had admitted assaulting police officers. The Trump transition team has said pardons will be issued \"case by case,\" but Trump has said the \"vast majority\" of Jan. 6 defendants should not be in jail. The U.S. attorney's office said that just eight pretrial defendants remain in the jail in Washington, while all the other incarcerated Jan. 6 defendants are serving the sentences imposed after their convictions, which came after they confessed to their crimes in court and pleaded guilty or when juries or judges found evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that they had committed the crimes they were charged with.",
      "While more misdemeanor cases against low-level Jan. 6 defendants seem unlikely in a Trump administration, it is not yet clear how pending cases against people accused of assaulting law enforcement officers will be handled. Online \u201csedition hunters\u201d who have already aided the FBI in hundreds of Jan. 6 cases say more than 200 people suspected of committing assaults on law enforcement officers or members of the media have been identified but have not yet been arrested. Among them are more than 60 people whose images are featured on the FBI website that lists them as wanted for assault."

      "\"The Consular Section of the Foreign Ministry and the Israeli Embassy in Brazil contacted the Israeli and his family, and accompanied him throughout the event until his swift and safe departure from Brazil,\" it said.",
      "The foreign ministry further warned Israelis against posting on social media about their military service, saying \"anti-Israeli elements may exploit these posts to initiate futile legal proceedings against them.\"",
      "The case, which was brought by the Hind Rajab Foundation, or HRF, a Belgium-based organization seeking to document the actions of Israeli soldiers in Gaza and pursue justice for potential war crimes, accused the Israeli soldier of \u201cparticipating in massive demolitions of civilian homes in Gaza during a systematic campaign of destruction.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not a case of distant command,\u201d\u00a0Maira Pinheiro, HRF\u2019s lead lawyer, said in a statement shared on the organization\u2019s website. \u201cThis individual actively contributed to the destruction of homes and livelihoods, and his own statements and behavior clearly align with the genocidal objectives in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Citing Article 88 of the Brazilian Code of Criminal Procedure, which covers proceedings for crimes allegedly committed outside of Brazil, Judge Raquel Soares\u00a0Charelli\u00a0directed federal police to launch an investigation into soldier on Dec. 30, according to Brazilian news outlet Metr\u00f3poles.",
      "HRF also said Israeli officials had assisted the soldier in fleeing Brazil.",

      "Federal police in Brazil also did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "The International Criminal Court in November issued arrest warrants for both Netanyahu and former Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant.",
      "The new case in Brazil has sparked outrage and alarm in Israel, which has vehemently denied allegations of war crimes and accused international courts of antisemitism for pursuing them.",
      "Foreign Afffairs and Defense Committee Chairman Yuli Edelstein announced that an urgent discussion would take place Monday in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, on how to protect IDF soldiers abroad from war crimes allegations, according to Israeli media.",
      "Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid blamed Israel's leadership for the possible prosecution of Israeli soldiers abroad.",
      "\"The fact that an Israeli reservist was forced to flee Brazil in the dead of night to avoid arrest for fighting in Gaza is a huge political failure by an irresponsible government that simply doesn\u2019t know how to work,\" Lapid wrote in a post on X on Sunday.",
      "Meanwhile, some human rights advocates applauded the case.",
      "United Nations Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese said that legal action in Brazil and elsewhere was \u201cnecessary and overdue.\u201d",
      "Israel \u201cwill go to great lengths to shield its soldiers since a conviction abroad for crimes against Palestinians is a precedent it cannot afford. Yet, justice is unstoppable,\u201d she wrote in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Sunday."

    "story": [
      "The White House announced Monday that President Joe Biden would ban new offshore oil and gas drilling along most of the U.S. coastline.",
      "The order will protect some 625 million acres of ocean along America\u2019s Atlantic and Pacific coasts, the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska\u2019s Bering Sea from \"environmental and economic risks and harms,\"\u00a0the White House said in a statement announcing the move.",
      "It is also an attempt to protect Biden\u2019s climate legacy from the energy policy set to be pursued by Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s energy policy.",
      "Biden will use an obscure provision of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), which gives the president the power to indefinitely withdraw unleased lands from the outer continental shelf.",
      "While former President Barack Obama used the act in 2016 to protect 119 million acres of land, Monday\u2019s move is much larger and will be viewed as a significant victory for environmental groups that have long argued further drilling is contradictory to the U.S. government\u2019s stated goal of slashing emissions that lead to climate change.",
      "Last year was the hottest in recorded history.",
      "\u201cDrilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation\u2019s energy needs. It is not worth the risks,\u201d Biden said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAs the climate crisis continues to threaten communities across the country and we are transitioning to a clean energy economy, now is the time to protect these coasts for our children and grandchildren,\u201d he added.",
      "Biden's decision takes the total area of ocean he has protected to 670 million acres \u2014 higher than any other president \u2014 and could frustrate Trump's plans to gain an economic boost from doubling down on the increased oil and gas production he oversaw in his first administration.",
      "During his first administration, Trump used an executive order in an attempt to overturn Obama\u2019s decision to invoke OCSLA during the final month of his presidency, but that decision was struck down in the courts. That means it may take an act of Congress to reverse Monday\u2019s announcement by the Biden administration.",
      "The week after he won the 2024 presidential election, Trump named Liberty Energy CEO Chris Wright as his pick to lead the Department of Energy.",
      "Wright has previously written on the need for more fossil fuel production to lift people out of poverty, and in a video posted to his LinkedIn profile in 2023, said that \u201cthere is no climate crisis, and we\u2019re not in the midst of an energy transition, either.\u201d",
      "While many of the protected areas have not tended to draw much interest from the energy industry, the Biden administration also said the ban would cover the entire eastern U.S. Atlantic coast and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Both areas have been of interest to oil companies, although Trump himself moved to prevent drilling in those areas during his first administration.",
      "In 2020, Trump issued a moratorium on drilling in areas where oil and gas exploration received wide opposition from Republicans in Florida and voters in North Carolina.",
      "In many of the areas protected by Monday\u2019s announcement, Biden said, \u201cdevelopment that would do little, if anything, to meet the nation\u2019s energy needs.\u201d",
      "In response to the news, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland said in a statement that \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s actions today are part of our work across this Administration to make bold and enduring changes that recognize the impact of oil and gas drilling on our nation\u2019s coastlines.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, the President is taking action that reflects what states, Tribes and local communities have shared with us \u2014 a strong and overwhelming need to support resilient oceans and coastlines by protecting them from unnecessary oil and gas development,\u201d she added.",
      "Citing the lessons learned from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill \u2014 when 134 million gallons of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 Biden said that \u201cwe do not need to choose between protecting the environment and growing our economy, or between keeping our ocean healthy, our coastlines resilient, and the food they produce secure and keeping energy prices low.

      "The field also includes Ken Martin, a DNC vice chair who leads the Minnesota state party; James Skoufis, a New York state senator; and several others without experience in elected office or leading a state party, like Marianne Williamson, the author and two-time long-shot presidential candidate.",
      "DNC members will elect the new chair Feb. 1 in Baltimore. Multiple candidate forums are set to begin this week, with candidates required to submit signatures from at least 40 DNC members by later this month to qualify to compete."

      "President-elect Donald Trump has invited multiple groups of House Republicans to join him at Mar-a-Lago next weekend, three sources involved in the planning told NBC News.",
      "Trump\u2019s team worked with Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s leadership team to finalize which members would be invited, the sources said.",
      "Between Jan. 10 and Jan. 12, members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, lawmakers from states affected by the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, chairs of key committees and other groups of Republicans will visit Trump at his Florida residence, just days ahead of his inauguration to a second term.",
      "The Mar-a-Lago trips come after a tense speaker vote on Friday in which Trump had to personally convince at least two holdouts to support Johnson\u2019s re-election. It also comes as Republicans prepare to take up one massive reconciliation package later this spring that will likely include an extension of Trump\u2019s 2017 tax law.",
      "Trump wants to make sure that Republican lawmakers across the ideological spectrum are unified and on the same page with his ambitious legislative agenda, two of the sources added.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump transition team did not immediately respond to requests for comment about next weekend\u2019s visits.",
      "Divisions between different factions of the party were on display after Friday\u2019s speaker vote when members of the Freedom Caucus released a letter saying that they voted for Johnson \u201cbecause of our steadfast support of President Trump.\u201d",
      "They added, \u201cWe did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the Speaker\u2019s track record over the past 15 months.\u201d",
      "Along with Trump\u2019s victory in November, Republican lawmakers retained control of the House and flipped control of the Senate, meaning the GOP is likely to have an easier time advancing its agenda once Trump is inaugurated.",
      "But in the House, Republicans have a fragile majority and can barely afford to lose a single vote when advancing Trump\u2019s preferred legislation. It\u2019ll force GOP House members to be almost unanimously united on their agenda.",
      "Already in the first vote of the year, three GOP lawmakers \u2014 Reps. Keith Self of Texas, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ralph Norman of South Carolina \u2014 initially voted for someone other than Johnson for speaker.",
      "Self and Norman changed their decisions minutes after casting their first votes, ensuring a victory for Johnson."

      "Ukraine\u2019s main achievement in the past five months of fighting has been to capture and hold on to a slice of territory inside Russia\u2019s Kursk region that could provide it with an important bargaining chip in\u00a0possible peace talks.",

Solid-fuel missiles do not need to be fueled immediately ahead of launch, are often easier and safer to operate, and require less logistical support, making them harder to detect and more survivable than liquid-fuel weapons."

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 10:31:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a North Korean missile test carried out during his visit to Seoul was a reminder of the need to deepen U.S. cooperation with South Korea and Japan.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a\u00a0North\u00a0Korean missile test carried out during his visit to Seoul on Monday was a reminder of the need to deepen Washington\u2019s cooperation with South\u00a0Korea\u00a0and Japan to deter an emboldened Pyongyang.",
      "North\u00a0Korea\u00a0fired what appeared to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile at around noon local time (10 p.m. Sunday ET), which flew more than 690 miles east before falling into the sea, according to South\u00a0Korea\u2019s military.",
      "Speaking a few hours later, Blinken told a news conference the launch underscored the importance of collaboration between the U.S., South\u00a0Korea\u00a0and Japan, including on sharing real-time missile data and holding trilateral military exercises.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s launch is just a reminder to all of us of how important our collaborative work is,\u201d he said.",
      "Blinken also warned of Pyongyang\u2019s deepening ties with Moscow. He said Washington believed Russia intended to share space and satellite technology with\u00a0North\u00a0Korea\u00a0in exchange for its support for the Ukraine war, in which more than 1,000\u00a0North\u00a0Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded.",
      "President Joe Biden, who leaves office this month, made headway in deepening trilateral cooperation between the U.S. and South\u00a0Korea\u00a0and Japan, despite historic issues that have often plagued relations between the Asian neighbors.",
      "But political turmoil in South\u00a0Korea, together with the imminent return of the unpredictable rule of Donald Trump in the United States, has raised questions over whether those efforts can be sustained.",
      "South\u00a0Korean lawmakers last month voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol and suspend him from duties after his Dec. 3 declaration of martial law stunned the country. Yoon\u2019s impeachment trial is being heard by\u00a0the Constitutional Court.",
      "If Yoon is permanently removed from office, a presidential election would be called and the liberals \u2014 seen as likely to win that contest \u2014 have been critical of Yoon\u2019s efforts to partner with Tokyo.",
      "Blinken, who also met on Monday with acting President Choi Sang-mok, told the news conference that while Washington had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Yoon\u2019s actions, it had confidence in the country\u2019s institutions and democratic resilience.",
      "Monday\u2019s launch was Pyongyang\u2019s first since Nov. 5, when it fired at least seven short-range ballistic missiles.",
      "It was not immediately clear what type of missile was fired, but\u00a0North\u00a0Korea\u2019s IRBM\u00a0tests\u00a0last year featured a new solid-fuel design and carried what Pyongyang said was a hypersonic glide vehicle, a warhead designed to be able to maneuver and evade missile defenses.",
      "The\u00a0North\u00a0has said it is working to make its missiles of all ranges solid fuel. Solid-fuel missiles do not need to be fueled immediately ahead of launch, are often easier and safer to operate, and require less logistical support, making them harder to detect and more survivable than liquid-fuel weapons."

      "As Ukraine\u2019s most important military backer, the U.S. has given Kyiv nearly $61.4 billion in military assistance. On Monday, the White House pledged another $2.5 billion \u2014 likely the last steps taken by the Biden administration in that direction.",
      "On the other hand, Trump has made clear that he does not wholeheartedly support Kyiv\u2019s war against Vladimir Putin\u2019s invading forces.",
      "In an interview with NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker earlier this month, the president-elect said Ukraine would \u201cprobably\u201d receive less military aid once he takes office, contending that Europe should match the U.S.\u2019s level of support.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in for $350 billion, and Europe is in for $100 billion. Why isn\u2019t Europe in for the same as us?\u201d he said. \u201cThe one thing that should happen is that Europe ... should equalize.\u201d",
      "\u201cWar with Russia is more important for Europe than it is for us. We have a little thing called an ocean in between us,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump has been careful not to reveal much of his plan to end the war, though his choice of U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, presented a peace plan to Trump in April, a plan that involves putting pressure on both sides by cutting off military aid to Ukraine if it doesn\u2019t agree to negotiations, and expanding weapons shipments to Kyiv if Moscow refuses to come to the table.",
      "Trump also criticized Ukraine after it launched missiles into Russian territory last month: \u201cI disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that?\u201d he said in an interview with Time magazine earlier this month.",
      "Meanwhile, in recent weeks Trump\u2019s aides have pushed for a truce contingent on Kyiv delaying its membership to the NATO alliance by 20 years, in exchange for continued arms supply from the West and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire.",
      "But some experts say this will only invite the Kremlin to continue its efforts to undermine the European security order.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern is that Ukraine will be pressured to accept a bad deal with Russia, as Donald Trump will be keen to deliver on his promise to stop the war,\u201d said Kristi Raik, the deputy director of the International Centre for Defence and Security, in an op-ed.",
      "In line with changing circumstances, Zelenskyy\u2019s public statements have also shifted, now emphasizing the need for long-term security over territorial control. Short of being open to painful concessions, the Ukrainian president has signaled a greater willingness to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "This shift comes after previous acknowledgments that it\u2019s unlikely Ukrainian forces will be able to roll back Russian troops from the seized territory, including the Crimean peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine that Moscow has held for a decade.",
      "Putin, meanwhile, has been doing the equivalent of a victory lap.",
      "During his traditional end-of-year press conference on Dec. 19, he boasted that his forces were \u201cadvancing\u201d on the battlefield and that \u201cRussia\u2019s \u201cdefense capabilities are the highest in the world.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said he was \u201cready to engage\u201d in peace talks with Ukraine, noting\u00a0that \u201cpolitics is the art of compromise.\u201d",
      "Putin referred to the 2022 peace talks held between the two countries in Istanbul, where the draft agreement discussed involved the Kremlin taking control over the Crimea and Donbas region, and with Ukraine giving up plans to join NATO and reducing its military.",
      "Those talks failed, with both sides blaming the other for the collapse.",
      "\u201cPutin placed particular emphasis on Russia being a rational actor by being willing to accept a ceasefire on its own terms and accusing the Ukrainian side of sabotaging a previous deal,\u201d said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at a London-based think tank, RUSI.",
      "But with Putin\u2019s usual threats of escalation on show, Russia is negotiating from a position of strength, rather than weakness \u2014 and it expects concessions from Ukraine with the help of the Trump administration.",
      "The Russian concept of negotiations is \u201cvery different from our own,\u201d said Dailey of the RAND Corporation. \u201cRussia just wants what it has wanted since it started this war.\u201d",
      "Putin has repeatedly voiced that deferring Ukraine\u2019s membership to NATO is not enough for Moscow. On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov doubled down on the Russian president\u2019s position, saying that he would not consider the plans reportedly being put forward by Trump\u2019s team.",
      "\u201cWe are not satisfied with the proposals made by representatives of the president-elect\u2019s team to postpone Ukrainian membership in NATO for 20 years, as well as to introduce a peacekeeping contingent of British and European forces into Ukraine,\u201d Lavrov told state-owned TASS news agency.",
      "\u201cSince NATO\u2019s long-standing expansion was one of the main causes of the Ukrainian crisis, ensuring Ukraine\u2019s nonaligned status remains among the goals of the special military operation that must be achieved,\u201d the foreign minister said.",
      "Even if Trump tries to restore ties between the U.S. and Russia once he comes into office, he would have to \u201cswim against the current\u201d given the bipartisan consensus in the U.S. on Russia \u2014 which is \u201cnot so simple,\u201d Lavrov added.",
      "Dailey said it would be \u201cfoolhardy\u201d to think that \u201cyou could enter negotiations with Russia and believe you would get any concessions that you did not force them to concede at the tip of a spear.\u201d",
      "Put simply, Russia currently sees itself as having the advantage both militarily and politically.",
      "\u201cUnder these conditions, I do not anticipate Russia would concede much of anything,\u201d she added.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s unease is underscored by the seemingly cordial terms between the American and Russian leaders.",
      "While Zelenskyy has pushed for NATO membership as a necessary move to safeguard Ukraine from future invasions, Kyiv\u2019s prospects seem largely unattainable in both the U.S. and Europe, where leaders appear divided over which security pledges they can offer Kyiv.",
      "Nevertheless, Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that Ukraine needs unequivocal support from the U.S. alongside European guarantees.",
      "\u201cIt is very important for us to have both on board: the United States and the Europeans,\u201d he said during recent talks held in Brussels."

Solid-fuel missiles do not need to be fueled immediately ahead of launch, are often easier and safer to operate, and require less logistical support, making them harder to detect and more survivable than liquid-fuel weapons."

    "story": [
      "BRISTOL, England \u2014 U.S. rugby star\u00a0Ilona Maher\u00a0made her debut for the Bristol Bears women\u2019s team in front of a record home crowd of 9,240 fans on Sunday.",
      "But Maher, \u201cthe most followed rugby player on the planet,\u201d could not prevent Bristol from losing 40-17 to defending champion Gloucester-Hartpury in a Premiership Women\u2019s Rugby match.",
      "She came on as a substitute in the 61st minute at Ashton Gate with Bristol trailing 28-10. Maher made her presence felt in a couple of rucks and looked for work off the wing but could make little impact to the overall picture in her 20 minutes on the field.",
      "The previous attendance record for a Bristol women\u2019s home match was 4,101 against Harlequins in May 2022. Such was the anticipation surrounding Maher\u2019s debut that Bristol relocated the match from a smaller venue to Ashton Gate to satisfy demand for seats.",
      "The 28-year-old Maher, who helped lead the U.S. to the\u00a0bronze medal in rugby sevens\u00a0at the Paris Games, has signed a three-month contract with Bristol in southwestern England. She had begun training with Bristol in December when the team announced the signing before going back to the United States for the holidays.",
      "Maher has more than 8 million followers combined on Instagram and TikTok. She was a runner-up on the \u201cDancing With The Stars\u201d TV show.",
      "The Vermont native is returning to the 15-a-side game in hopes of boosting her chances of making the U.S. team for the\u00a02025 Rugby World Cup\u00a0in England. She can play at wing or center.",
      "Bristol also said the attendance was a record for a stand-alone game in the Premiership. League-leading Harlequins said they set a women\u2019s club rugby record for attendance on Dec. 28 when 18,055 fans watched the team beat Leicester Tigers 42-17 at Twickenham Stadium. That was not a stand-alone match; it was part of a doubleheader with the Harlequins men\u2019s team."

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 12:51:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The leadership of Austria\u2019s ruling conservatives held a crisis meeting on Sunday to pick a successor to Chancellor Karl Nehammer, who announced his resignation on Saturday as attempts to form a coalition government without the far right fell apart.",
    "story": [
      "The leadership of\u00a0Austria\u2019s ruling conservatives held a crisis meeting on Sunday to pick a successor to Chancellor Karl Nehammer, who announced his resignation on Saturday as attempts to form a coalition government without the far right\u00a0fell apart.",
      "More than two hours after the meeting began, several\u00a0Austrian media reported that People\u2019s Party (OVP) Secretary-General Christian Stocker, 64, would take over as party leader in an interim capacity. There was no immediate comment from the party.",
      "The\u00a0surprise collapse\u00a0of three and then two-party talks aimed at cobbling together a centrist coalition that could serve as a bulwark against the far-right\u00a0Freedom Party\u00a0(FPO) after the FPO came first in September\u2019s\u00a0parliamentary election\u00a0leaves President\u00a0Alexander Van der Bellen\u00a0with few options.",
      "A snap election with support for the euroskeptic, Russia-friendly FPO still growing or an\u00a0about-face\u00a0in which Van der Bellen tasks FPO leader Herbert Kickl with forming a government are now the most likely options, with only limited scope for alternatives or playing for time.",
      "\u201cIt is not an easy situation,\u201d Markus Wallner, the governor of Vorarlberg, the westernmost of\u00a0Austria\u2019s nine provinces, told reporters before the OVP leadership meeting at the chancellor\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cI believe we must do everything we can now to avoid sliding towards a national crisis.\u201d",
      "Wallner said he opposed a snap election since that would delay the arrival of a new government by months. OVP governors are part of the leadership.",
      "Nehammer insisted during and after the election campaign that his party would not govern with Kickl because he was too much of a conspiracy theorist and posed a security risk while at the same time saying much of Kickl\u2019s party was trustworthy.",
      "Nehammer\u2019s departure makes it likely that whoever succeeds him will be more open to a coalition with the FPO, which is formally allied with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s Fidesz party.",
      "The FPO won September\u2019s election with around 29% of the vote, and opinion polls suggest its support has only grown since then, extending its lead over the OVP and Social Democrats to more than 10 percentage points while their support has shrunk.",
      "The OVP and FPO overlap on various issues, particularly taking a tough line on immigration, to the point that the FPO has accused the OVP of stealing its ideas.",
      "The two governed together from late 2017 until 2019, when a video-sting scandal involving the then-leader of the FPO prompted their coalition\u2019s collapse. At the state level, they govern together in five of nine states, including in OVP moderate Wallner\u2019s Vorarlberg.",
      "The national dynamic is now different because if they were to form an alliance the OVP would for the first time be junior partner to the FPO, making the position of OVP leader difficult and undesirable to many.",
      "After initial media reports that household names like former party leader Sebastian Kurz, who led the last coalition with the FPO and has since been\u00a0convicted of perjury, could become OVP leader,\u00a0Austrian media reported overnight that they were no longer in the running.",
      "That left lesser-known figures such as new Chamber of Commerce Secretary-General Wolfgang Hattmannsdorfer, 45.",
      "Meanwhile, the FPO hammered home its message.",
      "\u201cAustria\u00a0needs a Chancellor Kickl now,\u201d it said on X."

Iran has denied involvement in the attack.",
      "Meloni\u00a0became the latest in the handful of foreign leaders who have visited Trump in Florida since the Nov. 5 election. He has met with Argentinian President\u00a0Javier Milei, Prime Minister Viktor\u00a0Orban\u00a0of Hungary, and\u00a0Canadian Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau."

      "Hundreds of South Koreans, bundled up against freezing temperatures and snow, rallied overnight into Sunday near the residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, calling for his ouster and arrest, as authorities prepared to renew their efforts to detain him over his short-lived martial law decree.",
      "Dozens of anti-corruption agency investigators and police attempted to execute a detainment warrant against Yoon on Friday but\u00a0retreated from his residence in Seoul after a tense standoff with the presidential security service\u00a0that lasted more than five hours.",
      "The one-week warrant for his detention is valid through Monday.",
      "There were no immediate indications that anti-corruption authorities were ready to send investigators back to the residence as of Sunday afternoon. Staff from the presidential security service were seen installing barbed wire near the gate and along the hills leading up to Yoon\u2019s residence over the weekend, possibly in preparation for another detention attempt.",
      "Last Tuesday, a Seoul court issued\u00a0a warrant to detain Yoon and a separate warrant to search his residence\u00a0after the embattled president defied authorities by\u00a0refusing to appear for questioning\u00a0and obstructing searches of his office. But enforcing them is complicated as long as Yoon remains in his official residence.",
      "Investigators from the country\u2019s anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after the conservative president, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by a legislature dominated by the liberal opposition,\u00a0declared martial law\u00a0on Dec. 3 and\u00a0dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.",
      "The Assembly overturned the declaration within hours in a unanimous vote\u00a0and impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion, while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events.",
      "If the anti-corruption agency manages to detain Yoon, it will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise, Yoon will be released after 48 hours.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military investigators, says detaining Yoon would be \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d as long as he is protected by the presidential security service.",
      "The agency has urged the country\u2019s acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, to instruct the service to comply with their execution of the detainment warrant, but Choi has yet to publicly comment on the issue.",
      "In a video statement, Park Jong-joon, chief of the presidential security service, hit back against criticism that his organization has become Yoon\u2019s private army, saying it has legal obligations to protect the incumbent president. Park said he instructed his members not to use violence during their standoff with investigators and called for the anti-corruption agency and police to change their approach.",
      "Park and the deputy chief of the presidential security service defied summonses on Saturday from police, who planned to question them over the suspected obstruction of official duty following Friday\u2019s events.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal team said it will file complaints against the anti-corruption agency\u2019s chief prosecutor, Oh Dong-woon, and approximately 150 investigators and police officers involved in Friday\u2019s detention attempt, which they claim was unlawful. The team said it will also file complaints with public prosecutors against the country\u2019s acting defense minister and police chief for ignoring the presidential security service\u2019s request to provide additional forces to block the detention attempt.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers had submitted an objection to the warrants against the president on Thursday, but the Seoul Western District Court dismissed the challenge on Sunday.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, called for the anti-corruption agency to move quickly to detain Yoon, saying it was deeply disappointing to see the agency \u201chesitating and letting time slip away.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of anti-Yoon protesters rallied for hours near the gates of the presidential residence from Saturday evening to Sunday, voicing frustration over the failed detention attempt and demanding stronger efforts to bring Yoon into custody.",
      "Separated by police barricades and buses, pro-Yoon protesters were gathering in nearby streets, denouncing his impeachment and vowing to block any efforts to detain him."

    "story": [
      "It has long been a source of shame as much as curiosity.",
      "Now, some 80 years later, the names of those suspected of collaborating with the Nazis have been made public in the Netherlands as the country goes to new lengths to document the extent of its complicity in the horrors perpetrated by the Third Reich.",
      "In the country where teenage diarist Anne Frank is the most famous victim of the Holocaust, a historical research group funded by the Dutch government has for the first time published a list of nearly half a million people suspected of collaboration during World War II, after a law prohibiting its release expired on New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "The Huygens Institute\u2019s \u201cWar in Court\u201d project, which received an $18.5 million (18 million euros) grant from the three Dutch ministries that govern education, health and justice, has made public a digital archive that includes a list of 425,000 mostly Dutch people who were investigated for collaborating with the Netherlands\u2019 Nazi occupiers.",
      "The archive is \u201can extraordinary resource, and one that is very timely in terms of the Dutch debates about World War II and levels of collaboration,\u201d said Dan Stone, a professor of modern history at Royal Holloway, University of London.",
      "\u201cAt the very least, it shows that huge numbers of people were accused of collaborating with the Nazi occupier,\u201d Stone told NBC News by email. \u201cAnd the fact that relatively few were imprisoned probably tells us as much about postwar Dutch society as it does about the wartime facts.\u201d",
      "Of those in the database, only a fifth ever appeared in court, with most cases concerning more minor offenses such as membership in the Nazi party, Reuters reported. According to the Dutch central statistics bureau, in 1939 \u2014 the year World War II broke out \u2014 the country\u2019s population was 8.7 million. That would make just under 5% of the country suspected collaborators.",
      "Germany invaded the Netherlands in 1940 and occupied the country until the allied liberation in 1945.",
      "During that period, more than 100,000 Dutch Jews \u2014 around three-quarters of those in the country \u2014 were killed in the Holocaust, with approximately 6 million Jews murdered overall alongside the Nazis\u2019 political opponents and members of other groups declared to be inferior, such as Roma and LGBTQ people."
